5|$|Europa, {{along with}} Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was {{discovered}} by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the <b>low</b> <b>magnification</b> of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the IAU), Io and Europa were seen {{for the first time}} as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, its {{apparent}} magnitude at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope.

5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for <b>low</b> <b>magnification</b> objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{equally as}} {{important}} is optic character. Diamond and other cubic (and also amorphous) materials are isotropic, meaning that light entering a stone behaves {{the same way}} regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are anisotropic, which produces birefringence, or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an optic axis (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under <b>low</b> <b>magnification,</b> this birefringence is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws.

Thus, the analysis can determine if the more expensive, more time-consuming examination techniques using the SEM or the TEM are required and where on the specimen the work should be concentrated.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new {{calibration}} model of both static distortion and projection for a scanning-electron microscope (SEM). The proposed calibration model depends continuously on the magnification factor. State-of-the-art methods have proposed models {{to solve the}} static distortion and projection model but for a discrete set of low and high magnifications: at <b>low</b> <b>magnifications,</b> existing models assume static distortion and perspective projection. At high magnifications, existing models assume an orthogonal projection without presence of static distortion. However, a magnification-continuous model which defines continuous switch from <b>low</b> to high <b>magnifications</b> {{has not yet been}} proposed. We propose a magnification-continuous static calibration model of the SEM. The static distortion and intrinsics of the projection matrix are modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs) with respect to magnification. The approach is applied with success to the JEOL-JSM 820 in a secondary electron imaging mode for magnification ranging from 100 × to 10 k×. The final RMS reprojection error is about 0. 9 pixels. This result together with two application-based experiments: the consistent measurements of the bending of a cantilever and a 3 -D reconstruction of a nano-ball emphasize the relevance of the proposed approach...|$|R

A wider FOV may be used to achieve a more vast observable world given the same magnification compared with a smaller FOV without compromise to magnification.

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} {{subcellular localisation}} of proteins in living cells {{is a critical}} step in determining their function. The evaluation of fluorescence images constitutes a common method of localising these proteins. For this, additional knowledge about {{the position of the}} con-sidered cells within an image is required. In an automated system, it is advantageous to recognise these cells in bright-field microscope images taken in parallel with the regarded fluorescence micrographs. Unfortu-nately, currently available cell recognition methods are only of limited use within the context of protein localisation, since they frequently re-quire microscopy techniques that enable images of higher contrast (e. g. phase contrast microscopy or additional dyes) or can only be employed with too <b>low</b> <b>magnifications.</b> Therefore, this article introduces a novel approach to the robust automatic recognition of unstained living cells in bright-field microscope images.
