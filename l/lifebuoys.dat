5|$|No {{trace of}} the monitor was found until the corpse of a sailor in a dinghy and a few <b>lifebuoys</b> washed ashore on the Finnish island of Kremare. Extensive {{searches}} of the sea bottom also failed to locate the ship. In January 1894 a commission appointed to investigate convened and reprimanded Rear Admiral P. S. Burachek, commander of the detachment, for letting Rusalka go to sea in bad weather as well as Lushkov for losing contact with the monitor. The commission concluded that the ship's steering gear failed or that water had entered the ship and caused her to lose power. Either would have caused Rusalka to turn parallel to the waves where her superstructure would have been demolished and extensive flooding would have soon overwhelmed her small reserve of buoyancy. Whatever the cause, Rusalka obviously broached and sank {{with the loss of}} all 177 members of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-four of the 273 {{personnel}} from Evans {{were killed in}} the collision, with the majority of these believed to have been asleep or trapped inside the bow section, which sank within minutes. Melbourne deployed her boats, life rafts, and <b>lifebuoys,</b> before carefully manoeuvring alongside the stern section of Evans, where both ships' crews used mooring lines to lash the ships together. Sailors from Melbourne dived from the flight deck into the water to rescue overboard survivors close to the carrier, while the carrier's boats and helicopters collected those farther out. All of the survivors were located within 12 minutes of the collision and rescued before half an hour had passed, although the search continued for fifteen more hours. After Evans stern was evacuated, it was cast off, while the carrier moved away to avoid damage. The stern did not sink, and was later recovered, stripped of parts, and sunk for target practice.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>Lifebuoy</b> is {{no longer}} {{produced}} in the US and UK, it is still being mass-produced by Unilever in Cyprus for the UK, EU, US and Brazil markets, in Trinidad and Tobago for the Caribbean market, and in India for the Asia market. Unilever in Cyprus and Trinidad and Tobago is manufacturing the Red <b>Lifebuoy</b> Soap with a carbolic fragrance, but as of 1976 it no longer contains phenol. The <b>Lifebuoy</b> soap manufactured in India and Indonesia for other markets including South and South East Asia has been updated to use red and other colours with ‘modern’ aromas. <b>Lifebuoy</b> soap is today imported to the UK by Jupiter Imports, owned by Richard Langham, former recording engineer at Abbey Road Studios.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lifebuoy</b> was {{introduced}} by Lever Brothers in 1895 in England. Originally a carbolic soap containing phenol, different varieties were later introduced without the medicinal carbolic smell, such as the coral-colored <b>Lifebuoy</b> during the late 1950s and <b>Lifebuoy</b> Minty Refresher in 1966. <b>Lifebuoy</b> {{was one of the}} most popular soaps in the United States from approximately 1923 to the mid-50's, when perfumed soaps took over the market. It was the best selling medicated/health soap in North America until roughly 1951. It was well known for its red and yellow packaging, red color and octagonal shape, as well as its carbolic aroma. Sometime in 1951 or 1952, due to declining sales, Lever Bros. experimented with adding perfumes to the soap, and made the changes permanent in 1954. Earlier experiments in 1936, 1938, 1939 and 1940 also added an artificial scent to the soap, but generally lasted only one batch. Sales, however, continued to decline until 2006, when <b>Lifebuoy</b> was officially completely pulled from the American market. <b>Lifebuoy's</b> popularity reached its peak between 1932 and 1948. After World War Two, when more materials were available and rationing was over, other more appealing soaps began to take hold of the market. Its popularity waned steadily through the 1950s. In the mid/late 1960's it saw a popularity surge which would last through 1973. This was, in part, caused by the introduction and success of <b>Lifebuoy</b> White in the American market. After this decline, the <b>Lifebuoy</b> brand was seen less and less in the American market. It was pulled from American shelves starting in 2003 and was completely phased out of the American market by 2006.Sometime in 2008 or 2009, Unilever released <b>Lifebuoy</b> Classic, a modern soap with retro packaging and a medicated scent intended to be similar to that of the 1950s product. It saw novelty success but was never embraced as a staple product in the American home. It is now primarily manufactured as a gift intended to be reminiscent of A Christmas Story and is currently sold in the official A Christmas Story website gift shop.|$|R

When the <b>lifebuoy</b> was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out.

2500|$|His {{career began}} in the East Indies, where he served aboard the frigate [...] with two fellow youths Horatio Nelson and Thomas Troubridge who he would remain in contact with as they each rose through the ranks in the navy. He {{eventually}} {{spent most of his}} youth serving in the West Indies and off the American coasts during the American War of Independence, seeing action in a number of battles with the French. He was a commander {{by the end of the}} war, but peace left him without a ship or promotion prospects. He married during the period of peace, taking the surname Bertie in accordance with his father-in-law's will, and also used his time ashore to carry out experiments that led to the introduction of <b>lifebuoys</b> to the navy. Returning to active service during the wars with revolutionary France, Bertie commanded a number of ships, often in the North Sea or the English Channel. His experience led to him being assigned to the expedition to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker and his old friend Horatio Nelson. Bertie was involved in the fierce fighting during the Battle of Copenhagen, and received Nelson's praise for his actions. This was the start of Bertie's long association with the Baltic, both as a captain, and after his promotion to rear-admiral. His good service led to a knighthood and an appointment to the Swedish Order of the Sword, but seriously weakened his health. He was obliged to resign his command in 1810, and went into retirement, dying in 1825.|$|E

Tommy understood his case, and looked quickly round for one of those ring-shaped <b>lifebuoys</b> which we are accustomed to see in our passenger steamers tied up so securely that they would in most cases of sudden emergency be utterly useless. But the owners of the [...] "Butterfly" [...] were economists. They did not think life-preserving worth the expenditure of a few shillings, so there was no lifebuoy to be found. There was a round cork fender, however, which the boy seized and flung into the sea, just as Job's grasp loosened. He uttered a wild shriek, and tossed up his arms imploringly, as he was carried away. The buoy fell close beside him, and he caught it. But it was scarce sufficient to sustain his weight, and merely prolonged the agonising struggle. Tommy soon lost sight of him in the darkness. Soon after there arose a wild fierce cry, so loud and strong that it seemed to have been uttered at the boy's elbow. Tommy shuddered, for it suggested the idea of a despairing soul.|$|E
