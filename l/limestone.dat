40|$|Vast {{deposits}} of <b>limestones</b> of Late Maastrichtian to Paleocene age {{occur in the}} Ohafia, Ozu-Abam and Arochukwu areas of southeastern Nigeria. The present study sought to gain insight into the evolutionary history and conditions of formation of the <b>limestones,</b> through detail investigations and characterization of the diagenetic processes that affected the rock. The diagenetic processes considered include cementation, neomorphism, micritization, compaction and dissolution. Dolomitization process was not considered because it was conspicuously absent in all the thin sections examined. The cement types observed include blocky or equant mosaic calcite cement, drusy mosaic calcite cement, micritic calcite cement with a meniscus fabric, and acicular aragonite cement. Micritization of bioclasts in the <b>limestones</b> is very low and is characterized by thin micritic envelopes covering the grain surfaces. Neomorphism is a prominent feature of the <b>limestones</b> and {{is responsible for the}} formation of large sized crystals in the <b>limestones.</b> Compaction is discernible by a parallel alignment of fractures in a thin section.

40|$|The Getic and Supra-Getic are palaeogeographic {{units in}} SE Serbia and SW Bulgaria. Based on the {{presence}} (in Eastern) or absence (in Western) of Lower Jurassic marine deposits, the Getic is divided into Eastern and Western. In the Eastern Getic, the Lower Jurassic sedimentation in SE Serbia {{is represented by the}} Vidlič Clastites covered by the Lukanja Coal Beds, Lukanja Quartz Sandstones, Lukanja Brachiopods Beds, Lukanja Marlstones, Lukanja Belemnitic-Gryphaean Beds and Lukanja Cephalopod Limestones; in SW Bulgaria, the sedimentation commenced with the Tuden Formation, followed by the Kostina Formation and the Ozirovo Formation with a few members. The Middle Jurassic in SE Serbia commenced with the Senokos Siltstones and Shales and the Gulenovci Beds, while in SW Bulgaria with black shales (the Etropole Formation), followed by marls and clayey <b>limestones</b> of the Bov Formation. The Middle Jurassic sediments are represented in the Western Getic of SE Serbia by the Kurilovo Clastites and the Kurilovo <b>Limestones</b> (synonym to Gumpina <b>Limestones</b> of KRAÜTNER & KRSTIĆ 2003); in the Supra-Getic of SE Serbia they are formed by the Jerma Clastites and Jerma <b>Limestones</b> (synonym of the Gumpina <b>Limestones).</b> In SW Bulgaria the Middle Jurassic sediments are represented by the sandstones of the Gradets Formation and by the bioclastic <b>limestones</b> of the Polaten Formation. During the Callovian (Middle?) started the formation of a carbonate platform with micritic <b>limestones.</b> In SE Serbia, it is Basara <b>Limestones,</b> Vidlič <b>Limestones,</b> Beljanica and Ždrelo <b>Limestones,</b> and in SW Bulgarian, the Belediehan Formation of Callovian-Kimmeridgian p. p. age. Characteristic for the Supra- Getic is the formation of a few grabens with specific sedimentation: the Svetlya Graben (the Zhablyano and Ozirovo Formations) and the Lobosh Formation; the Treklyano Graben (the Dobridol and Sredorek Formations), and out of it - the Methohya and Sredorek Formation.
