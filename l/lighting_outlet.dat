50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power <b>outlets</b> (cigarette <b>lighter</b> <b>outlets)</b> of two vehicles. While this eliminates concerns with incorrect connections and generation of arcs near battery terminals, {{the amount of}} current available through such a connection is small. This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for cranking. The engine cranking motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette <b>lighter</b> <b>outlet.</b> Many vehicles turn off the cigarette <b>lighter</b> <b>outlets</b> when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette <b>lighter</b> <b>outlet</b> to the battery.|$|R

50|$|Along {{with the}} UIC 568-cable and connectors, {{carriages}} used for international traffic {{are required to}} be equipped with electric heating. The power for this, {{as well as for}} <b>lighting,</b> air-conditioning, electric <b>outlets</b> for passengers, etc., is carried by a separate cable.

40|$|AbstractFor drawing {{electrical}} wiring diagram of buildings, mostly two dimensional CAD programs are used. Drawing is done starting from the source (utility pole) to main power panel and then it is distributed towards to subpanels. Then, end points such as sockets, lighting armature, etc are defined. In this study several algorithms are developed in order to evaluate different part of drawing project. Tree structure of drawing is analyzed and all materials to be used are decided based on an algorithm. Apart from these, some of the supplies {{to be used in}} project but not shown in the drawings are also be chosen with certain criteria. These decision systems will result in efficiency of overall cost of the project. In wire drawing {{one of the most important}} point is the line drawing with reference to an object. Apart from <b>light</b> <b>outlet</b> all wires are referenced to walls. Furthermore, all supplies shown in drawings are allocated with reference to walls and with an angle to walls. In wiring diagram drawings, standard CAD programs have no ability for wire drawing with reference to walls. Besides that, suggestion and selection of the most appropriate supplies is not possible. These increase drawing time and result in very high cost calculation errors. These algorithms provide fast and correct implementation. By analyzing drawings in a tree structure on which users have minimal impact, and with automatic selection of supplies all type of calculation mistakes are minimized...|$|R
40|$|DE 102009047361 A 1 UPAB: 20110621 NOVELTY - The device has {{an optical}} channel (110) with imaging lenses (120, 130) that lay on two substrates, respectively. The lenses are {{arranged}} such that a surface {{of one of}} the lenses is a light inlet surface (180) of the channel, and a surface of another lens is a <b>light</b> <b>outlet</b> surface (182) of the channel. A field lens lies between the imaging lenses such that an axis formed perpendicular to a lateral curvature of the channel through a lateral central point of the field lens forms a symmetry axis (170) of the channel. Another surface of each imaging lens is formed as achromatic objectives. USE - Device for optically imaging a part of an object on a region of a digital image sensor e. g. charge coupled device, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor in a digital microscopy and/or macro photography. Can also be used as a polymer photodiode field. ADVANTAGE - The field lens lies between the imaging lenses such that the axis formed perpendicular to the lateral curvature of the optical channel through the lateral central point of the field lens forms the symmetry axis of the channel, thus enabling an imaging of laterally expanded close objects with a better relationship or ratio from image quality to overall height and ensuring that maximally detectable object area is no longer dependent on the overall height of the device...|$|R
