5|$|The <b>littoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Soconusco lies to {{the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and {{consists}} of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|The <b>littoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Soconusco lies to {{the south}} of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas, and {{consists}} of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of the Sierra Madre. The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E

She was later involved in the civil strife in Nicaragua in the late 1920s during which bluejackets and marines from Tulsa helped maintain order ashore. Tulsa was involved in operations in Nicaragua from August 1926 to December 1928. On 1 April 1929, Tulsa was assigned as the flagship of the South China Patrol, which was based in Canton and Hong Kong, and patrolled the Pearl River and South China Sea. In June 1929, she was reassigned to a two-week deployment with the Yangtze Patrol. The following month she was reassigned to Tientsin, to gather intelligence, and reported {{it back to the}} Asiatic Fleet. In May 1941, she was reassigned to the Philippines, and joined the Inshore Patrol, which guarded the <b>littoral</b> <b>zone</b> of Manila Bay.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important techniques for ocean monitoring. Azimuth ambiguities are a real problem in SAR images today, which can cause performance degradation in SAR ocean applications. In particular, <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> can be strongly affected by land-based sources, whereas they are usually regions of interest (ROI). Given the presence of complexity and diversity in <b>littoral</b> <b>zones,</b> azimuth ambiguities removal is a tough problem. As SAR sensors can have a repeat cycle, multi-temporal SAR images provide new insight into this problem. A method for azimuth ambiguities removal in <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> based on multi-temporal SAR images is proposed in this paper. The proposed processing chain includes co-registration, local correlation, binarization, masking, and restoration steps. It is designed to remove azimuth ambiguities caused by fixed land-based sources. The idea underlying the proposed method is that sea surface is dynamic, whereas azimuth ambiguities caused by land-based sources are constant. Thus, the temporal consistence of azimuth ambiguities is higher than sea clutter. It opens up the possibilities to use multi-temporal SAR data to remove azimuth ambiguities. The design of the method and the experimental procedure are based on images from the Sentinel data hub of Europe Space Agency (ESA). Both Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Stripmap (SM) mode images are taken into account to validate the proposed method. This paper also presents two RGB composition methods for better azimuth ambiguities visualization. Experimental results show that the proposed method can remove azimuth ambiguities in <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> effectively...|$|R

40|$|The high species {{richness}} of zooplankton communities in macrophytes <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> could {{result from the}} diversity of potential trophic niches found in such environment. In macrophytes <b>littoral</b> <b>zones,</b> in addition to phytoplankton, neustonic, benthic and epiphytic biofilms can also be potential components of the microcrustacean diet. Here, we investigated the ability of three large cladocerans: Daphnia longispina, Simocephalus vetulus and Eurycercus lamellatus, to develop on periphyton as their only food source or as a complement to a phytoplankton resource in scarce supply. D. longispina exhibited a very low growth and reproduction rates on the periphytic resource and as S. vetulus seems unable to scrape on periphyton. In contrast, E. lamellatus could not grow on phytoplankton, {{and appears to be}} an obligatory periphyton scraper. This latter finding contrasts with previous studies suggesting that E. lamellatus could be able to scrap periphyton as well as filter-feed on suspended matter. These differences in feeding strategy probably reflect the different trophic niches occupied by these three species in macrophytes <b>littoral</b> <b>zones,</b> and may explain at least in part their ability to coexist in the same environment...|$|R
40|$|Omnivory {{is common}} in many food webs. Omnivores in {{different}} habitats can potentially change their feeding behaviour and alter their trophic position and role according to habitat conditions. Here we examine the trophic level and diet of the omnivorous signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) in gradients of trophic status and lake size, {{both of which have}} been previously suggested to affect trophic position of predators separately or combined as productive space. We found the trophic position of omnivorous crayfish to be positively correlated with lake trophic status, but found no evidence for any influence of lake size or productive space on crayfish trophic position. The higher trophic position of crayfish in eutrophic lakes was largely caused by a shift in crayfish diet and not by an increase in trophic links in basal parts of the food web. Hence, our results support the "productivity hypothesis," suggesting that food chains can be longer in more productive systems. Furthermore, stable isotope data indicated that larger crayfish are more predatory than smaller crayfish in lakes with wider <b>littoral</b> <b>zones.</b> Wider <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> promoted the development of intrapopulation differences in trophic position whereas narrow <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> did not. Hence, differences in habitat quality between and within lakes seem to influence the trophic positions of omnivorous crayfish...|$|R
40|$|Algae which {{bloom in}} open water and {{accumulate}} in the <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> {{may affect the}} biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus in eutrophic lakes. To determine such effects, {{a part of the}} lakeshore with little allochthonous nutrient input in Taihu Lake, China was selected for this field study. Distinct differences in sedimentary P forms were found among the different littoral subzones. The surface sedimentary total phosphorus (TP) content was 655 mg/kg in the eulittoral subzone and 631 to 641 mg/kg in the infralittoral subzone. Both were much higher than that in the profundal zone (410 mg/kg). Calcium-bound P (Ca-P) was significantly correlated to exchangeable P (Ex-P), and they both had the highest contents in the infralittoral subzone and the lowest in the profundal zone. The aluminum- and iron-bound P (Al-P, Fe-P) contents decreased from land to water along the ecotone section. Lower Fe/P ratios and higher Al-P/Fe-P ratios appeared in the infralittoral subzone, as compared with the profundal zone. This suggested that the accumulated algae could lead to a great deposit of P in the <b>littoral</b> <b>zones.</b> However, the active sedimentary P form transformation in the <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> would also result in a partial release of the accumulated P to the overlying water...|$|R
25|$|A {{catamaran}} configuration fills a {{niche for}} powered vessels, where speed and sea-kindliness is favored over bulk capacity. In larger vessels, this niche favors car ferries and military vessels for patrol or {{operation in the}} <b>littoral</b> <b>zone.</b> Two advances over the traditional catamaran are the small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH) and the wave-piercing configurationâ€”the latter having become a widely favored design.|$|E
25|$|Bumastus {{could also}} curl up (known as enrollment) into a ball-like shape. This is {{believed}} to indicate that its habitat {{might have been the}} shallow waters of the <b>Littoral</b> <b>zone.</b> When waves wash them out from the sediments it could simply roll up and be carried along. Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the least resistance to wave action.|$|E
25|$|True {{littoral}} caves {{should not}} be confused with inland caves that have been intersected and revealed when a sea cliff line is eroded back, or with dissolutional voids formed in the <b>littoral</b> <b>zone</b> on tropical islands.

Such caves have been termed as hybrid caves.|$|E
40|$|<b>Littoral</b> <b>zones</b> are geographies of {{constant}} movement between land and sea. The armchair traveller {{sits in the}} domestic space day-dreaming about places elsewhere. Both <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> and the armchair traveller share an amorphous position of moving between the loci of here and there. They operate as unformed, fluctuating spaces that reflect what academic Elisabeth Grosz terms as the space of in-between. While Grosz discusses the space of in-between in relation to architecture, her idiom is used in this paper to examine other forms as well (forms being any manner of identities). As such, this research paper argues that engaging with <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> Â– either physically, or as a daydreaming armchair traveller Â– not only signifies the in-between Â– but also encourages external perspectives upon forms. Subsequently, things that had seemed fixed or resolved, such as roles in the domestic environment, can be modified from a space external to them. The difference between popular and unpopular littoral geographies is discussed, reasoning that atypical <b>littoral</b> <b>zones</b> are more adaptable to notions of unformed spaces. Several littoral narratives are also examined; 19 th century French scenic wallpaper, the island-journey and the littoral-dominated films of John Sayles. Specific works of artist Simon Starling are used to illustrate a process of modifying and redirecting forms. The backyard will also be discussed as both a site of in-between and as a backdrop for photographic constructions. It is {{the aim of this}} writer to use the abovementioned histories as a framework from which to consider the research and artworks supporting The MFA research. Ultimately, the aim {{of this paper is to}} argue that time spent imagining and engaging with atypical littoral geographies, is not to only gain an unfamiliar perspective, but to also to push upon and redirect things that had otherwise seemed resolved...|$|R
