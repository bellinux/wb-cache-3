Some analysts have stated that one of the chief causes of the Maoist insurgency, or the Nepalese Civil War (1996-2006), was the denial of language rights and marginalization of ethnic groups.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, popular {{archaeology}} {{programs such}} as Time Team and Meet the Ancestors {{have resulted in a}} huge upsurge in public interest. Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the Community archaeology framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects. Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately. Often this requires observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines. Certain charities and <b>local</b> <b>government</b> <b>bodies</b> sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours.|$|E
25|$|The airport's 2024 {{master plan}} calls for the {{completion}} of a rail link that will connect with the Midland Line between Bayswater Station and Ashfield Station at the Tonkin Highway. The rail link was initially theorised to continue above ground along Tonkin Highway to the Great Eastern Highway where it was believed to go underground along Brearley Avenue and to the terminals in operation at completion of the line. The link to the airport was originally proposed in the 1990s by nearby <b>local</b> <b>government</b> <b>bodies,</b> however the proposal was not followed through at the time. In 2014, the rail link plan received its final approval from the state government, and is expected to be complete by 2020, construction started in 2016, the rail link however will be entirely underground, contradicting the original plan of it being partly underground and party above ground. On 17 January 2017, Brearley Avenue was closed to accommodate the construction of Belmont railway station. On 28 May 2017, Airport Central station officially started construction.|$|E
25|$|Sadat {{took several}} {{measures}} to decentralize {{power to the}} provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls {{of the central government}} over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. But local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of <b>local</b> <b>government</b> <b>bodies</b> had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the infitah alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers.|$|E

The Act on National Flag and Anthem does not detail how one should show respect during performances of [...] "Kimigayo". In a statement made by Prime Minister Obuchi, the legislation will not impose new regulations on the Japanese people when it comes to respecting the flag or anthem. However, <b>local</b> <b>government</b> <b>bodies</b> and private organizations sometimes suggest or demand certain protocols be followed. For example, an October 2003 directive by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government required teachers to stand during the national anthem at graduation ceremonies. While standing, the teachers are required to sing [...] "Kimigayo" [...] while facing the Hinomaru. United States military personnel are required by regulations to render honors with a hand salute, or when in civilian dress, to place their right hand over their heart when [...] "Kimigayo", The Star-Spangled Banner, or any other national anthem is performed. The Act on National Flag and Anthem also does not dictate when or where [...] "Kimigayo" [...] should be played. The anthem, however, is commonly played at sporting events inside of Japan, or at international sporting events where Japan has a competing team. At sumō tournaments, [...] "Kimigayo" [...] is played before the awards ceremony.|$|E
