50|$|Different {{manufacturers}} have produced machines {{with one of}} three types of presser foot shank in mind. These are the <b>low</b> <b>shank,</b> high shank, and the slant shank presser foot. A <b>low</b> <b>shank</b> presser foot has a 0.5 in distance {{from the bottom of}} the foot to the center of the thumbscrew; a high shank foot has a 1 in distance; a slant shank foot is distinctly slanted. The kind of foot a given machine requires is not interchangeable: a low-shank machine will only accept a <b>low</b> <b>shank</b> presser foot, and a high shank machine only a high-shank presser foot, though within these categories any <b>low</b> <b>shank</b> or high shank foot will fit any corresponding <b>low</b> <b>shank</b> or high shank machine; exceptionally, a slant shank foot can only be used with a Singer slant needle machine and no other (likewise, such a machine can accept no other kind of foot).|$|E

A long-skirted coat, a la francaise, covered loosely his thin, bowed back. A small three-cornered hat rested on a lot of powdered hair, tied in a queue.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of genotype on growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat chemical composition traits of chickens under hot climatic conditions. Two exotic meat strains (Hybro and Hubbard) and three Sudanese native chicken ecotypes (Bare- neck, Large Baladi and Betwil) were used for this purpose. Data were analyzed using General linear model (GLM) of SAS (2007). Results revealed that genotype had significant (P< 0. 01) effect on traits studied, with the exotic strains exhibited higher average values for live body weight, eviscerated carcass, dressing percentage and carcass cuts percentages. On the other hand the native chicken ecotypes showed higher relative values for back, wings, visceral organs and feather. Chemical composition results were variable, with the highest levels of Protein and ether extract recorded for the exotic meat strain, Hybro and the lowest were recorded for the native chicken, Bare-neck. Moreover, significant differences (P< 0. 01) among genotypes were observed for shank weight and shank length, with Hubbard being the highest and Large Beladi and Betwil being the <b>lowest</b> for <b>shank</b> weight and shank length respectively. Among the native chicken ecotypes, Bare-neck had the lowest relative feather weight indicating the effect of Na gene in reducing feather coverage around the body...|$|R
40|$|Joint ankle {{represents}} one of the most complicated anatomic-functional structures of locomotoric apparatus. Upper joint ankle (talocruralis) bind <b>low</b> tip-end of <b>shank</b> (tibia) and fibula with joint bone (talus) and represent joint among the bones of shank and foot bones. Upper joint ankle joint together with lower ankle joint acts like functional, anatomical and clinical entity not only in physiological conditions but as well in injuries. These injuries cause not only damages of bone structure but also of ligaments and soft structures. Fractures of maleolus as the most frequent of low extremities represent 10 - 12 % of all fractures. As the most frequent mechanism of injury of joint ankle the inversion of foot is stated when it is in supination and adduction. This analysis had 151 patient who had joint ankle fracture both sexes, age 18 - 45, and among them there were 102 men (67. 55 %) and 49 women (32. 45 %). The patients whose diagnosis was joint ankle fracture were observed in Orthopedic - Casualty ward of Clinical Centre in Podgorica. The research period was May 2005 -May 2009. The results of our research show that the most frequently fractures of joint ankle happened while running 52 patients (34. 44 %) and the least by fall from the height 22 (14. 57 %). The most frequent fracture type was SE type 48 (31. 79 %) and the least PA type 25 (16. 56 %) ...|$|R
