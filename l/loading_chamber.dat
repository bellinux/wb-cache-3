30|$|Samples were {{prepared}} {{in a manner}} similar to that described in Piwowar et al. [45]. Cells on silicon chips were rinsed and plunge frozen as described above. Prior to freezing, it is important to reduce the thickness of the liquid layer to a minimum in order to ensure the best freezing results. After cryofixation in liquid ethane, the samples were transferred to LN 2 until placement onto the ToF-SIMS cold stage. The cold stage was pre-cooled to − 160 °C at 10 - 7  mbar in the <b>loading</b> <b>chamber,</b> then vented to atmosphere to allow for the placement of the sample. The sample was rapidly transferred from under liquid nitrogen onto the cold stage, where it was held onto the stage by a clip. The cold finger was immediately brought into contact with the cold stage and the <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> was immediately pumped down to 5 × 10 - 7  mbar. The maximum temperature of the cold stage was − 85 °C during the entire process, as measured by a thermocouple mounted to the surface of the stage. After the <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> was evacuated the sample stage was cooled to − 130 °C before warming at a rate of 5 °C/min to − 80 °C [38]. The stage was held at − 80 °C for 30  minutes to sublimate the excess water from the surface of the cells. After the sublimation, the stage was cooled to − 160 °C and transferred into the analysis chamber. All analyses were performed with the stage temperature at − 130 °C. Cells maintained a high K+/Na+ ratio, as shown in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{evaluating}} the dynamic behavior of ballast mixed with tire derived aggregate as an economic and environmental preserving method to obviate the rigidity problems in railway tracks. For this purpose, the ballast was mixed with 0, 11, 22, and 33 volume percentages of tire derived aggregate in a <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> and was examined under different types of dynamic loads such as Sweep sine imposed by a shaker on a rigid square plate. Considering the plate as rigid foundation resting on ballast mixed with tire derived aggregate as subgrade, frequency response functions of both foundation and subgrade were calculated by recorded accelerations and force using the installed accelerometers on loading plate and the wall of <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> and load transducer in shaker tip. The obtained results for pure ballast first proved that Sweep sine shaker test leads to more smooth spectra in comparison to other shaking methods. The obtained values for subgrade stiffness and damping ratio showed considerable decrease and increase with respect to increase in tire derived aggregate percentage in ballast mixture. As an optimum percentage of tire derived aggregate, values around 10 can be proposed for practical uses...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{construction}} of a high-vacuum tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (HV-TERS) system that allows in situ sample preparation and measurement. A detailed description of the prototype instrument is presented with experimental validation of its use and novel ex situ experimental results using the HV-TERS system. The HV-TERS system includes three chambers held under a 10 (- 7) Pa vacuum. The three chambers are an analysis chamber, a sample preparation chamber, and a fast <b>loading</b> <b>chamber.</b> The analysis chamber is the core chamber and contains a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and a Raman detector coupled with a 50 x 0. 5 numerical aperture objective. The sample preparation chamber is used to produce single-crystalline metal and sub-monolayer molecular films by molecular beam epitaxy. The fast <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> allows ex situ preparation of samples for HV-TERS analysis. Atomic resolution can be achieved by the STM on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite. We demonstrate the measurement of localized temperature using the Stokes and anti-Stokes TERS signals from a monolayer of 1, 2 -benzenedithiol on a gold film using a gold tip. Additionally, plasmonic catalysis can be monitored label-free at the nanoscale using our device. Moreover, the HV-TERS experiments show simultaneously activated infrared and Raman vibrational modes, Fermi resonance, and some other non-linear effects that are not observed in atmospheric TERS experiments. The high spatial and spectral resolution and pure environment of high vacuum are beneficial for basic surface studies. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E

40|$|Seepage {{direction}} {{is crucial for}} understanding the critical state and development of piping erosion. A stress-controlled apparatus was designed to investigate the piping behavior of cohesionless soil under upward flow condition. The components of the new apparatus included a <b>loading</b> <b>chamber,</b> a vertical and confining loading system, an upstream water supply device, a soil-water separating system, and a water collecting system. The <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> provides space for a soil specimen setting and loading. The combination of a vertical and a confining loading system was designed to apply complex stresses to a soil specimen. Under the stresses, the specimen was then eroded by the gradually increasing hydraulic head supplied by the water supply system. The eroded particle and spilling water were collected and detected by the soil-water separating system and the water collecting system. A series of experiments were carried out using the new apparatus. Results demonstrated the repeatability experiments and usefulness of the apparatus. The new apparatus allowed us to investigate the piping behavior under different stress states and hydraulic gradients. With this new apparatus and experiments, we found that lower and high critical hydraulic gradients (CHGs) should be included as the criteria of piping development based {{on the relationship between}} the hydraulic gradient and the seepage response. In addition, the stress state on the CHG and the particle erosion rate played important roles in the piping development. The outer pressure on the specimen can retard the development of erosion. In contrast, the hydraulic gradient was found to be positively correlated to the erosion rate. Results also indicated that a specimen would collapse once the amount of eroded small particles exceeds the critical value of 46. 5 % of the soil...|$|E

40|$|The GELFREE 8100 Fractionation System {{is a novel}} protein {{fractionation}} {{system designed}} to maximize protein recovery during molecular weight based fractionation.

During separation, a constant voltage is applied between the anode and cathode reservoirs, and each protein mixture is electrophoretically driven from a <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> into a specially designed gel column gel. Proteins are concentrated into a tight band in a stacking gel, and separated based on their respective electrophoretic mobilities in a resolving gel. As proteins elute from the column, they are trapped and concentrated in liquid phase in the collection chamber, free of the gel. The instrument is then paused at specific time intervals, and fractions are collected using a pipette. This process is repeated until all desired fractions have been collected.

40|$|We have {{designed}} an electrophoresis {{system that can}} purify plasmid DNA from a culture without centrifugation. This system is based on electrofiltration where bacterial cell lysates are loaded in one chamber and the purified plasmid DNA is recovered in an adjacent chamber. These two chambers are separated by a membrane made of regenerated cellulose, which allows plasmid DNA to migrate to the recovery chamber while retaining most contaminants in the <b>loading</b> <b>chamber.</b> Unfortunately, even with the optimization of the parameters involved in the electrofiltration, the only DNA that can pass through the middle membrane still has some contaminants, which prevent sequencing of the plasmid. Our results have shown that a pure plasmid cannot cross a membrane with pores small enough to prevent the migration {{of most of the}} contaminants. Only a plasmid complexed with some contaminants can cross a small pore membrane. In parallel, we have compared six direct sequencing methods that do not require any plasmid purification prior to the sequencing reaction. We compared the reliability, quality of sequences, time required, and cost of these six methods. We found that the best method was that of Zhang et al. (1999). This method is fast, reliable, produces good quality sequences and is inexpensive. The performance of this method is due to the amount of ABI's ready reaction mix used, the pre-sequencing heating step to lyse the cell, the large volume of the PCR sequencing reaction and the addition of BSA...|$|E
40|$|An {{interrupted}} stitch type with favorable tissue characteristics {{will reduce}} local wound complications. We describe a novel high-strength, low-tension repair for the interrupted closure of skin, cartilage, and muscle, the double loop mattress stitch, {{and compare it}} experimentally with other interrupted closure methods. The performance of the double loop mattress technique in porcine cartilage and skeletal muscle is compared with the simple, mattress, and loop mattress interrupted sutures in both a novel porcine <b>loading</b> <b>chamber</b> and mechanical model. Wound apposition is assessed by electron microscopy. The performance of the double loop mattress in vivo was confirmed using a series of 805 pediatric laparotomies/laparoscopies. The double loop mattress suture is 3. 5 times stronger than the loop mattress in muscle and 1. 6 times stronger in cartilage (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Additionally, the double loop mattress reduces tissue tension by 66 % compared with just 53 % for the loop mattress (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001). Wound gapping is equal, and wound eversion appears significantly improved (p[*]≤[*] 0. 001) compared with the loop mattress in vitro. In vivo, the double loop mattress performs {{as well as the}} loop mattress and significantly better than the mattress stitch in assessments of wound eversion and dehiscence. There were no episodes of stitch extrusion in our series of patients. The mechanical advantage of its intrinsic pulley arrangement gives the double loop mattress its favorable properties. Wound dehiscence is reduced because this stitch type is stronger and exerts less tension on the tissue than the mattress stitch. We advocate the use of this novel stitch wherever a high-strength, low-tension repair is required. These properties will enhance wound repair, and its application will be useful to surgeons of all disciplines...|$|E
