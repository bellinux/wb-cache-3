40|$|ABSTRACT- This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} intake, nutrient digestibility and body weight gain of foals on diets of concentrate and legume hay. Treatments were: <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> (Medicago sativa), Campo Grande stylo hay (20 % Stylosanthes macrocephala and 80 % Stylosanthes capitata) and Mineirão stylo hay (Stylosanthes guianensis cv.

Dry matter intake was estimated at 30 g of dry matter (DM) /kg BW and was comprised of 40 % concentrate meal and 60 % hay. Fecal production and nutrient digestibility were calculated by the LIPE ® marker methodology. There {{was no difference between}} <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> and Campo Grande stylo hay intake, but intake of Mineirão stylo hay was lower than that of <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> Body weight gain and nutrient digestibility coefficients were similar for foals fed different diets.

40|$|Estimation of indigestible neutral {{detergent}} fibre (iNDF) {{is necessary}} for accurate and precise predictions of feed energy values and potential microbial protein from digested NDF in the rumen. Due to lengthy laboratory procedures, iNDF has been estimated using the formula ADLÃƒ? 2. 4 (iNDF 2. 4). The relationship between iNDF and acid detergent lignin (ADL) is more variable, across and within forage species. The purpose of our study was then to assess the variability of iNDF and respective implications on ration fine-tuning for dairy cattle. Sixty forages, including grasses, maize silages and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hays,</b> were fermented in vitro from 0 to 240 hours. Residual NDF of the fermented samples were obtained at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 216 and 240 h, with the last value assumed to represent iNDF (iNDF 240). This was used to obtain the potentially digestible NDF fraction (pdNDF). Rates of digestion of pdNDF were obtained assuming a first order decay. Simulations with the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS v 6. 1, 2012) were done to evaluate {{the effects of the}} different estimated iNDF and NDF rate of digestion (kd) on energy and microbial protein estimations, assuming the requirements of a high-yielding lactating cow and a standard TMR with at least 50 % forage. Results were dependent on the amount of forage and respective NDF and ADL. The iNDF 240 values resulted between 1 % and 136 % higher than the iNDF 2. 4 values. The reduced pdNDF pool resulted in both lower cell wall linked protein in the rumen and microbial protein of around 5 to 165 g, and, as a consequence, on a total decreased metabolizable protein for milk. Use of iNDF 240 showed consistently lower metabolizable energy (ME) between 2 and 10 MJ/day, compared to when using iNDF 2. 4. The improved metabolizable protein (MP) and ME values would result in 0. 3 to 3. 2 kg/d less milk when using iNDF 2. 4. This research demonstrates how points later in the fermentation curve, even if not biologically relevant for the cow, result in a more accurate and precise estimation of the rate of NDF digestibility. Indigestible NDF estimated at 240 h would give better predictions of rumen parameters in models like the CNCPS and better fine-tuning in dairy cow diets, especially when using high forage and/or NDF rations.

40|$|The {{influence}} of a diet of either pasture or hay {{on the development of}} lactic acidosis in sheep was investigated using a grain challenge approach. Twenty-four Merino wethers with a mean live weight of 36. 7 (s. e. 3. 6) kg were used; 12 were adapted to grass pasture and 12 to <b>hay</b> (<b>lucerne</b> and oaten <b>hay,</b> 60 : 40) for 4 weeks before being given 1 kg of crushed barley via stomach tube. Six sheep in each group were also given virginiamycin (VM; 50 mg/kg barley) with the grain to test the efficacy of this antibiotic in controlling the bacteria responsible for the development of acidosis. Changes in volatile fatty acid (VFA), pH, lactate and bacterial count in the rumen and faecal pH and dry matter (DM) were measured for a 24 -h period following administration of the barley. Daily intakes of hay were measured for a 10 -day period following grain engorgement. Total ruminal VFA increased (P < 0. 01) over time and tended (P = 0. 08) to be higher in sheep adapted to hay than in those adapted to pasture (67. 5 v. 59. 8 mmol/l). The molar proportions of VFA changed (P< 0. 01) over time in favour of propionate in both groups. Ruminal pH was higher (P< 0. 001) in pasture-adapted sheep, but declined (P< 0. 001) in both groups over time following the introduction of barley. This decline in pH was associated with increases in ruminal concentration of VFA in pasture-adapted sheep and VFA and lactate in hay-adapted sheep. The addition of VM resulted in a higher (P < 0. 001) proportion of propionate and a trend towards higher (P = 0. 24) faecal pH and DM content. Faecal pH and DM content declined (P < 0. 001) over time and was lower for the pasture-adapted sheep. The introduction of either barley alone or barley with VM from both hay and pasture diets increased (P < 0. 05) the viable counts of total bacteria, Streptococcus bovis and lactic acid bacteria. Bacterial isolates were purified and identified by complete sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to determine the predominant bacteria during the overfeeding of grain. Isolates from medium selective for S. bovis were all identified as this species when VM was not given. VM had no effect on counts of viable bacteria, but inhibited the growth of S. bovis...|$|R

40|$|Comaprative {{investigations}} {{have been made}} in a climatic room on the effects of periodic heat load (20 - 40 Â°C), 3 days dehydration, rehydration, and feed type (<b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> or grass hay) in adult Desert sheep and Nubian goats. The response to natural summer environment was also examined in groups of either species receiving grass hay and water ad libitum. Body temperature regulation, body weight changes, water relations, dry matter. Intake and digestion and blood and urine composition were the parameters studied. On exposure to 40 Â°C the increases in rectal tempeature, skin temperature and respiratory rate were more pronounced in goats than in sheep. In the outdoor environment the species response was reversed and coincided with the diurnal fluctuations in ambient temperature and solar radiation. The feed type had no significant effect on temperature regulation although the goats maintained significantly higher panting rates with grass hay. Dehydration resulted in higher rectal and skin temperatures and lower respiratory rates irrespective of species and feed type; this response was reversed during rehydration. On heat exposure there was a sharp rise in body weight during the first 3 days and thereafter decreased progressively with grass hay whereas it was almost maintained with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> During dehydration with both feeds the goats experienced higher body weight losses than sheep. On rehydration the lost body weight was compensated only in animals receiving <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> Drinking was the major avenue of water intake and the beat induced increase was more pronounced in goats than in sheep. The increase in water intake was correlated with hyperthermia and the level of protein intake. Higher urine excretion was induced by heat stress and higher protein intake indicating thermolytic diuresis and excretion of excessive nitrogenous waste products respectively. On dehydration urine excretion decreased progressively in both species but to a higher extent in goats particularly with grass hay. Rehydration did not induce marked diuresis in both species with Lucerne hay; with grass hay there was complete water retention in sheep while the goats did not retain the whole volume ingested during rehydration. The faecal water loss was positively related to dry matter intake. During periodic heat load exposure it decreased in both species with grass hay and increased in sheep only with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> During dehydration the reduction in faecal water loss resulted from a decrease in the amount of moisture per unit of faeces as well as an actual decrease in faeces output due to decrease in dry matter intake. On periodic heat load exposure, with grass hay, evaporative water loss was increased to the same extent in both epecies whereas with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> the increase was more marked in goats. Apparently the feed type had no significant effect on evaporative water loss. In both species the water turnover rates were significantly increased on heat exposure and were higher with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> than with grass hay. The response to heat was more pronounced in goats. With grass hay as staple food the turnover rate values were higher at 20 - 40 Â°C than in the outdoor environment in both species. Periodic heat load depressed the dry matter intake in goats only with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> whereas with grass hay there was a decline in both species. Irrespective of the environment the goats had higher dry matter intake with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> whereas in sheep there was no significant feed effect. In both species dehydration depressed the food intake to a higher extent with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> than with grass hay. Both species had higher dry matter digestibility values with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> In both species the water/dry matter ratio increased with heat exposure and was higher with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> than with grass hay. An exception was that goats had a higher ratio with grass hay at 20 - 40 Â°C because of loss of condition and low heat tolerance. In animals maintained outdoors there was a significant positive correlation between were intake and dry matter intake. The change which occurred in blood volume and composition were modulated mainly by haemodilution resulting from heat exposure or rehydration and haemoconcentration following dehydration, and the goats showed higher responses under most of the experimental situations. However, some of the parameters were separately affected by feed type and heat. The values of haematocrit, total plasma solids, total plasma proteins, plasma albumin, and plasma urea were higher with <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> with grass hay in both species. Irrespective of species and feed type acute heat exposure resulted in an increase in circulating plasma solids and plasma urea concentration. The changes in urine electrolytes were generally affected by body fluids dynamics. On dehydration urine sodium potassium and urea concentrations increased irrespective of species and feed type. However, whereas the daily output of sodium was elevated the outputs of potassium and urea went down. Under all experimental conditions urine urea concentration and total daily excretion were higher in animals fed on <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> The results obtained which were related to mechanisms involved in temperature regulation and water relations were discussed in the light of previous findings in the literature...|$|E

The degree of surface contamination of <b>hay</b> and <b>lucerne</b> is comparatively higher in spring than in summer vegetation owing to a higher radioactive fallout in spring. 3.

The plants with a lower Ca content take a proportionately lower content of Sr- 90 from the soil.

Samples from commercial chicken feed (maize kernels), cattle feed (<b>lucerne,</b> grass and <b>hay)</b> and milk were analysed for the presence of certain mycotoxins and cultured for fungi. Results of fungal profiles showed that most samples were contaminated by moulds belonging to the genera, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium, Mucor, Phoma and Rhizopus. All the chicken feed samples tested contained mycotoxins either below the recommended safe levels for poultry or below the detection limits of the ELISA tests. However, samples of grass contained levels of zearalenone greater than the allowable concentration for dairy and beef cattle (250 ppm), which may be linked to the presence of Fusarium scirpi identified in the fungal profiles. The levels of AFM 1 were below the detection limits of the ELISA tests, which may be attributed to the low levels of aflatoxins found in the feed (grass) samples.

There was also a control without yeast. In vitro gas production was measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 h incubation. There was no forage/yeast interaction. Both yeast products tended to reduce the maximum volume produced quadratically and lag time linearly, while in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) increased linearly. Ruminal ammonia N and lactic acid were not affected, whereas methane and carbon dioxide tended to be reduced with the intermediate dose of yeast. When the mixture included oat hay, the total volume of gas increased, the lag time decreased, and there was higher IVDMD than in the lucerne-based mixtures, which were associated with lower methane production.

40|$|During spring kikuyu-ryegrass pasture {{has a low}} {{dry matter}} (DM) content (10 - 12 %), is highly {{digestible}} and has high levels of soluble carbohydrates. Low rumen pH values have been recorded for cows grazing these pastures even when supplemented {{with low levels of}} concentrate. The rumen environment and extent of rumination may therefore be sub-optimal. Supplementation of the pasture with dry roughage may improve rumination, the rumen environment and therefore also milk production performance. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine if strategic supplementation of <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> will improve milk production, milk composition and the rumen environment of cows grazing high quality kikuyu/ryegrass during spring and receiving low levels of concentrate. Forty eight high producing Jersey cows were blocked and randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: control (no supplemental roughage), supplementation of 1. 0 kg <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> and supplementation of 2. 0 kg <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> after morning milking. Cows received 5 kg of dairy concentrate per day during milking. Cows grazed as one group and pasture was allocated to ensure a post grazing height of 10 - 12 on the rising plate meter (5 - 6 cm). The average post grazing pasture height for the experimental period was 10. 83 ± 1. 68 (n= 73) on the RPM (5. 42 cm). There were no differences (P > 0. 10) between the treatments for 4 % fat corrected milk production, which were 22. 2 kg/d for the control, and 22. 5 kg/d and 22. 9 kg/d for the 1 kg and 2 kg lucerne treatments respectively. Milk fat and protein percentage was not affected (P > 0. 10) by supplementation of <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> The milk lactose content of cows receiving the control and 1 kg <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> treatments were higher (P 0. 10) between treatments in overall mean pH, measured with either the logging systems or with the portable pH meters averaging 6. 18 and 6. 11 for cows receiving the control and the 2 kg lucerne treatment respectively. The mean rumen NH 3 -N did not differ (P > 0. 10) between treatments. The mean concentration of acetic acid and the total VFA concentration was higher (P 0. 10) between treatments in the DM or NDF disappearance of ryegrass after 24 hours. Supplementation of <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> to cows grazing well managed kikuyu-ryegrass pasture during spring did not improve milk production, milk composition, rumen pH or in situ NDF disappearance of ryegrass Results suggest that cows grazing kikuyu/ryegrass pastures supplemented with low levels of concentrate consume sufficient eNDF to maintain a favourable rumen environment and normal milk composition.

Thirty two crossbred wether lambs ([Merino × Border Leicester] × Poll Dorset) were divided into four groups by stratified randomization according to liveweight (26 – 33 kg). After a 7 -day adaptation to a <b>hay</b> diet (<b>lucerne</b> hay:oaten hay; 30 : 70), lambs were allocated to four treatments consisting of (1) basal diet of <b>lucerne</b> hay:oat <b>hay</b> (20 : 80; metabolizable energy (ME) = 7. 0 MJ/kg DM), Basal; (2) basal + canola meal (84 g per day), CM; (3) basal + soymeal (75 g per day), SM; or (4) basal + fishmeal (80 g per day), FM. Daily hay and supplement DMI, and weekly liveweight were recorded during a 53 -day experimental study. Blood samples were taken on day 1 and pre- and post-feeding on days 30 and 53 to measure changes in plasma glucose and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentration. At the end of the experiment, lambs were slaughtered and hot carcass weight (HCW) recorded; cold carcass fatness (total muscle and adipose tissue depth at 12 th rib, 110 mm from midline; GR) was determined at 24 h postmortem. Total DMI was increased (P < 0. 001) in CM, SM and FM treatments, but basal hay DMI intake was only increased (P < 0. 01) in CM and FM treatments compared with Basal treatment. This resulted in significant (P < 0. 01) increases in metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) intakes in all supplemented treatments, with the highest intakes recorded in the FM treatment. Liveweight gain (LWG) was significantly increased in CM and SM (P < 0. 05) and FM (P < 0. 01) treatments but HCW was significantly (P < 0. 01) heavier slaughter only in the FM treatment. Feed conversion efficiency (P < 0. 001) and GR fat at depth (P < 0. 05) was reduced in all supplement treatments compared with Basal.

40|$|Objective: To {{report on}} {{spontaneous}} clinical and subclinical acidosis {{in a large}} dairy herd, to evaluate the diets and feeding strategies involved, and to report on measures of rumen function in the cows affected. Design: A Gippsland dairy herd was sampled {{as part of a}} wider randomised cross-sectional study that examined the prevalence, risk factors for, and effects of, acidosis on rumen function of dairy cattle. Three herds on the farm were involved in the study: the transition herd (cows 3 weeks prior to calving), the very fresh lactating herd (1 <days in milk< 10, herd 1) and the fresh lactating herd (10 <days in milk< 120, herd 2) including a small lame herd fed separately. The transition cows were fed 2 kg dry matter triticale per cow per day and hay with an estimated total dry matter intake of 4. 8 kg per cow per day. The lactating cow diet included 6. 75 kg dry matter triticale per cow per day with total concentrate fed being 8. 1 kg dry matter per cow per day in the milking parlour. Silage, <b>lucerne</b> cubes, <b>hay</b> and pasture (herd 2 only) was also fed to the lactating cows with the estimated total dry matter intake for cows in herds 1 and 2 being 13. 7 kg and 20. 8 kg per cow per day respectively. Three primiparous and five multiparous cows in early lactation (< 100 days in milk) were randomly selected from each of two lactating herds: herds 1 and 2. Rumen fluid was sampled from each cow by both rumenocentesis and stomach tube. The rumenocentesis samples were tested for pH at the time of sampling. Stomach tube samples were frozen and subsequently tested for volatile fatty acid, ammonia, and D- and L-lactate concentration. Results: In the very fresh herd, there was a high prevalence of severe lameness and scouring, coupled with a mean rumen pH 5. 67, low mean total volatile fatty acid concentration 71. 0 mM and high mean concentrations of L- and D-lactate, (7. 71 mM and 7. 31 mM), respectively. Cows in the fresh herd had moderate signs of scouring and lameness. A lame herd comprising approximately 50 cows separated from the fresh herd was also present on the farm. The mean rumen pH of the fresh herd was 5. 74 and mean rumen concentrations of volatile fatty acids, ammonia, L- and D-lactate were within ranges considered normal. Conclusions: The transition diet failed to supply sufficient energy and protein for maintenance of cows of this live weight in late gestation. The diet fed to the very fresh herd was low in effective fibre and contained an excessive content of non-structural carbohydrate in the form of processed, rapidly fermentable grain. The sudden change from the transition diet to the diet fed to the very fresh herd probably also precipitated the outbreak of acidosis. This case report provides unique detail, including information on diets and rumen parameters, of an outbreak of acidosis in a pasture-fed herd...|$|R
40|$|Establishment of the rumen {{microbiome}} can {{be affected}} by both early-life dietary measures and rumen microbial inoculation. This study used a 2 × 3 factorial design to evaluate the effects of inclusion of dietary fat type {{and the effects of}} rumen inoculum from different sources on ruminal bacterial communities present in early stages of the lambs’ life. Two different diets were fed ad libitum to 36 pregnant ewes (and their lambs) from 1 month pre-lambing until weaning. Diets consisted of chaffed <b>lucerne</b> and cereal <b>hay</b> and 4 % molasses, with either 4 % distilled coconut oil (CO) provided as a source of rumen-active fat or 4 % Megalac® provided as a source of rumen-protected fat (PF). One of three inoculums was introduced orally to all lambs, being either (1) rumen fluid from donor ewes fed the PF diet; (2) rumen fluid from donor ewes fed CO; or (3) a control treatment of MilliQ-water. After weaning at 3 months of age, each of the six lamb treatment groups were grazed in spatially separated paddocks. Rumen bacterial populations of ewes and lambs were characterised using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing of the V 3 /V 4 regions of the 16 S rRNA gene. Species richness and biodiversity of the bacterial communities were found to be affected by the diet in ewes and lambs and by inoculation treatment of the lambs. Principal coordinate analysis and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed between diet differences in bacterial community groups existed in ewes and differential bacterial clusters occurred in lambs due to both diet and neonatal inoculation. Diet and rumen inoculation acted together to clearly differentiate the bacterial communities through to weaning, however the microbiome effects of these initial early life interventions diminished with time so that rumen bacterial communities showed greater similarity 2 months after weaning. These results demonstrate that ruminal bacterial communities of newborn lambs can be altered by modifying the diet of their mothers. Moreover, the rumen microbiome of lambs can be changed by diet while they are suckling or by inoculating their rumen, and resulting changes in the rumen bacterial microbiome can persist beyond weaning...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis work {{was to investigate the}} feed value and diet selection of tagasaste foliage vs <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> chaff; browsing activities in mixed conditions of tagasaste shrub/pasture; and the preference ranking for forage shmbs species including tagasaste in multi-shmb/pasture conditions by goats as well as sheep. 1. Two eiperiments were carried out in The Animal Physiology Unit, Massey University and Grassland Division DSIR, Palmerston North. A) Indoor experiment: to evaluate DM intake, feed selection, digestibility, chemical compositions of tagasate foliage and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> B) Outdoor experiment: to evaluate browsing activities of goats on mixed conditions of tagasaste shmb and pasture and goat behaviour. 1. 1 DM intake, in- vivo OMD, in- vitro OMD and body weight change were similar for both tagasaste foliage and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> groups. DM intakes were 33. 37 ± 1. 64 (g/kg BW/day) for tagasaste foliage and 26. 49 ± 2. 22 (g/kg BW/day) for <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> In - vivo DMD were 70. 42 ± 1. 35 % and 66. 94 ± 1. 35 % for tagasaste and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> chaff respectively. Similarly, in- vitro DMD were 62. 48 % vs 66. 63 % for tagasaste and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> group. Tagasaste leaves only were higher in in - vitro DMD compared to stems only. In- vitro DMD of leaves were 69. 29 % whereas for stems were 47. 45 %. Tagasaste foliage and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> chaff were similar in Nitrogen (3. 16 vs 3. 21 % DM); NDF (45. 89 vs 45. 39 % DM); ADL (7. 10 vs 6. 76 % DM). But ash content in tagasaste foliage was less than half that of <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> (5. 18 vs 11. 92 % DM). Goats selected most leafy parts of the tagasaste foliage, which were high in Nitrogen content and digestibility but lower in NDF and lignin than the feed offored. In the feed refusal of tagasaste foliage Nitrogen content was 2. 52 % DM; and NDF and ADL were 55. 1 % and 9. 0 % respectively. However, such type of selectivity were not distinct while feeding on <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> chaff, possibly due to its homogeneou$· nature. During the indoor measurement periods body weight change were 0. 026 ± 0. 008 (kg/day/kg BW) and 0. 036 ± 0. 008 (kg/day/kg BW) for tagasaste foliage and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> group respectively. 1. 2 Goats spent more time on browsing on tagasaste foliage than grazing on pasture. Percentage of activities on browsing observations were 36. 0 ± 2. 08 % compared to 22. 2 ± 2. 08 % for grazing and 41. 7 ± 2. 08 % on idling. Goats browsed tagasaste foliage up to 1. 5 m height. Bipedal stance was frequently observed. Goats ate dead bark of tagasaste branches particularly {{towards the end of the}} experiment period when there was no more foliage to browse. The use of artificial shelter was rare, instead of that they selected open and relatively dry places for night camping. Overgrazing might be harmful for better performance of tagasaste plants. Body weight changes in mixed conditions of tagasaste shrub /pasture conditions were higher than in indoor conditions while feeding either on tagasaste foliage or <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> chaff as a sole diet. In shrub/pasture conditions body weight change was 0. 133 ± 0. 02 (kg/day/kg BW) and 0. 122 ± 0. 02 (kg/day/kg BW) for the two groups. 2. In the second trial preference for browsing by goats and sheep in multi-shrub species and pasture conditions including tagasaste, preference ranking for shrub species, and overlap of browsing activities between goats and sheep were evaluated in DSIR, Ballantrae Hill Station. The tested species were six leguminou~ shrubs includii:ig tagasaste, three non leguminous shrubs and two erect grass species. Leguminous species: tagasaste (Chamaecytisus palmensis (Christ) Hutch.), broom (Cytisus scorparius (L) Link.), tree medic (Medicago arborea L.), black locust (Robinia pseudocacia L.), gorse (Ulex europaeus L.), short spine gorse (Ulex europaeusL.). Non leguminous species: tauhinu (Cassinia leptophylla (Frost. F.) R. Br.), ceanothus (Ceanothus griseus (Trel.) Me Minn.), and manuka (Leptospermum scorparium J. R. et, G. Frost.). Erect grass species: toetoe (Cortaderiafulvida (Buchan) Zotov.), pampas (Cortaderia selloana Schult) Asch. & Graeb.). 2. 1 The browsing activities of goats were high compared to sheep. Goats and sheep ranked shrub species differently, but the differences were not extreme. Similarly, proportional utilizations of shrubs were higher in goats compared to sheep. Overlap of browsing activities for shrub species was higher in summer and autumn than in winter. Goats spent 44. 67 ± 1. 3 % of activities on browsing compared to 11. 56 ± 1. 3 % of sheep. Grazing activities between goats and sheep were 48. 57 vs 80. 49 ± 1. 3 %of total observation respectively. Similarly idling activities were 6. 76 vs 7. 95 ± 1. 3 %for goats and sheep respectively. Low idling activities during the two hours record period might be due to the overnight fasting of the animals. 2. 2 The most intensively browsed species were tree medic, tagasqste and ceanotlius by goats as well as sheep. Among the other species goats preferred gorse and short spine gorse compared to other shrub species while sheep preferred black locust and broom. Less preferred species were pampas, tauhinu, toetoe and manuka. Utilization of these species was higher by goats than by sheep. A comperison between these results and those of Lambert et al., (1989) indicated that there were some difference in estimates of preference made under indoor and outdoor conditions. The results indicate the potential of common grazing with goats and sheep especially in shrub/pasture conditions, in the absence of shrubs incorporation of tagasaste in goat farming systems could be useful...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a 4 x 4 Latin square design involving four adult crossbred (Kaghani x Rambouillet) weather kept in individual metabolic crates and four experimental diets viz: maize stovers (Diet A), maize stovers with 150 g/d molasses-urea block (Diet B), <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> (Diet C) and <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> with 150 g/d molasses-urea block (Diet D). The forage intake was restricted to 2 % of body weight. Each experimental period consisted 10 days of adaptation followed by five days of data collection. Total dry matter intake on molasses-urea block (MUB) supplemented diets was higher (p< 0. 05) than unsupplemented diets. The daily quantity of total dry matter and water consumed by weathers was higher (p < 0. 001) on MUB supplemented diets. Water consumption was positively co-related to nitrogen intake (r 2 0. 66 : p< 0. 00 I) and varied due to diets (p < 0. 00 I). in vivo dry matter digestibility (DMD) and organic matter digestibility (OMD) of lucerne hay-based diets were greater (P< 005) than those containing maize stovers. Supplementation of MUB did not affect the DMD or OMD of the diets. The interaction of MUB and forage (P = 0. 06) revealed that MUB was effective in increasing (P< 0. 05) the nitrogen digestibility of maize stovers from 30, 59 % on diet A to 51. 33 % on diet B but did not affect the nitrogen digestibility in animals fed <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> The wethers receiving lucerne hay-based diets retained more nitrogen (p< 0. 001) than those given maize stovers (8. 50 's 3, 12 g/d). Molasses-urea block supplementation on both forages increased (p < 0. 05) the nitrogen retention. Mean nitrogen retention was I 82. 4. 41, 7. 19 and 9. 82 gld in wethers receiving diets A. B. C and D. respectively. Mean rumen ammonia concentration (mg N/lOO ml) in wethers receiving maize stovers. was 10. 52. which increased (p< 0, 05) to 17. 87 in response to MUB supplementation. On <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay.</b> the rumen ammonia concentrations did not change due to MUB and the mean values on diets C and D were 24, 24 and 29. 88 mg N/ 100 ml. rcspectively. It was concluded that MUB supplementation did not affect in vivo dry matter or organic matter digestibility of the experimental diets. but was effective in supporting higher nitrogen retention. Diets based on <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> supported higher nitrogen retention in wethers than those fed maize stovers. Feeding of MUB increased the demand for drinking water...|$|E
40|$|Pellets made {{of biomass}} for energy {{purposes}} {{can be considered}} as a significant type of biofuel. The efficiency of biopellets depends upon many factors; therefore, in our paper we have focused our attention on measuring the physical properties of biopellets made from <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> and maize stover. The chemical composition of biomass materials is characterised. Biopellets were made on the hydraulic press and their durability was measured on the own instrument designed according to the ASABE S 269. 4 standard.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of Spirulina (Arthrospira plantensis) supplementation level, basal diet, sire breed, and sex on wool quality parameters in purebred and crossbred Merino lambs. A total of 48 lambs, over two consecutive years (n= 24 per year), was randomly allocated into Spirulina supplementation level (CONTROL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) groups and balanced by sire breed (Black Suffolk, Dorset, Merino, White Suffolk) and sex (ewes, wethers). Lambs had ad libitum access to a basal diet of pasture and <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay,</b> and had Spirulina supplement daily throughout the 42 -day feeding trial, after a 21 -day adjustment phase. Mid-side wool samples were removed from each lamb {{at the beginning and}} end of the feeding trial and commercially analysed for quality. The wool quality data were transformed into 'wool trait change over the feeding trial period' by the difference between the wool measurements {{at the beginning and end}} of the experiment prior to statistical analysis. Wool clean fleece weight (CFW) was significantly influenced by level of supplementation, basal diet and sex (P< 0. 05). Spirulina-supplemented lambs on <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay</b> basal diet elicited higher CFW responses which increased with supplementation level. CONTROL lambs had the lightest CFW regardless of basal diet. Sire breed and sex variations were significant (P< 0. 05) as wool from Suffolk-sired lambs and ewes had the highest fibre diameter coefficient of variation (CV) and CFW, respectively. CV and fibre diameter standard deviation were the most affected wool traits by significant interactions between Spirulina supplementation level, sire breed and sex.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of organic soil amendments against S. sclerotiorum, {{the cause of}} soft rot of lettuce, and similar diseases {{of a range of}} other crops, was evaluated in the glasshouse and in the field. Stem rot of tomato, also caused by S. sclerotiorum, was also studied under field conditions. <b>Lucerne</b> <b>hay,</b> stable manure and fowl manure greatly suppressed disease incidence caused by S. sclerotiorum in lettuce and tomato crops. These amendments significantly reduced sclerotium numbers remaining in the soil after crop harvest. This was observed in the field and in glasshouse experiments. Incorporation of organic amendments, in particular <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay,</b> stable manure and fowl manure, significantly increased the number and fresh weight of marketable lettuce heads and the number and fresh weight of marketable tomato fruit. There was 100 % germination when sclerotia were added to soil extract and distilled water. Aqueous leachates from <b>lucerne</b> <b>hay,</b> stable manure and cow manure, however, substantially reduced the viability of sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotium viability was reduced when tomato stems infested with S. sclerotiorum were buried in a compost heap (internal temperature 50 - 600 C) and composted for seven weeks. There was a 100 % kill of sclerotia isolated from infested material and buried in the compost heap, 98 % kill of sclerotia incubated in an oven at 40 C compared to 10 % reduction in viability of those isolated from non-composted infected tomato stems. Organic amendments generally reduced the number of sclerotia in the soil over the experimental period. Disease incidence reflected levels of sclerotia in soil. The presence of organic substrate combined with high moisture levels, high relative humidity, and mild temperature suppressed Sclerotinia diseases, delayed onset of disease in some seasons and decreased the rate of disease development in lettuce and tomatoes.

40|$|Elche (Alces alces) werden immer wieder als äusserst anspruchsvolle Pfleglinge in Menschenobhut beschrieben, was vor allem an ihrer besonderen Verdauungsphysiologie und den daraus resultierenden Fütterungsansprüchen liegt. Elche verweigern laut Literatur oft die angebotenen Raufuttermittel, was indirekt zu einer überproportionalen Aufnahme von leichtverdaulichem Futter und damit chronischer Pansenazidose führen kann und ein Grund für die geringe Lebenserwartung von Elchen in Menschenobhut sein könnte. Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es daher, anhand von Fütterungsversuchen an vier Elchen nicht nur verdauungsphysiologische Basisdaten von Elchen zu mehren, sondern zu überprüfen, ob eine reine Raufutter-Fütterung tatsächlich bei diesen Tieren nicht möglich ist. Die verwendeten Futterrationen bestanden aus der zootypischen mit Mischfutter, und reinen Raufutterrationen aus Luzerneheu, Luzerne-/Gras-/Laubheu, und nur aus Laubheu.
