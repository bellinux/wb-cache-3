40|$|Abstract. The <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> {{machine has}} been used in {{industries}} because of its low-cost and high efficiency precision forming technique. In the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> process is that the permanent die and filling systems are placed over the furnace containing the molten alloy. The filling of the cavity is obtained by forcing the molten metal, by means of a pressurized gas, to rise into a ceramic tube, which connects the die to the furnace. The ceramics tube, called stalk, has high temperature resistance and high corrosion resistance. However, attention should be paid to the thermal stress when the ceramics tube is dipped into the molten metal. It is important {{to reduce the risk of}} fracture that may happen due to the thermal stresses. To calculate the thermal stress, it is necessary to know the surface heat transfer coefficient when the ceramics tube dips into the molten metal. In this paper, therefore, the three-dimensional thermo-fluid analysis is performed to calculate surface heat transfer coefficient correctly. The finite element method is applied to calculate the thermal stresses when the tube is dipped into the crucible with varying dipping speeds and dipping directions. It is found that the thermal stress can be reduced by dipping slowly when the tube is dipped into the molten metal...|$|E

Furthermore the solutions to eliminate them were presented. By reducing the pouring rate, the turbulent flow {{at the corner of}} casting had eased, so the gas pores could be eliminated.
