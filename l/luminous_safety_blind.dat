40|$|Defense-in-depth is a {{fundamental}} safety principle for the design and operation of nuclear power plants. Despite its general appeal, defense-in-depth {{is not without its}} drawbacks, which include its potential for concealing the occurrence of hazardous states in a system, and more generally rendering the latter more opaque for its operators and managers, thus resulting in <b>safety</b> <b>blind</b> spots. This in turn translates into a shrinking of the time window available for operators to identify an unfolding hazardous condition or situation and intervene to abate it. To prevent this drawback from materializing, we propose in this work a novel safety principle termed “observability-in-depth”. We characterize it as the set of provisions technical, operational, and organizational designed to enable the monitoring and identification of emerging hazardous conditions and accident pathogens in real-time and over different time-scales. Observability-in-depth also requires the monitoring of conditions of all safety barriers that implement defense-in-depth; and in so doing it supports sensemaking of identified hazardous conditions, and the understanding of potential accident sequences that might follow (how they can propagate). Observability-in-depth is thus an information-centric principle, and its importance in accident prevention is {{in the value of the}} information it provides and actions or safety interventions it spurs. We examine several “event reports” from the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission database, which illustrate specific instances of violation of the observability-in-depth safety principle and the consequences that followed (e. g., unmonitored releases and loss of containments). We also revisit the Three Mile Island accident in light of the proposed principle, and identify causes and consequences of the lack of observability-in-depth related to this accident sequence. We illustrate both the benefits of adopting the observability-in-depth safety principle and the adverse consequences when this principle is violated or not implemented. This work constitutes a first step in the development of the observability-in-depth safety principle, and we hope this effort invites other researchers and safety professionals to further explore and develop this principle and its implementation...|$|R

40|$|Blind {{puncture}} access {{procedures are}} frequent in medicine but {{can lead to}} complications due to over-puncture. When tissue membranes yield under applied stress, the device suddenly accelerates forward into the patient. Clinical background for puncture access procedures and specifically trocar insertion during laparoscopic surgery is presented. A design method is outlined and applied, with functional requirements defined and strategies and concepts detailed. The chosen mechanism concept is developed through geometric analysis. A cost-effective flexure-based mechanism is proposed as an improvement, and flexure mechanics analysis is performed. Flexure samples were manufactured and tested to validate theoretical work and fabrication technique. Prototypes were constructed, revealing {{the need for further}} design for assembly and flexure design considerations. Potential solutions are proposed and future steps outlined. The proposed device has the potential to improve <b>safety</b> during <b>blind</b> puncture access procedures by actively opposing forward acceleration of the device upon break-through thus reducing over-puncture incidents. by Nikolai David Michael Begg.

40|$|Software plays {{a central}} role in {{military}} systems. It is also an important factor in many recent incidents and accidents. A safety gap is growing between our software-intensive technological capabilities and our understanding of the ways they can fail or lead to accidents. Traditional forms of accident investigation are poorly equipped to trace the sources of software failure, for instance software does not age {{in the same way that}} hardware components fail over time. As such, it can be hard to trace the causes of software failure or mechanisms by which it contributed to accidents back into the development and procurement chain to address the deeper, systemic causes of potential accidents. To identify some of these failure mechanisms, we examined the database of the Air Force Accident Investigation Board (AIB) and analyzed mishaps in which software was involved. Although we have chosen to focus on military aviation, many of the insights also apply to civil aviation. Our analysis led to several results and recommendations. Some were specific and related for example to specific shortcomings in the testing and validation of particular avionic subsystems. Others were broader in scope: for instance, we challenged both the investigation process (aspects of) and the findings in several cases, and we provided recommendations, technical and organizational, for improvements. We also identified important <b>safety</b> <b>blind</b> spots in the investigations with respect to software, whose contribution to the escalation of the adverse events was often neglected in the accident reports. These blind spots, we argued, constitute an important missed learning opportunity for improving accident prevention, and it is especially unfortunate at a time when Remotely Piloted Air Systems (RPAS) are being integrated into the National Airspace. Our findings support the growing recognition that the traditional notion of software failure as non-compliance with requirements is too limited to capture the diversity of roles that software plays in military and civil aviation accidents. The identification of several specific mechanisms by which software contributes to accidents can help populate a library of patterns and triggers of software contributions to adverse events, a library which in turn can be used to help guide better software development, better coding, and better testing to avoid or eliminate these particular patterns and triggers. Finally, we strongly argue for the examination of software’s causal role in accident investigations, the inclusion of a section on the subject in the accident reports, and the participation of software experts in accident investigations...|$|R

50|$|Indirect {{supervision}} {{is when a}} {{correctional officer}} is placed in an enclosed booth and must constantly watch over the inmates through a bird’s eye view. The physical interactions that officers have with the inmates is minimal, {{for most of the}} communication comes through an intercom system. Inmates are placed in their own cells and officers have physical barriers to ensure their own safety. When havoc is wreaked, a call for a response team is placed over the intercom. This type of supervision is strong, but has some drawbacks, such as the creation of blind spots. These are created through indirect supervision because the guards standing watch can have objects blocking tiny spots or they may just not be looking in the right direction at the right time. Indirect supervision is an impersonal and more distant form of supervision that helps with officer <b>safety,</b> but leaves <b>blind</b> spots for “…inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.|$|R
40|$|Collisions between {{personnel}} on {{foot and}} heavy equipment or materials on {{a construction site}} {{can be characterized as}} a contact collision. These types of incidents are a common occurrence on a work site. Technology is needed to improve work zone safety by alerting workers that are in danger of collisions pro-actively and in real-time. Developing this technology may assist in collecting previously un-recorded data on "near-misses" (close-calls). An approach is presented in this paper that is based on wireless radio frequency technology to alert workers in real-time when they are in danger. Various experiments are described that have been conducted in order to gain better understanding of the technology's potential, including measuring equipment blind spots and alert (or <b>safety)</b> zones. <b>Blind</b> spots areas are measured for six common construction vehicles to help determine the required (or minimum) alert distance (safety zone) for the equipment. A computer program was developed in-house to automatically calculate the percentage of blind spots on 2 -dimensional planes and in the overall 3 -dimensional volume. The blind spots results directly indicate the necessary safety zones for the equipment. The proximity device results show that technology demonstrated the capability of collecting important safety data while pro-actively detecting hazardous situations and warning workers and equipment operators during imminent potential hazardous events. Furthermore, the presented research can lead to improve the overall safety performance in construction and elsewhere through improved learning and education by providing relevant information to decision makers at all levels.

METHODS: Patients {{suspected of having}} infectious pneumonia were included prospectively. Three samples were obtained: expectorated sputum, nasotracheal suction-ing, and mini-BAL via a double telescopic catheter (Combicath). Under local anesthesia, nasotra-cheal suctioning was done according to standard recommendations. Then mini-BAL was per-formed; the bronchial catheter serves {{as a guide for}} the mini-BAL catheter, and tracheal position is verified via colorimetric capnography.

40|$|Considering motorcyclists, {{pedestrians}} and bicyclists {{as vulnerable}} road users (VRUs), more than 75 {{percent of the}} victims of fatal crashes involving large trucks in Taiwan are VRUs. Most crashes occurred at or were due to the blind spots of large trucks because of the size and traveling locations of the VRUs. This study applies typology and statistical methods to estimate the potential <b>safety</b> benefit of <b>blind</b> spot detection (BSD) systems for large trucks on VRUs. The pre-crash scenarios associated with the blind spots of large trucks were derived by counting the maneuvers of large trucks and VRUs, prior to crashes, the truck drivers’ improper behaviors (cause of crashes), and the crash types. The number of crashes and fatalities were counted for the pre-crash scenario relevant to the BSD systems. A value of 0. 8 of human machine interface factor (HMIF) based on a previous study was applied to estimate the potential safety benefits of the BSD system. The results show that the implementation of BSD systems on all large trucks could help avoid about 24, 10, and 11 percent of large truck-involved crashes with pedestrians, bicycles, and motorcycles, respectively. The BSD systems could also save 5 pedestrians, 3 bicyclists, and 15 motorcyclists per year from crashes involving large trucks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Severe malaria {{remains a}} major cause of global {{morbidity}} and mortality. Despite the use of potent anti-parasitic agents, the mortality rate in severe malaria remains high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of severe malaria may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Endothelial activation plays {{a central role in the}} pathogenesis of severe malaria, of which angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2) has recently been shown to function as a key regulator. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major inhibitor of Ang- 2 release from endothelium and has been shown to decrease endothelial inflammation and reduce the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes. Low-flow inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) gas is a US FDA-approved treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure in neonates. Methods/Design This prospective, parallel arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trial compares adjunctive continuous inhaled nitric oxide at 80 ppm to placebo (both arms receiving standard anti-malarial therapy), among Ugandan children aged 1 - 10 years of age with severe malaria. The primary endpoint is the longitudinal change in Ang- 2, an objective and quantitative biomarker of malaria severity, which will be analysed using a mixed-effects linear model. Secondary endpoints include mortality, recovery time, parasite clearance and neurocognitive sequelae. Discussion Noteworthy aspects of this trial design include its efficient sample size supported by a computer simulation study to evaluate statistical power, meticulous attention to complex ethical issues in a cross-cultural setting, and innovative strategies for <b>safety</b> monitoring and <b>blinding</b> to treatment allocation in a resource-constrained setting in sub-Saharan Africa.

METHODS: Double-blind, parallel-group, international, randomised, non-inferiority trial. More {{than half of the}} 196 participating centres were primary care centres. Patients eligible had type 2 DM uncontrolled on sulfonylurea. 846 were randomised. They received study treatment for 1 year. 423 patients were allocated to benfluorex (150 to 450 mg/day) and 423 were allocated to pioglitazone (30 to 45 mg/day). Primary efficacy criterion was HbA(1 c). <b>Safety</b> assessment included <b>blinded</b> echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac and valvular status. RESULTS: At baseline, patients were 59. 1 ± 10. 5 years old with HbA 1 c 8. 3 ± 0. 8 %, and DM duration 7. 1 ± 6. 0 years. During the study, mean HbA 1 c significantly decreased in both groups (benfluorex: from 8. 30 ± 0. 80 to 7. 77 ± 1. 31 versus pioglitazone: from 8. 30 ± 0. 80 to 7. 45 ± 1. 30 %). The last HbA 1 c value was significantly lower with pioglitazone than with benfluorex (p< 0. 001) and non-inferiority of benfluorex was not confirmed (p = 0. 19). Among the 615 patients with assessable paired echocardiography (310 benfluorex, 305 pioglitazone), 314 (51 %) had at least one morphological valvular abnormality and 515 (84 %) at least one functional valvular abnormality at baseline. Emergent morphological abnormalities occurred in 8 patients with benfluorex versus 4 with pioglitazone (OR 1. 99), 95 % CI (0. 59 to 6. 69). Emergent regurgitation (new or increased by one grade or more) occurred more frequently with benfluorex (82 patients, 27 %) than with pioglitazone (33 patients, 11 %) (OR 2. 97), 95 % CI (1. 91 to 4. 63) and were mainly rated grade 1; grade 2 (mild) was detected in 2 patients with benfluorex and 3 with pioglitazone.

MethodsUnblinded investigators identified thromboembolic events, using standardized terms (such as “myocardial infarction,” “deep vein thrombosis,” “pulmonary embolism,” and “ischemic stroke”). A <b>blinded</b> <b>safety</b> adjudication board reviewed serious thromboembolic events, {{as well as}} those referred by an independent unblinded data and safety monitoring board. We descriptively compared thromboembolic event and patient characteristics between treatment groups and included detailed patient-level outcome descriptions. We did not power the trials to assess safety. ResultsWe enrolled 388 patients (4 F-PCC: n= 191; plasma: n= 197) in the trials. Thromboembolic events occurred in 14 of 191 patients (7. 3 %) in the 4 F-PCC group and 14 of 197 (7. 1 %) in the plasma group (risk difference 0. 2 %; 95 % confidence interval − 5. 5 % to 6. 0 %). Investigators reported serious thromboembolic events in 16 patients (4 F-PCC: n= 8; plasma: n= 8); the data and safety monitoring board referred 2 additional myocardial ischemia events (plasma group) to the safety adjudication board for review. The safety adjudication board judged serious thromboembolic events in 10 patients (4 F-PCC: n= 4; plasma: n= 6) as possibly treatment related. There were 8 vascular thromboembolic events in the 4 F-PCC group versus 4 in the plasma group, and 1 versus 6 cardiac events, respectively. Among patients with thromboembolic events, 3 deaths occurred in each treatment group. All-cause mortality for the pooled population was 13 per group. We observed no relationship between thromboembolic event occurrence and factor levels transiently above the upper limit of normal; there were no notable differences in median factor or proteins C and S levels up to 24  hours postinfusion start in patients with and without thromboembolic events.

40|$|Background: Crosstalk between hormone- and EGFR-family {{pathways}} is {{a possible}} cause of resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AI), {{as suggested by the}} increased expression of HER 2, EGFR and MAPK in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer (BC) cells. Lapatinib (Lap) is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of EGFR and HER 2 tyrosine-kinases. Combination of an AI and Lap in ER+/HER 2 - tumors could avoid the onset of resistance due to early stimulation of EGFR and HER 2 pathways. To evaluate these effects, we designed an international multicenter phase IIb double-blind randomized trial in ER+/HER 2 - BC pts candidates for hormone neoadjuvant therapy. Methods: Postmenopausal pts with stage II-IIIa, HR+/HER 2 - BC are randomized to letrozole (Let; 2. 5 mg/d) plus lapatinib (Lap; 1, 500 mg/d) or placebo (P), given continuously for 24 weeks before surgery. Activity (with ultrasonographyc, US) and cardiac safety (with echocardiogram) assessment are performed after 12 and 24 weeks. Tissue biomarkers of hormone and EGFR-family related pathways are analyzed before and after treatment. An initial sample size of 42 pts will be enrolled assuming a 50 % chance of cOR with Let+P and a 40 % increase in cOR with the Let+Lap (equal to 70 % absolute cOR). Additional 48 pts will be treated in case we observe 20 cOR in the first cohort (Simon's design). Results: 19 Italian and European centers are participating in the study. From April 2007, 28 pts have been randomized, and 15 pts were treated for at least 3 months (mo). Six pts completed the six mo treatment, and 4 underwent surgery. At diagnosis, mean US tumor size was 2. 87 cm (range 2 - 6 cm). All pts were ER+ (73 % ER+/PR+) and HER 2 -. No significant decrease in mean LVEF was observed at the 3 -mo evaluation (60. 9 %- 61. 5 %). No grade 3 - 4 toxicities were reported. A 34 % absolute reduction in median longest US tumor diameter has been observed after 3 mo (15 pts) and 65 % reduction has been obtained at 6 mo (6 pts).

Subjects and laboratory personnel were <b>blinded.</b> <b>Safety</b> and antibody responses 21 -days post-second vaccination (Day 42) were assessed. Post-trial, to compare the risk of malaria episodes 130 - 365 days post-second vaccination, Stage 2 subjects were age-matched to 50 control individuals. RESULTS: Nearly all subjects who received BK-SE 36 had induration (Stage 1, n =  33, 92 %; Stage 2, n =  63, 96 %) as a local adverse event. No serious adverse event related to BK-SE 36 was reported. Pre-existing anti-SE 36 antibody titers negatively correlated with vaccination-induced antibody response. At Day 42, change in antibody titers was significant for seronegative adults (1. 95 -fold higher than baseline [95 % CI, 1. 56 - 2. 43], p =  0. 004) and 6 - 10 year-olds (5. 71 -fold [95 % CI, 2. 38 - 13. 72], p =  0. 002) vaccinated with BKSE 1. 0. Immunogenicity response to BKSE 0. 5 was low and not significant (1. 55 -fold [95 % CI, 1. 24 - 1. 94], p =  0. 75). In the ancillary analysis, cumulative incidence of first malaria episodes with ≥ 5000 parasites/µL was 7 cases/ 33 subjects in BKSE 1. 0 and 10 cases/ 33 subjects in BKSE 0. 5 vs. 29 cases/ 66 subjects in the control group. Risk ratio for BKSE 1. 0 was 0. 48 (95 % CI, 0. 24 - 0. 98; p =  0. 04). CONCLUSION: BK-SE 36 is safe and immunogenic. The promising potential of BK-SE 36, observed in the follow-up study, warrants a double-blind phase 1 / 2 b trial in children under 5 years.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Sugammadex {{has been introduced}} for reversal of rocuronium (or vecuronium) –induced neuromuscular blockade (NMB). Although its efficacy has been established, data are conflicting whether it is safer than neostigmine traditionally used for reversing NMB. Design Meta-analysis of data about effectiveness and safety of sugammadex compared to neostigmine for reversing NMB in adults was performed using the PRISMA methodology. Setting University medical hospital. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to identify English-language randomized controlled trials. Two reviewers independently selected the trials; extracted data on reversal times, incomplete reversals of NMB, and adverse events (AEs); and assessed the trials' methodological quality and evidence level. Only AEs that were related to study drug by a <b>blinded</b> <b>safety</b> assessor were considered for meta-analysis. Patients A total of 1384 patients from 13 articles were included in this meta-analysis. Main results Compared to neostigmine, sugammadex was faster in reversing NMB (P <. 0001) {{and more likely to}} be associated with higher train-of-four ratio values at extubation (mean difference, 0. 18; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 14 - 0. 22; P <. 0001) and lower risk of postoperative residual curarization after extubation (odds ratio [OR], 0. 05; 95 % CI, 0. 01 - 0. 43; P =. 0068). Compared to neostigmine, sugammadex was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of global AEs (OR, 0. 47; 95 % CI, 0. 34 - 0. 66; P <. 0001), respiratory AEs (OR, 0. 36; 95 % CI, 0. 14 - 0. 95; P =. 0386), cardiovascular AEs (OR, 0. 23; 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 61; P =. 0036), and postoperative weakness (OR, 0. 45; 95 % CI, 0. 21 - 0. 97; P =. 0409). Sugammadex and neostigmine were associated with a similar likelihood of postoperative nausea and vomiting (OR, 1. 23; 95 % CI, 0. 70 - 2. 15; P =. 4719), pain (OR, 1. 06; 95 % CI, 0. 15 - 7. 36; P =. 9559), neurologic AEs (OR, 1. 47; 95 % CI, 0. 52 - 4. 17; P =. 4699), general AEs (OR, 0. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 47 - 1. 21; P =. 2448), and changes in laboratory tests' values (OR, 0. 57; 95 % CI, 0. 18 - 1. 78; P =. 3368). Conclusions Results from this meta-analysis suggest that sugammadex is superior to neostigmine, as it reverses NMB faster and more reliably, with a lower risk of AE...|$|R
30|$|The phase II {{clinical}} study of CC- 930 in IPF patients was a multicenter study, open to enrollment from January 2011 to August 2012, {{which consisted of}} a screening period, 4 -week blinded sequential ascending-dose phase, a 52 -week open-label treatment-extension phase, and a 52 -week observational follow-up phase. A total number of 19 clinical sites were activated to recruit subjects (13 sites in the United States and six sites in Canada), out of which 11 sites enrolled subjects (seven sites in the United States and four sites in Canada). The study population was restricted to subjects with an FVC > 50 and < 90  % of predicted, DLco > 25 and < 90  % of predicted, and resting saturated oxygen of > 92  % on room air at sea level who have findings of usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on HRCT and/or usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on histopathology (i.e., lung biopsy), and the exclusion of known causes of interstitial lung disease. The primary endpoint {{of the study was}} to evaluate the safety (clinical adverse events (AE), laboratory, or other changes) of CC- 930 in the 4 -week double-blind treatment phase. Secondary endpoints included: CC- 930 pharmacokinetics; evaluation of the long-term safety of CC- 930 in the 52 -week open-label extension; and disease progression and death rates within the total treatment and follow-up observational period. Exploratory endpoints included: changes in blood biomarkers KL- 6, MMP- 1, MMP- 7, SP-A and SP-D, TIMP- 1, CCL- 18, CCL- 2, PAI- 1, and tenascin C; changes in FVC and DLCO from baseline; and change in HRCT pulmonary fibrosis score from baseline. The double-blind, ascending-dose phase consisted of three sequential dose cohorts [CC- 930 50  mg QD (cohort 1), CC- 930 100  mg QD (cohort 2), and CC- 930 100  mg BID (cohort 3)]. In each cohort, eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo (two patients) or CC- 930 (eight patients) for 4  weeks. The decision to escalate to the next dose level was made after all patients had completed or discontinued prematurely from the preceding dose level, and pharmacokinetic and safety data from the preceding dose level had been reviewed by an external data monitoring committee. Ongoing review of <b>blinded</b> <b>safety</b> data from eight patients receiving CC- 930 100  mg BID (cohort 3) revealed increases in liver transaminases that may have been a potential risk to patients if they continued at that dose. This observation led to the issuing of a protocol amendment to decrease the study drug dose in Cohort 3 from 100  mg BID to 100  mg QD (3 of 8 subjects remained on study and were dose-reduced). The data from these 3 subjects were handled on an intent-to-treat basis. All patients who completed the double-blind, ascending-dose phase were eligible to enter the open-label treatment-extension phase and continue on the same dose of CC- 930 for 52  weeks. Patients initially allocated to placebo were given the CC- 930 dose from their original cohort assignment. The external data monitoring committee regularly reviewed safety results during this phase.|$|R

People with vision impairment usually use a white cane {{as their primary}} tool for wayfinding and obstacle detection. Environmental cues, though not always reliable, are used to support the decision making of the visually impaired at various levels of navigation and situation awareness. Due to differences in spatial perception as compared to sighted people, they often encounter physical {{as well as information}} barriers along a trip. In order to improve their mobility, accessibility and level of confidence in using our transportation system, it is important to remove not only the physical barriers but also the information barriers that could potentially impede their mobility and undermine safety. Many assistive systems have been developed in the past for visually impaired users to navigate and find their way. However, most of these systems were not adopted by users mostly due to the inconvenience of using such systems. In this research, we developed a mobile accessible information system that allows people with vision impairment to receive transportation information at key locations where decision making is necessary. A smartphone-based personal assistive system, called MAPS (Mobile Accessible Pedestrian System), was developed to provide intersection geometry and signal timing information, not available from other apps in the market for people with vision impairment. In addition, the MAPS incorporates a geospatial database with Bluetooth beacon information that allows the MAPS to provide navigation assistance, situation awareness, and wayfinding to users even when a GPS solution is not available. The MAPS app communicates with the traffic signal controller through a secured wireless link to obtain real-time Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) information, which together then inform visually impaired pedestrians with their current locations and when to cross streets. A self-monitoring infrastructure using a network of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons was developed to ensure the information integrity of the network. The key contributions of this dissertation include the development of: •	A smartphone-based navigation and decision support system that incorporates intersection geometry and traffic signal information for people with vision impairment, •	A simple user’s interface (using a single or double-tap on a smartphone screen) that is easy for the visually impaired to learn and use, •	Standardized message elements for an audible work zone bypass routing information system, •	A self-monitoring infrastructure using a network of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) low-cost BLE beacons, (including customized firmware allowing BLE beacons to monitor each other), •	A crowdsourcing approach using users’ smartphones to monitor the status of BLE beacons and update messages associated with beacons, •	A cloud-based geospatial database to support navigation by incorporating BLE beacon localization information when a GPS solution is not available, •	A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based Multivariable Regression (MR) algorithm together with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) technique using beacon localization to provide a positioning solution by the smartphone even if a GPS solution is unavailable, and •	Statistical methodologies and wireless signal fingerprinting techniques to monitor BLE beacons in a network in order to determine when a beacon is moved, removed or disappears. The intent of the MAPS is not to undermine the maintenance of skills and strategies that people with vision impairment have learned for navigation and wayfinding. Instead, the system aims to support their wayfinding capability, extend mobility and accessibility, and improve <b>safety</b> for the <b>blind</b> and visually impaired. This self-monitoring infrastructure ensures that correct information is provided to users at the right location when needed. This thesis also introduces the idea of using the same system to warn sighted pedestrians about approaching an intersection when they are distracted by looking at their smartphone...|$|R
