25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford.</b> Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E
500|$|Although some reviewers {{criticized the}} episode for its profanity and other {{material}} deemed offensive {{at the time}} of its original broadcast, several others felt [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was a significant improvement over the pilot, particularly for its satirical element regarding American consumerism. The episode introduced such recurring characters as Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels, Bebe Stevens and Clyde Donovan. The show's portrayal of Kathie <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford</b> was the first time a celebrity was spoofed in South Park.|$|E
500|$|... "Weight Gain 4000" [...] is {{the third}} episode of the American {{animated}} television series South Park. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 27, 1997.

United Students Against Sweatshops is active on college campuses. The International Labor Rights Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of workers in China, Nicaragua, Swaziland, Indonesia, and Bangladesh against Wal-Mart charging the company with knowingly developing purchasing policies particularly relating to price and delivery time that are impossible to meet while following the Wal-Mart code of conduct. Labor unions, such as the AFL-CIO, have helped support the anti-sweatshop movement out of concern both {{for the welfare of}} workers in the developing world and those in the United States.|$|R
500|$|Cartman's {{impulse to}} buy a {{bodybuilding}} supplement based on a single commercial {{has been described as}} a satire of the concept of [...] "identity shopping". The concept involves the obtaining of an identity through what one owns, wears or buys, just as Cartman seeks to remake himself as a bodybuilder by buying Weight Gain 4000. [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] also satirizes the obsession with celebrity prevalent among most Americans, particularly through the town's overly enthusiastic reaction to Kathie <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford's</b> appearance. Additionally, Anglican theologian Paul F. M. Zahl has suggested Cartman's addiction to food in the episode, combined with his blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 supplement and his insistence to [...] "follow your dreams", reflects the idea that many people falsely cling to the notion of free will when they in fact lack any self-control whatsoever. Zahl wrote, [...] "The two writers of South Park see through the myth of 'free will.'" ...|$|R

500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford.</b> Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford</b> is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.|$|E

The soup splash was created by dropping an item into the pot, then adding the animated characters over it. The taping of this segment took longer than expected, so a broadcast of WABC-TV's Eyewitness News that was to take place (the show was {{and continues to be}} taped at the facilities of WABC in New York, where it originated in 1983) had to be moved to another studio. Jerry Springer also guest stars in the episode as himself. His lines were recorded by Julie Thacker.|$|E
5000|$|Hee Haw {{produced}} a short-lived spin-off series, Hee Haw Honeys (not {{to be confused}} with Hee Haw's female cast members), for the 1979-80 television seasons.

Their restaurant included a bandstand, where guest country artists would perform a couple of their hits of the day, sometimes asking the cast to join them. Cast members would also perform songs occasionally; and the Nashville Edition, Hee Haw's backup singing group, frequently appeared on the show, portraying regular patrons of the restaurant.

50|$|The Morning Show, co-hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey, premiered locally on WABC-TV in New York on April 4, 1983.

After Abernathy got married and {{decided to return to}} Los Angeles, Kathie <b>Lee</b> Johnson (later <b>Gifford)</b> joined Philbin officially on June 24, 1985. Their chemistry proved to be successful as The Morning Show soon became number 1 in the market and went on to debut in national syndication on September 5, 1988, when the title was changed to Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.|$|R
25|$|After Garvey left Los Angeles in 1982 {{and moved}} to New York City, Philbin rejoined her on The Morning Show, on WABC-TV. At the time, the 9am time slot for WABC {{suffered}} from low Nielsen ratings because of competition from WNBC-TV's Donahue and WCBS-TV's game show block featuring The Joker's Wild and Tic Tac Dough. After Garvey left again and Ann Abernathy briefly shared co-hosting duties, Philbin was paired with Kathie <b>Lee</b> Johnson (later <b>Gifford),</b> in June 1985, and ratings improved significantly. The show became nationally syndicated in September 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee and the success continued. The program replaced A.M. Los Angeles upon its cancellation in 1991 and was eventually picked up {{by all of the}} ABC owned-and-operated stations except for WLS in Chicago, which aired The Oprah Winfrey Show in that time slot and had done so since the show's debut as A.M. Chicago.|$|R
500|$|Kathie <b>Lee</b> <b>Gifford,</b> then a {{television}} hostess {{on the morning}} talk show Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, {{was the first of}} many celebrities to be spoofed in a South Park episode. The South Park creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] aired, the tabloid The Globe hired Suzen Johnson to film herself seducing Frank Gifford, Gifford's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the [...] "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly happens to a celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in South Park. Actress Karri Turner provided the voice of Gifford in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on South Park. Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof glass bubble. The bubble was inspired by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile during a trip to Denver, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built {{into the back of a}} modified truck, was [...] "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film Orgazmo.|$|E

Originally a summer replacement for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, Hee Haw was an immediate ratings winner throughout that first summer and was permanently added to the CBS schedule in December 1969. Co-hosted by Roy Clark and Buck Owens, the hour-long program featured regulars Archie Campbell, Grandpa Jones, Minnie Pearl, Junior Samples, Lulu Roman and Gordie Tapp. Comedian and frequent Peppiatt & Aylesworth collaborator Jack Burns was also a writer and major contributor in the early years of the show.
