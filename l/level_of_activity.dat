5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E
5|$|On August 2, {{after an}} {{extraordinarily}} active early season, the NOAA released an updated outlook on {{the remainder of}} the season, significantly raising the expected <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005, Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the NOAA nor Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> The actual ACE would prove to be 248 × 104 kt2— 277% of the median.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2003, NOAA {{published}} its {{forecast for}} the Central Pacific hurricane season. The forecast {{called for a}} slightly below-average <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in 2003, due to the same forecast of the onset of La Niña which would later prompt the low forecast for the Eastern Pacific.|$|E

30|$|The Charnley {{classification}} {{may also}} be used to assess <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> [51], which is in accordance with the authors’ original intention [43]. Loosening of arthroplasty components {{has been shown to be}} more frequent in Charnley group A than group B, and group C patients, presumably because the classification directly relates to <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> [52].|$|R
5|$|The slight {{radioactivity}} of rubidium {{was discovered}} in 1908, {{but that was before}} the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and the low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> (half-life greater than 1010years) made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; {{the growth of the}} volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|On May 22, 2006, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) CPC (CPC) {{released}} their forecasts for the 2006 Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons. The Pacific {{season was}} expected to be hindered by the decades-long cycle that began in 1995, which generally increased wind shear across the basin. NOAA predicted a below-normal <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the Eastern Pacific, with 12–16named storms, of which 6–8 were expected to become hurricanes, and 1–3 expected to become major hurricanes. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility was also expected to be below average, with only two to three tropical cyclones expected to form or cross into the area. They expected that neither El Niño nor La Niña would affect conditions significantly.|$|E
50|$|Low level waste (LLW): Waste that {{is above}} {{clearance}} levels and requires robust isolation and containment for periods {{of up to}} a few hundred years and is suitable for disposal in engineered near surface facilities. LLW include short lived radionuclides at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> concentration and also long lived radionuclides, but only at relatively low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> concentration.|$|R
50|$|Flexible Budgets: The {{concept of}} {{flexible}} budgets {{is an extension}} of the traditional budgeting methodology that is most valuable when the company expects or any experience wide variations in <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> within some area of the company, such as sales, or if many of the costs vary directly with those <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> e.g. they are direct costs tied to sales, and the budget controls for these costs would be marginally useless if activity levels were significantly different from those in the budget. In such situations, direct costs are budgeted for various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and the budget used for a comparison with actual results is the budget that is based on the actual activity levels achieved.|$|R
40|$|In humans, the wakeful resting {{condition}} {{is characterized by}} a default mode of brain function involving high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> within a functionally connected network of brain regions. This network has recently been implicated in mental self-projection into the past, the future, or another individual's perspective. Here we use [(18) F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging to assess resting-state brain activity in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, as a potential window onto their mental world and compare these results with those of a human sample. We find that, like humans, chimpanzees show high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> within default mode areas, including medial prefrontal and medial parietal cortex. Chimpanzees differ from our human sample in showing higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in left-sided cortical areas involved in language and conceptual processing in humans. Our results raise the possibility that the resting state of chimpanzees involves emotionally laden episodic memory retrieval and some <b>level</b> <b>of</b> mental self-projection, albeit in the absence of language and conceptual processing...|$|R
5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} {{stratovolcano}} in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position straddling two major pieces of crust accounts for its high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies {{broke out of}} the region and rapidly advanced to the German border. This campaign dominated the activities of eight of the ten Australian squadrons in the UK, as well as most of the airmen posted to RAF units. During July and August the RAAF units operated at or near their highest <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> in the war to that point, but morale remained high as the airmen perceived that the contribution of air power to the campaign would be decisive. Large numbers of Australian airmen who were undergoing training or awaiting a posting on D-Day were assigned to combat units during the fighting to replace casualties of the Normandy campaign.|$|E
5|$|The season {{produced}} twenty-one tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical {{storms and}} nine further intensified to become hurricanes. Despite this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> only one hurricane– Raymond– strengthened {{into a major}} hurricane. The most significant storm, in terms of loss of life and damage, was Hurricane Manuel. Forming in mid-September, Manuel attained its peak as a minimal Category1 hurricane before moving ashore the coastline of Mexico. In total, the storm contributed to 123 confirmed fatalities and $4.2 billion (2013 USD) in damage. Throughout {{the duration of the}} season, four other named storms– Hurricane Barbara and tropical storms Juliette, Octave, and Sonia– made landfall in Mexico, causing minor damage and loss of life.|$|E

5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> of the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E

40|$|Background: It is well {{established}} that hippocampal activity is positively related to effective associative memory formation. However, in biological systems often optimal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> are contrasted by both sub-and supra-optimal <b>levels.</b> Suboptimal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal <b>activity</b> are commonly attributed to unsuccessful memory formation, whereas the supraoptimal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal <b>activity</b> related to unsuccessful memory formation have been rarely studied. It is still unclear under what circumstances such supra-optimal <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> hippocampal <b>activity</b> occur. To clarify this issue, we aimed at creating a condition, in which supra-optimal hippocampal activity is associated with encoding failure. We assumed that such supra-optimal activity occurs when task-relevant information is embedded in task-irrelevant, distracting information, which {{can be considered as}} noise...|$|R

5|$|Météo-France issued their {{seasonal}} {{forecast of}} cyclone activity for the basin on November 12. MFR predicted a slightly below average to average season, citing {{the effects of}} a very strong El Niño event. Compared to an average of ten moderate tropical storms that usually form in the South-West Indian Ocean, a 70% chance was given to the probability of six to ten named storms forming. A 20% chance was given to the formation of only five cyclones or less, and a 10% was given to an above average <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity.</b> MRF expected that an above average number of named storms would develop in the central region of the basin (from 60°E to 77°E), and that there would be lower than average activity to the east of 77°E. Activity near normal was expected west of 60°E. MFR also predicted that the motion of cyclones during the season would have a stronger meridional component than normal, having a tendency to track south quickly.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
5|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf have been actively monitoring the seismicity there since the 1980s and {{have found a}} consistent low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity,</b> but a primary characteristic of the activity {{is that there are}} multiple sequences of earthquake swarms. Three swarm events, beginning in the north and ending in the south gulf, have been observed beginning in 1983 when more than 1,000 events occurred over a three-month period near the northeastern boundary of the Elat Deep (in the northern gulf) with the largest three events approaching 5 on the Richter magnitude scale. A less pronounced swarm occurred in 1990 with the largest event reaching 4.3 in the central gulf near the Elat Deep and the Arogonese Deep. The last significant swarm happened in 1993 in the southwestern Arogonese Deep (in the southern gulf) with the highest magnitude of 6.1 and more than 300 larger than magnitude 3 in the following weeks.|$|E
