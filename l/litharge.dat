He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering <b>litharge</b> with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with <b>litharge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as <b>litharge,</b> which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by capillary action into the hearth linings.|$|E
25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the <b>litharge.</b> In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting <b>litharge</b> could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{demonstrates}} that Tepe Sialk {{was an important}} metal production center in central Iran during the Sialk III and Sialk IV periods. A significant amount of metallurgical remains were found during the excavations in the 1990s and later. This includes large amounts of slag pieces, <b>litharge</b> cakes, and crucibles and moulds.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{known to}} be {{potentially}} dangerous include Aconitum, secretions from the Asiatic toad, powdered centipede, the Chinese beetle (Mylabris phalerata), certain fungi, Aristolochia, Aconitum, Arsenic sulfide (Realgar), mercury sulfide, and cinnabar. Asbestos ore (Actinolite, Yang Qi Shi, 阳起石) is used to treat impotence in TCM. Due to galena's (<b>litharge,</b> lead(II) oxide) high lead content, it is {{known to be}} toxic. Lead, mercury, arsenic, copper, cadmium, and thallium have been detected in TCM products sold in the U.S. and China.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{introduced}} in 1911 concerning the smelting of materials containing lead and {{the manufacture of}} red or orange lead and flaked <b>litharge</b> prohibited the employment of women and young persons in these processes and ordered monthly medical examinations of all employees. The Factory Workshop (Cotton Cloth Factories) Act of 1911 provided the Secretary of State {{with the power to}} make regulations to improve conditions in cotton cloth factories in relation to ventilation and humidity, while The Labourers (Ireland) Act of 1911 applied the dormant portion of the Irish Suitors’ Fund to the purposes of the Labourer’s Cottages’ Fund, while bestowing authority upon the Irish Land Commission “to extend the limit of advances which may be made” for the provision of allotments and houses from £4.5million to £5.5million, while also providing further powers for the demolition of unhealthy cottages. The Public Health (Ireland) Act empowered Irish local authorities to set up regulations for the seizure of unsound meat and for inspecting slaughterhouses, while the Public Health (Scotland) Act of 1897 was amended in 1911, extending the powers of local authorities under the Public Health (Scotland) Act to any body of commissioners or trustees authorised to supply water.|$|E

2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead <b>litharge,</b> ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E
6000|$|Another {{interesting}} [...] "find" [...] was a flat-bottomed, thick-walled clay {{crucible of}} small size (2 10/16 inches high by 2 4/16 inches across the mouth), exactly resembling the article {{picked up at}} Hamámát. The latter, however, contains a remnant of <b>litharge,</b> possibly showing that the old Egyptians worked the silver, {{which may have been}} supplied by the Colorado quartz.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not ground" [...] (says De Mayerne), [...] "but a {{drying oil}} is {{prepared}} with <b>litharge,</b> and the pulverized asphaltum mixed with this oil {{is placed in}} a glass vessel, suspended by a thread [in a water bath]. Thus exposed to the fire it melts like butter; when it begins to boil it is instantly removed. It is an excellent color for shadows, and may be glazed like lake; it lasts well."--Ib. p. 463.|$|E
6000|$|... 798. In an {{experiment}} {{of this kind}} the equivalent for the lead came out 93.17, which is very much too small. This, I believe, {{was because of the}} small interval between the positive and negative electrodes in the oxide of lead; so that it was not unlikely that some of the froth and bubbles formed by the oxygen at the anode should occasionally even touch the lead reduced at the cathode, and re-oxidize it. When I endeavoured to correct this by having more <b>litharge,</b> the greater heat required to keep it all fluid caused a quicker action on the crucible, which was soon eaten through, and the experiment stopped.|$|E
60|$|Now, that 'tis {{nothing but}} the vitrify'd metal that sticks upon {{the surface of the}} colour'd body, is evident from this, that if by any means it be scraped and rubb'd off, the metal {{underneath}} it is white and clear; and if it be kept longer in the fire, so as to increase to a considerable thickness, it may, by blows, be beaten off in flakes. This is further confirm'd by this observable, that that Iron or Steel will keep longer from rusting which is covered with this vitrify'd case: Thus also Lead will, by degrees, be all turn'd into a litharge; for that colour which covers the top being scum'd or shov'd aside, appears to be nothing else but a <b>litharge</b> or vitrify'd Lead.|$|E
6000|$|The best ink for finger {{printing}} is not {{the best}} for ordinary printing. It is important to a commercial printer that his ink should dry rapidly on the paper, and he does not want a particularly thin layer of it; consequently, he prefers ink that contains various drying materials, such as <b>litharge,</b> which easily part with their oxygen. In finger prints this rapid drying is unnecessary, and the drying materials do harm by making the ink too stiff. The most serviceable ink for our purpose is made of any pure [...] "drying" [...] oil (or oil that oxidises rapidly), mixed with lampblack and very little else. I get mine in small collapsible tubes, each holding about a quarter of an ounce, from Messrs. Reeve & Sons, 113 Cheapside, London, W.C. Some thousands of fingers may be printed from the contents of one of these little tubes.|$|E
6000|$|... 473. This opinion has, I think, {{been shown}} by other {{philosophers}} {{not to be}} accurate, though I {{do not know where}} to refer for a contradiction of it. Sir Humphry Davy himself said in 1801[A], that dry nitre, caustic potash and soda are conductors of galvanism when rendered fluid by a high degree of heat, but he must have considered them, or the nitre at least, as not suffering decomposition, for the statements above were made by him eleven years subsequently. In 1826 he also pointed out, that bodies not containing water, as fused <b>litharge</b> and chlorate of potassa, were sufficient to form, with platina and zinc, powerful electromotive circles[B]; but he is here speaking of the production of electricity in the pile, and not of its effects when evolved; nor do his words at all imply that any correction of his former distinct statements relative to decomposition was required.|$|E
6000|$|... 476. The {{analogy of}} the decomposing or {{experimental}} cell {{to the other}} cells of the voltaic battery renders it nearly certain that any of those substances which are decomposable when fluid, as described in my last paper (402.), would, {{if they could be}} introduced between the metallic plates of the pile, be equally effectual with water, if not more so. Sir Humphry Davy found that <b>litharge</b> and chlorate of potassa were thus effectual[A]. I have constructed various voltaic arrangements, and found the above conclusion to hold good. When any of the following substances in a fused state were interposed between copper and platina, voltaic action more or less powerful was produced. Nitre; chlorate of potassa; carbonate of potassa; sulphate of soda; chloride of lead, of sodium, of bismuth, of calcium; iodide of lead; oxide of bismuth; oxide of lead: the electric current was {{in the same direction as}} if acids had acted upon the metals. When any of the same substances, or phosphate of soda, were made to act on platina and iron, still more powerful voltaic combinations of the same kind were produced. When either nitrate of silver or chloride of silver was the fluid substance interposed, there was voltaic action, but the electric current was in the reverse direction.|$|E
60|$|When he has melted these {{substances}} and stirred them well up, and so obtained a complete mixture, he throws in air upon {{the surface to}} burn off all the sulphur from the remaining sulphuret of lead; and at last he gets an ingot of lead with platinum--much lead, comparatively, and little platinum. He gets that in the crucible {{with a lot of}} scoriæ and other things, which he treats afterwards. It is that platiniferous lead which {{we have to deal with}} in our future process. Now, let me tell you what he does with it. His first object is to get rid of the lead. He has thrown out all the iron, and a number of other things, and he has got this kind of compound indicated in the table. He may get it as high as 78 per cent. of platinum, and 22 of lead; or 5, or 10, or 15 of platinum, and 95, or 90, or 85 of lead (which he calls weak platinum), and he then places it in the kind of vessel that you see before you. Suppose we had the mixture here; we should have to make it hot, and then throw in air upon the surface. The combustible metal--that is, the lead--and the part that will oxidise, are thoroughly oxidised; the <b>litharge</b> would flow out in a fused state into a vessel placed to receive it, and the platinum remains behind.|$|E
6000|$|We at once {{recognized}} {{the value of}} this discovery when, reaching the tents, we examined the quartz, and found it seamed and pitted with veins and geodes containing Colorado, earthy and crumbling metallic dust, chlorure, iodure, and bromure of silver, with various colours, red, ochre-yellow, and dark chocolate-brown. It stained the fingers, and was suspiciously light--n'importe. I must regret that here, as indeed throughout the exploration, all our specimens were taken from the surface: we had not time to dig even a couple of feet deep. The lad 'Id almost fainted with joy and surprise when the silver dollars were dropped into his hand, one by one, with the reiteration of [...] "Here's another for you! and here's another!" [...] This lavishness served to stimulate cupidity, and every day the Bedawin brought in specimens from half a dozen different places. But the satisfaction was at its height when the crucible produced, after cupellation, a button of [...] "silver" [...] weighing some twenty grammes from the hundred grammes of what the grumbling Californian miners had called, in their wrath, [...] "dashed black dust;"[EN#109] and when a second experiment yielded twenty-eight grammes (each fifteen grains and a half) and ten centigrammes from 111 grammes, or {{about a quarter of a}} pound avoirdupois. In the latter experiment also, the culot came away without the <b>litharge,</b> which almost always contains traces of silver and antimony. Hence we concluded that the proportions were 30:110--a magnificent result, considering that 12-1/2:100 is held to be rich ore in the silver mines of the Pacific States.[EN#110] The engineer was radieux with pride and joy. The yellow tint of the [...] "buttons" [...] promised gold--two per cent.? Three per cent.? Immense wealth lay before us: a ton of silver is worth 250,000 francs. Meanwhile--and now I take blame to myself--no one thought of testing the find, even by a blow with the hammer.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that Deville depends upon intense heat for {{carrying}} off vapour; and this {{brings me to the}} point of shewing how vapours are carried off. Here is a basin of mercury, which boils easily, as you know, and gives us the opportunity of observing the facts and principles which are to guide us. I have here two poles of the battery, and if I bring them into contact with the mercury, see what a development of vapour we have. The mercury is flying off rapidly; and I might, if I pleased, put all the company around me in a bath of mercury vapour. And so, if we take this piece of lead and treat it in the same way, it will also give off vapour. Observe the fumes that rise from it; and even if it was so far enclosed from the air that you could not form any <b>litharge,</b> you would still have those abundant fumes flying off. I may also take a piece of gold, and shew you the same thing. I have here a piece of gold which I put upon a clean surface of Paris limestone. Applying the heat of the blowpipe to it, you see how the heat drives off the vapour; and if you notice {{at the end of the}} Lecture, you will observe on the stone a purple patch of condensed gold. Thus you see a proof of the volatilisation of gold. It is the same with silver. You will not be startled if I sometimes use one agent and sometimes another to illustrate a particular point. The volatility of gold and silver is the same thing, whether it be effected by the voltaic battery or by the blowpipe. [A lump of silver was placed in a charcoal crucible between the poles of a voltaic battery.] Now, look at the fumes of silver, and observe the peculiar and beautiful green colour which they produce. We shall now shew you this same process of boiling the silver, cast on a screen from the electric lamp which you have before you; and while Dr. Tyndall is kindly getting the lamp ready for this purpose, let me tell you that Deville proposes to throw out in this way all these extraneous things that I have spoken of, except two--namely, iridium and rhodium. It so happens, as he says, that iridium and rhodium do make the metal more capable of resisting the attacks of acids than platinum itself. Alloys are compounded up to 25 per cent. of rhodium and iridium, by which the chemical inaction of the platinum is increased, and also its malleability and other physical properties. [The image of the voltaic discharge through vapour of silver was now thrown upon the screen.] What you have now on the screen is an inverted image of what you saw when we heated the silver before. The fine stream that you see around the silver is the discharge of the electric force that takes place, giving you that glorious green light which you see in the ray; and if Dr. Tyndall will open the top of the lamp, you will see the quantity of fumes that will come out of the aperture, shewing you at once the volatility of silver.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{the term}} [...] "litharge" [...] has been {{combined}} {{to refer to}} other similar substances.

50|$|To {{secure the}} prisms {{of the lens}} a {{compound}} of calcium carbonate, lead, and linseed oil, called <b>litharge,</b> was used.
