25|$|That the {{original}} {{creators of the}} movement were now passing the torch to another batch of bands and musicians was a historically enormous development: it would set Argentine rock apart.

50|$|Impressive {{view of the}} {{building}} {{is partly due to}} the site where it was built. The Pashkov House stands on a high Vagankovo hill, as though continuing the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> its <b>ascent,</b> on an open corner of two descending streets. The front facade faces the sunny side. The mansion was erected a bit skewed and not along the straight <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the street relative to the street and to the entrance from the Starovagankovsky Lane. Because of this, the Pashkov House is better perceived from sideways, farther angle viewpoints.|$|R
5000|$|The great Brenva face of Mont Blanc de Courmayeur and Mont Blanc had {{not been}} climbed between the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> Güssfeldt's <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> the Aiguille Blanche de Pétérey and the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> the Brenva route until Smythe and I {{had the good fortune}} to {{discover}} the 'Sentinel' route in 1927. He climbed the first of these routes, the Sentinelle Rouge, with Frank Smythe on 1-2 September 1927. Smythe also accompanied him on the first <b>ascent</b> <b>of</b> Route Major on 6-7 August 1928. According to Claire Engel, [...] "both expeditions were among the most notable of the century". The third route - the Pear Buttress - ascended the large rock buttress on the left of the face, and was made by Graham Brown, together with Alexander Graven and Alfred Aufdenblatten, on 5 August 1933.|$|R
60|$|But these, and {{hundreds}} of others which it is sin not to dwell upon--wooded hills and undulating moors of North England--rolling surges of park and forest of the South--soft and vine-clad ranges of French coteaux, casting their oblique shadows on silver leagues of glancing rivers,--and olive-whitened promontories of Alp and Apennine, are only instances of Turner's management of the lower and softer hills. In the bolder examples of his powers, where he is dealing with lifted masses of enormous mountain, we shall still find him as cautious in his use of violent slopes or vertical lines, and still as studied in his expression of retiring surface. We never {{get to the top}} of one of his hills without being tired with our walk; not by the steepness, observe, but by the stretch; for we are carried up towards the heaven by such delicate gradation <b>of</b> <b>line,</b> that we scarcely feel that we have left the earth before we find ourselves among the clouds. The Skiddaw, in the illustrations to Scott, is a noble instance of this majestic moderation. The mountain lies in the morning light, like a level vapor; its gentle <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>ascent</b> are scarcely felt by the eye; it rises without effort or exertion, by the mightiness of its mass; every slope is full of slumber; and we know not how it has been exalted, until we find it laid as a floor for the walking of the eastern clouds. So again in the Fort Augustus, where the whole elevation of the hills depends on the soft <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> swelling surface which undulate back through leagues of mist carrying us unawares higher and higher above the diminished lake, until, when we are all but exhausted with the endless distance, the mountains make their last spring, and bear us, in that instant of exertion, half way to heaven.|$|R
25|$|Loughrigg has two {{subsidiary}} ridges on {{its eastern}} flank.

Despite the girdle of lakes only Windermere is visible from the summit. The vista is open to the south over the green and blue country of Furness, with many fells in view on the other three sides.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{studies have}} sought to {{determine}} the precise relationships within {{this part of the}} evolutionary tree, with conflicting results regarding the question whether Styracosaurus albertensis, Rubeosaurus or Einiosaurus [...] might have been in the direct <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>ascent</b> to Achelousaurus. In 2005, an analysis by Michael Ryan and Anthony Russell found Styracosaurus more closely related to Achelousaurus than to Centrosaurus. This was confirmed by analyses by Ryan in 2007, Nicholas Longrich in 2010, and Xu et al. in 2010. But the same year Horner and Andrew T. McDonald moved Styracosaurus ovatus to its own genus, Rubeosaurus, finding it a sister species of Einiosaurus, while Styracosaurus albertensis was again located on the Centrosaurus branch. In 2011, a subsequent study by Andrew T. McDonald in this respect replicated the outcome of his previous one, as did a publication by Andre Farke et al. In 2017, J.P. Wilson and Ryan further complicated the issue, concluding that MOR492 ("Taxon A") was not referable to Rubeosaurus and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it.|$|E
60|$|A good {{carriage}} road followed the easiest <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>ascent</b> towards this edifice, and reached a gateway. Within {{it began to}} describe a curve bordered with asphalted footways to the broad verandah of the house, and then descended again to the gate. The grounds enclosed were planted with deciduous shrubs, which had now mostly dropped their leaves, and clumps of firs darkening in the evening light with the gleam of some garden statues shivering about the lawn next the house. The breeze grew colder and stiffer as {{the father and son}} mounted toward the mansion which Dan used to believe was like a chateau, with its Mansard-roof and dormer windows and chimneys. It now blocked its space sharply out of the thin pink of the western sky, and its lights sparkled with a wintry keenness which had often thrilled Dan when he climbed the hill from the station in former homecomings. Their brilliancy gave him a strange sinking of the heart for no reason. He and his father had kept up a sort of desultory talk about Alice, and he could not have said that his father had seemed indifferent; he had touched the affair only too acquiescently; it was painfully like everything else. When they came in full sight of the house, Dan left the subject, as he realised presently, from a reasonless fear of being overheard.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe author, who is Secretary of the Analog Section of the British Computer Society, {{describes}} {{the way in}} which some of the logic components of a parallel logic analog computer function, and goes on to discuss the use of such a computer in optimization problems, as for instance in finding the best estimates of the parameters on compartmentation analysis of isotopic tracer experiments. The increased power which is gained when an analog computer is coupled to (hybridized with) a general purpose digital computer is then discussed, as shown for example in the increased speed of random-search optimization techniques when an analog computer is used to integrate the differential equations, or the improvement in steepest ascent methods when the parallel logic can be used to keep the hill-climb path continuously on the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> steepest <b>ascent.</b> Finally, the use of a hybrid computer in solving partial differential equations is briefly outlined...|$|R
40|$|Chemotaxis during {{sinusoidal}} locomotion in nematodes captures in simplified {{form the}} general {{problem of how}} dynamical interactions between the nervous system, body, and environment are exploited in the generation of adaptive behavior. We used an evolutionary algorithm to generate neural networks that exhibit klinotaxis, a common form of chemotaxis in which the direction of locomotion in a chemical gradient closely follows the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> steepest <b>ascent.</b> Sensory inputs and motor outputs of the model networks were constrained to match the inputs and outputs of the C. elegans klinotaxis network. We found that a minimalistic neural network, comprised of an ON-OFF pair of chemosensory neurons {{and a pair of}} neck muscle motor neurons, is sufficient to generate realistic klinotaxis behavior. Importantly, emergent properties of model networks reproduced two key experimental observations that they were not designed to fit, suggesting that the model may be operating according to principles {{similar to those of the}} biological network. A dynamical systems analysis of 77 evolved networks revealed a novel neural mechanism for spatial orientation behavior. This mechanism provides a testable hypothesis that is likely to accelerate the discovery and analysis of the biological circuitry for chemotaxis in C. elegans...|$|R

6000|$|The {{island of}} Ug, upon which I had been marooned, {{lies in the}} Southern Hemisphere, but has neither {{latitude}} nor longitude. It has an area of nearly seven hundred square samtains and is peculiar in shape, its width being considerably greater than its length. Politically it is a limited monarchy, the right of succession to the throne being vested in the sovereign's father, if he have one; if not in his grandfather, and so on upward in the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>ascent.</b> (As {{a matter of fact}} there has not within historic times been a legitimate succession, even the great and good Jogogle-Zadester being a usurper chosen by popular vote.) To assist him in governing, the King is given a parliament, the Uggard word for which is gabagab, but its usefulness is greatly circumscribed by the Blubosh, or Constitution, which requires that every measure, in order to become a law, shall have an affirmative majority of the actual members, yet forbids any member to vote who has not a distinct pecuniary interest in the result. I was once greatly amused by a spirited contest over a matter of harbor improvement, each of two proposed harbors having its advocates. One of these gentlemen, a most eloquent patriot, held the floor for hours in advocacy of the port where he had an interest in a projected mill for making dead kittens into cauliflower pickles; while other members were being vigorously persuaded by one who at the other place had a clam ranch. In a debate in the Uggard gabagab no one can have a [...] "standing" [...] except a party in interest; and as a consequence of this enlightened policy every bill that is passed is found to be most intelligently adapted to its purpose.|$|E
6000|$|Cuddie Headrigg, who had {{advanced}} among the marksmen, being {{well acquainted with}} every rock and bush {{in the vicinity of}} the Castle, where he had so often gathered nuts with Jenny Dennison, was enabled, by such local knowledge, to advance farther, and with less danger, than most of his companions, excepting some three or four who had followed him close. Now Cuddie, though a brave enough fellow upon the whole, was by no means fond of danger, either for its own sake, or for that of the glory which attends it. In his advance, therefore, he had not, as the phrase goes, taken the bull by the horns, or advanced in front of the enemy's fire. On the contrary, he had edged gradually away from the scene of action, and, turning his <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>ascent</b> rather to the left, had pursued it until it brought him under a front of the Castle different from that before which the parties were engaged, and to which the defenders had given no attention, trusting to the steepness of the precipice. There was, however, on this point, a certain window belonging to a certain pantry, and communicating with a certain yew-tree, which grew out of a steep cleft of the rock, being the very pass through which Goose Gibbie was smuggled out of the Castle in order to carry Edith's express to Charnwood, and which had probably, in its day, been used for other contraband purposes. Cuddie, resting upon the but of his gun, and looking up at this window, observed to one of his companions,--"There's a place I ken weel; mony a time I hae helped Jenny Dennison out o' the winnock, forby creeping in whiles mysell to get some daffin, at e'en after the pleugh was loosed." ...|$|E
