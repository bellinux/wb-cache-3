5|$|On January 25, 2011, Stelmach {{announced}} that he would not seek re-election; he also promised a leadership race before the next election. He did not specify his date of resignation at that time, however he submitted his letter of resignation in June, writing that he would <b>leave</b> <b>office</b> on October 1. In the early hours of October 2, 2011, Alison Redford was declared the new leader of the party, and Stelmach resigned as premier on October 7.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower would <b>leave</b> <b>office</b> with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} did not {{execute the}} order and incumbent director Devi Singh who completed his six months of extension period, on September 8 did not <b>leave</b> <b>office</b> even after receiving the letter. As a result, there was confusion at IIM-L campus for almost a week. The allegations against Devi Singh, who served two term as director of IIM-L, ranges from nepotism to mismanagement of accounts. The Central Vigilance Commission also asked the HRD ministry to 're investigate' allegations of corruption against Devi Singh.|$|E

5|$|On occasion, a {{judge will}} <b>leave</b> <b>office</b> {{at the end}} of a term, in which case a general {{election}} determines their replacement. If the Supreme Court needs an additional judge on a temporary basis due to illness, an unfilled position, or a justice is disqualified from sitting on a case due to a conflict of interest, the court can appoint a senior judge to serve as a judge pro tempore. Senior judges are all former, qualified judges (a minimum of 12 years on the bench) that have retired from a state court. Only former Supreme Court justices, elected Oregon circuit court judges, or elected Oregon Court of Appeals judges can be assigned to temporary service on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|As Hayes {{prepared}} to <b>leave</b> <b>office,</b> several delegations of reform-minded Republicans {{urged him to}} run against the incumbent Republican, John Sherman, for United States Senate. Hayes declined the offers, preferring to preserve party unity and retire to private life. Hayes especially looked forward to spending time with his children, two of whom (daughter Fanny and son Scott) {{had been born in}} the past five years. Initially, Hayes tried to promote railway extensions to his hometown, Fremont. He also managed some real estate he had acquired in Duluth, Minnesota. Not entirely removed from politics, Hayes held out some hope of a cabinet appointment, but was disappointed to receive only an appointment as assistant U.S. treasurer at Cincinnati, which he turned down. He agreed to be nominated for his old House seat in 1872 but was not disappointed when he lost the election to Henry B. Banning, a fellow Kenyon College alumnus. In 1873, Lucy gave birth to another son, Manning Force Hayes. That same year, the Panic of 1873 hurt business prospects across the nation, including Hayes's. Sardis Birchard died that year and the Hayes family moved into Spiegel Grove, the grand house Birchard had built with them in mind.|$|E
5|$|In the {{lame-duck session}} of 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in the new Congress the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to <b>leave</b> <b>office,</b> signed the bill into law.|$|E
