5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the cheese is a traditional <b>local</b> <b>product</b> made by traditional methods.|$|E
25|$|Iron ores were a <b>local</b> <b>product</b> of the Valley of Oaxaca. Because San José Mogote was {{the central}} area of trade in this region, it {{utilized}} its rich resource of iron ore to manufacture polished stone mirrors, {{many of which have}} been found as far as the Olmec Gulf Coast Heartland.|$|E
25|$|The grave also {{contained}} {{an assemblage of}} imported objects from Italy and the Greek world, all of them associated with the preparation of wine. They included the famous krater (see below), a silver phiale (shallow bowl, sometimes seen as a <b>local</b> <b>product),</b> an Etruscan bronze oinochoe (wine jug), and several drinking cups from Etruria and Attica. One of the latter was dated as c. 525 BC and represents the latest firmly dated find in the grave. It thus provides the best evidence, a terminus post quem for its date. The vessels probably were placed on wooden tables or benches that did not survive.|$|E

25|$|Cotton {{forms the}} {{foundation}} of warps and wefts {{of the majority of}} modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a <b>local</b> <b>product.</b> Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for {{the foundation of}} a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet. Chemically treated (mercerised) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|<b>Local</b> <b>product</b> Doug Flutie (from Natick, Massachusetts), {{who won the}} Heisman Trophy for Boston College in 1984, was {{acquired}} by the Patriots during the 1987 players' strike and crossed the picket line to play his first game for the Patriots, which was also the last of three games played by replacement players in the 1987 season. Many defensive players for New England also crossed the picket line. However, late-season injuries put the Patriots out of playoff contention at 8–7. In 1988, Flutie played five games before he was replaced by Eason, after which they would alternate as the Patriots' starting quarterback. Though the Patriots had some success with this atypical arrangement, finishing the season 9–7, the Patriots narrowly missed the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Since the team's inception, {{the same}} colour {{combination}} for home shirts {{have been used}} each year. The colour scheme of orange shirts, shorts and socks was selected to reflect the famous <b>local</b> <b>product</b> of Shizuoka Prefecture; the mikan. The current bright orange hue, named S-Pulse Orange by the club, {{is the result of}} a gentle evolution from a more yellow/orange shade during the team's early years. At the advent of the J. League, S-Pulse were the only top division club in the country to wear orange, a distinction which is now shared with other top flight mainstays, such as Albirex Niigata and Omiya Ardija. There is currently no third kit. Goalkeeping colours have changed more over the seasons, with the current first choice kit all black, and all green being the second choice.|$|E

25|$|While US and British {{television}} is popular in Australia, locally produced content has had many successes. Successful <b>local</b> <b>product</b> has included Homicide and Division 4 {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo in the late 1960s, Number 96 and The Box in the 1970s, Prisoner in the 1980s and A Country Practice (1981–1993), Neighbours and Home and Away in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of the shows from the mid-1980s onwards have been exported and have sometimes been even more successful abroad, such as Steve Irwin's The Crocodile Hunter. Popular stars of Australian TV have included: the pioneer variety show hosts Graham Kennedy, Bert Newton, Don Lane and Daryl Somers, and contemporary talk show hosts Andrew Denton and Rove McManus. Popular international exports include Dame Edna Everage, Clive James, Geoffrey Robertson and The Wiggles.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Nicholas Mahrt [...] then-assistant coach for Washington University in St. Louis [...] coached in the St. Louis Metro League. His {{participation}} with that particular collegiate baseball organization left him dissatisfied with the <b>local</b> <b>product</b> that was being offered. Mahrt noticed the Metro League model lacked an opportunity for college players to pursue both aspects of their college experience. [...] Due to a schedule that was loaded with games on weekdays and weekends, student-athletes were ultimately {{forced to choose between}} baseball and a summer job/internship. By playing in most summer leagues, young adults forgo a chance to enhance their post-collegiate careers. Declining an invitation, in order to gain career knowledge and collect a summer paycheck, means college players forgo sharpening their baseball skills.|$|E

2500|$|Critic Mihai Zamfir, who {{notes that}} Dobrogeanu-Gherea was by then {{blending}} his Marxism into a [...] "more autochthonous" [...] perspective on politics, also argues that him {{and his colleagues at}} Contemporanul review were by then becoming aware that Romanian socialist literature was failing their expectations. In his assessment, the <b>local</b> <b>product</b> of Marxist guidelines was [...] "sub-mediocre", the theorist himself being [...] "perfectly aware" [...] of such inadequacies. Zamfir concludes that [...] "the more and more vociferous nationalists around Sămănătorul" [...] were one of the factors to replace [...] "socially-themed" [...] currents, and that their success prompted Dobrogeanu-Gherea to part with literature. Likewise, Râpeanu notes that, contrary to the Marxist leader's expectations, Contemporanul and its 1890s satellite Literatură și Știință had not [...] "managed to set up a current", and that they compensated by publishing traditional authors such as Vlahuță.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 {{campaign}} led to no roster changes. [...] However, Sanna Nyassi and Tyrone Marshall {{were signed}} from Seattle Sounders FC.

The Guadeloupe International can play at either Left or Right back. On September 13, Comminges made his debut for Colorado as a substitute in a 4–1 home loss to Club Santos Laguna in the CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E
