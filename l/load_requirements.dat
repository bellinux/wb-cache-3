5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. In light of this cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and <b>load</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{non-traditional}} material deformation {{method is}} introduced {{as an alternative}} approach {{to the production of}} parts of complex geometries. The deformation mechanism, which relies on selectively increased metal flow in locally heated regions, gives advantages to part strength and fatigue properties. Compared to closed-die forging, the reduction of heating and <b>loading</b> <b>requirements</b> has a positive effect on tool life, tool design and <b>loading</b> <b>requirements.</b> Furthermore, the method can be applied to near-net-shape production in an open-die forging environment, thus reducing the cost of the production forming dies. The work presented in this paper examines the effects of heating duration, compressed profile, and the number of forming steps on the mode of deformation. A simulation model of the differential heating forming process has been characterised, and a finite element analysis was performed using various operational parameters. Additionally, the modes of metal flow in bi-metallic hollow parts were examined both experimentally and by numerical simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R
