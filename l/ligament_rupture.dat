40|$|Background Despite interventions, {{anterior}} cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>ruptures</b> can cause long-term deficits. To assist in identifying and treating deficiencies, 3 D-motion analysis {{is used for}} objectivizing data. Conventional statistics are commonly employed to analyze kinematics, reducing continuous data series to discrete variables. Conversely, functional data analysis considers the entire data series. Methods Here, we employ functional data analysis to examine and compare the entire time-domain of knee-kinematic curves from one-leg hops between and within three groups. All subjects (n = 95) {{were part of a}} long-term follow-up study involving {{anterior cruciate}} <b>ligament</b> <b>ruptures</b> treated 20 years ago conservatively with physiotherapy only or with reconstructive surgery and physiotherapy, and matched knee-healthy controls. Findings Between-group differences (injured leg, treated groups; non-dominant leg, controls) were identified during the take-off and landing phases, and in the sagittal (flexion/extension) rather than coronal (abduction/adduction) and transverse (internal/external) planes. Overall, surgical and control groups demonstrated comparable knee-kinematic curves. However, compared to controls, the physiotherapy-only group exhibited less flexion during the take-off (0 – 55...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{association}} of the BstUI RFLP C/T (rs 12722) and DpnII RFLP C/T (rs 13946) COL 5 A 1 polymorphisms, individually and as haplotypes, with anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>ruptures</b> in recreational skiers. Subjects were 138 male recreational skiers with surgically diagnosed primary anterior cruciate <b>ligament</b> <b>ruptures.</b> The control group consisted of 183 apparently healthy male recreational skiers, who were without any self-reported history of ligament or tendon injury. DNA was extracted from buccal cells donated by the subjects and genotyping was carried out using real-time PCR. The genotype distributions for both polymorphisms met Hardy- Weinberg expectations in both groups. There were no significant differences in genotype distribution of allele frequencies of COL 5 A 1 BstUI RFLP C/T and COL 5 A 1 DpnII RFLP C/T polymorphisms between the ACL rupture and control groups. The T-T (BstUI RFLP T, DpnII RFLP T) haplotype was the most common (55. 6 %). The haplotype T-C was not present in any of the subjects. There was an underrepresentation tendency of the C-T haplotype in the study group compared to controls under recessive mode of inheritance. Higher frequency of the COL 5 A 1 BstUI RFLP C/T and COL 5 A 1 DpnII RFLP C/T polymorphisms haplotype is associated with reduced risk of anterior cruciate ligament injury in a group of apparently healthy male recreational skiers...|$|R
