40|$|Many {{countries}} have provided online {{access to some}} types of legislative documents by subject, keywords or date. Nevertheless, the possibility of querying historical versions of the documents is usually an uncommon feature. The dispersion of laws and other legislative documents and their continuous changes make difficult the generation and querying of valid legislative information at a given date. Furthermore, the ripple effect of modifications such as updates, insertions or derogations affecting the entire body of a law or {{part of it is}} not always visible for the citizens who are looking for legislative information. Some issues related to change management of legislative documents can be identified: how to apply the history of changes to a version of a legislative document to obtain a new version, and what type of data model might be better to satisfy temporal queries, to store new versions of documents or to obtain them dynamically. The access to all versions of a document and its fragments is important in legislative queries to be sure which law was in force to apply when a case happened. Law documents are produced and stored in information systems with different data models to access and retrieve information about them in a large-scale manner, but most of them do not have law change management functions. Web standards, such as XML, XSLT and RDF, facilitate the separation between content, presentation and metadata, thus contributing to a better annotation and exploitation of information from these documents and their fragments to improve the historical queries and the version generation of legislative documents. This paper presents a proposal of a data model for storage and retrieval of different versions of legislative documents using Linked Data, a method of publishing structured interlinked data, for managing relations between legislative documents and its changes. Document structures, changes to legislation, metadata, requirements of historical queries are analyzed in this work. Furthermore, the proposed model facilitates historical querying of <b>legislative</b> documents and <b>consolidation</b> procedures, allowing update relationships between documents and fragments without changes on the original documents. The model has been tested with Ecuadorian laws, but it could be used for law systems of other countries because the model is independent of the legislative framework.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Agriculture {{has always}} been a very {{volatile}} industry, mainly due to fluctuating commodity prices (specifically white maize) and irregular rainfall patterns. Furthermore, the agricultural industry is confronted with finite resources of which limited arable land and water scarcity are among the most troubling. Many agribusinesses in the industry have also achieved a level of maturity as far as market share is concerned, leaving little room for further growth. On the other hand, most of these agri-businesses are organisations with shareholders and investors demanding acceptable and sustainable returns on their investments. This situation invariably creates challenges relating to growth, profitability and sustainability. One of the few ways of addressing this problem is for stakeholders in the industry to combine their resources, capabilities and efforts through consolidation strategies, like acquisitions, mergers and strategic alliances, among others. This includes an extended presence and involvement throughout the value chain by means of forward and backward integration. The aim of such consolidation activity is to improve the long-term sustainability of agri-businesses and the agricultural industry as a whole. Agriculture is extremely important in terms of its contribution to the national economy, employment and job creation, earning foreign exchange through exports and improving food security and safety as well as the affordability of and access to food. Agri-businesses fulfil the functions of handlers, processors and marketers of agricultural produce, suppliers of production inputs and services including mechanisation solutions and support as well as being financiers of farmers and farming activities. However, there are too many role players and intermediaries involved in the agricultural industry which only aggravates the problem of limited growth potential within the industry. This study focuses on one of the leading agribusinesses in the industry {{while at the same time}} aiming to obtain the opinions of other industry stakeholders regarding the desirability of such consolidation strategies, the nature and extent thereof and the probability of successfully executing such strategies within the industry. Qualitative empirical research was performed by using a semi-structured interview schedule and conducting personal or telephonic interviews with a selection of executives, directors and other senior managers of several agri-businesses, regulators and controlling bodies associated with the South African agricultural industry. The themes covered included growth and sustainability, strategic leadership, consolidation as strategy, the different consolidation approaches, consolidation methods to be used, motives for <b>consolidation,</b> possible <b>legislative</b> restrictions on <b>consolidation,</b> the steps in the consolidation process and the preferred business approach to execute a consolidation strategy. The results of the empirical study indicated that consolidation does support growth and sustainability and that sound strategic leadership is of strategic importance to agri-businesses. The majority of participants confirmed that consolidation does form part of their current strategies and agreed that a combination of the three different consolidation approaches will be most effective in the execution of a consolidation strategy. Of the different consolidation methods, strategic alliances was the most preferred method as well as being selected as the method most likely to successfully achieve industry consolidation. Value creation was the overwhelming choice as being the primary motive for consolidation and was also selected as the motive with the highest probability of achieving success in consolidating the agricultural industry. The restrictive nature of the South African Competition Act (89 of 1998) and the competition authorities was highlighted by the responses obtained from the interviewees. Even though the negotiation phase was described as the most important step in the consolidation process, the results showed that is critically important to accommodate all the different steps in the process to ensure the success of the entire consolidation project. Finally, there was no clear preference regarding the business approach to apply in executing a consolidation strategy, being either a focuses business approach or an integrated business philosophy. The recommendations contained suggestions to increase consolidation activity among stakeholders in the industry and to develop and establish sufficient consolidation skills and capacity to aggressively pursue a consolidation strategy. It was also suggested that agri-businesses should reverse previous decisions to limit shareholding within these organisations. Any consolidation approach and consolidation method which is based on willing and amicable participation of the parties involved, benefits these stakeholders and the industry. These transactions must hold some benefit or value for those parties involved as well as other stakeholders in the industry. The principle of embracing the competition authorities and the requirements of the South African Competition Act (89 of 1998) as part of the consolidation process was strongly advocated. Ultimately, the business approach which best supports the organisation’s strategy is the obvious choice, but the reality is that it might include characteristics of both an integrated and a focussed approach.

40|$|Legal {{personality}} of general court judges - {{the ability of}} individuals to the legislation to acquire {{the legal status of}} a judge of the court of general jurisdiction, that speak carrier of subjective rights and legal responsibilities of professional judges. Legal {{personality of}} general court system is determined by the required qualifications of the candidate as a judge imposed the Laws of Ukraine "On the Judicial System and Status of Judges" 1 and other legal acts. Constitutional law is no consensus about the nature and content of the personality. Some researchers in their research identified this phenomenon of legal capacity since, in their view, to distinguish between these concepts no theoretical or practical reason. In my opinion, the legal position concerning the identification and the relationship is correct. Relationships are "a special form of social interaction, whose participants have mutual, postal rights and responsibilities and implement them to meet their needs and interests [...] . " The legal specifics of this concept, among other features, such different circumstances, participants may be legal Only entities, ie entities endowed with certain personality; They are characterized by a specific relationship of the parties in the form of mutual rights and obligations. The structure of the concept are the subjects (natural and legal persons), objects (tangible and intangible assets) and content that is on one side (in the material sense), let the behavior of the obliged person on the other (as legal aspects) - subjective rights and legal responsibilities. Thus, we can define personality as a kind of relationship where one party serving individual properties are given legal value, and another - the state, which through consolidation in the legislation recognizes these as legally significant. But such a relationship is not a legal relationship in their own sense. Legal personality, resulting <b>legislative</b> <b>consolidation</b> of certain properties of the individual quality characterizes only one side.
