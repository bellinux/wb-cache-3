5|$|The Uniate Church, {{created for}} the Ruthenian {{population}} of the Commonwealth, in its administrative dealings gradually switched to the Polish <b>language</b> <b>use.</b> From about 1650, {{the majority of the}} Church's archival documents generated were in the Polish, rather than in the otherwise used Ruthenian (its Chancery Slavonic variety), language.|$|E
5|$|Because {{norms for}} <b>language</b> <b>use</b> {{are shared by}} members of a {{specific}} group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of differences {{are not part of the}} linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their <b>language</b> <b>use,</b> even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations quickly if possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E

5|$|Langdon Brown Gilkey {{explained}} religious {{language and}} experience in terms of symbolism, identifying three characteristic features of religious symbolism which distinguish it from other <b>language</b> <b>use.</b> Firstly, religious symbolism has a double focus, referring both to something empirical and to something transcendent; Gilkey argued that the empirical manifestation points towards the transcendent being. Secondly, he believed that religious symbolism concerns fundamental questions of life, involving issues important to an individual or community. Finally, he argued that religious symbols provide standards by which life should be lived.|$|E
5|$|Because {{language}} {{emerged in}} the early prehistory of man, before the existence of any written records, its early development has left no historical traces, and {{it is believed that}} no comparable processes can be observed today. Theories that stress continuity often look at animals to see if, for example, primates display any traits that can be seen as analogous to what pre-human language must have been like. And early human fossils can be inspected for traces of physical adaptation to <b>language</b> <b>use</b> or pre-linguistic forms of symbolic behaviour. Among the signs in human fossils that may suggest linguistic abilities are: the size of the brain relative to body mass, the presence of a larynx capable of advanced sound production and the nature of tools and other manufactured artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of <b>language</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
30|$|Additionally, the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> in many forums can be {{problematic}} in its technicalities. One {{of the older}} users {{in one of our}} studies wrote: ‘I find online help useless as it’s written in American/technical <b>language</b> which, though <b>using</b> English words, makes no sense whatsoever’. There can be a considerable mismatch between the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> {{as a matter of course}} within an open source forum, and the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> by those seeking assistance.|$|R
50|$|Sri Lankan {{literature}} is the literary tradition of Sri Lanka.

However, the <b>languages</b> <b>used</b> in ancient times were much different than the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> in Sri Lanka now.|$|R
50|$|Turkish Sign Language (Türk İşaret Dili, TİD) is the <b>language</b> <b>used</b> by {{the deaf}} {{community}} in Turkey. As with other sign languages, TİD {{has a unique}} grammar {{that is different from}} the oral <b>languages</b> <b>used</b> in the region.|$|R
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of <b>language</b> <b>use</b> can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E

25|$|The major benefit, however, {{is related}} to {{language}} exposure. As pointed out by Tokuhama-Espinosa, language opens the doors to new realms including that of new cultures.

25|$|Clearly, Wittgenstein did {{not want}} to be a behaviorist, nor did he want to be a cognitivist or a phenomenologist. He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned with facts of linguistic usage.

Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the Investigations.|$|E
