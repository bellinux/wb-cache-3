40|$|Among many {{techniques}} used for increasing fuel efficiency {{of a modern}} Gasoline Direct-Injected (GDI) engine are boosting and stratified operation. In modern downsized GDI engines, boosting is standard {{in order to achieve}} a high power output. Boosted GDI-engines have however mostly been operated in homogenous mode and little is known on the effects <b>of</b> operating a <b>boosted</b> GDI-engine in stratified mode. This paper presents the influence on combustion, standard emissions and particulate size distribution in a Spray-Guided, Gasoline, Direct-Injected (SGDI), single cylinder, research engine operated with various <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>boost.</b> The engine was operated in steady state mode at five engine operating points of various load and speed. The engine was boosted with a Roots blower and operated at four <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> as well as atmospheric pressure for comparison. The engine was fueled with market gasoline (95 RON) blended with 10 % ethanol. The gas motion induced by the engine head was primarily tumble motion but a small amount of swirl. The spark plug and injector was mounted in parallel with the intake valves. Results indicate that exhaust temperature and NOx emissions decrease with increasing boost. Hydrocarbon emissions increase with increasing boost. The results on particulate emissions indicate that nucleation mode particulates increase with increasing boost. The opposite trend was observed for agglomeration mode particulates which decreased with increasing boost pressure...|$|R

50|$|Control for the {{solenoids}} and {{stepper motors}} {{can be either}} closed loop or open loop. Closed loop systems rely on feedback from a manifold pressure sensor to meet a predetermined boost pressure. Open loop systems have a predetermined control output where control output is merely based on other inputs such as throttle angle and/or engine RPM. Open loop specifically leaves out a desired boost level, while closed loop attempts to target a specific <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> pressure. Since open loop systems do not modify control levels based on MAP sensor, differing boost pressure levels may be reached based on outside variables such as weather conditions or engine coolant temperature.

50|$|The {{design of}} {{gasoline}} engines and the compression ratio impact the maximum possible boost. To obtain more power from higher boost levels and maintain reliability, many engine components {{have to be}} replaced or upgraded from that of naturally aspirated powertrains. Design considerations include the fuel pump, fuel injectors, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, valves, head-gasket, and head bolts. The maximum possible boost depends on the fuel's octane rating and the inherent tendency of any particular engine toward detonation. Premium gasoline or racing gasoline can be used to prevent detonation within reasonable limits. Ethanol, methanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) allow higher boost than gasoline, because of their higher resistance to autoignition (lower tendency to knock). Diesel engines can also tolerate much higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> pressure than Otto cycle engines, because only air is being compressed during the compression phase, and fuel is injected later, removing the knocking issue entirely.|$|R

40|$|In {{regulated}} two-stage sequential turbocharging systems, a smaller, {{high pressure}} (HP), and a larger, low pressure (LP), turbocharger are sequentially positioned {{to recover the}} energy available in the exhaust gases and deliver acceptable <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> to the intake of an internal combustion engine. Due to the different sizes of the turbochargers, by-pass valves are placed in the system to control operations. Due to the turbocharging system layout, {{it is clear that}} the air pressurized by the LP compressor enters nonuniformly the HP compressor. This is caused by the rotating radial compressor and the interconnecting bends which cause swirl and velocity to scatter, respectively. Furthermore, the heat transfer in the two turbochargers may have an effect on the apparent efficiencies. For these reasons, the standard mapping approach for turbochargers is not able to take into account the effect of non-uniform flow and heat transfer. In this paper, a novel approach for mapping the two-stage turbocharging system is proposed and performed into a monodimensional simulation code. Although, flow non-uniformity and turbochargers heat transfer effects on the performance of the turbocharging system are not considered, at this present time, the study centralizes on the investigation and the validation of the mapping approach. In fact, a two-stage sequential turbocharging system has been considered for the study and a simulation code to investigate the mapping technique has been implemented...|$|E

The goal of the paper is to optimize the control parameters of a 4. 2 dm 3 unit displacement marine DI Diesel engine, in order to enhance the efficiency of the combustion system and reduce engine out emissions. The investigation is carried out by means of experimental tests and CFD simulations. For a better control of the testing conditions, the experimental activity is performed on a single cylinder prototype, while the engine test bench is specifically designed to simulate different <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>boosting.</b> The numerical investigations are carried out using a set of different CFD tools: GT-Power for the engine cycle analysis, STAR-CD {{for the study of the}} in-cylinder flow, and a customized version of the KIVA- 3 V code for combustion. All the models are calibrated through the above mentioned experimental campaign. Then, CFD simulations are applied to optimize the injection parameters and to explore the potential of the Miller combustion concept. It is found that the reduction of the charge temperature, ensuing the adoption of an early intake valve closing strategy, strongly affects combustion. With a proper valve actuation strategy, an increase <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> pressure and an optimized injection advance, a 40 % reduction of NOx emissions can be obtained, along with a significant reduction of in-cylinder peak pressure, without penalizing fuel efficiency...|$|R

Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) and dual phase LV technologies have been introduced for rural areas supply. Savings have also been made by the selection of appropriate design loads on which to base the network design. In addition to load and household density, overall cost per connection is also affected by the extent of voltage regulation allowed for in feeder design and operation.

40|$|Among many {{technical}} innovations {{and improvements}} in power train technologies, engine downsizing (reduction in displacement volume and/or the number of cylinders) {{is one of the}} most effective methods to reduce fuel consumption. Engine downsizing is achieved by running with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pressure <b>boosting</b> at full load using a supercharger or turbocharger. In order to downsize Diesel engines that are typically turbocharged, it is necessary to raise the boost level well above the capability <b>of</b> the single-stage <b>boosting</b> system. However, when the displacement of the engine is reduced substantially, its dependence on boosting system increases and it needs high boost pressure to produce enough torque for acceleration. Although very effective, some characteristics of the turbocharged engines remain unsatisfactory and matching a turbocharger to an engine to achieve efficient turbocharger operation over a wide range of engine speed is a difficult and often compromising process. This study presents a simulation-based methodology for dual-stage turbocharger matching, through an iterative procedure predicting optimal configurations of compressors and turbines for given operating conditions. Different types <b>of</b> <b>boost</b> control schemes for the dual-stage turbocharging system are evaluated for performance and fuel economy benefits. In order to further enhance the low end torque and transient characteristics of the downsized engine, hybrid dual-stage boosting systems are also investigated. The hybrid dual-stage boosting systems incorporate different types <b>of</b> <b>boosting</b> devices, such as a mechanically driven supercharger, an electrically driven supercharger, and a variable geometry turbine, into a dual-stage system with only turbochargers on both stages. The simulation results suggest that the hybridization <b>of</b> the <b>boosting</b> system results in fewer compromises in the boosting system matching resulting in substantial reduction in fuel consumption without too much compromise in performance. In addition, the assessment of the different types <b>of</b> dual-stage <b>boosting</b> systems presented in the study and the methodology used in the process provide valuable means to evaluate and develop a new boosting system that requires excellent low end torque and transient boosting characteristics as well as the fuel economy benefit from the downsized engine...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{into the}} impact of {{vaccination}} against the varicella zoster virus (VZV) have increasingly focused on herpes zoster (HZ), which {{is believed to be}} increasing in vaccinated populations with decreasing infection pressure. This idea {{can be traced back to}} Hope-Simpson's hypothesis, in which a person's immune status determines the likelihood that he/she will develop HZ. Immunity decreases over time, and can be boosted by contact with a person experiencing varicella (exogenous boosting) or by a reactivation attempt of the virus (endogenous boosting). Here we use transmission models to estimate age-specific rates of reactivation and immune boosting, exogenous as well as endogenous, using zoster incidence data from the Netherlands (2002 – 2011, n =  7026). The boosting and reactivation rates are estimated with splines, enabling these quantities to be optimally informed by the data. The analyses show that models with high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exogenous <b>boosting</b> and estimated or zero endogenous <b>boosting,</b> constant rate <b>of</b> loss of immunity, and reactivation rate increasing with age (to more than 5 % per year in the elderly) give the best fit to the data. Estimates of the rates <b>of</b> immune <b>boosting</b> and reactivation are strongly correlated. This has important implications as these parameters determine the fraction of the population with waned immunity.

40|$|Background: Traffic {{congestion}} is nowadays {{probably one}} of the greatest problems of urban transportation systems and infrastructure. Unfortunately, it frequently happens that road work investments connected with the construction of new and re-construction of old road networks, contrary to original intentions, fails to improve urban transportation or even deteriorate it significantly. 	Methods: The article presents an analysis of some methods of easing urban traffic congestion. Instrumental methods such as city center parking tolls usually do not bring about sit uation improvement. Introducing a faster and relatively comfortable public transportation competitive with commuting by cars is more efficient. 	Results and conclusions: The results of the research also reveal that the frequently applied method of road broadening does not lead to increasing their capacity as it fuels the preference for using private cars, instead of means of mass transportation.
