50|$|E.amylovara {{typically}} {{makes its}} entry into its host xylem or cortical paranchyma. It can also enter through stomata, <b>lenticles</b> and hydathodes.

50|$|The granulites {{are very}} closely allied to the gneisses, as they consist of {{nearly the same}} minerals, but they are finer-grained, have usually less perfect foliation, are more {{frequently}} garnetiferous, and have some special features of microscopic structure. In the rocks of this group the minerals, as seen in a microscopic slide, occur as small rounded grains forming a closely fitted mosaic. The individual crystals never have perfect form, and indeed traces of it are rare. In some granulites they interlock, with irregular borders; in others they have been drawn out and flattened into tapering <b>lenticles</b> by crushing. In most cases they are somewhat rounded with smaller grains between the larger. This {{is especially true of}} the quartz and feldspar which are the predominant minerals; mica always appears as flat scales (irregular or rounded but not hexagonal). Both muscovite and biotite may be present and vary considerably in abundance; very commonly they have their flat sides parallel and give the rock arudimentary schistosity, and they may be aggregated into bands in which case the granulites are indistinguishable from certain varieties of gneiss. The garnets are very generally larger than the above-mentioned ingredients, and easily visible with the eye as pink spots on the broken surfaces of the rock. They usually are filled with enclosed grains of the other minerals.|$|R
40|$|Massive calcium {{carbonate}} mud mounds are present within the St. Joe Limestone (Lower Mis-sissippian) of southwestern Missouri and northwestern Arkansas. These <b>lenticles</b> {{are up to}} 30 feet thick and 300 feet long. Thln-bedded crinoldal imestones enclose the bioherms. The enclosing lime-stones onlap the bioherms and by successive overlap extend over the mounds. Point-count analyses of thin sections from nine localities were made. The bioherms consist mainly of calcite-mudstone (about 80 percent) with {{only a small percentage}} (approximately 13 percent) of skeletal remains and 5 per-cent sparry calcite. Fenestrate bryozoans are the most abundant skeletal constituents, making up about 8 percent of the rock. Echinoderm fragments comprise only 2 percent of the mounds. Other known skeletal components are present in a total amount generally less than. 3 percent. The interbiohermal beds contain 47 percent skeletal grains including 13 percent fenestrate bryozoans and 25 percent echinoderm remains, 51 percent calcite mud and about 1 percent sparry calcite. The most acceptable hypotheses for the origin of the bioherms are: (1) the interaction of physical environmental f ctors and bathymetry; (2) the sedlment-trapping and-stabilizing activities of fenestrate bryozoans, and; (3) the sediment-trapping and-stabilizing activities of plants, not preserved. Although none of the three hypotheses can be completely rejected, it is possible that fenestrate bryozoans alone may have caused the growth and accumulation of these Missouri bloherms. It is also possible that the bryo-zoans were at least assisted by plants of which there are no preserved remains...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} the {{processes}} which occur {{and the consequences of}} sub-zero temperatures on those soil parameters important for a landfill liner. The main points are: a) examination of the published investigations and theories, b) determination by in-situ and laboratory experiments of material property changes, c) determination of the temperature action in situ and in laboratory test and the main parameters, d) possible thermal protection. In general a structure will be formed in the material which is characteristic for the matrix of the material and the main influencing parameters. The results of this are a rising moisture content in the frozen zone (in the case of cryosuction), a lower dry density (loosening by ice <b>lenticles)</b> and, normally, a lower shear strength. The permeability measured in a triaxial cell with thawed material rises about half an order of magnitude, in extreme cases about one order of magnitude. In general the changes are partly reversible by loading but the structure created by the frost will remain. Over two winters under normal to light conditions no frost penetration was observed in a clay liner beneath a drainage layer of about 40 cm (gravel d = 16 / 32 mm). As a conclusion certain materials are discussed with regard to their suitability as thermal protection of the mineral liners. (orig.)

40|$|The {{source of}} the gold in the giant Carlin type {{deposits}} iu Nevada is controversial; is it deeply sourced from the lower crust or mantle, from high level intrusions or from the sedimentary basin? We report new evidence that the Ordovician to Devonian carbonaceous stratigraphy that hosts the ore deposits is a viable source-rock for both gold and arsenic. Detailed studies of the host sediments away from the Ore deposits bas revealed at least seven metalliferous intervals of organic-rich mudstones in the stratigraphy {{from the base of}} the Roberts Mountains Formation to the top of the Rodeo Creek Formation. These intervals are enriched in syngenetic/diagenetic V, As, Mo, Se, Ni, Ag, Zn and Au and are termed the VAMSNAZ suite. These metals are preferentially concentrated in very fine grained aggregates of diagenetic pyrite, hut some are also present in bedding parallel <b>lenticles</b> and cross cutting veins of bitumen. The metal association is typical of redox sensitive elements that are enriched in euxinic sedimentary environments by reduction and adsorption onto organic matter. Simple mass balance calculations suggest that these sediments may have contained sufficient metals to account for the entire budget of gold, arsenic and many of the other elements concentrated in the epigenetic Carlin ore deposits. Pre-enrichment of gold and arsenic in the Ordovician to Devonian slope and basin depositional facies of the Great Basin is proposed as a necessary requirement for the formation of the Carlin type ores in Nevada. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of mining in the Upper Harz simple open cast working (Schurfe) was the {{predominant}} method of mining. With increasing depth a form of mixed mining developed that was somewhere between open cast and underground mining. These mines were known as glory holes (Pingen) or simply dip mines (Unterwerksbau). The ore deposits that lay immediately on the surface were quickly exhausted and, as early as the 12th and 13th century miners were forced to switch entirely over to underground mining. The mining methods that could be used were limited by the steep, almost vertical, <b>lenticles</b> of ore, which were only a few metres wide, but dipped for several hundred metres into the earth. Hauling shafts were usually positioned in centre of the ore allotment on the lode and followed it into the ground. This resulted in inclined shafts with their characteristic, right-angled, longitudinal sections and frequent changes of angle away from the vertical. There were two reasons for this approach: firstly, it had to be possible to extract ore from the beginning (as soon as the shaft was sunk) {{in order to make the}} pit economic as early as possible. Secondly, the rock in the ore lode, which formed a 'zone of disturbance', was much softer than the surrounding rock. The typical Harz grauwacke was far harder than concrete. As a result, the majority of drainage adits followed the vein. From the shaft, main gangways, the so-called Feldortstrecken, were driven out to the boundary of the mine allotment. From these gangways, miners began to extract the ore, heading downwards into the floor, by 'brushing down' (Nachreißen) in stepped fashion, a technique known as underhand stoping. The stopes had a height of up to 3 metres and followed one another about 5 to 6 metres apart. In longitudinal section, therefore, a pit looked like a Christmas tree standing on its head. The deepest point of the pit was usually the main shaft. This enabled it to collect pit water in the shaft 'sump'. As mining progressed the shaft was sunk deeper.|$|R
