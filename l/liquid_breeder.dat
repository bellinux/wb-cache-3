40|$|In HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) blanket for ITER fusion reactor, an {{efficient}} management operation of tritium is necessary, {{in order to}} minimize the release of tritium to the environment and to improve the economy of the overall balance of the reactor tritium inventory. In this context, optimization techniques for the measurement of tritium in the various stages of the fuel cycle of the reactor must be carried out in parallel with the research and development of processing systems for tritium. For example, the TES, Tritium Extraction System, is a critical system and the determination of the concentration of hydrogen isotopes is required for its correct design [1]. Therefore, the need of a fast and reliable sensor for the measurement of the tritium concentration in the <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> is well established.

40|$|The Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) blanket {{is based}} on the {{eutectic}} liquid alloy Pb 16 Li as breeder material and neutron multiplier, and pressurised water as coolant.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} the most promising <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> blankets currently proposed for testing in ITER. The critical MHD issues for self-cooled and dual coolant LM systems are the MHD pressure drop and flow distribution with ideal and imperfect insulator barriers/coatings, ideal and imperfect flow channel inserts, and complex geometry flow elements like expansions, contraction, manifolds, etc. Separately cooled LM systems still must circulate the LM for tritium removal, and similar MHD issues may limit flow velocity and influence tritium permeation due to creation of stagnant regions and other non-ideal flow distribution effects. Molten salt breeder/coolants have significantly reduced electrical conductivity as compared to LMs, and MHD pressure drop is not considered a serious issue. However, MS also has much lower thermal conductivity, and the heat transfer to/from the structure depends on turbulent convection. The degradation of convective heat transfer by MHD turbulence modification/suppression is of great interest for both self-cooled MS systems where first wall cooling may need to be enhanced, and dual coolant MS systems where heat transfer from the hot breeder to the cooler wall needs to be suppressed. These issues are discussed in detail and development plans specifically for the dual-coolant PbLi concept, up to and including integrated testing in ITER, are presented. I...|$|E

40|$|Two {{important}} {{components of}} a <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> blanket of a fusion power reactor are the liquid breeder/coolant and the steel structure that the liquid is enclosed in. One candidate combination for such components is Lead-Lithium (PbLi) eutectic alloy and advanced Reduced Activation Ferritic/Martensitic (RAFM) steel. Implementation of RAFM steel and PbLi in blanket applications still requires material compatibility studies as many questions related to physical/chemical interactions in the RAFM/PbLi system remain unanswered. First of all, the mass loss caused by the flow-induced corrosion of the steel walls at temperatures in the range 450 &# 61616;C - 550 &# 61616;C needs to be better characterized. Second, another serious practical concern is the transport of activated corrosion products and their precipitation in the cold section of the loop. Third, an important modeling parameter, the saturation concentration of iron in PbLi, needs further evaluations as the existing correlations demonstrate scattering of several orders of magnitude. Besides, the existing experimental data on corrosion are often contradictive and the underlying physics is not well understood, especially if the PbLi flow is turbulent and strongly affected by the applied magnetic field due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects in the flowing liquid metal. The research performed here is aimed at: (1) better understanding of corrosion processes in the system including RAFM steel and flowing PbLi {{in the presence of}} a strong magnetic field and (2) prediction of corrosion losses in conditions of a Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) blanket, which is at present the key liquid metal blanket concept in the US. To do this, numerical and analytical tools have been developed and then applied to the analysis of corrosion processes. First, efforts were taken to develop a computational suite called TRANSMAG (Transport phenomena in Magnetohydrodynamic Flows) as an analysis tool for corrosion processes in the PbLi/RAFM system, including transport of corrosion products in MHD laminar and turbulent flows. The computational approach in TRANSMAG is based on simultaneous solution of flow, energy and mass transfer equations with or without a magnetic field, assuming mass transfer controlled corrosion and uniform dissolution of iron in the flowing PbLi. Then, the new computational tool was used to solve an inverse mass transfer problem where the saturation concentration of iron in PbLi was reconstructed from the experimental data resulting in the following correlation:, where T is the temperature of PbLi in K and is in wppm. The new correlation for saturation concentration was then used in the analysis of corrosion processes in laminar flows in a rectangular duct {{in the presence of a}} strong transverse magnetic field. As shown in this study, the mass loss increases with the magnetic field such that the corrosion rate in the presence of a magnetic field can be a few times higher compared to purely hydrodynamic flows. In addition, the corrosion behavior was found to be different between the side wall of the duct (parallel to the magnetic field) and the Hartmann wall (perpendicular to the magnetic field) due to formation of high-velocity jets at the side walls. In the blanket conditions, the side walls experience a stronger corrosion attack demonstrating a mass loss up to 2 - 3 times higher compared to the Hartmann walls. The analysis for a case of a strong magnetic field suggests scaling laws for the mass loss ML in rectangular ducts, which include the effects of the temperature T, mean bulk velocity Um and the applying magnetic field B 0 : for the side wall, and for the Hartmann wall, where q, s ~ 0. 5. As seen from these laws, the mass loss at the Hartmann wall is not affected by a magnetic field providing the magnetic field is high. Further analysis was performed for corrosion in the Hartmann flow, which is the MHD analog of the hydrodynamic Poiseuille flow. The main goal of the analysis is to elucidate the effect of a magnetic field on the corrosion mass loss in the case when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the flow-confining wall. It was found that the corrosion rate is strongly dependent of the ratio between the thickness of the concentration boundary layer and that of the magnetohydrodynamic Hartmann boundary layer. Once the concentration boundary layer becomes thicker than the Hartmann layer, further increase in the magnetic field does not affect the corrosion rate. A self-similar solution for the concentration field was derived for two particular cases: (i) the thickness of the concentration boundary layer is much smaller than the thickness of the Hartmann layer and (ii) the Hartmann layer is much thinner than the concentration boundary layer. The derived solutions comply very well with the numerical data and thus can be recommended for calculations of the corrosion mass loss in fusion applications and also to analyze experimental data. Analysis of the effect of a magnetic field on corrosion of RAFM steel in a turbulent PbLi flow is performed using numerical simulations. The impact of the magnetic field strength and its direction for this mass transfer problem is analyzed with the aid of a mass transfer equation for dissolved products coupled with the MHD equations. This approach utilizes a special form of the "K-&# 949;" model of turbulence, which takes into account the effect of turbulence suppression by a magnetic field. Computations are performed for three orientations of the magnetic field, with respect to the main flow (streamwise, spanwise and wall-normal B-field) in the temperature range from 400 &# 61616;C to 550 &# 61616;C, which is of particular interest for fusion cooling applications. Changes in the corrosion rate caused by MHD effects have been analyzed with regard to turbulence modification by a magnetic field and to formation of the Hartmann boundary layer at the walls perpendicular to the magnetic field. As demonstrated, for all three magnetic field orientations, decrease of the corrosion rate occurs as the magnetic field increases. However, a wall-normal magnetic field has a stronger effect on the reduction of the corrosion rate compared to the other two magnetic field orientations due to more intensive turbulence suppression. For the case of a wall-normal magnetic field, a correlation for the turbulent dimensionless mass transfer coefficient (Sherwood number, Sh) has been constructed based on the numerical data, which shows the effect of the flow velocity via the Reynolds number (Re) and that of the applied magnetic field via the Hartmann number (Ha) :, where Sherwood number in a purely hydrodynamic flow Sh 0 is a function of Re. The developed analytical and computational tools have been used in the calculations of the corrosion mass loss in the poloidal ducts of the DCLL blanket under conditions of the so-called US DEMO reactor. The present analysis is limited to the outboard region of the reactor where the magnetic field is ~ 4 T. One of the goals of the analysis is to establish conditions when a high PbLi temperature at the blanket exit of ~ 700 &# 61616;C needed for high thermal efficiency of the power conversion cycle can be achieved, while the corrosion mass loss is maintained within the allowable limits. At present, the suggested maximum for the corrosion wall thinning is 20 &# 61549;m/yr. The analysis includes parametric studies, using the electrical conductivity of the insulating flow channel insert (FCI) and the PbLi temperature as parameters. Also, more detailed computations have been performed using computed temperature distributions from the 3 D MHD/thermofluid analysis. The obtained corrosion data suggest that the most corrosion losses occur in the thin gap between the First Wall and the FCI (side-wall section of the gap), while the corrosion losses in the Hartmann-wall section of the gap are almost negligible due to very low velocities there. Also, the maximum temperature at the interface between the RAFM wall and the flowing PbLi (which guaranties the average wall thinning < 20 &# 61549;m/yr) was estimated at about 470 &# 61616;C. This is consistent with the estimate from a more conservative analysis in the past...|$|E

We plan to accomplish this end, in part, by extending the original studies to include system and component design and parametric evaluations of the nuclear steam supply system and its related systems and subsystems based on a n estimation of the state of technology in 1980. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>liquid</b> metal <b>breeder</b> blankets for fusion reactors has been {{performed in the}} Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe {{as a part of}} the European fusion blanket development program with the aim to select the two most promising concepts in 1995 for further development. In this report are described the designs of self-cooled blankets together with the results of the accompanying R and D program of the years 1992 - 1995. The program includes design studies as well as theoretical and experimental work in the fields of neutronics, magneto-hydrodynamics, thermohydraulics, mechanical stresses, compatibility and purification of lead-lithium, tritium extraction and control, safety, reliability, electrical insulating coatings, and fabrication technologies for blanket segments.
