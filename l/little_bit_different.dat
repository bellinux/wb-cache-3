500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path."

The New York Times called it a [...] "low-budget freak show/cult classic/cultural institution" [...] and considered the songs featured in the film to be [...] "catchy". Geoff Andrew of Time Out noted that the [...] "string of hummable songs gives it momentum, Gray's admirably straight-faced narrator holds it together, and a run on black lingerie takes care of almost everything else", rating it 4 out of 5 stars. Dave Kehr of Chicago Reader on the other hand considered the wit to be [...] "too weak to sustain a film" [...] and thought that the [...] "songs all sound the same".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of the few in the series that has no paranormal {{elements}} to it. Carter said of the episode's conception, [...] "My first chance to work with David Nutter in a long time, and I wanted to give him something he could sink his teeth into. It's a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>different</b> for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears. I felt that I had to figure out what she is most afraid of, and she is most afraid of those things that most of us are afraid of. [...] The idea of dying at the hands of someone—creature or not—and she is helpless to do anything about it. I thought it was a very good way to explore Scully's character." [...] The scene where Dana Scully imagines Pfaster appearing as a devil was influenced by real-life accounts, as described by Carter: [...] "There are reports of people who had been under the spell of Jeffrey Dahmer, who actually claimed that he shape-shifted during those hours when they were held hostage; that his image actually changed."

The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed.

[...] is helping her out, just in a different way."

5000|$|Musically, {{this album}} found the band moving back more to their speed-laden, melodic death metal roots, though the already present {{alternative}} and metalcore sound still remains. In {{an interview with}} SuicideGirls.com, Wichers spoke about what direction the band might take musically with its next album. [...] "We talked about maybe taking a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a <b>different</b> approach for the next record," [...] he said. [...] "Having me and Sylvain back in the band, I think that we're probably {{going to try to}} do stuff that might be a little more technical. We want to keep the element of the catchy chorus but at the same time maybe have bit more guitar solos than on Sworn to a Great Divide and also let Dirk drums get more space on the record for drumming. That was one of the things I think that 'Sworn to a Great Divide' was lacking a <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> It's a good record but I think that with such talented musicians the next album definitely needs to have more performance." [...] Peter Wichers also stated that this album will have more blues elements that previous albums and even said that one of the riffs for 'The Thrill' was inspired by a bluegrass riff.|$|R
5000|$|What Warner {{asked us}} to do was {{turn it into a}} much broader {{audience}} title, stop making it gritty, photorealistic film reference, [...] and just open it up to a bigger audience. So we took a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of a <b>different</b> slant on it. We took a game that we felt was appropriate for a broader audience, but perhaps the violence of the films, we just took it away a little. So for this game, it's very much more family friendly, it's more colourful, but we tried to keep it where the core Lord of the Rings audience wouldn't be turned off by that, which is something we never want to do ... The Lord of the Rings always will be huge. As a gaming ideal, it's sort of where everything else came from; it's a fantasy game, it's swords, it's bad guys, it's magic, it's everything that's basically core fantasy, and fantasy does have a huge part in gaming.|$|R

He made that decision more or less by himself. He can be a really great drummer but he had difficulty on tour putting out the energy for the length of shows they were doing. I don't know if he thought they'd put things on hold for him." [...] He was replaced on an initially temporary basis with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron. Cameron said, [...] "I got a phone call out of the blue, from Mr. Ed Ved, Stoney and Kelly. I was ambushed. It was really short notice. He called and said 'hey what are you doing this summer?'" [...] Cameron learned over 80 songs in two weeks. [...] Regarding his entrance, Cameron stated that [...] "The guys made me feel real welcome and it wasn't a struggle to get it musically, but my style was a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>different,</b> I think, than what they were used to.

2500|$|As McKittrick was {{led from}} the court, Bennett asked her to give {{evidence}} against Paulus, but she was initially reluctant to do so. She continued to resist until the case against Paulus was heard in February 1975. At the trial, McKittrick testified that Robinson had paid Paulus $25,000 {{to find someone to}} eliminate Hill, and that in turn, Paulus had paid Vandiver $5,000 to carry out the murder. McKittrick and Robinson both passed polygraph tests. The results indicated that McKittrick was being truthful when she stated that Robinson had caused John Hill's death and that Robinson was telling the truth when he said {{he had nothing to do}} with Hill's murder. Bennett also produced evidence that Ash Robinson had taken out a private telephone number, which had been found written on a scrap of paper in Paulus's handbag. DeGuerin then sought to portray McKittrick as a liar by calling Paulus to the witness stand, a strategy that was almost successful until Paulus deviated from the agreed testimony. She had sought to portray herself as a respectable widow who had taken pity on McKittrick. However, after telling the court that she did not know Vandiver, but had taken McKittrick into her home after a friend of her late husband had introduced them in the spring of 1972, Paulus offered comment on the difference between the two women's lifestyles. She told the court [...] "I liked [...] even though you could gather from her conversation that her life was just a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>different</b> from mine".|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had tapped her for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”. Norwood confirmed his idea in an interview she held at the release party of Shock Value II: [...] "What I'm doing on the [...] album is a <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>different</b> than what everybody knows me for. Timbaland endorsed that [...] He really gave me a shot to be different and be versatile. I can't thank him enough for that. This is a wonderful opportunity." [...] Though Norwood went on to record several other rap songs the following months and hoped it would eventually lead to a signing with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group, plans for hip hop-oriented album under his imprint were eventually abandoned as the singer felt the sound would not aim at her core audience.
