5|$|Although the {{existing}} line had been upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, {{operation of the}} Brill Tramway {{was taken over by}} London's Metropolitan Railway and Brill became one of its two north-western termini.

The population of the area remained <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> primary income source remained the carriage of goods to and from farms. Between 1899 and 1910 other lines were built in the area, providing more direct services to London and the north of England. The Brill Tramway went into financial decline.|$|E
5|$|By early August14, the shear had {{substantially}} {{disrupted the}} storm, leaving the low-level center of circulation exposed {{from the area}} of convection, which was also deteriorating. After meandering, the storm began to move westward. Forecasters expected it to resume a northwestward track as high pressure {{to the south of}} Bermuda was forecast to weaken and another high was predicted to form southwest of the Azores. By 1800UTC on August14, the strong shear had further weakened the storm, and it no longer met the criteria for a tropical cyclone. It degenerated into a remnant <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center issued their final advisory on the cyclone. Moving westward, it occasionally produced bursts of convective activity, before dissipating on August18.|$|E

5|$|On July 14, 2008 a {{weakening}} surface trough extended across northern Florida, producing thunderstorms across the state. A weak {{low pressure area}} developed on July 15 near Tallahassee, which moved southeastward into the Gulf of Mexico.

Late on July 17, however, convection increased {{in association with the}} <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> system quickly became better organized. Late on July 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked that a tropical depression was developing, with its convection becoming more concentrated around a circulation; at 11 p.m. EST on July 18 (0300UTC July 19), it was classified as Tropical Depression Three, about 65miles (105km) southeast of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E

5|$|A non-tropical frontal low {{developed}} from a cold front on November 1 {{to the west}} of the Azores. It intensified while moving west-northwestward and gradually dissipated its frontal structure. It became a subtropical storm on November 4 about 775 nautical miles (1435km) south of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Operationally, the storm was considered a non-tropical <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center did not begin issuing advisories until it became a tropical cyclone. It moved slowly northward as convection organized into a ring around the center. As a result of a ship reporting hurricane-force winds near the center, and due to the development of a weak mid-level warm core, the subtropical cyclone was reclassified as Hurricane Noel on November 5. Increasing westerly wind shear limited convection near the center, and Noel weakened to a tropical storm early on November 6. Progressively cooler water temperatures contributed to weakening, and Noel became extratropical later on November 6 about 330mi (530km) southeast of Newfoundland. The extratropical remnant continued to the northeast and was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm later that day.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on May16 and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on May24. That day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150mi (240km) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline. At that time, this system was associated with a monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Despite being disorganized, gradual development of this system was anticipated by the NHC. On May25, a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua, after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward-moving Kelvin wave. Convection soon became organized around the newly formed <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48hours was likely. The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1200UTC on May28 about 125mi (205km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|A weak {{surface area}} of low {{pressure}} detached from a frontal system on August 8 while 1,150miles (1,850km) to the east of Bermuda. It moved southwestward, and on August 9, it generated convection as it passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. The surface <b>low</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E

Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E
5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} was <b>low</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{two main}} forces {{failed to notice}} Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E

5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was <b>low</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What gave rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Don {{failed to}} intensify {{significantly}} {{due to a}} misalignment between the lower and mid-level circulations. The wind shear in the region further exposed the circulation from the convection late on July28, although the winds increased slightly. Early on July29, Don attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) {{as reported by the}} Hurricane Hunters, and the storm maintained that intensity while moving across the Gulf of Mexico. As Don approached the Texas coast early on July30, the thunderstorms rapidly diminished due to the combination of wind shear, drier air, and cooler water temperatures just offshore. The winds decreased as the convection dissipated, and Don made landfall on Padre Island National Seashore as a tropical depression at 0230UTC on July30. About {{three and a half hours}} later, Don degenerated into a remnant <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> circulation dissipated six hours after that.|$|E
5|$|On September 17, the {{intensification}} {{became more}} rapid and Helene {{quickly became a}} Category2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed down in the central Atlantic, which {{was in response to}} a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. The northward turn shifted the course away from any land areas. The intensification continued through the afternoon, and that evening, Helene strengthened into a major hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 962mbar. As shear remained <b>low</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> oceans remained warm, Helene intensified slightly more, peaking as a solid Category3 hurricane with 120mph (195km/h) winds early on September 18. At that time, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean. Operationally, Helene was estimated to have had 125mph (205km/h) winds, but the post-storm analysis downgraded it slightly. As Gordon moved eastward on the afternoon of 18th, a narrow ridge built in, forcing Helene westward. The eyewall collapsed somewhat, and Helene weakened slightly to a Category2 hurricane, where it leveled off for about 48hours until September 20 due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. On the 20th, Helene turned back to the northwest and weakened slightly due to a slight increase in wind shear. That afternoon, it was downgraded to a Category1 hurricane, which Helene remained until becoming extratropical.|$|E

5|$|The Chaco Low is a semi–permanent low {{pressure}} system situated {{east of the}} Andes that is approximately located between 20oS and 30oS during summer (displaced to the north in winter). It is stronger in the summer than in winter due {{to a combination of}} high insolation, dry surface conditions, and southward displacement of the South Atlantic and South Pacific High (this makes it difficult for cold fronts to enter at lower latitudes). The Chaco Low interacts with the South Atlantic High, generating a pressure gradient that draws moist air from the northeast to coastal and central regions of Argentina. It also forces easterly winds from the Amazon basin to move southward, which is reinforced by the funneling effect from both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau. The Chaco Low brings large amounts of moisture that favour the development of convective thunderstorms during summer, reaching as far south as 35oS. This movement of air from the north owing to the interaction between the Chaco <b>Low</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic high is the strongest in summer when the Chaco Low is at its strongest. These winds bring hot, humid tropical air from the north. Sustained and intense winds from the north are responsible for severe weather events such as heat waves and severe convection. During winter, the Chaco Low weakens as a result of lower insolation. This is partly responsible for the decrease in winter precipitation over much of Argentina (in addition to northward displacement of westerlies) due to a weaker transport of air masses from the tropics. This excludes areas south of 40oS where it is dominated by westerlies.|$|E

Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his own good. Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> house was a drain on limited resources.
