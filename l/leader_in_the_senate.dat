5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to the Senate in 1957, Cooper was {{assigned}} to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In 1959, he challenged Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen to become the Republican floor <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> but lost by four votes. In a 1960 poll of fifty journalists conducted by Newsweek magazine, Cooper was named the ablest Republican member of the Senate. He helped author and co-sponsored the National Defense Education Act. Together with Senator Jennings Randolph, he sponsored the Appalachian Regional Development Act, designed to address the prevalent poverty in Appalachia. He succeeded in gaining more state and local control over the anti-poverty group Volunteers in Service to America. He was a vigorous opponent of measures designed to weaken the Tennessee Valley Authority.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the Australian Labor Party from an early age, {{he was elected to}} the Australian Senate in 1961; and, in 1967, he was elected Opposition <b>Leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> In the Senate {{pre-selection}} convention in the Sydney Trades Hall in April 1960, with backing from Ray Gietzelt (but lacking factional endorsement) and with the luck of drawing first in addressing the delegates, Murphy won support with an impassioned but well-structured and infectiously optimistic seven-minute speech on the Labor Party's historical commitment to civil liberties and human rights.|$|E
25|$|Scott won {{election}} to the Senate in 1958, narrowly prevailing over Democratic Governor George M. Leader. He was a strong advocate for civil rights legislation, and he voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. He won election as Senate Minority Whip in January 1969 and was elevated to Senate Minority Leader after Everett Dirksen's death later that year. As the Republican <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Scott urged President Richard Nixon to resign {{in the aftermath of}} the Watergate Scandal. Scott declined to seek another Senate seat in 1976 and retired in 1977.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of each two-year session the House elects a speaker who does not {{normally}} preside over debates but serves as the majority party's <b>leader.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> the Vice President is the ex officio president of the Senate. In addition, the Senate elects an officer called the President pro tempore. Pro tempore means for the time being and this office is usually held by the most senior member of the Senate's majority party and customarily keeps this position until there's a change in party control. Accordingly, the Senate does not necessarily elect a new president pro tempore {{at the beginning of a}} new Congress. In both the House and Senate, the actual presiding officer is generally a junior member of the majority party who is appointed so that new members become acquainted with the rules of the chamber.|$|E

He was also a vigorous supporter of the White Australia policy, advocating the cessation of Kanaka immigration and the gradual deportation {{of those who had}} already arrived in Queensland; his opposition was based on a concern that [...] "inferior labour would ... tend to degrade labour throughout the Commonwealth", as well as concerns about racial purity.|$|E

500|$|The {{divisions}} within the Coalition were laid bare in an episode of Four Corners, aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 9 November 2009. [...] The program featured the Coalition's <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Nick Minchin, suggesting that man-made climate change was a conspiracy of the political left and disputing Turnbull's authority to strike {{a deal with the}} government on the ETS. Later in the month, Minchin spoke against the ETS in the Senate. Abbottwho had publicly supported the ETSwas now arguing that the Coalition should abandon the policy. Turnbull attacked Abbott's change of mind, stating: [...] "Tony has expressed a number of views, each of which is at odds with the view he expressed before".|$|E
500|$|Whitlam's {{relationship}} with Calwell, never good, deteriorated further after {{publication of a}} 1965 article in The Australian. The article reported off-the-record comments Whitlam had made that his leader was [...] "too old and weak" [...] to win office, and that the party might be gravely damaged by an [...] "old-fashioned" [...] 70-year-old Calwell seeking his first term as prime minister. Later that year, at Whitlam's urging, and over Calwell's objection, the biennial party conference made major changes to the party's platform: deleting support for the White Australia policy and making the ALP's leader and deputy leader ex officio members of the conference and executive, along with the party's leader and deputy <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> As Whitlam considered the Senate unrepresentative, he opposed the admission of its ALP leaders to the party's governing bodies.|$|E

Making {{clear that he was}} not intended on becoming the orchestra <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> but rather the 1st chair in a couple of sections, Voinovich picked out several committees where he would make his mark. Particularly in his first years in the Senate, Voinovich was opposed to lowering tax rates. He frequently joined Democrats on tax issues and in 2000 was the only Republican in Congress to vote against a bill providing for relief from the [...] "marriage penalty".|$|E
2500|$|After the Kentucky Supreme Court {{declared}} Kentucky's entire {{public education}} system unconstitutional due to inequalities in funding for local districts, Senate President John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose appointed Baker {{as the only}} Republican legislator on the committee charged with creating a system that would meet the court's definition of constitutionality. John Rogers, the Republican floor <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> objected {{that he was not}} consulted about Baker's appointment, that Republicans were underrepresented on the committee, and that Baker – despite his previous legislative service – was considered a freshman legislator. Baker said he believed more Republicans would be appointed to the committee when he agreed to serve. The committee presented the Kentucky Education Reform Act to the legislature in 1990, and Baker was one of only three Republicans who voted for it. Baker was awarded the Louisville-Jefferson County Crime Commission Legislator of the Year Award in both 1990 and 1992. He was unopposed for re-election in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|In October the {{government}} became embroiled in another embarrassing {{controversy over the}} alleged misuse of VIP aircraft, which {{came to a head}} when John Gorton (Government <b>Leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate)</b> tabled documents that showed that Holt had unintentionally misled Parliament in his earlier answers on the matter. Support for his leadership was eroded even further by his refusal to sack the Minister for Air, Peter Howson, in order to defuse the scandal, fuelling criticism from within the party that Holt was [...] "weak" [...] and lacked Menzies' ruthlessness. Much of the blame for the episode within the Public Service was visited upon Sir John Bunting, Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department, although other figures such as the Deputy Secretary Peter Lawler were able to protect themselves. One of John Gorton's first acts upon becoming Prime Minister in January 1968 was to sideline Bunting by creating a separate Department of the Cabinet Office with Bunting as its head, and replaced him with Lenox Hewitt.|$|E

2500|$|Born in a {{farmhouse}} in Stonewall, Texas, Johnson {{was a high}} school teacher and worked as a Congressional aide before winning election to the House of Representatives in 1937. He won election to the Senate in 1948, and was appointed the position of Senate Majority Whip in 1951. He became the Senate Minority Leader in 1953 and the Senate Majority Leader in 1955. As a <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Johnson became known for his domineering personality and the [...] "Johnson treatment", his aggressive coercion of powerful politicians to advance legislation. Johnson ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1960 presidential election. Although unsuccessful, he accepted the invitation of then-Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts to be his running mate. They went on to win a close election over the Republican ticket of Richard Nixon and Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., and Johnson was sworn in as Vice President on January 20, 1961. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, and Johnson succeeded Kennedy as president. The following year, Johnson won a landslide in 1964, defeating Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|As President of the Senate, Overhulse {{appointed}} 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans to committee chairmanships {{and split}} committee memberships equally {{between the two}} parties as well. [...] As a conservative rural legislator, Overhulse sometimes voted with the Republicans, but also stood with fellow Democrats on many issues. [...] His bi-partisan leadership approach was very effective and made him popular with all his colleagues in the legislature. [...] When friends in Central Oregon decided to honor Overhulse at a tribute dinner in Madras, over 300 civic and political leaders from around the state attended. [...] The master of ceremonies at the event was Tom McCall, a future Republican governor of Oregon. [...] The Republican <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>senate,</b> Warren Gill, attended as did Walter Pearson, the senate’s Democratic leader. [...] The speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives also attended along with numerous other legislators, who rented a bus for the trip from Salem to Madras and back. [...] In addition, Governor Robert D. Holmes, United States Senator Wayne Morse, Oregon congressman Al Ullman, and Portland mayor Terry Schrunk all sent personal telegrams which McCall read to the guests at the dinner. [...] At the event, Overhulse was presented with a peace pipe by an elder of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, recognizing him for [...] "keeping the peace" [...] in Oregon’s state government.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the chief}} Radical <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> during Reconstruction, Sumner fought hard to provide equal civil and voting {{rights for the}} freedmen {{on the grounds that}} [...] "consent of the governed" [...] was a basic {{principle}} of American republicanism, and to block ex-Confederates from power so they would not reverse the gains made from the Union's victory in the Civil War. Sumner, teaming with House leader Thaddeus Stevens, battled Andrew Johnson's reconstruction plans and sought to impose a Radical program on the South. Although Sumner forcefully advocated the annexation of Alaska in the Senate, he was against the annexation of the Dominican Republic, then known by the name of its capital, Santo Domingo. After leading Senators to defeat President Ulysses S. Grant's Santo Domingo Treaty in 1870, Sumner broke with Grant, and denounced him in such terms that reconciliation was impossible. In 1871, President Grant and his Secretary of State Hamilton Fish retaliated; through Grant's supporters in the Senate, Sumner was deposed as head of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner had become convinced that Grant was a corrupt despot and that the success of Reconstruction policies called for new national leadership. [...] Sumner bitterly opposed Grant's reelection by supporting the Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley in 1872 and lost his power inside the Republican Party. [...] Less than two years later, he died in office.|$|E
