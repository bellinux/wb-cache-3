She was a founder member of the short-lived Melbourne Independent Theatre Company, which staged a simgle production, Brain Faull's Life for the Living (15 May 1967 – 27 May 1967) at the Emerald Hill Theatre before disbanding. Later the same year, Florance appeared at St Martin's Theatre in Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party (1 November 1967 – 25 November 1967) alongside Peter Adams. In February 1968, Florance appeared with the St Martin's Theatre company in Thomas Keneally's Halloran's <b>Little</b> <b>Boat</b> (5 February 1968 – 17 February 1968) alongside Terence Donovan at the Playhouse Theatre, Perth. {{as part of the}} Festival of Perth, and then in Melbourne at St Martin's Theatre. Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes (22 May 1968 – 15 June 1968) alongside Syd Conabere at St Martin's Theatre was Florance's last play of the 1960s.|$|E

500|$|Verlaine's lyrics on Marquee Moon {{combined}} {{urban and}} pastoral imagery. Although {{it was not}} a concept album, many of its songs made geographical references to lower Manhattan. According to Bryan Waterman, author of the 33⅓ book on the record, it celebrated stern adolescence in the urban pastoral mode. Its urban nocturne theme was derived from poetic works about Bohemian decadence. According to Spin, the album was about urban mythology; Verlaine brought [...] "a sentimental romanticism to the Bowery, making legends out of the mundane". The lyrics also incorporated maritime imagery, including the paradoxical [...] "nice <b>little</b> <b>boat</b> made out of ocean" [...] in [...] "See No Evil", the waterfront setting in [...] "Elevation", sea metaphors in [...] "Guiding Light", and references to docks, caves, and waves in [...] "Prove It".|$|E
500|$|Starting out for Franz Josef Land to the {{south-east}} on July 22, {{the three}} soon {{found that their}} struggle across the ice, which had ridges two-stories high, was hardly bringing the goal any nearer: the drift of the ice was in the opposite direction, moving them backwards. On August 4 they decided, after a long discussion, to aim for Sjuøyane in the southwest instead, hoping to reach the depot there after a six- to seven-week march, {{with the help of}} the current. The terrain in that direction was mostly extremely difficult, sometimes necessitating a crawl on all fours, but there was occasional relief in the form of open water—the <b>little</b> <b>boat</b> (not designed by Andrée) was apparently a functional and safe conveyance—and smooth, flat ice floes. [...] "Paradise!" [...] wrote Andrée. [...] "Large even ice floes with pools of sweet drinking water and here and there a tender-fleshed young polar bear!" [...] They made fair apparent headway, but the wind turned almost as soon as they did, and they were again being pushed backwards, away from Sjuøyane. The wind varied between southwest and northwest over the coming weeks; they tried in vain to overcome this by turning more and more westward, but it was becoming clear that Sjuøyane was out of their reach.|$|E
500|$|The Calcutta Review starts {{by noting}} {{that this is a}} book that cannot be done justice in a brief notice, that Wallace is a most eminent naturalist, and chiefly known as a Darwinian. the book was the most {{interesting}} to cross the reviewer's desk since Palgrave's Arabia (1865) and Sir Samuel Baker's Explorations of the Nile (1866). By combining geography, geology and ethnology into one narrative, the reader is saved [...] "the monotony of traversing the same regions several times". The review describes in detail Wallace's findings of different birds and mammals either side of the Wallace line. It notes Wallace's cheerfulness and good temper in the face of [...] "the difficulties and inconveniences attendant upon foreign travel", such as having to cross [...] "a hundred miles of open sea in a <b>little</b> <b>boat</b> of four tons burthen", which Wallace calmly describes as comparatively comfortable. The reviewer remarks that Wallace was [...] "set down as a conjuror by these simple people" [...] with unimaginable purposes from a faraway country, but is less admiring about Wallace's moralising tone, especially when he supposes that [...] "wild communities" [...] can be happier than [...] "in a more highly civilised society". The review ends with some reflections of surprise on how little-known the Malay Archipelago is in India, given that they were closely connected with Hindu temples in Java and Bali, and hopes that soon there will be some [...] "productions" [...] of the archipelago in the Indian Museum of Calcutta.|$|E

2500|$|As {{they were}} going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across {{the bow of the}} Charleston in a {{whaleboat}} with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, [...] "Frank, come on board." [...] Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the <b>little</b> <b>boat.</b> The Guam merchant merely grinned and replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, [...] "Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois." [...] The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The [...] "welcoming party" [...] had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked at them for a few moments. He had already heard from José Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.|$|E
