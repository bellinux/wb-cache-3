40|$|Abstract: Using the {{heuristic}} <b>linear</b> <b>creep</b> model, {{this article}} derives the governing differential {{equations of motion}} for a vehicle traveling on curved tracks. The vehicle is modelled by a 27 -degrees-of-freedom (27 -DOF) car system, with lateral displacement, vertical displacement, roll angle, and yaw angle of the each wheelset and the bogie frames, {{as well as the}} lateral dis-placement, roll angle and yaw angle of the car body all taken into consideration. To analyse the respective effects of major system parameters on the vehicle dynamics, the 27 -DOF system is reduced to a 14 -DOF system by excluding designated subsets of the system parameters. The effects of suspension parameters of a vehicle on the critical hunting speeds were evaluated by the 14 - and 27 -DOF systems. Results obtained in this study, show that the critical hunting speeds derived using the 14 -DOF system are generally higher than those evaluated using the 27 -DOF system. Additionally, the critical hunting speeds evaluated using the heuristic non-linear creep model are lower than those derived using the <b>linear</b> <b>creep</b> model. The effects on derailment quotients of vehicle speeds are evaluated using both linear and non-linear creep models with various suspension parameters. Finally, the effects of vehicle speeds on the derailment quotient for the sharp curves and low vehicle speeds are investigated and compared with both linear and non-linear creep model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} dynamic finite-element models of I˙zmit earthquake postseismic deformation {{to evaluate whether}} this deformation is better explained by afterslip (via either velocity-strengthening frictional slip or <b>linear</b> viscous <b>creep)</b> or by distributed linear viscoelastic relaxation of the lower crust.

Our best frictional afterslip model fits the main features of postseismic slip inversions, in particular, high slip patches at (and below) the hypocenter and on the western Karadere segment, and limited afterslip west of the Hersek Delta (Bürgmann et al., 2002). The model requires a weakly velocity-strengthening fault, that is, either low effective normal stress in the slipping regions or a smaller value for the parameter describing rate-dependence of friction (a-b) than is indicated by laboratory experi-ments.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in our {{previous}} publication (Blawzdziewicz,Cristini,Loewenberg, 2003) that high-viscosity drops in two dimensional <b>linear</b> <b>creeping</b> flows with a nonzero vorticity component may have two stable stationary states. One state corresponds to a nearly spherical, compact drop stabilized primarily by rotation, and the other to an elongated drop stabilized primarily by capillary forces. Here we explore consequences of the drop bistability for the dynamics of highly viscous drops. Using both boundary-integral simulations and small-deformation theory we show that a quasi-static change of the flow vorticity gives rise to a hysteretic response of the drop shape, with rapid changes between the compact and elongated solutions at critical values of the vorticity. In flows with sinusoidal temporal variation of the vorticity we find chaotic drop dynamics in response to the periodic forcing. A cascade of period-doubling bifurcations is found to be directly responsible for the transition to chaos. In random flows we obtain a bimodal drop-length distribution.

30|$|Wheel–track {{interaction}} {{is actually a}} very complicated phenomenon and several methods {{have been used to}} compute the normal and friction forces on wheels in the literature [13, 14]. Kalker’s <b>linear</b> <b>creep</b> theory offers an easy solution to incorporate creep forces into the rail vehicle model {{as a function of the}} speed of the rail vehicle. Therefore, Kalker’s theory is an essential ingredient of many of dynamic rail vehicle models in the present literature. Comparison of different wheel–track interaction models has been well studied; however, most of the models ignore the fact that wheel slip phenomena had been reduced significantly with the recent improvements in traction and brake technologies. Therefore, wheel slip can be observed for modern rapid transit rail vehicles depending on the wheel–track adhesion conditions, but at normal conditions wheel slide protection systems avoid wheel slide during acceleration and braking.|$|E

The rails are modelled as Timoshenko beams, and the concrete two-block sleepers are assumed to be rigid mass with vertical and lateral movement. The pads under the rails and the rubber boots under the sleepers provide greater vertical and lateral elasticity for the track. The Hertz nonlinear elastic contact theory is used to calculate the normal wheel/rail force. The wheel/rail tangent creep force is first calculated using Kalker’s <b>linear</b> <b>creep</b> theory and then modified by the Shen-Hedrick-Elkins theory.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} cyclic yield {{strength}} (CYS, σc) {{as a key}} characteristic for the definition of safe design for engineering structures operating under fatigue and creep conditions. CYS is defined on a cyclic stress-strain curve, while monotonic yield strength (MYS, σm) is defined on a monotonic stress-strain curve. Both values of σc and σm are identified using a 2 -steps fitting procedure of the experimental stress-strain curves using Ramberg-Osgood and Chaboche material models. Comparison of σc and fatigue endurance limit σf on the S-N fatigue curve reveals that they are approximately equal. Hence, basically safe fatigue design is guaranteed in purely elastic domain defined by the σc. A typical creep rupture curve in time-to-failure approach for creep analysis has 2 inflections corresponding to the σc and σm. These stresses separate 3 sections on the creep rupture curve, which are characterised by 3 different creep fracture modes and 3 creep deformation mechanisms.

In this model, the wagon movements were described using up to 78 degrees of freedom (Dofs). The two wheels in a wheelset are coupled through the stiffness coefficients corresponding to the natural torsional and bending modes of wheelset. The track is considered as a discretely supported distributed-parameter track modelling with one layer. In the wheel–rail interface, before the creep saturation point µsNc (μs, static wheel–rail friction coefficient; μc, normal force), the creep forces and moments are calculated using Kalker’s <b>linear</b> <b>creep</b> theory. After that point, the wheel slides on the rail and the friction force will be μkNc (µk—kinetic friction coefficient). The simulations show that the frequency of wheel stick-slip process is composed of a basic frequency, which matches the sleeper-passing frequency and the combined torsional and bending frequency of the wheelset, forming the wavelength of rail corrugation at different situations. Generally, the wheel stickslip process on the high rail oscillates at the basic frequency whilst the dominant frequency on the low rail is double the basic frequency.

In general, the precision of AFM based nanomanipulation has been compromised mainly by hysteresis and creep of the piezo actuator.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{long-term}} {{variation of}} bending moment distribution caused by creep {{in a continuous}} beam erected sequentially in span-length sections with overhangs is analyzed. A <b>linear</b> aging <b>creep</b> law is assumed. The problem in-volves changes of the structural system from statically determinate to indeter-minate, a gradual {{increase in the number}} of redundant moments, and age dif-ferences between various cross sections. A system of Volterra integral equations for the history of support bending moments is derived. By considering infi-nitely many equal spans, which is good enough whenever there are more than a few spans, one can take advantage of a periodicity condition for the construc-tion cycle; this reduces the problem to a single equation which is of a novel type in creep theory-an integral-difference equation involving time lags in the integrated unknown. The solution exhibits sudden jumps at times equal to mul-tiples of the construction cycle. The jumps decay with time roughly in a geo-metric progression. Approximation of time integrals with finite sums yields a large system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These equations can-not be solved recurrently, step-by-step. By solving the large equation system with a computer, the effects of the duration of the construction cycle, of con-crete age at assembly of span from segments, and of the overhang length are studied numerically...|$|R
