40|$|Forest product trade {{analysis}} {{is complicated by}} the inter-relationships among forest products. This paper deals with the development and application of an integrated log-lumber trade model that divides the globe into 20 regions. These regions play a significant role as producers and/or consumers of coniferous <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> softwood <b>lumber.</b> The model is calibrated using positive mathematical programming (PMP) so that the baseline scenario precisely duplicates observed 2010 bi-lateral trade flows of both <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lumber.</b> The calibrated model is then used to examine (1) liberalization of Russian <b>log</b> export taxes <b>and</b> (2) removal of the export restrictions on Canadian lumber exports to the United States. By permitting expanded log exports, Russian welfare increases by $ 2. 3 billion, with losses to <b>lumber</b> consumers <b>and</b> producers more than covered by the gain in rents to timber land. However, the impacts on other regions in the model are surprisingly small. Likewise, removal of the export tax on Canadian lumber to the U. S. also leads to very small changes in welfare; Canada gains $ 91. 8 million, but the U. S. loses only $ 16 million as it shifts lumber sales from domestic to export markets. Russia loses $ 485 million because it produces less <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lumber,</b> while the impact on other regions is imperceptible. Clearly, by modeling <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lumber</b> together, the overall impacts of forest policies in one region are mitigated at the global scale...|$|R

40|$|Japan imports {{rather than}} exports {{forestry}} products {{even though it}} has ample forestry resources. Moreover, the leading exporters of forest products often have strong market power in the trade market of forestry products. The possibility of incomplete competition in the Japanese wood import market can also be suspected {{from the fact that the}} structure of imports of <b>logs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lumber</b> has remained unchanged over the past 10 years. However, there has been limited empirical economic analysis of the timber trade market to support this assertion. In this study, we examine the market power of the primary exporting countries in the Japanese <b>log</b> <b>and</b> <b>lumber</b> market based on the residual demand model. We analysed the import data of forestry products from 1988 to 2010 with respect to every main item exported to Japan. The analysis shows that Canada has market power over several items of logs in the Japanese import market, while the United States and Canada have market power over several items of lumber. The study also clarifies that imperfect competition exists in the Japanese timber import market and that the timber price in Japan is partially determined by the exporting countries.

50|$|Hatfield {{was founded}} by Norbert St. Germaine in 1836.

50|$|Early {{development}} in the area was on the St. Croix River, which now forms the boundary with Wisconsin on the county's eastern side.
