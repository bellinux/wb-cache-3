5000|$|By needing fewer wait states, the 1000's {{graphics}} hardware is {{as fast as}} the PC's {{while remaining}} compatible with both it and the PCjr. Like the PCjr, the 1000 uses up to 32K of system RAM for display memory. The computer's designers omitted a DMA because the PCjr does not have one, and they believed that those who needed it would add it with additional memory for the computer; they omitted the RS-232 port because all Tandy printers use the parallel port and, they believed, most customers would use internal modems. The earlier models of the Tandy 1000 had a composite video output, and could be used with a color or monochrome composite monitor, or a TV with an RF modulator. The original 1000 and SX had a <b>light-pen</b> port. Unlike most PC clones, several Tandy 1000 computers had MS-DOS built into ROM and could boot in a few seconds. Tandy bundled DeskMate, a graphical suite of consumer-oriented applications, with various Tandy 1000 models.

40|$|The <b>light-pen</b> {{coordinate}} {{measuring machine}} (LPCMM for short) is portable and flexible to measure features including invisible ones in-situ. Since different styluses are needed to measure different features and even {{during the process of}} measuring a single workpiece with complicated configurations, to improve the system measurement accuracy it is beneficial to calibrate the stylus tip center position after it is mounted to the <b>light-pen</b> before measurement in an industrial field. A novel and simple method aiming at self-calibrating the position of the tip center based on invariable distances is presented. The distinguishing feature of the proposed method is that the center position of the tip can be calibrated by using a kinematic seat with an inverted cone hole without any external reference and auxiliary devices. Calibration is based on that the distance between the tip center and that of any LED is invariable when the <b>light-pen</b> is swung smoothly with its spherical tip firmly touching the fixed cone seat. To ensure the repeatability of the algorithm some error constraint parameters are given. Based on invariable distances, the tip center position in the <b>light-pen</b> coordinate system can be obtained. Experiment results show that the self-calibration method has the advantage of good repeatability, with standard deviations 0. 027, 0. 023 and 0. 014 mm in U, V and W directions, respectively.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of phased-array two-dimensional echocardiography in detecting, localizing and quantifying myocardial injury in man, the relationship of two-dimensional echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities to morphologic evidence of myocardial infarction was evaluated in 20 autopsied patients. Comparisons were made between independent two-dimensional echocardiographic readings of left ventricular segmental wall motion and morphologic evidence of myocardial injury. Of 15 infarcts, 14 were detected by regional akinesis, dyskinesis or hypokinesis. The relationship between abnormal segmental wall motion and morphologic evidence of myocardial necrosis or fibrosis was significant. Seventy-nine of 88 (90 %) of infarcted segments showed abnormal wall motion, although 38 of 82 (46 %) of morphologically normal segments also demonstrated wall motion abnormalities. Fifty-eight of 65 segments that showed regional akinesis or dyskinesis were transmurally infarcted. Twenty-five of 38 pathologically normal segments seen by two-dimensional echocardiography as akinetic or dyskinetic were adjacent to scar. Hypokinesis was non-specific (31 segments normal, 21 subendocardial infarction). Normal wall motion excluded transmural infarc-tion (0 of 46 segments), but in one patient was associated with subendocardial injury (nine/ 42 segments).

40|$|SUMMARY Two-dimensional {{echocardiography}} {{can provide}} serial cross-sectional {{images of the}} left ven-tricular cavity. We examined whether such serial images from steady-state ejecting hearts would allow three-dimensional reconstruction and accurate volume estimation without major geometric assumptions. Cross-circulated, paced dog hearts were suspended in a blood-filled tank. Serial cross-sectional images were taken at 3 -mm intervals along the vertical axis. Left ventricular cavity and muscle areas of each image were planimetered with a <b>light-pen</b> system and summated for volume: total volume = z (areas X 3 mm). Direct left ventricular volume was measured through the cardiac cycle with a volumetric chamber connected to a balloon in the ejecting left ventricle. In six hearts, 67 separate direct volume measurements (range 9. 5 - 54. 7 ml) from various points in the cardiac cycle were compared with the simultaneous echo volume measurements. By least squares linear regression, echo volume = 1. 01 (direct volume) - 0. 44 ml; r = 0. 972, SEE = 2. 93 ml. Provided accurate cross-sectional localization is available, these studies suggest that extremely accurate steady-state left ventricular volume can be determined noninvasively in the ejecting heart from multiple cross-sectional im-ages.

40|$|Precise quantitation of {{the effects}} of the non-selective beta {{adrenergic}} blocking drug propranolol (3. 15 mg/kg body weight) on left ventricular function, segmental wall motion, and diastolic pressure-volume relation in man has been performed. High fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements and simultaneous single-plane angiocardiograms were recorded on a video disc and volumes calculated by a <b>light-pen</b> computer system. Systolic segmental wall motion was computer analysed using the long axis-quadrasection method. Patients were transvenously atrially paced to maintain a constant heart rate. The haemodynamic effects of propranolol may vary depending upon the extent of pre-existing myocardial disease. In some patients ventricular function, as measured by ejection fraction, may be reduced. This reduction in ejection fraction appears to result from overall reduction in segmental wall motion, but also from accentuation of segmental wall abnormalities. These results are consistent with the thesis that beta adrenergic blocking drugs may inhibit compensatory sympathetic mechanisms. The diastolic effects of propranolol may include quite substantial increases in ventricular volumes in those patients with impaired cardiac function. With respect to the intact human ventricle, propranolol may increase diastolic volume for a given level of ventricular pressure. Thus, in a static sense, the ventricle in these patients could be viewed as being more compliant after propranolol administration. However, the fact that the length-tension relation, as measured by the slope of the logarithmic pressure versus volume plot is unaltered by propranolol, suggests that the muscle comprising the ventricle itself exhibits no alteration in its passive elastic properties...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional echocardiographic {{determination}} of right ventricular ejection fraction was compared with right ventricular ejection fraction obtained by first pass radionuclide angiography in 39 patients with coronary artery disease. Apical four chamber and two chamber right ventricular views were obtained in 34 (87 %) of the 39 patients, while a subcostal four chamber view was obtained in 31 patients (80 %). Right ventricular ejection fraction by two-dimensional echocardiography {{was calculated by}} the biplane area-length and Simpson's rule methods using two paired orthogonal views and utilizing a computerized <b>light-pen</b> method for tracing the right ventricular endocardium. A good correlation (r = 0. 74 to 0. 78) was found between radionuclide angiographic and two-dimensional echocardiographic right ventricular ejection fraction for each method used. Patients with acute inferior myocardial infarction had the lowest right ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography and two-dimensional echocardiography (p < 0. 05 compared with patients with right coronary artery obstruction and no infarction). There were no differences in right ventricular ejection fraction between patients with acute and old inferior myocardial infarction by both techniques. No correlation was found between left and right ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography (r = 0. 16). It is concluded that 1) right ventricular ejection fraction by two-dimensional echocardiography correlates well with radionuclide angiographic measurements and can reliably evaluate right ventricular function in coronary artery disease, 2) patients with inferior myocardial infarction have reduced right ventricular ejection fraction, and 3) changes in left ventricular ejection fraction do not directly influence right ventricular function...|$|E
40|$|Reproducibility {{may be as}} {{important}} as absolute accuracy in assessing the utility of an echocardiographic method of left ventricular volume estimation for epidemiologic or physiologic studies. The magnitude of differences between measurements in the same subjects from day to day must be defined before any quantitative technique can be used reliably to document “real” changes in heart volume over time. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were performed several days apart in 30 subjects, including 20 normal subjects and 10 patients with stable coronary heart disease. Analyses of <b>light-pen</b> tracings provided measurements of end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and derived ejection fraction on both days, and differences in individual subjects between days were quantitated. Beat to beat, interobserver and in-traobserver variability also were assessed. Although group values changed little from day to day, individual volume changes were substantial in some cases. Confidence limits for individual measurements were derived from analyses of intrasubject variability and were as follows: end-diastolic volume ± 15 %, end-systolic volume ± 25 %, ejection fraction ± 10 %. Confidence limits in a larger group of subjects were narrower; in a group of 30 subjects, changes of greater than 2 % in end-diastolic volume, 5 % in end-systolic volume and 2 % in ejection fraction most likely represent real change. In-traobserver variability was minimal, but interobserver and beat to beat variability were of sufficient magnitude to suggest that serial measurements on a given subject be made ideally by a single person and that several cycles be averaged for a given measurement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth {{two-dimensional}} and M-mode echocardiography provide accurate {{estimates of}} left ventricular mass. However, their reproducibility in serial studies {{has not been}} compared, although this issue is critical to evaluation of regression of hypertrophy. To determine which technique provides more reproducible estimates of left ventricular mass, three serial studies were performed prospectively in each of eight normal adults over 5 months. Both two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiograms were obtained at each of these 24 studies. Measurements were performed by two independent observers {{who did not know}} patient identity. For the two-dimensional method, left ventricular mass was determined with use of a computer <b>light-pen</b> system and the truncated ellipsoid formula. For the M-mode method, mass was calculated from Penn convention measurements with use of the cube formula. At study 1 the group mean left ventricular mass by two-dimensional echocardiography (115 ± 20 g) did not differ from that by M-mode study (127 ± 37 g, p = NS). However, serial estimates of left ventricular mass were more reproducible by two-dimensional echocardiography. The mean difference among the three serial two-dimensional studies in each individual was 4. 8 ± 4 g (4. 2 ± 3 %) by the two-dimensional method, but was 18. 5 ± 13 g (14. 9 ± 10 %) by the M-mode method (p = 0. 01). Interobserver results for left ventricular mass by two-dimensional echocardiography correlated closely (r = 0. 95, n = 24, p < 0. 001). The superior reproducibility of two-dimensional echocardiographic estimates of left ventricular mass in normal adults supports the use of two-dimensional echocardiography when serial studies are to be performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} {{amorphous silicon}} position-sensitive detector (PSD) is {{usually in the}} form of large-area, continuous p-i-n silicon layer structure coupled with resistive layers next to the p and n Si layers. The device has many applications (e. g. light position measurements, <b>light-pen</b> input devices, etc.) and can be fabricated by using low-cost PECVD process. When used as a light-pen-based input device, several material-related design issues must be critically considered for achieving acceptable performance. The present work addresses three important issues, namely the spectral response of PSD, the uniformity requirement of the resistive layers, and the design of optical filter on the input side of PSD. They correspond to the signal-to-noise ratio of the device, the accuracy of light-position determination, and the integration problem with liquid crystal displays (LCD), respectively. Analytical analysis and computer simulation results draw the following important conclusions: (1) red-light-sensitive PSD can be obtained by properly tuning the thickness of p-layer and i-layer, which suppress the interference of background light when using the input device under sun light or similar illumination (2) the spot size of input light has little effect on position determination, as long as the size does not differ too much from that of required resolution. And a conservative uniformity requirement for the resistive layers can be obtained as Δ h/h {{less than or equal to}} 4 /n with n being the required number of pixels of display and h bring the film thickness (3) multi-layered filters made of oxides can be deposited on PSD to reflect non-signal light for LCD display while preserving the input-signal when the PSD is placed under a TN LCD.
