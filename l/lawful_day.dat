60|$|By the kindly {{rule of the}} phalanstery, every {{mother had}} {{complete}} freedom from household duties for {{two years after the}} birth of her child; and Clarence, though he would not willingly have given up his own particular work in the grounds and garden, spent all the time he could spare from his short daily task (every one worked five hours every <b>lawful</b> <b>day,</b> and few worked longer, save on special emergencies) by Olive's side. At last, the eight decades passed slowly away, and the fatal day for the removal of little Rosebud arrived. Olive called her Rosebud because, she said, she was a sweet bud that could never be opened into a full-blown rose. All the community felt the solemnity of the painful occasion; and by common consent the day (Darwin, December 20) was held as an intra-phalansteric fast by the whole body of brothers and sisters.|$|E
60|$|Being {{almost entirely}} uneducated, young Sloggins, {{when he reached}} man's estate, {{conceived}} that he would most benefit his fellow-creatures by combining the professions of the pulpit and the press--by preaching on Sundays and at odd times, while he acted as outdoor reporter to The Rowdy Puritan on every <b>lawful</b> <b>day.</b> Being {{a man of great}} earnestness and enterprise, he soon rose in the ranks of the Salvation Navy; and at one time commanded an evangelical barge on the benighted canals of our country. Finally, he made England almost too hot to hold him, by the original forms of his benevolence, while, at the same time, he acquired the utmost esteem and confidence of many wealthy philanthropists and excellent, if impulsive, ladies. These good people provided him with that well-equipped and armed steam yacht, the William Wilberforce, which he manned with a crew of converted characters (they certainly looked as if they must have needed a great deal of converting), and he had now for months been cruising in the South Pacific. A local cyclone had driven the William Wilberforce out of her reckoning, and hence the appearance of that vessel in the very nick of time to achieve my rescue.|$|E

5000|$|The Lex Aelia et Fufia (the Aelian and Fufian Law) was {{established}} {{around the year}} 150 BC in the Roman Republic.

5000|$|Christ {{requires}} {{that men do}} not take up arms even though this had been <b>lawful</b> in the <b>days</b> of Moses. All vengeance is the Lord's and is reserved for Judgment Day when {{the bodies of the}} reprobate shall become their own hells. Then shall all natural light be snuffed out, to be replaced by the return of chaos just as, in the beginning, earth and water had existed as uncreated substances. The act of creation consisted of God giving form and life to the elements through his word and his breath. Humans differ from their Creator and they know this because they see the elect and the damned and understand that all this can only have come about as a result of God's sovereign power.|$|R
