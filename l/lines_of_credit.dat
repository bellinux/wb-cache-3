Section 4C instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to direct directors at international financial institutions to veto the extension of loans and credit to the Zimbabwean government. According to the United States, these sanctions target only seven specific businesses owned or controlled by government officials and not ordinary citizens.|$|E

25|$|As {{the deal}} {{worked its way}} through state and federal {{regulatory}} approval, Dynegy took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced its debt.

25|$|However, this varied handcraft {{tradition}} faces challenges. Like {{other areas}} of Mexico, handcrafted goods must compete against cheaper, commercially made products and cheaper imitations. One problem that many artisans have, especially those who sell more expensive items such as furniture, is the inability to extend <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Michoacan artisans lack access to markets to sell and avenues to promote their products. One main market to which these artisans lack access is the tourism industry, valuable to other states in Mexico such as Oaxaca. One important reason {{for the lack of}} tourism is security concerns. As of 2012 11,640 artisans worked in the state, but most have income below the poverty line.|$|E
25|$|Despite slowing of the economy, as of June 2015 the Chinese stock index, the CSI 300 Index, {{which is}} based on 300 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, had risen nearly 150% over the past 12 months. In an effort to {{forestall}} damage from collapse of a possible economic bubble fueled by margin trading the central government raised requirements for margin lending. Economic damage from a crash in 2007-2008 was limited due to margin lending being highly restricted. In early July, after a fall in the markets of nearly 30% from their 12 June highs, there were efforts by blue-chip, often state-owned, firms, the Chinese securities industry, and the central government to stabilize the market by buying back stock and increasing purchases of the stock of established firms; however, much of the volatility has been in smaller, less-established firms that had been heavily invested in by unsophisticated, often working class, investors who had purchased stock based solely on its rapid increase in valuation. 80% of Chinese stocks are owned by individual investors, many novices. As of 10 July 2015 efforts by the China Securities Finance Corporation, CFS, a firm created by China's commodities and stock exchanges to finance trades, had apparently stabilized the market. Major Chinese securities firms were required by the China Securities Regulatory Commission to buy, and hold, a substantial amount of securities affected by the downturn. Using funds supplied by the central bank and commercial banks the China Securities Finance Corporation purchased enough stocks to halt the slide acquiring as much as 5% of the stock in some firms. <b>Lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> were extended by CFS to 21 securities firms, some of which also purchased up to 5% of some companies stocks. Some of the small cap stocks acquired may be overvalued.|$|E
