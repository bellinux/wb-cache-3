In this solution the <b>line</b> <b>load</b> is interpreted as a body force loading and by assuming the <b>line</b> <b>load</b> {{to be of the}} form of a Dirac delta function the solution of Mindlin's {{problem of a}} point load within the interior of the half space is obtained.

40|$|Equations are {{developed}} which govern the deflection response of long cylindrical panels {{subjected to a}} <b>line</b> <b>load.</b> The <b>line</b> <b>load</b> is directed {{toward the center of}} curvature of the panel, is located at an arbitrary point along the arc length of the panel, and is included at an arbitrary angle relative to the radial direction. Only the geometrically linear problem is considered and the spatial dependence in the problem is reduced to one independent variable, specifically, the arc length along the panel. The problem is thus solvable in closed form. Both symmetrically laminated and the less common unsymmetrically laminated simply supported panels are studied. The unsymmetrically laminated case was considered because the natural shape of an unsymmetric laminate is cylindrical. Results are presented which show the influence of the location and inclination of the <b>line</b> <b>load</b> on panel deflection. Shallow and deep panels are considered. Both the symmetric and unsymmetric panels exhibit similar behavior, the unsymmetric configurations being less stiff. Limited experimental results are presented...|$|E

5000|$|Once a DC {{operating}} point {{is defined by}} the DC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> an AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> can be drawn through the Q point. The AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> is a straight line with a slope equal to the AC impedance facing the nonlinear device, which is in general different from the DC resistance. The ratio of AC voltage to current in the device is defined by this line. Because the impedance of the reactive components will vary with frequency, the slope of the AC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> depends on the frequency of the applied signal. So there are many AC <b>load</b> <b>lines,</b> that vary from the DC <b>load</b> <b>line</b> (at low frequency) to a limiting AC <b>load</b> <b>line,</b> all having a common intersection at the DC {{operating point}}.

40|$|The basic inverse source {{problem of}} {{acoustic}} emission is {{the determination of}} the nature and location of the internal source from surface measurements of the transient elastic waves generated by the AE event. As pointed out by Sachse [1], this inverse problem requires a knowledge of the dynamic Green’s function for the structure under examination. The evaluation of this dynamic Green’s function is therefore a pivotal problem in the application of the techniques to monitor internal events in engineering structures. This paper deals with {{the determination of the}} transient motion of a four-ply fiber composite laminate resulting from an internal impulsive <b>line</b> <b>load</b> acting in the mid-plane of the plate in a direction normal to the mid-plane. The source function for acoustic emission associated with delamination will be located at one or other of the interfaces between the plies and the results presented here complement those of the earlier paper [2] which deals with an impulsive <b>line</b> <b>load</b> acting on the upper interface. Because of symmetry, the response to a <b>line</b> <b>load</b> at the lower interface may be deduced immediately from this upper interface solution...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of transmission <b>lines</b> <b>loaded</b> with pairs of magnetically coupled resonators. We have considered two different structures: (i) a microstrip <b>line</b> <b>loaded</b> with pairs of stepped impedance resonators (SIRs), and (ii) a coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission <b>line</b> <b>loaded</b> with pairs of split ring resonators (SRRs). In both cases, the line exhibits a single resonance frequency (transmission zero) if the resonators are identical (symmetric structure with regard to the line axis), and this resonance is different to the one of the <b>line</b> <b>loaded</b> with a single resonator due to inter-resonator coupling. If the structures are asymmetric, inter-resonator coupling enhances the distance between the two split resonance frequencies that arise. In spite that the considered <b>lines</b> and <b>loading</b> resonators are very different and are described by different lumped element equivalent circuit models, the phenomenology associated to the effects of coupling is exactly the same, and the resonance frequencies are given by identical expressions. The reported lumped element circuit models of both structures are validated by comparing the circuit simulations with extracted parameters with both electromagnetic simulations and experimental data. These structures can be useful for the implementation of microwave sensors based on symmetry properties...|$|R

Details are presented on the Tarsiut Caissons, the Single Steel Drilling Caisson (SSDC), the Caisson Retained Island (CRI), and the Molikpaq. Details on the ice-load measuring instrumentation are presented {{for each of the}} drill sites where an ice-load measurement program took place. The global loads on the structures are presented as a <b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> (Global Load per width of the structure) and the Global Pressure (<b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> per ice thickness).

The analysis shows that there is a general increase in the <b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> with increasing ice thickness. The data show considerable scatter. Much of the scatter can be explained by examining the failure mode of the ice during the interaction process.

For a diagonally applied constant <b>line</b> <b>load</b> f, resulting from a combination of a <b>line</b> <b>load</b> perpendicular to the neutral axis, q, and a <b>line</b> <b>load</b> parallel to the neutral axis, f_N, we use N_ 1, 2, 0 = - 3 (1 - ξ)^ 4 + 4 (1 - ξ)^ 3, N_ 2, 2, 0 = - 3 ξ ^ 4 + 4 ξ ^ 3, as above. We set β _ 1, 2, 0 = γ _ 2, β _ 2, 2, 0 = γ _ 2, γ _ 2 ∈R, such that ∂ _s κ(ξ [...]) = 12 γ _ 1 ξ ^ 2 - 12 γ _ 1 ξ, consistent with the linear beam theory. As there is a <b>line</b> <b>load</b> {{in the direction of the}} beam, we must also determine the coefficients β _ 1, 1, 0, β _ 2, 1, 0, which are related to the dilatations (r= 1). Because the impact of the line force in the longitudinal direction on the curvature of the beam vanishes for [...] u= [...] 0, we can drop the optional restriction ∂ p_I, 2, 0 = 0 (see Table 8 in Appendix 1). Thus, Q̅_I= 0 for I∈{ 1, 2 }, and the shape functions related to the dilatations, which result in a change in the normal force in the linear beam theory, are given as N_ 1, 1, 0 = (1 - ξ)^ 2, N_ 2, 1, 0 = ξ ^ 2. From the linear theory, we know that ∂ _f_Nε(ξ [...]) = 1 /EA (-ξ + 1 / 2). Using Eq. 33 a, we see that β _ 1, 1, 0 = 1 / 2 γ _ 1, β _ 2, 1, 0 = - 1 / 2 γ _ 1, γ _ 1 ∈R, result in ∂ _s ε (ξ [...]) = -γ _ 1 ξ + 1 / 2 γ _ 1, conforming to the linear theory.|$|E

Details are presented on the Tarsiut Caisson, the Single-Steel Drilling Caisson (SSDC), the Caisson-Retained Island (CRI), and the Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) Molikpaq. The global loads on the structures are presented as a <b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> (Global Load per unit width of the structure) and the Global Pressure (<b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> per unit ice thickness). Over 170 loading events are documented. There is excellent agreement amongst the measured loads {{on all of the}} structures if factors such as ice rubble and ice thickness are considered. Global loads are shown to be a function of the ice macrostructure (level first-year sea ice, multi-year ice, first-year ridges, hummock fields, isolated floes) and failure mode of the ice (bending, creep, mixed mode, crushing). The analysis shows that there is a general increase in the <b>Line</b> <b>Load</b> with increasing ice thickness. Empirical equations are presented to predict the global load in terms of the ice thickness and structure width for different ice failure modes. The most significant result of the analysis shows that the maximum Global Pressure measured for all types of ice loading events never exceeded 2 MN/m 2, with the vast majority less than 1. 5 MN/m 2.
