500|$|The United States used (some {{states still}} do, as they await state regulation) {{different}} grading standards. Maple syrup {{was divided into}} two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber. In Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for <b>lighter</b> <b>syrups,</b> but using letters: [...] "AA", [...] "A", etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baumé scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.|$|R

5000|$|Rasgulla is a syrupy dessert {{popular in}} the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and {{semolina}} dough, cooked in <b>light</b> <b>syrup</b> made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The dish originated in East India; {{in the past the}} present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be the birthplace of the dish.

40|$|The rapid loss {{of fruit}} {{firmness}} is a qualitative decisive factor for characterizing apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) use (fresh or processed) and commercialization pathways (short or storage). To {{better understand the}} texture variability in apricot, we studied {{the impact of a}} heat treatment as a function of fruit harvest stage on a large range of cultivars. Eighteen apricot cultivars were characterized at two maturity stages before and after cooking (85 °C in <b>light</b> <b>syrup).</b> A compression test allowed sorting the fruits to obtain homogeneous batches. Kramer shear tests provided global firmness of cooked fruits and puncture tests were performed on the median equatorial area of apricot flesh for fresh and cooked fruits. Among the registered variables, the apricot texture expressed by the “Work to limit” integrates the global evolution and allows a good discrimination of the ripening effect. The texture data was used to classify the varieties according to their firmness and suitability for industrial processing. Thus Vertige, Candide and Gaterie, followed by Orangered and Bergarouge, have been found as the most suitable cultivars for industrial processe...|$|E
40|$|Maple syrup is {{generally}} {{produced in the}} early spring from February through April w. hen maple sap runs from the maple trees. It is traditionally known that maple syrup tends to be darker when the maple syrup is produced from the sap in the later season. According to the maple syrup grading system in the United States, the darker syrup is given lower grades and values than the lighter syrup. Interestingly, some consumers, however, prefer dark syrup to <b>light</b> <b>syrup.</b> Therefore, the seasonal variation of important maple syrup parameters was investigated. The other aspect {{of this study was to}} determine whether the filtration process in maple syrup production removes some nutritional value from the product. In this research, five different seasonal filtered maple syrup samples and their unfiltered samples were compared with respect to their physical properties (density, absorption spectrum, solid content, and water activity) and their chemical properties (pH, mineral contents and sugar contents). It was found that the concentrations of calcium, iron, fructose, and glucose tended to be higher, while sucrose tendedto be lower as the season progressed. The filtration process did not seem to be a significant factor in influencing the concentrations of minerals and sugars. The Graduate Schoo...|$|E
50|$|They are {{traditionally}} {{served as a}} side dish with a meal. As a breakfast item they are often eaten with butter and a sweet condiment such as molasses, <b>light</b> sugarcane <b>syrup,</b> maple syrup, sorghum syrup, honey, or fruit jam or jelly. With other meals, they are usually eaten with butter or gravy instead of sweet condiments. However, biscuits and gravy (biscuits covered in country gravy) or biscuits with sausage are usually served for breakfast, sometimes as the main course. A biscuit may also be used to make a breakfast sandwich by slicing it in half and placing eggs and/or breakfast meat in the middle.|$|R
5000|$|In India, {{milk solids}} are {{prepared}} by heating milk over a low flame {{for a long}} time until most of the water content has evaporated. These milk solids, known as khoya in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, are kneaded into a dough, sometimes with a pinch of flour, and then shaped into small balls and deep-fried at a low temperature of about 148 °C. [...] The balls are then soaked in a <b>light</b> sugary <b>syrup</b> flavored with green cardamom and rose water, kewra or saffron.

5000|$|Agave syrups {{are sold}} in light, amber, dark, and raw varieties. <b>Light</b> agave <b>syrup</b> has a mild, almost neutral flavor, and is {{therefore}} sometimes used in delicate-tasting dishes and beverages. Amber agave syrup has a medium-intensity caramel flavor and is therefore used in dishes and drinks with stronger flavors. Dark agave syrup has stronger caramel notes and imparts a distinct flavor to dishes, such as some desserts, poultry, meat, and seafood dishes. Both amber and dark agave syrups are sometimes used [...] "straight out of the bottle" [...] as a topping for pancakes, waffles, and French toast. The dark version is unfiltered and therefore contains a higher concentration of the agave plant's minerals.|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{diseases}} and healthy eating An alarming increase in such chronic diseases as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, and {{some types of}} cancer has occurred {{over the past decade}} (Kant 2004). Improving diet quality by eating more whole grains and fruit and vegetables, and by eating less fat and refined sugar could help lower the incidence or severity of these diseases. Meeting these dietary recommendations does not necessarily require consumers to make major changes in their diet. Simple changes can be effective, such as substituting 100 percent whole wheat bread for white bread, lean ground beef for regular ground beef, low-fat milk for whole milk, or canned fruit in a <b>light</b> <b>syrup</b> for canned fruit in a heavy syrup. Few Americans successfully follow the USDA dietary guidelines, and low-income consumers are even less likely to meet them. When asked about barriers that prevented them from eating healthier foods, low-income consumers frequently cited high prices and difficulty in accessing healthier choices. However, no comprehensive studies have compared the cost of standard market goods to the cost of healthier substitutes. Measuring availability and prices In this study we compare the availability and cost of the standard Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) market baske...|$|E
40|$|The time {{dependence}} of the liking of foodstuffs was investigated in a study with 25 subjects, consisting of three parts: (1) on day one, a sensory specific satiety study, which was extended until 125 min after consumption; (2) on days two to seven, a repeated in home taste and evaluation study; (3) on day eight, a second sensory specific satiety study as in 1. In parts 1 and 3, {{subjects were asked to}} eat either cheese biscuits or pears in <b>light</b> <b>syrup</b> to satiety. The change in liking of both foodstuffs, after eating one of the two foodstuffs to satiety, was followed during 125 min. In part 2, the same subjects were asked to taste and evaluate each product at home, every day for six days. In the sensory specific satiety studies (parts 1 and 3) a significant decrease in liking was observed for the product eaten to satiety, as long as 125 min after consuming that product to satiety. For both products contrast effects were observed: the liking of the uneaten product increased after eating the other product to satiety, while liking of the eaten product decreased. This contrast effect lasted longer after eating cheese biscuits to satiety, than after eating pears to satiety. In the in home taste and evaluation study, a significant and linear decrease in liking was observed for both products during six days. There was a significant effect (p < 0. 05) of eating cheese biscuits to satiety in the sensory specific satiety study on day 1, on the liking ratings of the in home consumption study. No such effect was observed for the pears. The results indicate that sensory specific satiety is relatively strong for more than 2 h after consumption and can have effects on liking ratings for more than 24 h. These effects were different for the products tested. Based on these results, we suggest that combining eating a product to satiety and in home evaluation over several days, could possibly be useful as an accelerated method to predict changes in liking upon repeated consumption. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Light</b> {{and thick}} <b>syrup</b> storage is {{the storage of}} {{manufactured}} thick juice during the normal beet or cane campaign in order to process them during the “off season”. As {{there may be some}} changes in their properties during storage, syrups had been studied on physicochemical properties in three time intervals during 44 days to evaluate the changes amounts. The results showed significant decrease in brix, pH, Purity percentage (Q) and polarization and significant increase in color of both studied syrups (p< 0. 05). Density was approximately unchanged. Considering to the results, the determinant factor for all the studied properties in both syrups was pH, which decreased during storage and influenced the other properties. According to the changes, which may specially because of pH reduction and inversion occurring during storage, Controlling the production and storage situation in good quality can minimize the loss of quality and the degradation of product due to the storage time. These results also suggest that temperature and passing the time are the main factors affecting the quality of sucrose syrups, so that keeping them stored is be acceptable up to 22 days after production {{in order to keep the}} syrups properties almost unchanged and control the probable changes...|$|R
50|$|Week 12(b) - The Biggest Loser Cook-Off - This {{challenge}} was {{set by the}} trainers (Shannon and Michelle) {{to see how much}} the contestants had learnt about healthy cooking. Each contestant had 45 minutes to prepare an entrée, a main and a dessert. Each course had to include {{at least one of the}} three base ingredients: blueberries, chicken and bok choy. Shannon and Michelle would be the judges, and judge each dish on presentation and taste. The winner of the challenge would win a $4500 Everdure barbecue. Sammy presented her courses first: grilled eggplant with mushroom, cottage cheese and bok choy for entrée; stir-fried snow peas, carrot, mushroom, onion, garlic and chilli with Worcestershire and soy sauces for the main course; and carb-smart ice cream with berries and vanilla essence for dessert. Tiffany was next and presented: grilled capsicum and garlic bok choy tapas with cottage cheese for entrée; mustard chicken on a bed of lime and lemon greens for main course; and vanilla blueberries and yoghurt for dessert. Cameron then served his courses: cajun chicken and mushroom for entrée; stir-fried chicken with bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, capsicum, with worcestershire sauce for main course; and blueberries with yoghurt and <b>light</b> chocolate <b>syrup</b> for dessert. Sharif was the favourite to win the competition, being the best chef in the house. He first presented his entrée, baby spinach salad with cottage cheese and balsamic dressing (containing red, yellow and green capsicum, Spanish onion and cherry tomatoes), but unfortunately he forgot to put bok choy in the dish. He then presented the main course: wilted bok choy with stir-fried chicken, chilli, garlic and ginger plus a squeeze of lemon. His dessert was a punnet of blueberries with 100g of cottage cheese and a raspberry cooler on top. The judges awarded one point each to a contestant that they felt had the best dish within each course. Sammy got both points for the entrée. Tiffany got both points for the main course. For the dessert, Shannon gave a point to Tiffany and Michelle gave a point to Sharif. Therefore, Tiffany won the challenge and the barbecue with 3 points. Shannon and Michelle also awarded the Coach's Encouragement Award to Cameron because he has improved so much.|$|R
