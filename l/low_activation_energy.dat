50|$|Class II, {{which are}} {{intermediate}} in character. There is some localization of distinct valences, {{but there is}} a <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for their interconversion. Some thermal activation is required to induce electron transfer from one site to another via the bridge. These species exhibit an intense Intervalence charge transfer (IT or IVCT) band, a broad intense absorption in the IR- or visible part of the spectrum, and also exhibit magnetic exchange coupling at low temperatures. The degree of interaction between the metal sites can be estimated from the absorption profile of the IVCT band and the spacing between the sites. This type of complex is common when metals are in different ligand fields. For example, Prussian blue is an iron(II,III)-cyanide complex in which there is an iron(II) atom surrounded by six carbon atoms of six cyanide ligands bridged to an iron(III) atom by their nitrogen ends. In the Turnbull's blue preparation, an iron(II) solution is mixed with an iron(III) cyanide (c-linked) complex. An electron-transfer reaction occurs via the cyanide ligands to give iron(III) associated with an iron(II)-cyanide complex.|$|E
50|$|Common {{aspects of}} synthesis: With the aerographite's CVD process metal oxides had {{been shown in}} 2012 to be a {{suitable}} template for deposition of graphitic structures. The templates can be in situ removed. Basic mechanism is the reduction of metal oxide to a metallic constituent, the nucleation of carbon in {{and on top of}} metal and the simultaneous evaporation of metal component.Requirements for the metal oxides are: a <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> for chemical reduction, a metal phase, which can nucleate graphite, a low evaporation point of metal phase (ZnO, SnO).From engineering perspective, the developed CVD process enables the use of ceramic powder processing (use of custom particles and sintering bridges) for creation of templates for 3D carbon via CVD. Key advantages compared to commonly used metal templates are: shape variety of particle shapes, the creation of sintering bridges and the removal without acids.Originally demonstrated on just µm-sized meshed graphite networks, the CVD mechanism had been adopted after 2014 by other scientists to create nm-sized carbon structures. Details specific to reference: Aerographite is produced by chemical vapor deposition, using a ZnO template. The template consists of micron-thick rods, often in the shape of multipods, that can be synthesized by mixing comparable amounts of Zn and polyvinyl butyral powders and heating the mixture at 900 °C. The aerographite synthesis is carried out at ~760 °C, under an argon gas flow, to which toluene vapors are injected as a carbon source. A thin (~15 nm), discontinuous layer of carbon is deposited on ZnO which is then etched away by adding hydrogen gas to the reaction chamber. Thus the remaining carbon network closely follows the morphology of the original ZnO template. In particular, the nodes of the aerographite network originate from the joints of the ZnO multipods.|$|E
50|$|GeSbTe is a ternary {{compound}} of germanium, antimony, and tellurium, with composition GeTe-Sb2Te3. In the GeSbTe system, {{there is a}} pseudo-line as shown upon {{which most of the}} alloys lie. Moving down this pseudo-line, {{it can be seen that}} as we go from Sb2Te3 to GeTe, the melting point and glass transition temperature of the materials increase, crystallization speed decreases and data retention increases. Hence, in order to get high data transfer rate, we need to use material with fast crystallization speed such as Sb2Te3. This material is not stable because of its <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b> On the other hand, materials with good amorphous stability like GeTe has slow crystallization speed because of its high activation energy. In its stable state, crystalline GeSbTe has two possible configurations: hexagonal and a metastable face centered cubic (FCC) lattice. When it is rapidly crystallized however, it was found to have a distorted rocksalt structure. GeSbTe has a glass transition temperature of around 100 °C. GeSbTe also has many vacancy defects in the lattice, of 20 to 25% depending on the specific GeSbTe compound. Hence, Te has an extra lone pair of electrons, which are important for many of the characteristics of GeSbTe. Crystal defects are also common in GeSbTe and due to these defects, an Urbach tail in the band structure is formed in these compounds. GeSbTe is generally p type and there are many electronic states in the band gap accounting for acceptor and donor like traps. GeSbTe has two stable states, crystalline and amorphous. The phase change mechanism from high resistance amorphous phase to low resistance crystalline phase in nano-timescale and threshold switching are two of the most important characteristic of GeSbTe.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the results of}} NMR relaxation studies of fast ion glasses {{in the light of}} variable frequency electrical conductivity measurements. We show that the <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> observed for relaxation processes studied at constant frequency below the temperature of the T 1 minimum is reproduced by the corresponding constant frequency conductivity measurements. Other characteristics of the constant frequency conductivity in this <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> regime, such as the unphysically low pre-exponent, match with the corresponding observations for NMR measurements. Since the activation energy observed at constant frequency in the frequency-dependent regime for conductivity depends on the characteristic departure from exponential relaxation for the conductivity process, we conclude that the NMR activation energy is likewise a simple consequence of the nonexponential character of ionic relaxation in the glass. In this case, the <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> attributed to processes probed by NMR relaxation is simply a misinterpretation since it is found, in the wide frequency range studies available to admittance bridge measurements, that all elements of the relaxation spectrum have essentially equal activation energies...|$|E
40|$|Many glasses show {{relatively}} high lithium ion conductivities which result from <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energies.</b> Following Anderson and Stuart, the <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> {{is attributed to}} (i) the elastic distortion of "doorways" and (ii) the separation of cationic from anionic charges.
