The interaction of SO 2 with Al 2 O 3 was studied experimentally using B. E. T., thermogravimetry and temperature-programmed desorption. Adsorption takes place through a wide range of binding energies, with some SO 2 adsorbing irreversibly at temperatures below 800 °C. The amount adsorbed depends on the surface history and thermal treatment. An adsorption isotherm based on a bimodal energy distribution provides an adequate description of the equilibrium process. The chemical composition, sulfation and regeneration of an alkali-alumina sorbent for sulfur dioxide were studied using thermogravimetry, gas chromatography, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The active sorbent consists of a thin layer of sodium and <b>lithium</b> <b>aluminates</b> supported on alumina. The rate of sulfation is proportional to the SO 2 concentration in the gas, up to [SO 2] [approx. ] 5000 ppm. The activation energy of the sulfation is E = 21. 6 kcal/mole. The sulfated sorbent was regenerated by reduction with CO at 700 - 800 °C. Sulfur removal from the sorbent and distribution of gaseous products were measured at different alkali loadings, temperatures and CO concentrations.

40|$|Exploring the {{reactivity}} of mixed-metal synergic bases, {{it is found}} that the <b>lithium</b> TMP <b>aluminate</b> iBu 3 Al(TMP) Li functions as a dual TMP/alkyl base, exhibiting 2 -fold AMMAl (alkali-metal-mediated alumination) toward TMEDA to yield the heterobimetallic bis-(deprotonated TMEDA) derivative [Li{Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 N(Me) CH 2 } 2 Al(iBu) 2] (2). In contrast, the amide enriched aluminate iBu 2 Al(TMP) 2 Li acts as only a single-fold amido base toward TMEDA or PMDETA to afford the amine-deprotonated derivatives [Li{Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 N(Me) CH 2 }(TMP) Al(iBu) 2] (4) and [Li{Me 2 NCH 2 CH 2 N(Me) CH 2 CH 2 N(Me) CH 2 }(TMP) Al(iBu) 2] (5), respectively. On their own, the aluminum compounds iBu 3 Al or iBu 2 Al(TMP) are not sufficiently strong bases to metalate TMEDA or PMDETA, so in 2, 4, and 5, the α-deprotonations of TMEDA and PMDETA are synergic in origin, as the intramolecular communication between Li and Al appears to activate the TMP and iBu bases. This special behavior can be attributed to intramolecular proximity effects between the active base component (TMP or iBu) and the ligating TMEDA or PMDETA molecule. X-ray crystallography studies reveal 2 is a contacted ion-pair ate containing two α-aluminated TMEDA ligands, which chelate the lithium cation which is linked to the distorted tetrahedral Al center by two N bridges from the metalated junction of the TMEDA molecules.

Thus, the higher alkaline LixAln(OH) (m) (+z) complexed cations can penetrate into interlayers of birnessite at a higher rate.

40|$|A {{series of}} heavy {{alkaline}} earth metal tetrazolate complexes has been synthesized that contain metal ions saturated by aqua ligands. Tetrazolates with small ring-core carbon substituents favor formation of two dimensional polymers with u 3 -coordination of the tetrazolate {{to the metal}} centers. Tetrazolates with bulkier groups block coordination to the 1 - and 4 -nitrogen atoms, resulting in monomer formation. The first example of a trihydro(tetrazolyl) borate was prepared, and its bonding is heavily influenced by the basic BH 3 moiety. 18 -Crown- 6 adducts of dihydrobis(tetrazolyl) borate complexes have been prepared that contain B-N bonding to the 2 -nitrogen atoms, due to bulky ring-core atom substituents. A series of alkali metal hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complexes has been prepared by closely monitoring the reactions by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The lithium hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complex contains k 3 -N,N,N bonding that is analgous to the bonding mode of hydrotris(pyrazolyl) borate ligands. The 18 -crown- 6 adducts of the sodium and potassium hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate salts adopt n 2 -N,N and k 2 -N,H coordination modes, respectively, due to steric hindrances between the 18 -crown- 6 and hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate ligands. The bonding modes of the hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate complexes are stabilized by many hydrogen-bonding and dihydrogen-bonding contacts between the hydrotris(tetrazolyl) borate ligand and the ancillary ligand on the metal center. A series of poly(pyrazolyl) aluminate complexes containing aluminum-hydrogen bonds has been prepared, and these complexes exhibit similar coordination modes to their poly(pyrazolyl) borate analogues. Pyrazolyl exchange processes occur at room temperature in solution due to the weak Al-N and Al-H bonds. Salt metathesis of the new complexes with metal(II) halides yielded ligand, hydride, or pyrazolate transfer, depending on the metal and reaction conditions. The reactivity of 5 -substituted tetrazoles with lithium aluminum hydride was investigated {{in an attempt to}} prepare tetrakis(tetrazolyl) aluminate salts at low temperatures to avoid thermal decomposition of the parent tetrazoles. The reactions yielded complex reaction mixtures that were only soluble in polar solvents.

Characterization by Auger spectroscopy of a AlN + 0. 04 wt%Y specimen exposed at 600 C indicated the possibility of a <b>lithium</b> <b>aluminate</b> compound formation. Bulk, polycrystalline specimens of CaO (99. 9 % purity) showed mass losses above 500 C indicating a possible dissolution problem that had not been observed in previous short-term screening tests and is not predicted based on thermodynamic calculations. Doping of the lithium with oxygen (in the case of CaO) did not appear effective in reducing the mass loss at 600 C...|$|E
