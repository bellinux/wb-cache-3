25|$|Camp Bucca {{has been}} {{described}} as playing an important role in shaping the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The detention of large numbers of Jihadists and ex-Ba’athists during the Iraqi insurgency provided them with the opportunity to forge alliances and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> combining the ideological fervour of the former with the organizational skills of the latter. Former Camp Bucca detainees who went on to become leaders in the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant include Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, detained between 2005 and 2010 during the Iraq conflict and who is now an ISIS senior leader, its chief spokesman and is said to be running the entire country of Syria. Al-Adnani, in 2014, called for lone wolf attacks throughout the world and is thought to be the inspiration for terrorist attacks throughout France. He was killed in an airstrike in Northern Syria on 31 August 2016. Others include Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the ISIL; Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, al-Baghdadi's deputy; Haji Bakr, who spearheaded ISIL's expansion into Syria; Abu Abdulrahman al-Bilawi, the military leader responsible for planning the seizure of Mosul; and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, another senior military leader.

We believe that this is because no framework exists for conducting user evaluations of ubicomp applications. In this paper, we propose a framework in hopes of making it easier for researchers to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> results, to create effective discount evaluation techniques and design guidelines for ubicomp, to provide a mechanism for researchers to share what they have learned about the appropriateness of different evaluation techniques, and to provide structure so that key areas of evaluation are not overlooked. ...|$|R

Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics {{when he began to}} move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'. Coltrane later said of this criticism: [...] "they made it appear that we didn't even {{know the first thing about}} music (...) it hurt me to see [...] get hurt in this thing." ...|$|E

40|$|Failure in {{research}} is an increasingly hot topic, with high-profile crises {{of confidence in}} the published research literature in medicine and psychology. Among the major factors in this research crisis are the many incentives to report and publish only positive findings. These incentives prevent the field in general <b>from</b> <b>learning</b> <b>from</b> negative findings, and almost entirely preclude the publication of mistakes and errors. Thus providing an alternative forum for practitioners and researchers to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> failures can be very productive. The first LAK Failathon, held in 2016, provided just such an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to share their failures and negative findings in a lower-stakes environment, to help participants <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> mistakes. It was very successful, and there was strong support for running it as an annual event. This workshop will build on that success, with twin objectives to provide an environment for individuals to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> failures, and also to co-develop plans for how we as a field can better build and deploy our evidence base...|$|R

2500|$|Several {{models have}} shown how {{relatively}} simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize {{a system of}} sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al., as well as de Boer, and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory, showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel it thinks it has heard, whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If this matches the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed. [...] "Through repeated interactions," [...] according to de Boer, [...] "vowel systems emerge that are {{very much like the}} ones found in human languages." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{started with}} Knowles almost entirely {{obscured}} by smoke, walking {{towards the front}} of the stage and striking a pose in silhouette with only one beam of light illuminating her as she sang several lines of [...] "Déjà Vu". The lights went up and Knowles was revealed wearing spangly gold leotard and stilettos joined by two dancers in PVC catsuits and an all-female band who started playing the opening horns of [...] "Crazy in Love". More PVC-clad dancers emerged, while canons {{on either side of the}} stage puffed clouds of glitter out over the crowd and confetti were also dropped on stage as Knowles sang the song. She continued to perform [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] while banks of bright orange lights were displayed on stage. During [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] Knowles bent backwards at her guitarist's feet. She asked the crowd [...] "Are ya'll ready to dance?" [...] and went on singing [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] wearing a sequin dress while performing dance routines. Knowles later emerged atop a giant lighted flight of stairs wearing a white leotard and sang [...] "Smash Into You" [...] – the staircase was the show's biggest piece of equipment. She performed [...] "Ave Maria" [...] in a white dress which was later turned into a bridal dress after a veil was put on her head by the backing dancers. She sang the song with an operatic soprano voice adding an excerpt from Sarah McLachlan's [...] "Angel" [...] and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria". She continued on to sing [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] wearing a white bustier with a sheer, flowing wrap. At the conclusion of the song, outtakes from the music video of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] were shown before she appeared to perform the aforementioned song wearing Ray-Bans, a leather breastplate, aviator shades and a bulletproof-looking one-piece further asking the crowd to sing along the track. She included an excerpt from Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and Tupac Shakur's [...] "California Love" [...] while also doing several moves like a male. A video interlude directed by Melina Matsoukas was shown as excerpts from [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] was played in the background. The video showed Knowles as a robot further interacting with a cheetah as a mechanical voice intoned Sasha Fierce. This was a short introduction before Knowles performed the electro song [...] "Diva" [...] dressed in a leopard print leotard. She appeared at the top of the staircase with her backup dancers behind her while another video interlude showing Knowles singing and dancing at the age of five was shown. She then sang [...] "Radio" [...] while a clip was projected on the screen showing her dancing as a child. [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] was introduced with a brief speech about female empowerment with Knowles saying [...] "Ladies, we need each other. We need to <b>learn</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and we need to empower each other". [...] "Ego" [...] and [...] "Hello" [...] were also performed afterwards.|$|E
