5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

25|$|When the {{locomotive}} is running under power, a draught {{on the fire}} is created by the exhaust steam directed up the chimney by the blastpipe. Without draught, the fire will quickly die down and steam pressure will fall. When {{the locomotive}} is stopped, or coasting with the regulator closed, there is no exhaust steam to create a draught, so the draught is maintained {{by means of a}} blower. This is a ring placed either {{around the base of the}} chimney, or around the blast pipe orifice, containing several small steam nozzles directed up the chimney. These nozzles are fed with steam directly from the boiler, controlled by the blower valve. When the regulator is open, the blower valve is closed; when the driver intends to close the regulator, he will first open the blower valve. It is important that the blower be opened before the regulator is closed, since without draught on the fire, there may be backdraught – where atmospheric air blows down the chimney, causing the flow of hot gases through the boiler tubes to be reversed, with the fire itself being blown through the firehole onto the footplate, with serious consequences for the crew. The risk of backdraught is higher when the locomotive enters a tunnel because of the pressure shock. The blower is also used to create draught when steam is being raised at the start of the locomotive's duty, at any time when the driver needs to increase the draught on the fire, and to clear smoke from the driver's <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of a strictly applied inject and extend protocol for ranibizumab treatment of age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: This is a prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized trial. Patients underwent standard induction with 3 intravitreal doses of 0. 5 mg ranibizumab, each 1 month apart. Following this induction, patients were evaluated and received an injection at each visit. If they did not meet set criteria for signs of exudative disease the interval to the next visit was extended by 2 weeks and if exudative disease was present the interval was shortened by 2 weeks. RESULTS: Vision improved by 1. 3 lines (P = 0. 008); 26 % gained ≥ 3 <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> 74 % lost no <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> and 95 % avoided loss <b>of</b> ≥ 3 <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> CONCLUSION: This study shows that the Inject and Extend protocol is safe and efficacious {{for the treatment of}} age-related macular degeneration.

40|$|PURPOSE: To examine predisposing factors, {{treatment}} costs, {{and visual}} outcome of microbial keratitis in an ophthalmic casualty and inpatient population. DESIGN: Retrospective medical records review. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen- to 64 -year-olds with microbial keratitis treated at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital between May 2001 and April 2003 (n = 291). METHODS: Risk factors were identified from patient files. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data; severity; outpatient visits; hospital bed days; and vision loss were examined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost to treat (Australian dollars), vision loss, and factors influencing these outcomes. RESULTS: Ocular trauma (106 / 291 [36. 4 %]) and contact lens (CL) wear (98 / 291 [33. 7 %]) {{were the most}} commonly identified predisposing factors; 18 (6. 1 %) had multiple predisposing factors; 17 (5. 8 %), ocular surface disease; 20 (6. 9 %), herpetic eye disease; 4 (1. 4 %), systemic associations; 5 (1. 7 %), other; and 23 (7. 9 %), unknown cause.

Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive series {{of patients in}} a single vitreoretinal practice. Patients with symptomatic distortion and loss <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> secondary to VMT {{were included in the}} study. Patients received a single injection of ocriplasmin (JETREA®) and were followed-up after 1 month with optical coherence tomography. Results: Eight patients (8 eyes) were included (2 males and 6 females) in the study. Five of 8 eyes (62. 5 %) experienced complete release of the VMT; one of 8 eyes (12. 5 %) had partial release of VMT and two of 8 eyes (25 %) did not have release of VMT. The two patients with no release of their VMT had the same <b>vision.</b> <b>Of</b> the 5 patients with complete release of VMT, 3 patients had a one <b>line</b> worsening <b>of</b> their <b>vision,</b> 1 had a 4 <b>line</b> improvement <b>of</b> <b>vision,</b> and 1 stayed the same.

2500|$|Blomstedt himself died prematurely in 1935, aged 35. The {{significant}} {{vehicle for}} the development of modernism in Finland was his contemporary, Alvar Aalto, who was a friend of Asplund as well as key Swedish architect Sven Markelius. The latter had invited Aalto to join Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), ostensibly run by Le Corbusier. Aalto's reputation as a significant contributor to modernism was endorsed by his involvement in CIAM and by the inclusion of his works in significant architectural journals worldwide as well as significant histories of architecture, notably in the second edition (1949) of Space, Time and Architecture by the secretary-general of CIAM, Sigfried Giedion. Aalto's significant buildings from the early period of Modernism, which basically corresponded to the theoretical principles and architectural aesthetic of Le Corbusier and other modernist architects such as Walter Gropius, include the Turku Sanomat newspaper offices, Turku, Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium (1932) (part of a nationwide campaign for tuberculosis sanatorium construction) and Viipuri Library (1927–35). Central to Functionalism was paying close attention to how the building is used. In the case of the Aalto's Paimio tuberculosis sanatorium, the starting point for the design, he himself claimed, was to make the building itself a contributor to the healing process. Aalto liked to call the building a [...] "medical instrument". For instance, particular attention was paid to the design of the patient bedrooms: these generally held two patients, each with his or her own cupboard and washbasin. Aalto designed special non-splash basins, so that the patient would not disturb the other while washing. The patients spent many hours lying down, and thus Aalto placed the lamps in the room out of the patients <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> and painted the ceiling a relaxing dark green so as to avoid glare. Each patient had their own specially designed cupboard, fixed to the wall and off the floor so as to aid in cleaning beneath it.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the features and outcomes {{of patients with}} AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis after {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} availability. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 30 consecutive patients (44 eyes) with AIDS and newly diagnosed, active AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis, examined from January 2005 to December 2007. RESULTS: The mean age was 34. 8 years, 18 patients (60. 0 %) were male and median duration of AIDS was 90 months. Nineteen patients (63. 3 %) had evidence of highly active antiretroviral therapy failure and median CD 4 + lymphocyte count was 12. 5 cells/µl. Visual acuity at presentation was 20 / 40 or better in 27 eyes (61. 4 %). Retinitis involved Zone 1 in 13 eyes (39. 5 %). Despite specific anti-AIDSrelated cytomegalovirus therapy, 16 eyes (36. 4 %) presented relapse of retinitis and 10 eyes (22. 7 %) lost at least three <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision.</b> When compared to highly active antiretroviral therapy responsive patients, eyes of highly active antiretroviral therapy failure patients were more likely to develop relapse of retinitis (p= 0. 03) and loss of at least three <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> (p= 0. 03). CONCLUSION: The patients in this series are essentially young men with longstanding AIDS, non-responsive to highly active antiretroviral therapy and with a similar immunological profile as noted before highly active antiretroviral therapy era. These findings have implications for the management of the disease and confirm the magnitude of rational periodic screening after diagnosis of AIDS...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the clinical course of visual acuity and foveal thickness in the idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) after a vitrectomy {{with the use}} of triamcinolone. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 30 patients (30 eyes) with ERM that were treated by vitrectomy from 2004 to 2008. Visual acuity and foveal thickness from optical coherence tomography imaging was obtained preoperatively and at every postoperative follow-up visit. Results: Visual acuity improved by two or more <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> in 30 %, 50 %, 60 %, and 70 %, and stayed the same within ± 1 line in 47 %, 50 %, 40 %, and 30 % at one month, three months, five months, and seven months after surgery. Twenty-three percents of the subjects deteriorated by two or more <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> within one month after surgery. None of the subjects had reduced vision three months after surgery. Foveal thickness decreased significantly after surgery. The mean thickness was 409. 7 ± 107. 9 μm before surgery and 288. 6 ± 66. 1 μm seven months after surgery. Parameters which were significantly correlated with the final visual acuity included preoperative visual acuity (0. 683), preoperative foveal thickness (0. 544), and final foveal thickness (0. 643) (p< 0. 005). Conclusions: Foveal thickness and visual acuity improved until seven months after the vitrectomy in patients with idiopathic ERM. Preoperative visual acuity, foveal thickness, and final foveal thickness had a significant correlation with the final visual acuity...|$|R

60|$|The vacant {{expression}} of the eyes is very peculiar, and at once shows when a man is completely lost in thought. Professor Donders has, with his usual kindness, investigated this subject for me. He has observed others in this condition, and has been himself observed by Professor Engelmann. The eyes are not then fixed on any object, and therefore not, as I had imagined, on some distant object. The <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> <b>of</b> the two eyes even often become slightly divergent; the divergence, if the head be held vertically, with the plane <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> horizontal, amounting to an angle of 2'0 as a maximum. This was ascertained by observing the crossed double image of a distant object. When the head droops forward, as often occurs with a man absorbed in thought, owing to the general relaxation of his muscles, if the plane <b>of</b> <b>vision</b> be still horizontal, the eyes are necessarily a little turned upwards, and then the divergence is as much as 3'0, or 3'0 5': if the eyes are turned still more upwards, it amounts to between 6'0 and 7'0. Professor Donders attributes this divergence to the almost complete relaxation of certain muscles of the eyes, which would be apt to follow from the mind being wholly absorbed.[6] The active condition of {{the muscles of the}} eyes is that of convergence; and Professor Donders remarks, as bearing on their divergence during a period of complete abstraction, that when one eye becomes blind, it almost always, after a short lapse of time, deviates outwards; for its muscles are no longer used in moving the eyeball inwards for the sake <b>of</b> binocular <b>vision.</b>|$|R
