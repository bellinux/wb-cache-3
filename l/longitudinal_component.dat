The objectives are to present the technique to calculate the dielectric profiles and their transverse derivatives in the inhomogeneous {{cross section of the}} cylindrical hollow waveguide, and to understand the influence of the spot-size and cross section on the output fields and output power density. The derivation is based on Maxwell’s equations. The <b>longitudinal</b> <b>components</b> of the fields are developed into the Fourier-Bessel series. The transverse components of the fields are expressed as functions of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>components</b> in the Laplace plane and are obtained by using the inverse Laplace transform by the residue method.

50|$|Hollow {{metallic}} waveguides {{filled with}} a homogeneous, isotropic material (usually air) support TE and TM modes but not the TEM mode. In coaxial cable energy is normally transported in the fundamental TEM mode. The TEM mode is also usually assumed for most other electrical conductor line formats as well. This is mostly an accurate assumption, but a major exception is microstrip which has a significant <b>longitudinal</b> <b>component</b> to the propagated wave due to the inhomogeneity at the boundary of the dielectric substrate below the conductor and the air above it.

Imageline thus shares the property {{of being able to}} propagate waves at arbitrarily low frequencies with the TEM format lines, although it cannot actually support a TEM wave. However, imageline is not a suitable technology at lower frequencies. Imageline must be precisely machined as surface roughness increases radiation losses.|$|E

Such a behavior is a realization in cold-dense QCD of the magnetoelectric effect, which was first discovered in condensed matter physics.
