30|$|The {{resultant}} <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> can {{be divided}} into four distinct regions according to the structural properties of the ACL. A first nonlinear region, the so-called ‘toe region’, is described as collagen fibres, which are arranged in varying degrees of crimp, easily extend under low axial forces [26, 27, 28]. The toe region is followed by a quasilinear region where collagen fibres reversibly deform. The slope of the linear region allows for reproducible determination of ligament stiffness (measured in Newtons per millimetre) and corresponds to the loads acting on the ACL during daily activities. In the intact knee, both the toe region and the linear region of the ACL loading curve will allow the tibia to translate anteriorly for 3 – 5 mm during knee motion as well as during an anterior drawer manoeuvre. With additional loading, the slope of the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> decreases (yield-point) as plastic deformation of the collagen fibres occurs. Finally, the curve reaches the ultimate load, which is described as failure of the bone-ligamentbone complex. It may be derived from the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve,</b> that applying high loads to a ligament will increase the stiffness and may therefore sufficiently restrict excessive joint motion when high external loads are applied. Even more accurately, the biomechanical properties of a ligament are represented by the relation of stress and strain, where stress is defined as deformation per unit length (%) and where strain is defined as load per unit cross-sectional area (N/mm 2) [26].|$|E

30|$|A small {{commercial}} high-resolution mechanical tester (Instron Microtester 5848, USA) {{combined with}} a custom-built fiber gripping system was used to perform tensile tests on single bamboo fibers, which are often as short as 2  mm. The load cell used has a capacity of 5  N. A pre-tensioned force of roughly 10  mN was exerted on the sample and the tensile speed used was 0.048  mm/min. Elongation was recorded from the crosshead movement with a resolution of 0.08  µm. More than 50 fibers were tested for each group. For the calculations of cell wall mechanical properties, the cell wall areas of every broken fiber were determined with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Meta 510 CSLM, Zeiss, Germany). The broken fibers were first immersed in 0.1  % acridine orange solution for 20  s and then rinsed in distilled water several times. The fibers were then imaged with a 63 × immersion oil objective.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new technique for {{the determination of the}} material property characterizing the resistance to ductile fracture from a single tensile test on an unnotched specimen. The property known as the essential work of fracture (EWF) is usually associated with the specific energy, per unit cross sectional area, consumed during ductile fracture in a double edge notched tensile (DENT) specimen. This energy is referred to as 'essential' in order to distinguish it from the non-essential energy consumed on distributed plastic deformation accompanying fracture, but not required for material separation. In the present study we consider tensile tests carried out on unnotched dog-bone (DB) tensile specimens carrying large numbers of markers and incorporating continuous measurement of elongation between any two markers using a laser scanning extensometer. In a single test it is therefore possible to obtain multiple <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curves</b> for a large number of tensile specimens. This data is analyzed by separating contributions to specimen elongation made by distributed (pre-softening) and localized (post-softening) plastic deformation. We demonstrate on a series of tests the evaluation of essential and non-essential work of necking and tearing for an aluminum alloy subjected to different heat treatments, and compare the results with those obtained from conventional DENT tests...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{integration}} of tendon grafts used for {{replacement of the}} anterior cruciate ligament is still sometimes unsatisfactory and {{may be associated with}} postoperative anterior-posterior laxity. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the capacity of bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) gene transfer to improve the inte-gration of semitendinosus tendon grafts at the tendon-bone interface after reconstruction of the anterior cruci-ate ligament in rabbits. Methods: The anterior cruciate ligaments of adult New Zealand White rabbits were replaced with autologous double-bundle semitendinosus tendon grafts. The semitendinosus tendon grafts had been infected in vitro with adenovirus-luciferase, adenovirus-LacZ (AdLacZ), or adenovirus-BMP- 2 (AdBMP- 2); untreated grafts served as controls. The grafts were examined histologically at two, four, six, and eight weeks after surgery. In additional experiments, the structural properties of the femur-anterior cruciate ligament graft-tibia complexes, from ani-mals killed eight weeks postoperatively, were determined from uniaxial tests. The stiffness (N/mm) and ulti-mate load to failure (N) were determined from the resulting <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curves.</b> Results: Genetically engineered semitendinosus tendon grafts expressed reporter genes as well as BMP- 2 in vitro.

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} of Lüders bands {{formation in}} a rapidly solidified Ni- 20 Al- 12 Cr- 1. 8 Mo intermetallic alloy ribbon in the temperature range of 300 - 770 K is discussed. It was observed that strength and Lüders bands aspect on the specimen were irrespective of temperature. The flow characteristics in the Lüders region of the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> were, however, very temperature sensitive. At low temperatures (470 K), a clear serrated behavior was manifested and the amplitude of serration increased with temperature. It is suggested that yielding occurs by dislocation generation at grain boundaries and that the stress required for dislocation generation (σeff) is athermal. A temperature dependent stress originated by the dynamic pile-up of dislocations at grain boundaries (dynamic stress) is, however, introduced as rate controlling for Lüders front motion and responsible for serration appearance. © 1995 Acta Metallurgica Inc.

40|$|Summary. We {{investigate}} hysteretic {{behavior in}} two dynamic models for solid-solid phase transitions. An elastic {{bar with a}} nonconvex double-well elastic energy density is subjected to time-dependent displacement boundary conditions. Both models include inertia and a viscous stress term that provides energy dissipation. The first model involves a strain-gradient term that models interfacial energy. In the second model this term is omitted. Numerical simulations combined with analytical results predict hysteretic behavior in the overall end-load versus end-displacement diagram for both models. The hysteresis {{is largely due to}} metastability and nucleation; it persists even for very slow loading when viscous dissipation is quite small. In the model with interfacial energy, phase interfaces move smoothly. When this term is omitted, hysteresis is much more pronounced. In addition, phase boundaries move in an irregular, stick-slip fashion. The corresponding <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> exhibits serrations, in qualitative agreement with certain experimental observations in shape-memory alloys...|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{tests in}} the {{temperature}} range 298 to 873 K have been performed on 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo base metal and simulated heat affected zone (HAZ) structures of its weld joint, namely coarse grain bainite, fine grain bainite and intercritical structure. Tensile flow behaviour of all the microstructural conditions could be adequately described by the Hollomon equation (sigma = K- 1 epsilon(n 1)) at higher (> 623 K) temperatures. Deviation from the Hollomon equation was observed at low strains and lower (< 623 K) temperatures. The Ludwigson modification of Hollomon's equation, sigma = K- 1 epsilon(n 1) + exp (K- 2 + n(2) epsilon), was found to describe the flow curve. In general, the flow parameters n(1), K- 1, n(2) and K- 2 were found to decrease with increase in temperature except in the intermediate temperature range (423 to 623 K). Peaks/plateaus were observed in their variation with temperature in the intermediate temperature range coinciding with the occurrence of serrated flow in the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve.</b> The n(1) Value increased and the K- 1 value decreased {{with the type of}} microstructure in the order: coarse grain bainite, fine grain bainite, base metal and intercritical structure. The variation of nl with microstructure has been rationalized on the basis of mean free path (MFP) of dislocations which {{is directly related to the}} inter-particle spacing.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first in a three-part series {{investigating}} the mechanical properties of loblolly pine fibers. This paper outlines the experimental method and subsequent variation of latewood fiber mechan-ical properties in relation to tree position. Subsequent papers will deal with differences between early-wood and latewood fibers and effect of juvenility and tree height on global fiber properties. In this paper, the mechanical properties were determined on individual wood fiber with a user-built tensile testing apparatus. Cross-sectional areas of post-tested fibers were determined with a confocal scanning laser microscope and used to convert acquired <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curves</b> into stress-strain curves. The modulus of elasticity and ultimate tensile stress of loblolly pine latewood fibers tested in this study ranged from 6. 55 to 27. 5 GPa and 410 to 1, 422 MPa, respectively. Fibers from the juvenile core of the main stem were on {{the low end of the}} mechanical property scale, whereas fibers beyond the twentieth growth ring were near the high end of the scale. Coefficient of variation for fiber stiffness and strength averaged around 20 to 25 %. The shape of the fiber stress-strain curves is dependent on their growth ring origins: Mature fibers were linear from initial loading until failure, whereas juvenile tibers demonstrated curvi-linearity until about 60 % of maximum load followed by linear behavior to failure...|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{tests were}} {{performed}} on specimens in quenched and tempered and thermally aged conditions over a wide temperature range (300 - 873 K) to assess the occurrence of serrated flow, a manifestation of dynamic strain aging (DSA), in 9 Cr- 1 Mo ferritic steel, {{with an emphasis on}} the influence of prior thermal aging oil serrated yielding. The alloy exhibited jerky/serrated pow in the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curves</b> at intermediate temperatures. Types A, B, and C serrations were observed, depending on the test temperature and applied strain rate. The apparent activation energy of 83 kJ mol(- 1) measured for serrated flow suggests that diffusion of an interstitial solute such as carbon is responsible for dynamic strain aging in 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel. Prior thermal aging at 793 K for 5000 h and at 873 K for 1000 and 5000 h resulted in a significant decrease in the height of serrations, i. e. the magnitude of the stress drop, as well as an increase in the critical strain for the onset of serrations. Both of these observations indicate reduced propensity to DSA as a result of increased precipitate sinks as well as a reduced carbon concentration in solid solution owing to an increased density of carbides in the thermally aged conditions. Reduced propensity to DSA resulted in a significant reduction in the strength values at intermediate temperatures...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of fiber {{dimensional}} irregularities on the tensile behavior of fiber bundles is modeled, using the finite element method (FEM). Fiber dimensional irregularities are simulated with sine waves of different magnitude. The specific stress-strain curves of fiber bundles and the constituent single fibers are obtained and compared. The results indicate that fiber diameter irregularity along fiber length has {{a significant effect on}} the tensile behavior of the fiber bundle. For a bundle of uniform fibers of different diameters, all constituent fibers will break simultaneously regardless of the fiber diameter. Similarly, if fibers within a bundle have the same pattern and level of diameter irregularity along fiber length, the fibers will break at the same time also regardless of the difference in average diameter of each fiber. In these cases, the specific stress and strain curve for the bundle overlaps with that of the constituent fibers. When the fiber bundle consists of single fibers with different levels of diameter irregularity, the specific stress-strain and <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curves</b> of the fiber bundle exhibit a stepped or “ladder” shape. The fiber with the highest irregularity breaks first, even when the thinnest section of the fiber is still coarser than the diameter of a very thin but uniform fiber in the bundle. This study suggests that fiber diameter irregularity along fiber length is a more important factor than the fiber diameter itself in determining the tensile behavior of a fiber bundle consisting of irregular fibers. <br /...|$|R

However, each region of the capsule functions to stabilize the joint in different positions, and differences in joint laxity {{between men and women}} have been found. The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} region (axillary pouch and posterior capsule) and sex on the material properties of the glenohumeral capsule. Boundary conditions derived from experiments were used to create finite-element models that applied tensile deformations to tissue samples from the capsule. The material coefficients of a hyperelastic constitutive model were determined via inverse finite-element optimization, which minimized the difference between the experimental and finite-element model-predicted <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve.</b> These coefficients were then used to create stress-stretch curves representing the material properties of the capsule regions for each sex in response to uniaxial extension. For the axillary pouch, the C 1 (men: 0. 28 ± 0. 39 MPa and women: 0. 23 ± 0. 12 MPa) and C 2 (men: 8. 2 ± 4. 1 and women: 7. 7 ± 3. 0) material coefficients differed between men and women by only 0. 05 MPa and 0. 5, respectively. Similarly, the posterior capsule coefficients differed by 0. 15 MPa (male: 0. 49 ± 0. 26 MPa and female: 0. 34 ± 0. 20 MPa) and 0. 6 (male: 7. 8 ± 2. 9 and female: 7. 2 ± 3. 0), respectively. No differences could be detected in the material coefficients between regions or sexes. As a result, surgeons may not need to consider region- and sex-specific surgical repair techniques. Furthermore, finite-element models of the glenohumeral joint may not need region- or sex-specific material coefficients when using this constitutive model...|$|E
40|$|Collagen type I is {{the most}} {{abundant}} structural protein in tendon, skin and bone, and largely determines the mechanical behaviour of these connective tissues. To obtain {{a better understanding of}} the relationship between structure and mechanical properties, tensile tests and synchrotron X-ray scattering have been carried out simultaneously, correlating the mechanical behaviour with changes in the microstructure. Because intermolecular cross-links are thought to have a great influence on the mechanical behaviour of collagen, we also carried out experiments using cross-link-deficient tail-tendon collagen from rats fed with beta-APN, in addition to normal controls. The <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> of tendon collagen has a characteristic shape with, initially, an increasing slope, corresponding to an increasing stiffness, followed by yielding and then fracture. Cross-link-deficient collagen produces a quite different curve with a marked plateau appearing in some cases, where the length of the tendon increases at constant stress. With the use of in situ X-ray diffraction, it was possible to measure simultaneously the elongation of the collagen fibrils inside the tendon and of the tendon as a whole. The overall strain of the tendon was always larger than the strain in the individual fibrils, which demonstrates that some deformation is taking place in the matrix between fibrils. Moreover, the ratio of fibril strain to tendon strain was dependent on the applied strain rate. When the speed of deformation was increased, this ratio increased in normal collagen but generally decreased in cross-link-deficient collagen, correlating to the appearance of a plateau in the force-elongation curve indicating creep. We proposed a simple structural model, which describes the tendon at a hierarchical level, where fibrils and interfibrillar matrix act as coupled viscoelastic systems. All qualitative features of the strain-rate dependence of both normal and cross-link-deficient collagen can be reproduced within this model. This complements earlier models that considered the next smallest level of hierarchy, describing the deformation of collagen fibrils in terms of changes in their molecular packing...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{known as}} dynamic strain ageing, abbreviated DSA, has been known {{since the beginning of}} last century. It was first discovered as serrations in the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> obtained upon deforming specimens of certain alloys in tension. This phenomenon became known as the Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect. In connection with this it was also discovered that these alloys exhibit a negative strain rate sensitivity and often reduced ductility in the strain rate and temperature ranges where the PLC effect could be observed. It has since been shown that the negative strain rate sensitivity is actually the mechanism behind the PLC effect. DSA is now well documented and (at least rather well) understood under monotonic loading, but the effects of DSA on fatigue properties, in particular the development of the stress-strain response and fatigue life is not as well investigated. As the beginning of a project which aims to clarify these effects, an AA 7030 alloy (Al- 5. 4 Zn- 1. 2 Mg) is investigated for the temperature and strain rate effects on the DSA and its influence on the monotonic mechanical properties in naturally aged and peak aged material. This is done in order to obtain a solid theoretical and experimental base for further studies of the cyclic stress-strain behaviour. It is shown that DSA occurs under a variety of conditions concerning temperature, strain rate and heat treatment, resulting in inverse temperature and strain rate dependence of the flow stress and ductility as well as serrated yielding. Even the peak-aged temper, nominally DSA insensitive, show some of these signs, which is important since this (T 6) is the temper used in industrial applications. Due to the clear signs of DSA in both tempers, the material is considered suitable for further studies of the cyclic deformation properties. Furthermore, a thermal activation based model for plastic deformation is used to qualitatively explain the observed effects, and possible extensions of the model to suit the present material are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Each {{multilayered}} scaffold was {{cut into}} dumbbell-shaped constructs {{with a central}} rectangular area measuring 25  mm by 5  mm. Construct thickness was measured with digital calipers at three sites and averaged, from which the cross-sectional area (CSA) was calculated. Constructs were then clamped into a materials testing machine (Model 4502; Instron, Norwood, MA) and loaded under tension in a direction either parallel or perpendicular to fiber alignment. This distinction was arbitrary for random scaffolds. For the biomimetic scaffold, the scaffold was oriented with the two aligned longitudinal layers defining parallel. After preloading to 0.5  N, constructs were preconditioned from 0 to 2  % strain (estimated from clamp-to-clamp distance) for 15  cycles at 20  mm/min before undergoing load to failure at the same elongation rate. A custom digital motion tracking system (Spica Technology, Kihei, Maui, HI; 0.01  mm accuracy) was used to track the vertical displacement of the strain markers (black pen) using a single video camera aligned perpendicular to the plane. These data were inputted into ABAQUS software (ABAQUS/CAE Student Version 6.4; Simulia, Providence, RI) to determine strain. Both structural and material properties were determined. Of note, stiffness (modulus) was determined from {{the slope of the}} linear region of the <b>load-elongation</b> (stress-strain) <b>curve</b> while yield load (stress) and yield elongation (strain) were found at the intersection of the data curve and the tangent line with a 0.2  % positive offset along the x-axis, as described previously (Czaplewski et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|The {{plastics}} {{industry is}} increasingly oriented towards {{the use of}} polymers from natural origin (biobased) replacing plastics derived from petrol chemistry (fossil-based). Recently, some aliphatic polyamides were revalued by industries for packaging and for long-term applications but still low investigated. Moreover, nanoclays have been proven to improve mechanical and barrier performance of fossil based PAs. On the other hand, these superior properties of PA nanocomposites usually have as a "side effect" the increase of the brittleness by suppressing plastic deformation at the crack tip, which greatly limits the application of these materials. In this study two kinds of bio-polyamides were investigated: PA 10. 10 and PA 6. 10. As filler a natural montmorillonite modified with methyl hydrogenated tallow bis- 2 -hydroxyethyl quaternary ammonium (Cloisite® 30 B-Cl 30 B) was used. PAs were melt blended with clay using a co-rotating twin screw extruder LEISTRITZ ZSE 18 / 40 D. Neat polymers were also processed {{to have the same}} thermal history. Pellets obtained by the first extrusion were dried before the film extrusion. A single screw extruder (Eurotech Extrusion Machinery S. r. l.) (L= 80 cm D= 25 mm) equipped with a flat die was used. Samples for mechanical characterization were die cut and tested with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min using a Zwick 10 universal testing machine. Specimens for EWF were prepared according to the ESIS protocol and conditioned at 33 % of R. H. and room temperature. Before testing, a fresh razor blade was carefully tapped into ligament of specimen to introduce two aligned sharp pre-cracks. The free ligament length (l) was left in the range from 5 to 22 mm. The specific work of fracture (wf) was obtained by dividing the integrated area of the <b>load-elongation</b> <b>curve</b> with the initial ligament area. The essential work of fracture (we) and the plastic term (β*wp) are easily obtained from the best linear regression of a set of values represented in a graph plotting wf versus l (Figure 1 a). An estimation of the shape and dimensions of the necked zone surrounding the fractured ligament was done in order to derive the wp value (Figure 1 b). Clay did not significantly affect the work required for the onset of crack propagation (we) in PA 6. 10 while decrease in PA 10. 10. The plastic work (β*wp) of both PA was increased with clay. The individual nanoparticles act as stress concentration points, which promoted cavitations and thus induced relatively large local deformation. By this way, the mechanical work content necessary to generate the plastic flow is increased, leading to a higher wp value...|$|E
