5|$|Overall, Great Northern Highway {{performs}} favourably {{in terms}} of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up {{two thirds of the}} state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005–2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse, north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk, and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium-high and high risk. In 2013, Great Northern Highway received a similar rating, still higher overall than the other highways. Out of five stars, 21% was rated as one- or two-star, and 79% was rated three- or four-star, with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire Roadhouse.|$|E

25|$|Third-rail {{systems can}} be {{designed}} to use top contact, side contact, or bottom contact. Top contact is <b>less</b> <b>safe,</b> as the live rail is exposed to people treading on the rail unless an insulating hood is provided. Side- and bottom-contact third rail can easily have safety shields incorporated, carried by the rail itself. Uncovered top-contact third rails are vulnerable to disruption caused by ice, snow and fallen leaves.|$|E
25|$|Simul-rappelling or {{simultaneously}} rappelling — {{advanced technique}} where two climbers {{at the same}} time descend the same rope, or two ropes tied together, and one climber’s weight counterbalances the other. Generally the technique is considered <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> than the regular repelling; however, it’s useful in case of emergencies, or for rapping off opposite sides of a fin or spire where there are no anchor points, which is common in places like the Needles of South Dakota’s Black Hills.|$|E

25|$|In adults, {{particularly}} {{those living in}} areas with a high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and {{has been associated with}} peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and <b>less</b> <b>safe.</b> In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.|$|E
25|$|After a brief intense {{change in}} {{chain of command}} in the Pakistan Armed Forces, a {{full-fledged}} military operation called 'Zalzala (lit. earthquake) was undertaken by 14th Army Division in January {{with the goal of}} flushing out Baitullah Mehsud's TTP fighters from the area. The area had previously been a more or <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> zone for militants, with some villagers providing them support and shelter. The operation resulted in tactical success and scores of militants were killed during the operation, and within three days the armed forces were in full control of the area. The army later captured a few other villages and small towns as part of their attempt to pressure Baitullah Mehsud.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{roundabout}} crash type for cyclists, {{according to the}} New Zealand study, involves a motor vehicle entering the roundabout and colliding with a cyclist who already is travelling around the roundabout (50%+ of cyclist/roundabout crashes in New Zealand fall into this category). The next most common crash type involves motorists leaving the roundabout colliding with cyclists who are continuing farther around the perimeter. Designs that have marked perimeter cycle lanes {{were found to be}} even <b>less</b> <b>safe,</b> suggesting that in roundabouts, cyclists should occupy a vehicle lane or a separate path rather than a special lane. The researchers advised that drivers be forbidden from overtaking cyclists (as well as other vehicles) while in the circle.|$|E

25|$|In early 2009, French forces {{embarked}} on a significant campaign which aimed to retake an eastern Alasay District that the Taliban has controlled for the previous year. Alasay district is a strategic goldmine: it lies along a primary infiltration route {{into and out of}} Pakistan, it provides easy access to Kabul in an easily defensible primary valley (there are two other valleys in Alasay District), and it is mostly populated by the ethnic minority the Pashai and some Nuristani. In a French-led NATO force initiated, the operation was a success initially, due to reaching out to locals beforehand, they retook the entire valley with a single casualty over a single day of fighting. Almost immediately, the Afghans of the valley welcomed the French, and things seemed to be looking up. However, they didn’t stay. Much as in previous efforts to “sweep” the province, the French were dragged into other tasks, like protecting the main highway that travels the province from north to south through the volatile Tagab Valley. As a result, Alasay fell back to Taliban later that year and the security situation in the province deteriorated. It was that same tug-of-war all over again, with the residents of Alasay left frustrated and <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> than ever before. As 2009 progressed, bigger and bigger chunks of the province came under the sway of the insurgency, leading the provincial capital being more or less under curfew from the militants. By 2010, the French had stopped liaising with their Afghan Army counterparts, and the Provincial Reconstruction Team had ceased most of its operations.|$|E

50|$|Technological {{advancement}} of the neomodern era however has its downturns in that it added to the decadence in cultural good such that people everywhere, especially high number of youths follow the trends in the new 'what is', which include social celebrities {{in the form of}} dressing, sexual activities, extravagancies, and less interest in learning and even, working but more interest in making money. Money became a value-determinant than utility. This brought about frauds in various sectors.

500|$|On August 10, 1978 three {{teenage girls}} of the Urlich family of Osceola, Indiana {{were killed when}} the 1973 Pinto they were in was {{involved}} in a rear-end collision. [...] The driver had stopped in the road to retrieve the car's gas cap which had been inadvertently left {{on the top of the}} car and subsequently fell onto the road. [...] While stopped the Pinto was struck by a Chevrolet van. [...] Ford sent the Urlichs a recall notice for the Pinto in 1979. A grand jury indicted Ford on three counts of reckless homicide. Indiana v. Ford was a landmark in product liability law as the first time a corporation faced criminal charges for a defective product, and the first time a corporation was charged with murder. [...] If convicted, Ford faced a maximum fine of $30,000 under Indiana's 1978 reckless homicide statute. [...] Ford's legal defense was vastly more ambitious than the effort mounted in the Grimshaw case. [...] The effort was led by James F. Neal with a staff of 80 and a budget of about $1 million; the Elkhart County state's attorney had a budget of about $20,000 and volunteer law professors and law students. A former head of the NHTSA, testifying on Ford's behalf, said the Pinto's design was no more or <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> than that of any other car in its class. In 1980 Ford was found not guilty.

500|$|Enforcement and {{compliance}} with seat belt laws varies by state. (Massachusetts, {{which had the}} lowest death rate per 100 million miles traveled in 2015, was among the states with the lowest use of seat belts.) Some states require motorcycle helmets while others do not. Speed limits, traffic density, topography, climate and many other factors affect the divergent accident rates by state. Speed limits in Texas, Utah, and Rhode Island are prima facie rather than absolute. This allows motorists in those states to defend against a speeding charge {{if it can be}} proven that the speed was reasonable and prudent. In good driving conditions, many drivers in prima facie states presume (usually correctly) that police will allow some tolerance in enforcement. Even in states with absolute speed limits, enforcement and penalties vary from one state to another. For these and other reasons, state-to-state comparisons are difficult. There are many studies examining increases in Interstate speed limits from 55mph to 65, 70 and 75mph. Some found that fatality rates increased significantly on Interstate highways where speed limits were raised. One study that examined the change from 55 to 65mph found higher Interstate speed limits improved overall highway safety by drawing traffic from <b>less</b> <b>safe</b> secondary highways to safer Interstate highways. Since the changes to 80mph speed limits in some states (and 85mph on one section of a toll highway in Texas) are relatively recent, robust analysis is not yet available. Anecdotal evidence suggests actual vehicle speeds did not increase as much as speed limits did. Also, police may be enforcing the new higher limits more strictly than they enforced the prior limits. In some states, police have reallocated resources to focus more on impaired and distracted driving. The higher speed limits are predominantly in rural states, which tend to be Republican states. To many Republican voters, speed limits (and seat belt laws) are seen as intrusions on personal liberty. According to transportation historian Owen Gutfreund, state governments may raise speed limits because raising the speed limit “sounds like such an easy regulatory win.” It’s a simple way to “get government out of your face.” ...|$|E
