However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|A yellowish-brown pigment is {{diffused}} {{through the}} cytosol of the hyphae and is much deeper in color {{just below the}} cuticle of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale buff, but soon {{the color of the}} cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on <b>light,</b> <b>for</b> when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.|$|E
5|$|He continued, {{describing}} the unhappiness of his marriage, {{and how that}} made him vulnerable to her attributes, which were shared by all the learned gentlemen of his circle. He also believed that Anna Seward had noticed the effect her friend was having on him, and would regularly place her actions in the best <b>light</b> <b>for</b> his benefit. The elimination of Day as a suitor for Honora Sneyd's hand placed Edgeworth in a difficult situation and he resolved to end it by moving to Lyons France, to work, {{in the autumn of}} 1771.|$|E

5|$|In a World Tomorrow episode {{broadcast}} on 8 May 2012, Rajab accused the US of opposing democracy in Bahrain when it asked Russia {{not to sell}} arms for Syria while selling arms to Bahrain, and in July, shortly before Rajab's arrest, {{he noted that the}} presence of US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain made the struggle against the monarchy more difficult because US support, accompanied by the support, or silence, of the international community, was seen as giving the green <b>light</b> <b>for</b> repression and attacks on human rights defenders.|$|E
5|$|In other words, column j of A {{expresses the}} image of vj {{in terms of the}} basis vectors wi of W; thus this {{relation}} uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to different, but equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this <b>light,</b> <b>for</b> example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E

5|$|The main {{armament}} of the Bristol {{class was}} two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI guns that were {{mounted on the}} centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted. This armament was considered rather too <b>light</b> <b>for</b> ships of this size, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty <b>light</b> <b>for</b> our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit <b>light</b> <b>for</b> a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E

5|$|Bilins are found, for example, in Micrommata virescens, {{resulting}} in its green color. Guanine {{is responsible for}} the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus. It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha, Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, guanine creates their silvery appearance. While guanine is originally an end-product of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading to an increase in its storage. Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or interference of <b>light,</b> <b>for</b> example by modified setae or scales. The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors.|$|E
5|$|Cape Moreton Light, also {{listed as}} North Point Range Rear Light, is an heritage-listed active {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Moreton, a rocky headland {{located at the}} north eastern tip of Moreton Island, a large sand island {{on the eastern side}} of Moreton Bay, on the coast of South East Queensland, Australia. It marks the northern entrance to Moreton Bay and Brisbane and also serves as the rear <b>light</b> <b>for</b> the North Point Range. With its two distinctive red bands, it also serves as a daymark. It is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland, and the only one to be built by the New South Wales Government before the separation of Queensland, which took place in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland to be built of stone.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough <b>light</b> <b>for</b> each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E

5|$|In {{her second}} season {{of service in}} 1846, Great Britain {{successfully}} completed two round trips to New York at an acceptable speed, but was then laid up for repairs {{to one of her}} chain drums, which showed an unexpected degree of wear. Embarking on her third passage of the season to New York, her captain made a series of navigational errors that resulted in her being run hard aground in Dundrum Bay on the northeast coast of Ireland. There was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John's <b>light</b> <b>for</b> the Calf light on the Isle of Man.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 200X, robots {{developed}} to assist mankind are commonplace {{thanks to the}} efforts of renowned robot designer Dr. Light. However, one day these robots go out of control and start attacking the populace, among them six advanced humanoid robots made by Dr. <b>Light</b> <b>for</b> industrial purposes: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. He realizes the culprit is his old rival Dr. Wily (who plots to take over the world), but is unsure of what to do. His helper robot Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (which happens to be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively <b>light</b> <b>for</b> their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E

After being caught in a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God's service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea.

5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient <b>light</b> <b>for</b> photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic stratification.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} formed the present-day {{southern}} end of Newport News had long been established as an unincorporated town. During Reconstruction, the period after the American Civil War, the new City of Newport News was essentially founded by California merchant Collis P. Huntington.
