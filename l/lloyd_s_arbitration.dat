40|$|When an {{arbitration}} {{process is}} challenged, who decides whether the arbitration can proceed-and how should that question be answered? This Article discusses {{how and when}} courts should decide 2 ̆ 2 gateway 2 ̆ 2 issues in international arbitration, issues that go to {{the validity of the}} agreement to arbitrate. Using the examples of France and Germany, the author argues that the dominant Continental doctrines used to address such issues, the doctrines of Kompetenz-Kompetenz and separability, neither adequately explain courts 2 ̆ 7 decisions nor provide a strong logical basis for them. In contrast, the more nuanced U. S. approach, which involves demarcating 2 ̆ 2 gateway 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 non-gateway 2 ̆ 2 issues, has strong explanatory and normative force. The author demonstrates how U. <b>S.</b> <b>arbitration</b> law addresses several areas that remain problematic under the Continental doctrine. The author then argues that recognizing U. <b>S.</b> <b>arbitration</b> law 2 ̆ 7 s pragmatic balance between legitimacy and efficacy explains an otherwise confusing set of precedents. Finally, the author explains why the US. approach provides courts with a superior approach for responding to the Gateway problem...|$|R
