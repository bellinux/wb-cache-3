More than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools, and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling. In addition, fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and, among those who do, fewer complete the 10th grade.|$|E
25|$|Turret deck ships had a <b>low</b> <b>net</b> tonnage (an {{approximate}} {{measure of}} cargo space) {{in comparison to}} their deadweight capacity (weight of cargo) allowing them to operate at a lower fee structure than a conventional hull. Net tonnage is a computation of volume, and the method of measurement used at the Suez Canal to determine tolls {{was based on a}} measure of net tonnage which excluded some of the cargo spaces of these unconventional hulls. Turret and trunk deck ships therefore paid less in tolls than conventional ships of the same capacity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most widely}} used measure of cash flow is the net {{operating}} cycle, or cash conversion cycle. This represents the time difference between cash payment for raw materials and cash collection for sales. The cash conversion cycle indicates the firm's ability to convert its resources into cash. Because this number effectively corresponds to {{the time that the}} firm's cash is tied up in operations and unavailable for other activities, management generally aims at a <b>low</b> <b>net</b> count. (Another measure is gross operating cycle which is the same as net operating cycle except that it {{does not take into account}} the creditors deferral period.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a {{combination}} of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level a married person could be a big winner – getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a [...] "swing" [...] of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively <b>low</b> <b>net</b> benefits of the man or woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender). In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.|$|E
