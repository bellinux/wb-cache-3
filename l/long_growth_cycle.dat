The double coat is profuse, with a warm undercoat and a topcoat which has the texture of human hair. It should not be silky or curled, but wavy is acceptable. Long and thick, it is shown natural, but should not be so long as to touch the floor, as is typical in breeds such as the Lhasa Apso or Maltese. A fall of hair covers the face and eyes, but long eyelashes generally prevent hair from getting in the Tibetan Terrier's eyes, and the breed has very good eyesight.|$|E

40|$|Breeding {{goals of}} yield increases, root quality improvement, and disease {{resistance}} in cassava are considerably slowed down by biological {{characteristics of the}} crop, which includes a <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle,</b> a heterozygous genetic background and a poor knowledge {{of the organization of}} crop diversity. These factors severely hamper the speed and ease of moving around useful genes in cassava. The consequences are that cassava production fails to keep up with demand, especially in regions where over 90 % of yield is consumed as food, leading to an increase in acreage of cassava fields mostly into marginal lands. The advent of molecular markers,genome studies and plant genetic transformation holds promise of providing ways around breeding obstacles in <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> and heterozygous crops. A number of these new tools, including a molecular genetic map, markers linked to disease resistance genes, and marker-aided studies of complex traits now exist or are being developed for cassava at CIAT. Large scale sequencing and mapping of expressed sequence tags(ESTs) have been initiated, towards a transcript map of cassava and the implementation of the candidate-gene approach to complex trait mapping. A cassava bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library has also been constructed to expedite positional cloning of genes, known only by their phenotypes and their position relative to markers on a molecular genetic map and complementation studies of candidate loci. Studies of genes that control traits of agronomic importance, and their allelic diversity in nature,provides powerful tools for understanding the basis of crop performance and improvement.

40|$|The {{frequency}} and amplitude of oscillatory pollen tube growth {{can be altered}} by changing the osmotic value of the surrounding medium. This has motivated {{the proposition that the}} periodic change in growth velocity is caused by changes in turgor pressure. Using mathematical modeling we recently demonstrated that the oscillatory pollen tube growth does not require turgor to change but that this behavior can be explained with a mechanism that relies on changes in the mechanical properties of the cell wall which in turn are caused by temporal variations in the secretion of cell wall precursors. The model also explains why turgor and growth rate are correlated for oscillatory <b>growth</b> with <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycles</b> while they seem uncorrelated for oscillatory growth with short <b>growth</b> <b>cycles.</b> The predictions made by the model are testifiable by experimental data and therefore represent an important step towards understanding the dynamics of the growth behavior in walled cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the growth of the Spanish economy since the advent of {{democracy}} until today. In the first part, the specificities of the growth model are analysed, showing that the empirical evidence is not consistent with the conclusions of the standard growth models (i. e. neoclassical growth model with exogenous TFP). More precisely, in the last 30 years Spain has experienced two <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycles</b> which, far from being balanced, have shown major differences in the path of the relevant aggregated ratios. While the first cycle (1978 - 1993) showed a relatively small increase in employment and a considerable rise in productivity, the second cycle (1994 - 08) proved exactly the opposite: a spectacular increase in employment and a small gain in productivity. In the second part we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model of technology adoption dynamic à la Boldrin and Levine (2002), trying to account qualitatively for the main Spanish growth facts. We show that the characteristics of the labor market in Spain, with a dual system that protects permanent workers at the expense of temporary ones and an inefficient collective wage bargaining system have played a very relevant role in explaining the growth patterns of the last 30 years. ...|$|R

30|$|When {{the growth}} cycle {{is used as}} the sole {{evaluation}} index, sawdust, soybean straw and corn cob can significantly shorten the growth cycle of G. frondosa, with sawdust having the greatest effect. For instance, with formula  6, which had 37.5 % sawdust and 37.5 % corn cob, the growth cycle was nearly {{the same as that}} in control, and its yield was higher than that in control. Although G. frondosa had a <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> with the soybean straw substrate, the growth cycle can be significantly shortened by combining soybean straw with rice straw and corn straw, as evidenced in formulae  13 and 14 (Table  5). Therefore, when taking both growth cycle and yield into account, a certain percentage of sawdust can be added to the straw formula to shorten the growth cycle and increase the yield of G. frondosa as well. Since lignin content in sawdust was higher than that in crop straws, the substrate with high lignin content is observed to promote mycelial growth and thus shorten the growth cycle. The rapid colonization of substrate during spawn run prevents competition from other competitive molds and pathogenic microorganisms. Also, the shortened duration of the growth cycle saves costs, improve income and it is suitable for commercial producers of G. frondosa (Gaitan-Hernandez et al. 2006).|$|E

However, lack of early maturity genes in the Musa germplasm and the biology of banana impede the application of conventional breeding for this trait. In this study, we investigated the genetic transformation strategy of over-expressing D-type cyclin genes that have been shown to shorten cell cycle duration and increase growth in model plant species.

In accordance with the differences in the spatial distribution of soil information in farmland, fuzzy c-means clustering was applied to divide the farmland into several areas, where the soil fertility of each area is nearly uniform. Then the crop growth information in the area could be monitored with complete coverage by deploying a sensor node there, which could greatly decrease the deployed sensor nodes. Moreover, in order to accurately judge the optimal cluster number of fuzzy c-means clustering, a discriminant function for Normalized Intra-Cluster Coefficient of Variation (NICCV) was established. The sensitivity analysis indicates that NICCV is insensitive to the fuzzy weighting exponent, but it shows a strong sensitivity to the number of clusters...|$|R

Four sowing dates including Feb. 14, Feb. 24, Mar. 6, and Mar. 16 were considered as main plots and three different kinds of mulch including black plastic, clear plastic and control (without mulch) were considered as sub plots. The {{results showed that the}} effects of sowing date, kind of mulch, and their interactions on early maturity, early production, total production, germination period, and the number of days to harvest time were significant.

In 1893 - 1894 two big German-style mixed banks were created in Milan with the strong support of German, Swiss and French capital. As well known, Alexander Gerschenkron argued that Italian mixed banks {{played a major role in}} the national industrialisation during the so-called big spurt of those years. Indeed, as stated by Antonio Confalonieri and Peter Hertner, German-style mixed banks financed new manufacturing sectors, but they were relevant, above all, because they were quite innovative in financing industrial firms, by combining both short term credits as commercial banks and long term credits as investment banks. Moreover they acted as merchant banks whenever industrial firms required a connection with financial markets or needed financial or managerial restructuring. The paper focuses on the specific heritage of the XIXth century private banking on Italian major mixed banks’ practices. It considers their international connections (Paris, Berlin, and so on) and their operating models in relation to the European ones. Besides, we will provide a comparative quantitative analysis of their portfolios in order to evaluate how much they differed from the other major European universal banks (and how much investment banking activities weighted in their portfolios) ...|$|E

Root yield losses have been recorded for several pests, including mites, mealybugs, whiteflies, hornworm, lacebugs, thrips and burrower bugs. Agronomic characteristics such as vegetative propagation, a <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle,</b> drought tolerance, staggered planting dates and intercropping contribute to the considerable diversity of pests that feed on the crop. The dynamics of cassava production are evolving as trends in the food, feed and industrial starch sector are leading to an increased demand for high quality starches. The resulting shift to larger scale production units, expansion of cultivated area and modifications in crop management combined with the effects of climate change, especially warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns, affect the occurrence and dynamics of arthropod pests in cassava agro ecosystems. Data is presented to describe the effects of temperature and dry seasons on key pest species. Whiteflies, mites and mealybugs register a suitability increase in the same areas in South America: Northeastern Brazil, Northern Argentina, South-Central Bolivia, and Southwest Peru. In Africa increases are projected in Southeast Africa and Madagascar. In Asia, regions with greater projected suitability for these pest species are Coastal India and Southeast Asia.

40|$|Progress in the {{breeding}} of plantain and banana has been restricted by the complex genetic structure and behaviour of cultivated polyploid Musa. Genetic improvement has been hindered {{due to the}} large amount of space required for growth and maintenance of plant populations, in addition to the <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> and the low levels of fertility and seed viability characteristic of cultivated genotypes. Molecular marker assisted breeding has the potential to dramatically enhance the pace and efficiency of genetic improvement in Musa. This study was conducted to compare different PCR-based marker systems (RAPD, VNTR and AFLP) for the analysis of breeding populations generated from two diverse Musa breeding schemes. All three assays detected a high level of polymorphism between parental genotypes and within progeny populations. As expected, AFLP assays had by far the highest multiplex ratio while VNTR analysis detected the highest levels of polymorphism. AFLP analysis of a full-sib tetraploid hybrid population confirmed previous reports based on VNTR analysis, of a high frequency of recombination during 2 n (3 x) gamete formation by a triploid plantain landrace. In addition, both VNTR and RAPD analyses of a full-sib triploid hybrid population suggested a high frequency of homoeologous recombination during n (2 x) gamete formation by tetraploid hybrids. In general, there was a poor correlation between estimates of genetic similarity based on different types of marker.

Most consumers prefer non sweet taros. High content of sucrose (non-reducing sugar), glucose and fructose (reducing sugars) represent undesirable characteristics because they cause browning of the snacks. Breeding taro for improved corm quality {{is complex and}} phenotypic recurrent selection is impaired by the <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> and the low vegetative propagation ratio. New high-throughput phenotyping tools are needed to select suitable hybrids in early clonal generations. The aim {{of the present study}} was to develop an HPTLC protocol for the quantitation of sugars in the fresh corm (FW). The individual sugars values in 60 hybrids released by four different breeding programs were compared with 300 cultivars from six different countries. Sucrose, glucose, fructose, maltose and ribose were quantitated. Mean total sugars varied from 1. 83 to 6. 28 %FW in hybrids and from 1. 32 to 7. 69 %FW in cultivars. The ratio sucrose/reducing sugars varied from 0. 06 to 4. 34 in hybrids and from 0. 04 to 4. 82 in cultivars. The protocol developed in this study is rapid, cost efficient, environment-friendly and more accurate than previous techniques based on dry matter because sample preparation is known to affect chemical composition of individual sugars. This technique can be used in taro breeding programmes for the early detection of undesirable hybrids with high levels of reducing sugars. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Since several land cover types presents a distinguished temporal pattern in its spectral response, MODIS high {{temporal resolution}} can be used to identify such covers. This is specially true when observing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of agricultural land covers. Fourier transformations decomposes any signal represented in time to a frequency domain. Applying this transformation in a NDVI time-series results in parameters that describe how this signal behaves along several time frequencies (annual, semestral, etc). A strong annual signal indicates a land cover with a <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle,</b> such as sugar-cane (1 to 1. 5 years) while stronger semestral signals are typical of other agricultural crops (soy, corn, beans).

A computational routine, independent of any commercial remote sensing package, has been developed in order to calculate Fourier amplitude and phase images of a NDVI time series. Applying such analysis over a diverse agricultural region in São Paulo state (Ribeirão Preto) indicates that long and short growth period crops are easily distinguished (sugar-cane and annual crops such as soy, corn, beans).

In this context, we chose to develop an agri-environmental indicator, IN-Palm, which aims at estimating the risk of nitrogen losses in oil palm plantations, using the INDIGO® method. This kind of operational model is built to assess environmental risks as well as being used as a decision support tool. The development of indicators is particularly relevant in such contexts of data scarcity, as it allows for harnessing the most of readily accessible data from a whole range of sources, i. e. measured or modelled, qualitative or quantitative, empirical or expert knowledge. We adapted the indicator to characteristics of the oil palm system, such as the tropical climate, the <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> of about 25 years and the high production of biomass. We designed it to be easily implementable with available data on climate and soil conditions, and sensitive to practices such as fertiliser application (type, rate and timing), legume cover establishment, and residue management. Future work will include a sensitivity analysis, a validation against experimental data of losses in Sumatra, and a validation by end-users in a plantation in Sumatra...|$|E
40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} crop in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. Cassava can be produced adequately in drought conditions making it the ideal food security crop in marginal environments. Although cassava can tolerate drought stress, it can be genetically improved to enhance productivity in such environments. Drought adaptation studies in over three decades in cassava have identified relevant mechanisms which have been explored in conventional breeding. Drought is a quantitative trait and its multigenic nature makes it very challenging to effectively manipulate and combine genes in breeding for rapid genetic gain and selection process. Cassava has a <b>long</b> <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> of 12 - 18 months which invariably contributes to a long breeding scheme for the crop. Modern breeding using advances in genomics and improved genotyping, is facilitating the dissection and genetic analysis of complex traits including drought tolerance, thus helping to better elucidate and understand the genetic basis of such traits. A beneficial goal of new innovative breeding strategies is to shorten the breeding cycle using minimized, efficient or fast phenotyping protocols. While high throughput genotyping have been achieved, this is rarely the case for phenotyping for drought adaptation. Some of the storage root phenotyping in cassava are often done very late in the evaluation cycle making selection process very slow. This paper highlights some modified traits suitable for early-growth phase phenotyping {{that may be used}} to reduce drought phenotyping cycle in cassava. Such modified traits can significantly complement the high throughput genotyping procedures to fast track breeding of improved drought tolerant varieties. The need for metabolite profiling, improved phenomics to take advantage of next generation sequencing technologies and high throughput phenotyping are basic steps for future direction to improve genetic gain and maximize speed for drought tolerance breed...|$|E

During the <b>growth</b> <b>cycle</b> of this organism, morphological changes were noted which corresponded {{to changes in the}} pH of the culture medium. A physiological shift from acid to base production also occurred during the <b>growth</b> <b>cycle.</b> Concomitant with this physiological shift was the synthesis of 15 -azasterol. Upon synthesis of this azasterol, variations in the sterol pool were observed. These variations are identical to sterol alterations in susceptible yeast cells exposed to this drug (P. R. Hays, W. D. Neal, and L. W. Parks, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 12 : 185 - 191, 1977.) It appears that NRRL 28804 avoids growth inhibition from 15 -azasterol by confining its production to late in the <b>growth</b> <b>cycle...</b>|$|R
