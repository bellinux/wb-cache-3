5|$|When Phantoms {{were first}} {{delivered}} to interceptor squadrons, they {{remained in the}} grey-green camouflage colour scheme more associated with the strike and close air support missions they had undertaken. During the late 1970s, the RAF began experimenting with new colours for its air defence units, with 56 Squadron tasked with trialling proposed new schemes. In October 1978, a Phantom FGR.2 of 56 Squadron became {{the first to be}} painted in the new air superiority grey colour, combined with small, <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> roundels and markings. However, although the roundel remained in <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> colours, individual squadron markings eventually returned to more observable sizes and colours.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{obligation}} {{for a given}} dive profile must {{be calculated}} and monitored {{to ensure that the}} risk of decompression sickness is controlled. Some equipment is specifically for these functions, both during planning before the dive and during the dive. Other equipment is used to mark the underwater position of the diver, as a position reference in <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> or currents, or to assist the diver's ascent and control the depth.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> {{camouflage}} for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted bow wave {{to give the}} impression of high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation.|$|E
40|$|Radiation fogs sampled at Los Angeles {{were found}} to possess <b>low</b> <b>visibilities,</b> high liquid water content (LWC), {{relatively}} small drops, narrow peaked drop-size distributions, and high concentrations of micron sized haze droplets. Typical characteristics of valley fogs observed at Elmira, N. Y., were <b>low</b> <b>visibilities,</b> moderately high LWC, low concentrations of haze droplets, and similar drop size distributions to those measured in Los Angeles. On the other hand, advection fogs observed in Vandenberg were characterized by less severe <b>visibilities,</b> <b>low</b> LWC, large drops in a broad drop-size distribution, and very low haze nucleus concentrations...|$|R

5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to {{not like the}} taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E
5|$|Yet another DC-10, {{performing}} Western Airlines Flight 2605, {{crashed in}} Mexico City after a red-eye flight from Los Angeles barely 5 {{months after the}} crash of American Airlines flight 191. The Western Airlines DC-10's crash, however, was due to <b>low</b> <b>visibility</b> and an attempt to land on a closed runway. Ironically, the crash of yet another DC-10, United Airlines Flight 232, ten years later, restored some of the aircraft's reputation. Despite losing an engine and all flight controls and crash-landing in a huge fireball (which was caught on video by a local news crew), 185 people survived the accident. Experts praised the DC-10's sturdy construction as {{partly responsible for the}} high number of survivors, though the efforts of the crew were primarily responsible.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOrientation {{perception}} {{is known to}} be anisotropic, with cardinal axes (i. e., horizontal and vertical) being privileged. Indeed, orientation sensitivity is greater near the cardinals, and small deviations from cardinal axes may be illusorily perceived in an exaggerated manner. Here, we quantified this illusory deviation from the cardinals at various visibility levels, by having participants reproduce the orientation of oriented Gabor stimuli whose visibility was manipulated by duration and masking. We found, first, that participants could reproduce quite accurately the orientation of very brief stimuli presented at <b>lowest</b> <b>visibility</b> levels. Second, the magnitude of the deviation followed a non-monotonic pattern, being maximal for stimuli of intermediate visibility, and lower for both the <b>lowest</b> and highest <b>visibility</b> levels. Thus, orientation processing at <b>lowest</b> <b>visibility</b> levels is noisier but paradoxically more faithful to the physical input. This counterintuitive result suggests that categorical processing of sensory information depends on perceptual awareness...|$|R
50|$|Forward scatter sensors {{are more}} {{popular due to}} their lower price, smaller size and lower {{maintenance}} requirements. However, transmissometers are still used at some airports as they are more accurate at <b>low</b> <b>visibilities</b> and are fail-safe, i.e. in case of failure report visibility lower than actual.|$|R

2500|$|Snow {{built up}} rapidly, with bumper-high snow being {{reported}} by 1:00 pm and [...] high drifts by nightfall in the City of Buffalo. The {{depth of snow}} quickly caused many roads to become impassable (within 30 minutes {{in the part of}} Buffalo nearest Lake Erie), and the blowing snow caused extremely <b>low</b> <b>visibilities,</b> making travel nearly impossible.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{algorithm}} for encoder-based artifact reduction in transform coding. The algorithm {{can be used}} for noise shaping, i. e. concentration of the quantization noise in the region of the blocks where it has the <b>lowest</b> <b>visibility.</b> The method is based on the new Transform Coding Quantization Feedback (TCQF) algorithm, a general algorithm for quantization noise feedback in transform coding which optimizes the weighted squared error in the image domain. Experiments show that the algorithm leads to a significant reduction of mosquito noise in the decoded image at the same bit rate while maintaining complete compatibility with standard decoders. ...|$|R

50|$|In the United States, the National Weather Service {{defines a}} {{blizzard}} as a severe Snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow {{that results in}} <b>low</b> <b>visibilities.</b> The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is {{the strength of the}} wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are {{greater than or equal to}} 56 km/h with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 m or less and must last for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We have {{developed}} an animal model to inves-tigate the feasibility of using a digital radiography picture archive and communication system (PACS) to identify fish bones.

Digital radiographic images of the lateral neck were taken (60 kV, 200 mA, and 20 ms, 100 cm in distance). The images were interpreted by three radiologists.

40|$|Five multi-vehicular highway {{accidents}} {{caused by}} <b>low</b> <b>visibilities</b> in fog were examined {{as to the}} ability of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) techniques to detect the fog in advance. All of the accidents occurred near or shortly after sunrise on major U. S. or Canadian highways and resulted in numerous injuries and some fatalities. Multi-spectral infrared and visible channel data were used in the evaluation. In most cases, fog was detectable from GOES products but the lead time was usually short (1 - 3 hours). All were mesoscale events that would have required use of all available forms of observational data from satellites and surface mesonets to properly diagnose. Benefits and shortcomings of satellite-based techniques are described, along with technology improvements planned for future spacecraft. 1...|$|R

25|$|Man-made lakes, such as {{dams and}} flooded clay pits, gravel pits and {{quarries}}, often have <b>low</b> <b>visibility.</b> Disused and flooded quarries are popular in inland areas for diver training {{as well as}} recreational diving. Rock quarries may have reasonable underwater visibility - there is often little mud or silt to create mid-water particles that cause <b>low</b> <b>visibility,</b> {{and the lack of}} flow allows silt to settle on the bottom, where it may later be kicked up by unskilled divers to temporarily reduce visibility locally. As they are not natural environments, and usually privately owned, quarries may contain objects intentionally placed for divers to explore, such as sunken boats, automobiles, aircraft, or structures like grain silos and gravel chutes.|$|E
