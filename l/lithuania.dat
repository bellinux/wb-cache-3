5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1938 Adolf Hitler {{personally}} stated that gaining Klaipėda {{was one of his}} highest priorities, second only to gaining the Sudetenland. When Poland presented its ultimatum to <b>Lithuania</b> in March 1938, Germany openly declared that {{in the event of a}} military clash between Poland and <b>Lithuania,</b> its army would invade <b>Lithuania</b> to capture Klaipėda and a large portion of western <b>Lithuania.</b> A week after <b>Lithuania</b> accepted the Polish ultimatum, Germany presented an eleven-point memorandum that demanded freedom of action for pro-German activists in the region and a lessening of Lithuanian influence there. Its points were worded in a deliberately vague manner, which would enable Germany to accuse <b>Lithuania</b> of violations. <b>Lithuania</b> chose to postpone dealing with the problem, hoping that the international situation would improve. In the meantime it hoped to give the German population no reasons for complaint.|$|E

5|$|After Vytautas' {{death in}} 1430, <b>Lithuania</b> became embroiled in {{internal}} wars and conflicts with Poland.

5|$|After {{a request}} for {{assistance}} from <b>Lithuania,</b> the League Council called for Poland's withdrawal from the area. The Polish government indicated they would comply, but instead reinforced the city with more Polish troops. This prompted the League to decide {{that the future of}} Vilnius should be determined by its residents in a plebiscite and that the Polish forces should withdraw and be replaced by an international force organised by the League. The plan was met with resistance in Poland, <b>Lithuania,</b> and the Soviet Union, which opposed any international force in <b>Lithuania.</b> In March 1921, the League abandoned plans for the plebiscite. After unsuccessful proposals by Paul Hymans to create a federation between Poland and <b>Lithuania,</b> Vilnius and the surrounding area was formally annexed by Poland in March 1922. After <b>Lithuania</b> took over the Klaipėda Region, the Allied Conference set the frontier between <b>Lithuania</b> and Poland, leaving Vilnius within Poland, on 14 March 1923. Lithuanian authorities refused to accept the decision, and officially remained in a state of war with Poland until 1927. It was not until the 1938 Polish ultimatum that <b>Lithuania</b> restored diplomatic relations with Poland and thus de facto accepted the borders.|$|E

5|$|Báthory's {{position}} {{was at first}} extremely difficult, as there was still some opposition to his election.

At first {{the representatives of the}} Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke, and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury, hold Sejm conventions in both <b>Lithuania</b> and Poland, and reserve the highest governmental official offices in <b>Lithuania</b> for Lithuanians. He accepted the conditions. In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of <b>Lithuania,</b> Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia.|$|E
5|$|Cracks in the {{cooperation}} between Poland and <b>Lithuania</b> {{after the death}} of Vytautas in 1430 had offered the Knights a revived opportunity for interference in Poland. Władysław supported his brother Švitrigaila as grand duke of <b>Lithuania,</b> but when Švitrigaila, {{with the support of the}} Teutonic Order and dissatisfied Rus' nobles, rebelled against Polish overlordship in <b>Lithuania,</b> the Poles, under the leadership of Bishop Zbigniew Oleśnicki of Kraków, occupied Podolia, which Władysław had awarded to <b>Lithuania</b> in 1411, and Volhynia. In 1432, a pro-Polish party in <b>Lithuania</b> elected Vytautas's brother Žygimantas as grand duke, leading to an armed struggle over the Lithuanian succession which stuttered on for years after Władysław's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1320 Maria married Dmitri of Tver, {{ruler of}} a Russian principality. The {{marriage}} took place soon after Mikhail Yaroslavich, Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons {{were searching for}} strong allies against Yury of Moscow, their principal competitor for the throne of Vladimir and All Rus'. After 1327 <b>Lithuania</b> began to supplant Tver as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with <b>Lithuania.</b> Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, Alexander I, nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> and his daughter Uliana married Algirdas, the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line. The cooperation between <b>Lithuania</b> and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I both Poland and <b>Lithuania</b> gained independence, but borders in the region were not established. The most contentious issue was Vilnius (Wilno), historical capital of the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> with a population, according to the 1916 German census, divided about evenly between Jews and Poles, but with only a 2–3% Lithuanian minority. The Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty, signed in July 1920 between <b>Lithuania</b> and the Russian SFSR, drew the eastern border of <b>Lithuania.</b> Russia recognized large territories, including the Vilnius and Suwałki Regions, as belonging to <b>Lithuania.</b> That month, during the Polish–Soviet War, the Red Army pushed Polish forces from the contested territories, including Vilnius. In the meantime, Lithuanians secured some other areas abandoned by the Polish army, such as the town of Suwałki. On August 6, <b>Lithuania</b> and Soviet Russia signed a convention regarding withdrawal of Russian troops from the recognized Lithuanian territory. However, there were indications that the Soviets planned a coup against the Lithuanian government in hopes of re-establishing the Lithuanian SSR. The Soviet troops began to retreat only after the Red Army suffered a heavy defeat in Poland at the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August.|$|E
5|$|Klaipėda (German: Memel), an {{important}} seaport in East Prussia, was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was {{governed by the}} Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while <b>Lithuania</b> continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to <b>Lithuania</b> as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see <b>Lithuania</b> Minor) and was that country's only access to the Baltic Sea. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant {{to make a decision}} and it seemed that the region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig, <b>Lithuania</b> took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923. Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action. The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Klaipėda Parliament), was attached to <b>Lithuania.</b> The region covered about 2,400km² and had a population of approximately 140,000.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lithuania</b> {{had been}} part of the Russian Empire since the {{partitions}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the late 18th century. After the unsuccessful uprising of 1863, <b>Lithuania</b> was subjected to Russification policies: the Lithuanian press ban was initiated, schools were required to teach in the Russian language, Roman Catholics could not hold positions in government institutions and could own only limited amounts of land, and political rights were restricted. However, these measures had limited effects on the Lithuanian National Revival, and a sense of the Lithuanian national identity continued to grow. The first Lithuanian political parties, the Social Democratic Party of <b>Lithuania</b> and Lithuanian Democratic Party, included goals of political autonomy for <b>Lithuania</b> within the Russian Empire in their basic program.|$|E

5|$|The House of Mindaugas was {{the first}} royal family of Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania,</b> {{centered}} on Mindaugas, the first known and undoubted sovereign of <b>Lithuania.</b> He was crowned as King of <b>Lithuania</b> in 1253 and assassinated ten years later. His known family relations end with children; there is no data on his great-grandchildren or any relations with the Gediminids, a dynasty of sovereigns of <b>Lithuania</b> and Poland that started with Butigeidis ca. 1285 and ended with Sigismund II Augustus in 1572.|$|E
5|$|The {{family of}} Gediminas {{is a group}} of family members of Gediminas, Grand Duke of <b>Lithuania</b> (ca. 1275–1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family {{included}} the siblings, children, and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the history of <b>Lithuania</b> for the period as the Lithuanian nobility had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty, which ruled the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> from 1310s or 1280s to 1572.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} <b>Lithuania</b> between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania.</b> The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory of <b>Lithuania.</b> From this point on the history of <b>Lithuania</b> is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy of <b>Lithuania</b> was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, Minsk, and other territories east of modern-day <b>Lithuania</b> that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
