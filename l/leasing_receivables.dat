It isn’t now situation for credit, which belonged to the classical external finance sources for many years ago. However leasing has been obtaining its position during the last ten years. Recently some important regulations concerning leasing were arranged in Poland and it would let leasing to develop further. With its development a new type of risk has appeared, i. e. a leasing risk. This article refers to the mortgage as the way to secure the <b>leasing</b> <b>receivables</b> of a leasing company. It is the similiar situation {{as in the case of}} other finance companies, for example bank and because of that this article has in the majority an universal character. However the leasing risk differs from the credit risk in some points. The most important point is the risk connected with the leasing object which a leasing company owns. It means among other things the buy risk which includes the price and undelivery risk. In case o f heavy and big machines and especially in case of technological lines the property they are installed and run play an significant part. Those can only be used in places they are installed without losing their value. Because of that the mortgage on the property secure not only the <b>leasing</b> <b>receivables</b> but the leasing object installed inside as well. The mortgage on the property can play the double part in case of leasing. For the efficiency of the second part is however the quickly execution process necessary.

50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessor credits owned assets and debits a <b>lease</b> <b>{{receivable}}</b> {{account for the}} present value of the rents (an asset, which is broken out between current and long-term, the latter being {{the present value of}} rents due more than 12 months in the future). With each payment, cash is debited, the receivable is credited, and unearned (interest) income is credited. If the cost or carrying amount of the asset being leased is different from its fair value at inception, then the difference is recognized as a profit and the lease is called a sales-type lease. This most commonly applies when a manufacturer is using leasing as a method of selling its product. Other capital lessor leases, where the cost and fair value are the same, are called direct financing leases. A third type of lessor capital lease, called a leveraged lease, is used to recognize leases where the acquisition of the leased asset is substantially financed by debt.|$|R

50|$|The Tax Reform Act {{eliminated}} the double taxation of income earned at the corporate level by an issuer and dividends paid to securities holders, thereby allowing a REMIC to structure a mortgage-backed securities offering as a sale of assets, effectively removing the {{loans from the}} originating lender's balance sheet, rather than a debt financing in which the loans remain as balance sheet assets (as {{is the case for}} covered bonds). A REMIC itself is exempt from federal taxes, although income earned by investors is fully taxable. As REMICs are typically exempt from tax at the entity level, they may invest only in qualified mortgages and permitted investments, including single family or multifamily mortgages, commercial mortgages, second mortgages, mortgage participations, and federal agency pass-through securities. Nonmortgage assets, such as credit card <b>receivables,</b> <b>leases,</b> and auto loans are ineligible investments. The Tax Reform Act made it easier for savings institutions and real estate investment trusts to hold mortgage securities as qualified portfolio investments. A savings institution, for instance, can include REMIC-issued mortgage-backed securities as qualifying assets in meeting federal requirements for treatment as a savings and loan for tax purposes.|$|R
40|$|The {{productivity}} growth rate decline has jeopardized our {{standard of living}} and contributed {{to many of the}} countries economic ills. It has damaged U. S. industries 2 ̆ 7 competitive position in the world and domestic markets. It isn 2 ̆ 7 t the 2 ̆ 7 United States 2 ̆ 7 which is experiencing comparatively low rates of {{productivity growth}}; rather it is the individual firms which in aggregation make up the economy. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze those companies which are measuring their productivity to determine how they are coping with the concepts of productivity and its measurement problems. ^ A survey instrument was developed based upon a review of the literature relating to productivity and its measurement and by attending an American Productivity Center seminar. ^ Eighty-five of the Fortune 500 companies returning the questionnaire measure their productivity. These returns formed the basis for the study 2 ̆ 7 s analysis. ^ These companies use their productivity measures for a multiplicity of purposes. Some of the many uses reported included increasing awareness among employees, assisting in long and short range planning and for operational purposes. To meet their diverse needs the firms have developed many measures of productivity. Nearly all use several different measures of labor productivity. Nearly two-thirds use sales to represent output, while over three-quarters use some other value to represent output. It is evident that many firms use more than one value for output. ^ All firms measuring labor productivity included hourly employees, however a decreasing number included salary, supervisory, management, engineering or R 2 ̆ 6 D personnel. Among the firms measuring capital productivity all included equipment and machinery among their capital inputs, nearly all included land and building but the firms including inventories, account <b>receivables,</b> <b>leased</b> fixed assets or cash declined steadily. ^ The survey revealed a number of aspects of productivity measurement where many companies have departed from the theoretical concepts of productivity. Perhaps the most significant departure is that many firms fail to adjust the outputs and inputs for the effects of inflation and are obtaining spurious results. Most of the firms are not adjusting sales to reflect production in the time period under study. In many cases it appears that firms are using values which are readily available from accounting or production without attempting to refine the numbers.
