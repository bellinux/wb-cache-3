40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple alternative {{for the analysis}} and evaluation of ultrasonic scattering from arbitrary formed inclusions in materials. The basis for this are glass samples. Their sound velocity (longitudinal and transversal) can be adjusted by {{the composition of the}} glass so that it will be similar to the sound velocity of e. g. titanium alloy Ti 6246. The propagation of the sound fields in both materials is then comparable. Using <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> arbitrary formed three dimensional structures/voids can be built in glass. The surface of these internal structures consists of many micro cracks. By varying the micro crack concentration the sound transmission and reflection can be adjusted. By this means the ultrasonic scattering of impurity inclusions can be simulated. For verification different <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> voids (spheres, <b>cylinders</b> and ellipsoids) were built up in glass samples. They were inspected using focused ultrasonic probes. For comparison a titanium sample (Ti 6246) containing carbide and quartz inclusions was produced. Additionally the experimental situations were calculated using numerical simulation. Experimental and simulation results show that the correlation of ultrasonic scattering between laser engravings in glass samples and inclusions in titanium is good. Given that the production of glass samples with laser engravings is inexpensive, fast and reproducible, they offer a practical method to perform POD analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{printing}} {{industry is a}} growing market for laser applications with {{a wide spectrum of}} different kinds of lasers having been established. This paper focuses on the precise micro structuring of gravure, flexo, and embossing print forms by direct laser ablation. The principle of gravure printing is the direct ink transfer from an ink source to the print substrate by small 3 -dimensional cells engraved into the surface of a <b>cylinder.</b> Direct <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> into metallic <b>cylinders</b> is performed with a high power Q-switched Nd:YAG laser system tuned for high reproducibility and stability of the mean pulse energy (σ 2 < 1 %). An exact modulation technique allows fast variation and precise calibration of the energy of each single laser pulse as well as active modulation of the intensity profile of the beam. This method permits to set diameter and depth of each cell independently from pulse to pulse at a rate of 70 kHz. The aspect ratio and the shape of each single cell can therefore be defined freely for each laser pulse controlled by digital image data. Thus the cell shape can be optimized for the best ink transfer characteristic on different print substrates. ...|$|R

Laser technique is being applied in the textile and fashion industries {{because it is an}} ideal surface treatment for design application without usage of chemicals and water. This paper will explore a design method that combines <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> technology and metallic foil laminating for a sheening surface effect. Before the application of <b>laser</b> <b>engraving,</b> the aluminum foil is laminated on denim fabric with laminating adhesive. Then, the laminated denim fabric is <b>engraved</b> by the <b>laser</b> with a different DPI (dots per inch) as well as the pixel time (microsecond, μs). The performance of the <b>laser</b> <b>engraved</b> foil laminated denim fabric is investigated, including physical and mechanical properties. The study demonstrates an embellishment application in denim fabric, which developed metallic appearance with patterns on denim fabric combing the aluminum foil laminating and the <b>laser</b> <b>engraving</b> techniques.
