40|$|Central {{diabetes}} insipidus (DI) {{can be the}} outcome of a number of diseases that affect the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis. The causes of the condition can be classified as traumatic, inflammatory, or neoplastic. Traumatic causes include postoperative sella or transection of the pituitary stalk, while infectious or inflammatory causes include <b>meningitis,</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> hypophysitis, and granulomatous inflammations such as sarcoidosis and Wegener’s granulomatosis. Various neoplastic conditions such as germinoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, metastasis, leukemic infiltration, lymphoma, teratoma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, Rathke cleft cyst, hypothalamic glioma, and meningioma are also causes of central DI. In affected patients, careful analysis of these MR imaging features and correlation with the clinical manifestations can allow a more specific diagnosis, which is essential for treatment.

40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is {{multipotent}} cytokine {{that acts}} {{in a network}} of factors directing the inflammatory reaction of purulent bacterial meningitis (PBM). However, {{little is known about}} the role of IL- 6 in aseptic or "viral " meningitis (AM). IL- 6 was assayed by RIA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples obtained from patients with AM (n = 65), PBM (n = 8), and <b>lymphocytic</b> bacterial <b>meningitis</b> (LBM, n = 11). Of patients with AM, 89 % had detectable IL- 6 in CSF, with high IL- 6 titers (median, 2160 pgjmL; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1320 - 2540 pgjmL) compared with 100 % in patients with PBM (median, 6575 pgjmL; 95 % CI, 450 - 32, 000 pgjmL) and 90. 9 % in patients with LBM (median, 875 pgjmL; 95 % CI, 150 - 2180 pgjmL). There was a highly symmetrical correlation between IL- 6 and the percentage of polymorphonu-clear cells in CSF of patients with PBM (r =. 97, P =. 01) and AM (r =. 49, P =. 002). In conclusion, this study shows evidence that IL- 6 is released into the meningeal space in aseptic meningitis and is correlated with the local acute inflammatory response. Cumulative evidence indicates that there is a relationship between the local host response to an invasive pathogen and both meningeal damage and prognosis in bacterial meningi...|$|R

40|$|Viral infections of {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) are highly varied and in many cases {{difficult}} for diagnostics. Recently they have become more frequent in the practice of the specialists in infectious diseases and general medicine. Sometimes they had a motley clinical spectrum in other cases they were so similar that their appearance was a big challenge for clinicians. The aim of this presentation was to clarify the peculiarities in clinical course and prognostic factors {{of some of the most}} widespread viral CNS infections. In Bulgaria, 400 cases of viral infections of the CNS were registered per annum. The most prevalent of them were caused by Enteroviruses. Encephalitis, caused by Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1) was associated with high mortality and severe residual complications in survivors. VZV provoked benign encephalitis with cerebellitis. <b>Lymphocytic</b> choriomeningitis virus <b>meningitis</b> was characterized with long-lasting meningeal signs and combined with some psychological deviations and focal neurological disorders. Influenza virus rare but serious affected CNS with convulsions, psychotic expressions, stupor and coma. Prognosis for the severity of viral infections of the CNS was dependent on age, immune status, neurological predisposition and virulence of the etiological agent.

We report a case of young male who had history of fever and headache {{on and off for}} 2 years and later developed signs of meningitis, lateral rectus palsy, altered sensorium and bilateral papilledema. He did not respond to anti-tubercular therapy and antibiotics. CT scan and MRI brain were normal. He had hepato-splenomegaly with small hypoechoic lesions in the spleen. CSF culture grew gram negative bacilli. Brucella IgG antibodies in serum by EIA 7, IgM negative, Brucella antigen titer was positive, 1 : 160.

40|$|Background Hypersentivity Syndrome (HS) {{may be a}} {{life-threatening}} condition. It frequently presents with fever, rash, eosinophilia and systemic manifestations. Mortality can {{be as high as}} 10 % and is primarily due to hepatic failure. We describe what we believe to be the first case of minocycline-induced HS with accompanying <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> and cerebral edema reported in the literature. Case presentation A 31 -year-old HIV-positive female of African origin presented with acute fever, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> brain edema, rash, eosinophilia, and cytolytic hepatitis. She had been started on minocycline for inflammatory acne 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. HS was diagnosed clinically and after exclusion of infectious causes. Minocycline was withdrawn and steroids were administered from the second day after presentation because of the severity of the symptoms. All signs resolved by the seventh day and steroids were tailed off over a period of 8 months. Conclusion Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for serious adverse reactions to minocycline including <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> and cerebral edema among HIV-positive patients, especially if they are of African origin. Safer alternatives should be considered for treatment of acne vulgaris. Early recognition of the symptoms and prompt withdrawal of the drug are important to improve the outcome. </p...|$|E

Empirical antituberculous drugs with initial corticosteroid resulted in improved CSF parameters. A diagnosis of cerebral tuberculoma complicated by meningitis was made. She subsequently deteriorated clinically and radiologically. Despite a number of clinical features which were atypical of leptomeningeal metastasis, adenosquamous carcinoma was found on biopsy.

40|$|Meningitis is {{the main}} {{infectious}} central nervous system (CNS) syndrome. Viruses or bacteria can cause acute meningitis of infectious etiology. The term “Aseptic Meningitis ” denotes a clinical syndrome with a predominance of lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with no common bacterial agents identified in the CSF. Viral meningitis is considered {{the main cause of}} lymphocyte meningitis. There are other etiologies of an infectious nature.

40|$|We studied 100 {{patients}} with tick-borne meningopolyneuritis (Garin-Bujadoux, Bann-warth), the neurologic component of European erythema chronicum migrans disease. They had intensive radicular pain, asymmetric polyneuritis combined often with uni- or bilateral facial palsy, <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> without or with only slight meningismus, and a course lasting {{three to five}} months. Neurologic abnormalities were preceded by the bite of a tick or an insect in 37 percent of patients or by an erythema in 41 percent.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the clinical presentation}} of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome in Belgian patients {{in comparison with the}} literature. Methods: A retrospective case series of 12 patients diagnosed and treated in a university hospital. The 12 patient files were checked for gender, age, ethnicity, duration of follow-up, stage of disease, ocular and extraocular manifestations, presence of symptomatic <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> differential diagnosis, treatment and side effects, number of recurrences, complications and time to complete remission. Results: Besides ocular manifestations all 12 patients had also neurological manifestations with headache (100 %) and <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> (75 %) as main findings. The primary auditory (67 %) and dermatological (33 %) manifestations were respectively tinnitus (50 %) and vitiligo (33 %). Recurrent uveitis occurred in the majority (64 %) with an average of 2. 1 times per patient and a mean time to recurrence of 5. 7 months. An ophthalmologic complete remission was achieved in 7 (58 %) patients after a mean period of 14 months (ranging from 2 to 42 months). There is a favourable prognosis with normal visual acuity in 92 % of patients {{at the end of the}} follow-up. Conclusion: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is a rare disorder that is little known in general medicine. The main problem is that this disorder affects multiple systems and patients are not always seen first by an ophthalmologist. That’s why every internist should keep this syndrome in mind when examining a patient with visual complaints associated with general symptoms such as headache, general malaise, fever and nausea. Those general symptoms may not simply be attributed to the uveitis, but their presence should be an argument to do a lumbar puncture to rule out underlying <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis.</b> Contrariwise there has to be an ophthalmologic examination in each patient with unexplained general symptoms to rule out Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{found the}} {{prevalence}} of recurrent <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> associated with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) was 2. 2 / 100, 000 population in Finland during 1996 – 2006, higher than previous estimates. PCR was most sensitive in detecting HSV- 2 DNA from cerebrospinal fluid if the sample was taken 2 – 5 days after symptom onset. Recurrent <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> (RLM) is a rare disease, characterized by attacks of sudden onset aseptic meningitis followed by complete recovery and unpredictable recurrences. The disease is most often caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) and less frequently by other viruses, autoimmune disorders, or medication. Symptomatic episodes of RLM usually subside within 5 years, but {{the total number of}} episodes may reach 30. Patients are typically middle-aged, and women are more often affected than men (1 – 3). In addition to symptoms typical of meningitis, ≈ 50 % of patients have transient hallucinations, seizures, cranial nerve palsies, or an altered level of consciousness (4). The Study This study was conducted at Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland, which serves a population of 1. 4 million. The prevalence study covered January 1996 through December 2006.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionMollaret's {{meningitis}} is {{an unusual}} and under-appreciated syndrome of benign, recurrent aseptic meningitis. The available literature indicates that the causative agent is herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) {{in the majority of}} cases and much less frequently herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1). Case reportWe report the case of a 49 -year-old Indian female who had four attacks of recurrent <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> (Mollaret's meningitis) occurring over a 7 -year period. The diagnosis of herpes simplex meningitis was made {{at the time of the}} fourth episode by a positive PCR for herpes simplex virus infection in the cerebrospinal fluid. During the first three episodes, the patient was treated with anti-tuberculous drugs and antibiotics for bacterial meningitis; however for the last episode, once the diagnosis of herpes simplex meningitis was confirmed, only symptomatic treatment was given. No long-term suppressive therapy was given and no recurrence has been experienced so far. ConclusionsMollaret's meningitis should be suspected in all cases of recurrent <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis.</b> Early diagnosis may prevent prolonged hospital admissions, unnecessary investigations, and exposure to unnecessary medications, with the associated considerable costs. Treatment with acyclovir may be beneficial in decreasing the severity and duration of attacks and in preventing further episodes. [Au? 1]...|$|E

YKL- 40 was determined in 134 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples taken on admission from patients suspected of having meningitis (48 with purulent meningitis, 49 with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> 5 with encephalitis, and 32 without evidence of meningitis). YKL- 40 levels in CSF were significantly higher in patients with purulent meningitis (median, 663 g/liter [range, 20 to 8, 960]) and encephalitis (5, 430 g/liter [620 to 11, 600]) than in patients with <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>meningitis</b> (137 g/liter [41 to 1, 865]) or patients without meningitis (167 g/liter [24 to 630]) (Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn multiple compar-ison tests, P < 0. 001). CSF YKL- 40 levels were also determined for 26 patients with purulent meningitis having a repuncture, and patients who died (n 5) had significantly higher YKL- 40 levels than patients who survived (n 21) (2, 100 g/liter [1, 160 to 7, 050] versus 885 g/liter [192 to 15, 400], respectively; Mann-Whitney test, P 0. 018). YKL- 40 was most likely locally produced, since patients with infections of the central nervous system had CSF YKL- 40 levels that were at least 10 -fold higher than the corresponding levels in serum (2, 033 g/liter [470 to 11, 600] versus 80 g/liter [19 to 195]).
