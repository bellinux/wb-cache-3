He agreed to a school construction plan funded by borrowing up of to 2.5 billion in bonds, though he thought the crowding problem was being exaggerated for political purposes. He also sponsored 1998 legislation to improve and streamline pre-kindergarten education and provide training for parents who would be homeschooling their children.|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} claiming equal {{entitlement to}} continued {{life has been}} strongly defended in the literature as a fundamental social value. We refer to this principle as ‘equal value of life’. In this paper we {{argue that there is}} a general incompatibility between the equal value of <b>life</b> <b>principle</b> and the weak Pareto principle and provide proof of this under mild structural assumptions. Moreover we demonstrate that a weaker, age-dependent version of the equal value of <b>life</b> <b>principle</b> is also incompatible with the weak Pareto principle. However, both principles can be satisfied if transitivity of social preference is relaxed to quasi-transitivity. 1...|$|R

30|$|A closing remark {{concerning}} life's complexity. Life {{is complex}} - that is undeniable. But {{that does not}} necessarily mean that the <b>life</b> <b>principle</b> is complex. In fact we would argue that the <b>life</b> <b>principle</b> is in some sense relatively simple! Indeed, simple rules can lead to complex patterns, as studies in complexity have amply demonstrated [67, 68]. So we would suggest that life, from its simple beginnings as some minimal replicating system, and following a simple rule - the drive toward greater dynamic kinetic stability within replicator space - is yet another example of that fundamental idea.|$|R
