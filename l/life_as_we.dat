5|$|Gamma ray bursts {{can have}} harmful or {{destructive}} effects on life. Considering {{the universe as}} a whole, the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies. Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it can only exist in about 10% of all galaxies. Furthermore, galaxies with a redshift, z, higher than 0.5 are unsuitable for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, because of their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness.|$|E
5|$|Conditions on {{the other}} {{terrestrial}} planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it. But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.|$|E

Andrews defended the decision, saying: [...] "Some groups don't seem to be settling and adjusting into the Australian way of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> quickly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> would hope." ...|$|R

5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in the horizontal branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood {{is in the form}} of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's thirteenth writing credit and Kretchmer's eleventh directing credit for the series. The episode features several notable guest appearances. Dan Castellaneta, {{best known as the}} voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, appears as Dr. Kinny, a sociology professor. Rider Strong guest stars as a student who participates as a guard in the experiment. The episode features a guest appearance by Samm Levine, best known for his role on Freaks and Geeks. Levine had previously worked with series star Chris Lowell on <b>Life</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> Know It, a show that had been cancelled in 2005. Rachelle Lefevre, known for her later roles as Victoria in The Twilight Saga and in Under the Dome, guest stars as Marjorie, one of the sorority girls who becomes friends with Veronica.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the solar}} system appears hostile to <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it. No {{extraterrestrial}} life has ever been discovered, but there are several locations outside Earth where life could possibly exist, have existed, or thrive if introduced.|$|E
25|$|Scenes {{from the}} movies Due Date and <b>Life</b> <b>as</b> <b>We</b> Know It, both {{released}} in 2010, were filmed and had scenes {{take place on}} location at Hartsfield Airport.

25|$|Dawkins {{finishes}} {{by arguing}} that atheism is not a recipe for despair but just the opposite; rather than viewing <b>life</b> <b>as</b> a trial that must be endured before reaching a mythical hereafter, an atheist sees this <b>life</b> <b>as</b> all <b>we</b> have, and by disclaiming a next life can take more excitement in this one. Atheism, Dawkins concludes, is life-affirming {{in a way that}} religion can never be.|$|R

25|$|This {{can be seen}} {{as simply}} the classic design {{argument}} restated in the garb of contemporary cosmology.

25|$|Terraforming: {{a process}} of {{planetary}} engineering, specifically directed at enhancing the capacity of an extraterrestrial planetary environment to support <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it.

25|$|In June 2015, astronomers {{reported}} evidence for Population III {{stars in the}} Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy (at z = 6.60) found in Sextans.

25|$|There are {{two main}} {{drawbacks}} to the pulsar timing method: pulsars are relatively rare, and special circumstances are required for a planet to form around a pulsar. Therefore, {{it is unlikely that}} a large number of planets will be found this way. Also, <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it could not survive on planets orbiting pulsars due to the intensity of high-energy radiation there.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{question}} of what makes a planet habitable is much more complex than having a planet located at the right distance from its host star so that water can be liquid on its surface: various geophysical and geodynamical aspects, the radiation, and the host stars plasma environment can influence the evolution of planets and life, if it originated. Liquid water is a necessary but not sufficient condition for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, as habitability is a function of a multitude of environmental parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Janice Bishop, a Mars {{specialist}} {{from the}} Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence Institute also told the BBC that: [...] "All <b>life</b> forms <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it require liquid water {{so if we}} can actually find periods of time or places on the planet where there was standing water then the chance of life having formed increase greatly." ...|$|R

Research {{on the impact}} of {{cognitive}} aging on personal memories is examined including declines in working memory, long-term memory, processing speed, processing resources and inhibition of unnecessary information. Attentional resources and distinctive processing decline. <b>Life</b> speeds up <b>as</b> <b>we</b> age because our strongest memories occur earlier in our lives. Events occurring in late adulthood simply do not undergo the same scrutiny of encoding, storage and retrieval <b>as</b> earlier <b>life</b> events. Research in this field informs both teachers and students as to the best ways to shape the adult learning experience...|$|R
25|$|During {{the next}} two decades, NASA will {{continue}} to conduct missions to address whether life ever arose on Mars. The search begins with determining whether the Martian environment was ever suitable for life. <b>Life,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> understand it, requires water, so the history of water on Mars is critical to finding out if the Martian environment was ever conducive to life. Although the Mars Exploration Rovers {{do not have the}} ability to detect life directly, they are offering very important information on the habitability of the environment in the planet's history.|$|E
25|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{landed the}} Curiosity rover that is {{currently}} in operation on Mars. It was launched 26 November 2011, and landed at Gale Crater on 6 August 2012. Mission objectives are to help assess Mars' habitability and in doing so, determine whether Mars is or has {{ever been able to}} support life, collect data for a future human mission, study Martian geology, its climate, and further assess the role that water, an essential ingredient for <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, played in forming minerals on Mars.|$|E
25|$|The {{observed}} {{values of}} the dimensionless physical constants (such as the fine-structure constant) governing the four fundamental interactions are balanced as if fine-tuned to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life. A slight increase in the strong interaction would bind the dineutron and the diproton, and nuclear fusion would have converted all hydrogen {{in the early universe}} to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.|$|E
