5000|$|Naphyrone {{emerged as}} a new <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> in the United Kingdom only months after the ban of similar drug {{mephedrone}} (which was also a cathinone derivative). Until July 2010 the substance was not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and was therefore not illegal for someone to possess. The Medicines Act prevented naphyrone from being sold for human consumption, and therefore it was sometimes sold as 'pond cleaner' or as another substance not normally consumed by humans. In response to this emerging trend of new designer drugs, Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said, [...] "action {{to address the issue}} of emerging legal highs coming on to the market is a priority for the government." ...|$|E

Katie accuses Robert of {{having an affair with}} Alicia Metcalfe (Natalie Anderson) but is later proved wrong and is humiliated. Chas later convinces Katie to give her cousin Belle Dingle (Eden Taylor-Draper) a job at the stables. Katie sympathizes with Belle, who has a manslaughter conviction after accidentally killing one of her friends, Gemma Andrews (Tendai Rinomhota) in a fight, and tells Belle of her own experience with her involvement in Miss Strickland's death. Belle and Katie become close and Katie discovers that Belle is suffering from delusions and hearing Gemma's voice in her head.

40|$|The Minister of State, with {{responsibility}} for Drugs Strategy, Róisín Shortall T. D., announced today (Tuesday, 1 Nov) that the Government has approved an Order declaring a further range of “legal highs” to be controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. In May 2010, approximately 200 substances were placed {{under the control of}} under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. In August 2010 the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 made it a criminal offence to sell substances which have psychoactive effects. Due to these concerted legislative actions, there has been a significant {{reduction in the number of}} headshops operating throughout the country, from over 100 to approximately 10. “These new substances are dangerous and pose significant health risks for people who use them” the Minister said. “The Government has now brought under control another 60 substances approximately. This would not have been possible without the close working between my Department and other statutory and non-statutory bodies, as well as individual experts in this field. ” she added. Background * Further cathinone substances (further substances similar to mephedrone (Meow) which was controlled in May 2010); * naphthylpyrovalerone and related substances (e. g. the <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> product Pure NRG); * further synthetic cannabis-type substances (often sold as SPICE smoking mixtures); * dimethocaine and desethyl dimethocaine (contained in the <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> products Amplified and MindMelt); * desoxypipradol (found in the <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> product WHACK); * aminotetralins and aminoindans (e. g. the <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> product Pink Champagne); * fluorotropacocaine (also found in the <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> product WHACK); * bromodragonFLY; * salvinorin A found in the plant Salvia divinorum; * mitragynine and 7 -hydroxymitragynine found in the plant known as Kratom...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{availability}} of so called legal highs over the internet has hugely increased. Numerous online <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> retailers market a broad variety of products which are advertised as research chemicals, bath salts or plant food although clearly {{intended for human consumption}} as recreational drug replacements. No guidelines exist as to what is sold and in what purity. Consumers are led to believe that purchased goods are entirely legal. In this study several <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> products were purchased and analysed for their content.

40|$|The {{continuous}} appearance of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) in <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> products presents {{a challenge for}} the routine analytical laboratory. A rapid screening method for NPS analysis using fast gas chromatography mass spectrometry (fast GC-MS) is presented. Twenty-three analytes, including 5 -iodo- 2 -aminoindane (5 -IAI), 1 -(thiophen- 2 -yl) - 2 -methylaminopropane (MPA), 1 -benzylpiperazine (BZP), 4 -methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), 5, 6 -methylenedioxy- 2 -aminoindane (MDAI) and methoxetamine (MXE) were separated within 4 min. The method was used to analyze 35 Internet and head shop purchased 'legal high' products with the successful identification of their active ingredients. As previously observed, <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> products do not always contain their stated ingredients. Of the group of products purchased as 5 -IAI not one contained 5 -IAI with several containing mixtures of substances either already controlled in the UK or under consideration by the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The low bleed and high inertness of the chromatography column used ensured clean high quality mass spectrometry data which when combined with the short run time resulted in an efficient tool for NPS screening, even when standards were unavailable. Electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectra used in combination for the identification of unknown NPS are presented. Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{supply of}} {{recreational}} drugs {{has changed and}} users increasingly buy 'legal highs' over the Internet. Use of these is common {{and there is a}} potential for significant toxicity associated with their use. AIM: To determine the content of <b>legal</b> <b>highs</b> available for purchase in the UK and whether the content of these remains consistent. METHODS: Twenty-six <b>legal</b> <b>highs</b> were purchased monthly from five different Internet sites over 6 months. These were analysed to determine the drugs in the products and whether there were any changes in their content over this time period. RESULTS: All products were supplied initially, but there was a decline in supply of products month by month. The following drug classes were detected: piperazines, cathinones, caffeine/ephedrine or products in which no psychoactive drugs were detected. Of the products supplied on more than one occasion, 15 (75 %) contained the same compounds on each occasion. In three products there was a change in the piperazine detected, with 1 -benzylpiperazine being substituted for 1 -methyl- 4 -benzylpiperazine or vice versa. In two other products there was a cathinone [4 -fluorophenylpiperazine (pFPP) or 3 -fluromethcathinone (3 FMC) ] detected in products purchased in Month 1 that was not present in the products purchased in subsequent months. CONCLUSION: Whilst there was no variation in the composition of most <b>legal</b> <b>highs</b> supplied over 6 month, there was significant variation in the piperazine or cathinone content of one quarter of the products. This variation could be of clinical significance as the cathinone and piperazine products can be associated with significant toxicity...|$|R

The distinct lack of specialist support and referral to drug treatment for this patient population, with whom ambulance services are coming into contact with increasing frequency, is reported.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} phenomenon of ‘legal highs’ or Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS), directing substantial focus towards the exploration of user attraction. Whilst <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> research is expanding, the topic of legal highs still remains a relatively under-researched topic. In particular, research concerning the user is in short supply, as policy makers remain detached from the importance of understanding the attraction for users (Winstock and Ramsey, 2010). Therefore, this paper attempts to capitalise in the expansion of this knowledge and discover what reasons users attribute {{for the use of}} these psychoactive substances. A comprehensive review of the current literature has attributed the rise in use to predominantly two significant factors, ‘legality’ and ‘availability’. Although existing literature identifies legality as a secondary motivating factor, this paper questions whether its impact is somewhat underplayed throughout previous research...|$|E
40|$|Using {{mainstream}} media communication theories, this article outlines different {{mechanisms by which}} media can impact on public perceptions of drugs and crime. The media can set the agenda and define public interest; frame issues through selection and salience; indirectly shape individual and community attitudes towards risk and norms; and feed into political debate and decision making. We demonstrate how the media can fulfill each of these roles by examining the so-called Miaow Miaow (Mephedrone) <b>legal</b> <b>high</b> ‘epidemic’, {{as reported in the}} United Kingdom news media from 2009 - 2010. In doing so we illustrate that by contributing to hysteria, exerting pressure for policy change and increasing curiosity in drug use, the media can have a potentially powerful impact on demand for drugs and public perceptions of illicit drugs and drugs policy.
