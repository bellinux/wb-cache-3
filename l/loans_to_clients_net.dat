By using questionnaire, focus group discussions and PRA tools namely seasonal analysis of income, expenditure, savings and credit; Household generation; Receipts and spending of cash analysis; Financial analysis and Product attribute ranking, 107 respondents were contacted.

50|$|Management {{accounting}} is an applied discipline used {{in various}} industries. The specific functions and principles followed can vary {{based on the}} industry. Management accounting principles in banking are specialized but do have some common fundamental concepts used whether the industry is manufacturing-based or service-oriented. For example, transfer pricing is a concept used in manufacturing but is also applied in banking. It is a fundamental principle used in assigning value and revenue attribution to the various business units. Essentially, transfer pricing in banking is the method of assigning the interest rate risk of the bank to the various funding sources and uses of the enterprise. Thus, the bank's corporate treasury department will assign funding charges to the business units for {{their use of the}} bank's resources when they make <b>loans</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients.</b> The treasury department will also assign funding credit to business units who bring in deposits (resources) to the bank. Although the funds transfer pricing process is primarily applicable <b>to</b> the <b>loans</b> and deposits of the various banking units, this proactive is applied to all assets and liabilities of the business segment. Once transfer pricing is applied and any other management accounting entries or adjustments are posted to the ledger (which are usually memo accounts and are not included in the legal entity results), the business units are able to produce segment financial results which are used by both internal and external users to evaluate performance.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to analyze the credit risk of a {{microfinance}} institution based on the loan portfolio of a leading Maghrebian microfinance institution, both in terms of number of clients served and of portfolio size. This allows us to work with a proprietary data set of 1, 144, 770 contracts issued between 1997 and 2007. Using a resampling technique, we estimate the probability density function of losses and value-at-risk measures for a portfolio of <b>loans</b> granted <b>to</b> female and male microfinance clients separately. Results show that loss rates are higher for a male client population than for a female client population, both on average as for percentiles 95 to 99. 99. We find that this difference is due to lower default probabilities for female clients, while recovery rates for male and female clients are similar. We also analyze diversification effects, where we find that the proportion of diversifiable risk in total risk is bigger for portfolios of <b>loans</b> granted <b>to</b> female <b>clients</b> than for portfolios of <b>loans</b> granted <b>to</b> male <b>clients.</b> Finally we show that capital requirements determined by the 99. 9 percentile remain below those required by the Basel 2 Accords, which opens perspectives for a specific treatment of microfinance if financial regulation becomes applicable to the sector. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Based on {{interviews}} of MFIs in post war - Burundi about factors affecting their 2011 client loan defaults, this paper analyses how these {{factors contribute to}} a lower repayment rate using information asymmetry and an enforcement model. The primary repayment rate challenges found include confusing a loan with a grant, client mobility/migration, population displacement along {{with the creation of}} varieties of population features, households asset/wealth/ losses and genuine small business risk&/market losses/. The increase in in the number of risky borrowers {{as a result of a}} rise in the misunderstanding of a <b>loan</b> due <b>to</b> long-term relief intervention can lead to a high-risk, low- repayment rate equilibrium under adverse selection scenarios. Furthermore, the resulting loss of willingness <b>to</b> repay the <b>loan</b> makes enforcement difficult. The decrease in the incentive power of future <b>loans</b> due <b>to</b> <b>client</b> migration, a lower social stigma resulting from the creation of various population features in the community along with population displacement, and a lower implicit group collateral possibility as a result of household asset/wealth losses weaken peer pressure, monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, thereby reducing the loan repayment rate.
