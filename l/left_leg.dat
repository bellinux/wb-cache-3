5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the unmatched <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another unmatched leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E

40|$|Fifty-three {{psychiatric}} patients, 16 with schizophrenia, 19 with affective disorder, and 19 with schizo-affective disorder {{were diagnosed}} by Research Diagnostic Criteria. Hoffmann reflex recovery curves were {{measured in the}} right and <b>left</b> <b>legs</b> of each patient. In both affective disorder and schizo-affective disorder, recovery curve height in the right and <b>left</b> <b>legs</b> was highly correlated. In schizophrenia, recovery curve height in the right and <b>left</b> <b>legs</b> was not correlated. These results demonstrate a right-left asymmetry in motor neuron excitability specific to schizophrenia. The findings are compatible with a deficit in hemispheric transfer that is unique to schizophrenia. Other interpretations can be made, including diffuse cortical or subcortical dysfunction in schizophrenia which disrupts transfer or interpretation or intrahemispheric communication...|$|R

5|$|Parizeau's stance created {{opposition}} in the sovereignty movement, which coalesced around Bloc Québécois leader Lucien Bouchard. A popular and charismatic figure, Bouchard had come close to death from necrotizing fasciitis and lost his <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> His recovery, and subsequent public appearances on crutches, provided a rallying point for sovereigntists and the public at large. Bouchard thought a proposal lacking a partnership would doom the project among soft nationalists (such as himself) who worried about the economic consequences of separation.|$|E
5|$|Stunt co-ordinator Martin Grace {{suffered}} an injury while shooting {{the scene where}} Bond climbs down the train to catch Octopussy's attention. During {{the second day of}} filming, Grace – who was Roger Moore's stunt double for the scene – carried on doing the scene longer than he should have, due to a miscommunication with the second unit director, and the train entered a section of the track which the team had not properly surveyed.

5|$|The {{civil war}} {{had led to}} an {{economic}} collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus {{to the east and}} war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b> On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his <b>left</b> <b>leg</b> was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.|$|E

Joint angles were chosen to control muscle tendon lengths so that the muscles were near their optimal length within the length– tension relationship.

It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his third major crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his <b>left</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} few months of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in his <b>left</b> <b>leg,</b> and chronic nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs.

After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E
