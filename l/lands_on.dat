5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player <b>lands</b> <b>on,</b> Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> a fork in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E

He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, whilst Jaws <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> a trapeze net within a circus tent.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E

50|$|This {{relation}} with Pascal's triangle is demonstrated for small values of n. At zero turns, the only possibility {{will be to}} remain at zero. However, at one turn, there is one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −1 or one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 1. At two turns, a marker at 1 could move to 2 or back to zero. A marker at −1, could move to −2 or back to zero. Therefore, there is one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> −2, two chances of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> zero, and one chance of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> 2.|$|R
5|$|C Company <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> Guadalcanal unopposed and marches to the {{interior}} of the island, encountering natives and evidence of the Japanese presence.

5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E

It is exceptionally efficient at digesting its food, and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E
5000|$|Cole Porter makes a comic {{allusion to}} Plymouth Rock {{in the title}} song of the 1934 musical Anything Goes, imagining that, if Puritans were to object to [...] "shocking" [...] modern mores, instead [...] "of <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> Plymouth Rock, Plymouth Rock would <b>land</b> <b>on</b> them."

5|$|After Janet passed Barbados, {{the island}} was {{declared}} a state of emergency. Relief workers on Barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways, and the local government made requests for food and construction materials. The extensive damaged caused by Janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955Housing Act, which created the National Housing Authority (NHA) in 1956. The NHA was responsible for the acquisition of <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials, which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage. The newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struck.|$|E
5|$|After {{the pilot}} docks with {{a space station}} or <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> a planet, the screen and its {{interface}} change to a rendition of the area he is visiting. The player moves the pilot to different locations and interacts with certain objects, such as reading a bulletin board and talking to other characters, by clicking on their graphical representations. Freelancers economy consists of buying and selling spacecraft, their armaments and components, and commodities. Certain goods are considered contraband in some systems, {{and they have to}} be smuggled past police patrols to their buyers. Computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) in certain locations on the planets or stations offer quests and jobs.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 2008, {{advocacy}} groups in Maryland and New York, and their federal representatives, pushed for legislation to establish two national historical parks honoring Harriet Tubman: one to include her {{place of birth}} on Maryland's eastern shore, and sites along {{the route of the}} Underground Railroad in Caroline, Dorchester, and Talbot Counties in Maryland; and a second to include her home in Auburn, NY. For the next six years, bills to do so were introduced, but were never advanced or enacted. Meantime, in 2013, President Barack Obama used his executive authority to create the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, consisting of federal <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> Maryland's Eastern Shore at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
50|$|The Huygens probe, {{carried to}} Saturn's moon Titan by the Cassini, was {{specifically}} designed to survive <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> <b>land</b> and <b>on</b> liquid. It was thoroughly drop-tested {{to make sure it}} could withstand impact and continue functioning for at least three minutes. However, due to the low speed impact, it continued providing data {{for more than two hours}} after it <b>landed.</b> The <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> Titan in 2005 was the first <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> planet's satellites outside the Moon.|$|R

She <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> Krazoa Palace, after receiving a distress call from the planet and discovers that it was attacked by General Scales and the SharpClaw army. Krystal is persuaded by a wounded EarthWalker in the Palace to help by collecting all of the Krazoa Spirits and returning them to the palace, which would supposedly tilt the war in the dinosaurs' favour and stop Scales. However, after releasing the first one, a mysterious being sends Krystal into the spirit's path, trapping her in a floating crystal atop the Krazoa Palace until all the spirits can be returned.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{access to}} parks was {{a feature of}} many {{initiatives}} Jewell undertook as Secretary. A 2014 Secretarial Order set benchmarks to increase youth involvement, seeking to create opportunities {{for young people to}} play, learn, serve, and work in national parks. Jewell led the kickoff of the Every Kid Every Park program by leading fourth graders on a hike through Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. The Every Kid initiative made every fourth grade student, and their families, eligible for a free one-year pass to every national park. Jewell also backed a 2016 initiative to expedite permitting for youth organizations to explore public wild <b>lands</b> <b>on</b> overnight or multi-day trips, particularly in less popular parks.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by getting stuck in the ground. However, even {{on a flat surface}} it {{is possible}} for a coin to <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from <b>landing</b> <b>on</b> their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does <b>land</b> <b>on</b> its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|R
