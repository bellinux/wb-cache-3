5000|$|In 1883, Colonel Joe Rickey was {{purported to}} have invented the [...] "Joe Rickey," [...] after a {{bartender}} at Shoomaker's in Washington, D.C. added a lime to his [...] "mornin's morning," [...] a {{daily dose of}} Bourbon with <b>lump</b> <b>ice</b> and Apollinaris sparkling mineral water. Some stories place the exact day as a Monday after Col. Joe Rickey celebrated his wager with a Philadelphian on the successful ascension of John G. Carlisle to Speaker of the House. Col. Joe Rickey {{was known as a}} [...] "gentleman gambler" [...] and placed many bets on the outcome of various political contests.|$|E
60|$|Alleyne said nothing, but {{his heart}} seemed to turn to a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> in his bosom.|$|R
60|$|He {{filled a}} tumbler from the {{fountain}} on the side-table, and dropped in a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b> Leland drained it thirstily.|$|R
60|$|Despite his {{resolute}} purpose {{the poor}} man {{sat down on a}} <b>lump</b> of <b>ice,</b> buried his face in his hands, and meditated.|$|R
60|$|Some {{people got}} a {{splinter}} in their hearts, {{and that was}} dreadful, for then it began {{to turn into a}} <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps they did," [...] Jake owned, grinning. [...] "Anyhow, we'll {{have some}} more, with a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> in it, {{before we go}} down to lunch." ...|$|R
60|$|Maraton {{crossed the}} room and stood by her side. He spoke very gently. He even took her hand, which lay like a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> in his.|$|R
60|$|He {{had ordered}} {{a slave to}} hold <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> to his forehead, whilst Philippus Decius--lying next to him--was having perfume rubbed {{into the back of}} his neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your brother 'Dolphus," [...] {{said his}} father, poking the fire, [...] "is late to-night, Johnny, and will come home like a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b> What's got your {{precious}} mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you cold now?' she asked, {{and kissed}} his forehead. The kiss was cold as ice and reached down to his heart, which was already half a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b>|$|R
60|$|Little Kay {{was almost}} blue and black with cold, {{but he did}} not feel it, for she had kissed away his {{feelings}} and his heart was a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Castro {{dropped the}} next <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> {{somewhat}} hastily, {{so that the}} liquid splashed over the table; but she smiled with apparent good humor, and the man grew more bold.|$|R
6000|$|And then, like a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> {{pressed on}} her breast, came the thought: [...] "But if they do! Auntie! My boy! My girls! However shall I manage if they do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last {{and last}} again, then," [...] said Nod, packing {{into the pockets}} {{one or two of}} the stones and bullets and <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> that had fallen out, [...] "is it comfortable?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Englishman pacified {{himself with}} a whisky and soda which a waiter had just brought in. He added several <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> and drained the {{contents}} of the tumbler with a little murmur of appreciation.|$|R
60|$|Loading it inside, he re-appeared with it ready. Taking up a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> {{about the}} size of one's hand, he set it up on a hummock, and retired to a {{distance}} of about thirty yards.|$|R
60|$|They kept it up. With {{a hundred}} variations, a hundred guffaws, {{they said that}} he had gone to the movies during business-hours. He didn't so much mind Gunch, but he was annoyed by Sidney Finkelstein, that brisk, lean, {{red-headed}} explainer of jokes. He was bothered, too, by the <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> in his glass of water. It was too large; it spun round and burned his nose when he tried to drink. He raged that Finkelstein was like that <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b> But he won through; he kept up his banter till they grew tired of the superlative jest and turned to the great problems of the day.|$|R
6000|$|After a few minutes, {{the waiter}} {{came back with}} a large glass, in which a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> floated in red wine and mineral water. Adam, sending him away, remarked: [...] "That's a stupid fellow. I wanted to mix the stuff myself." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{sat at a}} little, round table, {{and between}} us were glasses holding big <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice,</b> and above us leaned an {{artificial}} palm. And because our scene was set with {{the properties of the}} one they recalled to his mind, Billy was stirred to narrative.|$|R
60|$|The {{words of}} the {{alderman}} made him more anxious than ever to visit the earth, and so he walked thoughtfully home, and put a few <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> in the stove to keep him warm, {{and sat down to}} think how he should manage the trip.|$|R
60|$|For some {{hours the}} brig {{proceeded}} onward with a freshening breeze, winding and turning {{in order to}} avoid the <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice.</b> Many of the smaller pieces were not worth turning out of the way of, the mere weight of the vessel being sufficient to push them aside.|$|R
60|$|They had not {{proceeded}} {{more than}} half a mile when a Polar bear walked leisurely out from behind a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice,</b> where it had been regaling itself on a dead seal, and sauntered slowly out towards the icebergs seaward, not a hundred yards in advance of them.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{there was}} little wind, {{otherwise}} Dick could not have stood that long and wild ride. As it was, he felt chilled to the bone, and his feet were like two <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice.</b> Gus Schmidt must have surmised this, for presently he stopped the sled and motioned to the youth.|$|R
60|$|Gamaliel did {{straighten}} up, {{as though}} Miss Lucretia had applied a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> {{to the small}} of his back. So it is when the literary deities, vestal or otherwise, return to their Stratfords. There are generally surprises in store for the people they have had on their knees, and for others.|$|R
6000|$|... (*32) Place a platina {{crucible}} over {{a spirit}} lamp, {{and keep it}} a red heat; pour in some sulphuric acid, which, though the most volatile of bodies at a common temperature, will be found to become completely fixed in a hot crucible, and not a drop evaporates--being surrounded by an atmosphere of its own, it does not, in fact, touch the sides. A few drops of water are now introduced, when the acid, immediately coming {{in contact with the}} heated sides of the crucible, flies off in sulphurous acid vapor, and so rapid is its progress, that the caloric of the water passes off with it, which falls a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> to the bottom; by taking advantage of the moment before it is allowed to remelt, it may be turned out a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> from a red-hot vessel.|$|R
6000|$|For the moment, Mrs. Gallilee was petrified. At {{his time}} of life, was this fat and feeble {{creature}} approaching her with conjugal endearments? At that early {{hour of the}} day, had his guilty lips tasted his favourite champagne, foaming in his well-beloved silver mug, over his much-admired <b>lump</b> of <b>ice?</b> And was this the result? ...|$|R
500|$|Hail {{is a form}} {{of solid}} precipitation. It is {{distinct}} from ice pellets (American sleet), though the two are often confused. It consists of balls or irregular <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice,</b> each of which is called a hailstone. [...] Ice pellets (American sleet) falls generally in cold weather while hail growth is greatly inhibited during cold surface temperatures.|$|R
6000|$|... "A smoke!" [...] gasped Grenfell. [...] "With {{your mouth}} and tongue like an ash-pit! I'd much sooner have a sherry cobbler, {{as they used to}} make it with a big <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> {{swimming}} in it, at the--it's the club, I mean. That is," [...] he added, with a sigh, [...] "if I could get it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Life ain't no punkins without whiskey an' sweetenin'," [...] was Shorty's greeting, as {{he pulled}} <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> from his thawing {{moustache}} and flung them rattling on the floor. [...] "An' I sure just got eighteen pounds of that same sweetenin'. The geezer only charged three dollars a pound for it. What luck did you have?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was {{trembling}} like a leaf {{in the wind}} he spoke of, and Bianca moved hastily towards him, holding out her arms. Suddenly his lips began to move; she heard him mutter: [...] "I have lost force; I will boil some milk. I must be ready when she comes." [...] And at those words her heart felt like a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, {{fighting}} {{will begin}} when the school-bell rings out four!" [...] cried the cadet {{who had been}} made referee. [...] "The company that chases the other company over its back line wins the contest. No fighting with anything but snow allowed. Anybody using his fists, or a stone, or a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice,</b> will be ruled out of the contest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I know {{perfectly}} that he {{combines the}} properties of a <b>lump</b> of <b>ice</b> and a red-hot coal," [...] he observed. [...] "Catherine has made it thoroughly clear, and you have told me so till I am sick of it. You needn't tell me again; I am perfectly satisfied. He will never give us a penny; I regard that as mathematically proved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a {{split in}} the ice somewhere. It's a common sound enough, {{as you might expect}} in a mass that is {{constantly}} moving," [...] replied Antoine, looking gravely round him, [...] "but I can't help thinking that this <b>lump</b> of <b>ice,</b> with crevasses on each side, is not the best of all spots for fixing a stake. It isn't solid enough." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{part they}} were about to pass over was {{exceedingly}} rough and broken, and Buzzby resolved to give his shipmates a shake. The pace was tremendous. The powerful dogs drew their loads after them with successive bounds, which caused a succession of crashes as the sledges sprang from lump to <b>lump</b> of <b>ice,</b> and the men's teeth snapped in a truly savage manner.|$|R
60|$|So it {{came about}} that the house stood the tempest, which had it been roofed with tiles or {{galvanized}} iron I am sure it would never have done, since the <b>lumps</b> of <b>ice</b> must have shattered one and pierced the other like paper. Indeed I have seen this happen in a bad hailstorm in Natal which killed my best horse. But even that hail was as snowflakes compared to this.|$|R
50|$|Lake Metelys {{is located}} in {{southern}} Lithuania's Alytus County. The lake, covering 1,292 hectares, has a maximum depth of 15 metres. It lies with the boundaries of Meteliai Regional Park. Lake Metelys formed from melted <b>ice</b> <b>lump.</b>|$|R
