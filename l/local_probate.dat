25|$|A will {{includes}} {{the appointment of}} Executor(s). One of their duties is {{to apply to the}} Probate Division of the High Court for a Grant of Probate. An Executor can apply to a <b>local</b> <b>probate</b> registry for a grant themselves but most people use a probate practitioner such as a solicitor. If an estate is small, some banks and building societies allow the deceased's immediate family to close accounts without a grant, but there usually must be less than about £15,000 in the account for this to be permitted.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Runaways" [...] never {{returned}} to Utah Territory and their positions remained unfilled until 1853. This is no doubt {{the reason that the}} Utah Legislature conferred original jurisdiction in both criminal and civil cases to the probate courts in 1852. This essentially gave the <b>local</b> Mormon-controlled <b>probate</b> courts concurrent jurisdiction with the federal district courts, and while it allowed for efficiency in justice without a full complement of federal judges, the move was denounced by later federal officials.|$|R
2500|$|Upon {{the death}} of a person intestate, or of one who left a will without {{appointing}} [...] executors, or when the executors appointed by the will cannot or will not act, the Probate Division of the High Court of Justice or the <b>local</b> District <b>Probate</b> Registry will appoint an administrator who performs similar duties to an executor. The court does this by granting letters of administration to the person so entitled, who must hire a lawyer to get this process started. Grants of administration may be either general (where the deceased has died intestate) or limited. The order in which the court will make general grants of letters follows the sequence: ...|$|R
2500|$|Spencer's {{home and}} tannery in Elizabethtown were {{thoroughly}} despoiled by the enemy. He suffered additional losses {{because of the}} depreciation of the currency. Determined to find a living, he moved {{with his family to}} the Miami Valley in Ohio where he bought three sections of land. When he arrived in Columbia, Ohio, the governor of the territory Arthur St. Clair made him the colonel of the <b>local</b> militia and <b>probate</b> judge for Hamilton County. One source gives a glowing account of Spencer's [...] "spotless" [...] character and generosity. He died at Columbia on 22 January 1811 and was interred in the Wesley Chapel Burial Grounds. His wife Anna lived until 1823. On 19 August 1865, Spencer's remains were moved to Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|R

The Library’s collections span Elgin’s history but feature the old Elgin photographs from the collection of Elmer Gyllek, thousands of photographic negatives donated by the Elgin Courier News, <b>local</b> <b>probate</b> and divorce records, and rich resources for research on Elgin homes. The Library also holds production records for most Elgin National Watch Company watches made before the 1950s and offers research services providing information on specific watches.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} was purchased in 1789 by Simeon Smith, {{and the house}} was probably built not long afterward. Smith had moved to the area in 1783 from northwestern Connecticut. This house was built for him by William Sprat (or Sprats), a Connecticut builder who spent his later years in this area, and is buried in a West Haven cemetery next to Simeon Smith. Smith was a prominent early settler of the area, and made a significant fortune speculating in land, in addition to providing medical services, serving as a <b>local</b> <b>probate</b> judge and in the state legislature.|$|E

50|$|Town {{attorneys}} then revealed {{plans to}} put the trust back on track. Local attorney David Cole was suggested to the selectman by another local attorney. Cole started showing interest in the fund in the mid-1970s, {{and he was one}} of the few people to actively support change of the fund's purpose. A lawsuit was then brought against the town over the fund. The office of state Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti also became involved as the fund had been seriously misused over the years. The suit was brought in the <b>local</b> <b>probate</b> court. The result of the lawsuit was for a new plan to be developed on how to run the fund. The presiding judge also undid the leases, invalidating them because they were signed by selectman not the trustee. A new plan of operation for trust was adopted after Cole and the assistant attorney general created the plan. The Cy-près doctrine was used to redevelop the trust fund as the original plans of the will would be hard to follow since selling cords of wood was not as profitable as it once was.|$|E
50|$|In January 2015, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle in Tallahassee {{ruled that}} all clerks {{in the state}} were {{required}} under the Constitution to issue marriage licenses to all same-sex couples. On January 5, 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in Miami-Dade County when Judge Sarah Zabel lifted the legal stay on her July decision legalizing same-sex marriage in Florida, and Karla Arguello and Catherina Pareto became the first same-sex couple married in Florida. On January 6, 2015 same-sex marriage was legalized and began throughout Florida. Also in January 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in South Dakota, but the ruling was stayed. Also that month, same-sex marriage was legalized in two separate rulings in Alabama, but both rulings were stayed. However, in February 2015 same-sex marriage was legalized in Alabama after the Supreme Court refused Alabama's attorney general's request to keep same-sex marriages on hold until the Supreme Court ruled whether laws banning them are constitutional. But the {{chief justice of the}} Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, wrote in his own order later that the latest ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in Alabama did not apply to the state’s probate judges and directed them not to comply. The judge who issued that latest ruling (Judge Callie V. S. Granade) then ruled that the <b>local</b> <b>probate</b> judge (Judge Don Davis of Mobile County) could not refuse to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, after which Davis began issuing licenses to same-sex couples, as did many counties in Alabama. In February 2015, a Texas probate judge ruled Tuesday that the state's ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, as part of an estate battle. Later that month Sarah Goodfriend and Suzanne Bryant became the first same-sex couple married in Texas, after their marriage license was issued in response to a district judge’s order in Travis County because one of the women had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. However, the clerk's office noted that “any additional licenses issued to same sex couples also must be court ordered,” and the Texas Supreme Court issued an emergency stay that same afternoon they were married. Also in February 2015, the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska announced its courts were authorized to allow the performance of same-sex marriages. In March 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in Nebraska, but that was stayed until the next Monday to give state officials time to appeal the ruling and ask for an extension of the stay, and then the Eighth Circuit granted the state's request, which placed same-sex marriage in Nebraska on hold until the federal appeals court ruled on Nebraska's marriage ban. Also in March 2015, the Alabama supreme court ordered Alabama's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, stating that a previous federal ruling that same-sex marriage bans violate the US constitution did not preclude them from following state law, which defined marriage as {{between a man and a}} woman.|$|E

In April 2015 Guam's attorney general directed officials to begin processing marriage license applications from same-sex couples, but the governor said he wanted to study the issue further, and the public health director said he wouldn't accept the applications. In May 2015, a federal judge ruled that same-sex marriage was legal in all Alabama counties, but placed her decision on hold until the Supreme Court issued a ruling on same-sex marriage. On June 5, 2015, a judge issued a ruling which struck down Guam's statutory ban on same-sex marriage. The ruling was issued immediately after the court hearing proceedings and went into effect on 8am Tuesday June 9. Same-sex marriages became performable and recognized in the U.S. territory from that date. Attorneys representing the government of Guam had said in a May 18 court filing that [...] "should a court strike current Guam law, they would respect and follow such a decision".|$|E
