5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to <b>look</b> <b>different.</b> He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

25|$|Around 1909, Nikolay Krasnov, Yalta's most fashionable architect, {{responsible}} for the grand ducal residences in Koreiz, was engaged to prepare {{plans for a new}} imperial palace. The Tsar's diary indicates that the design was much discussed in the Imperial Family; it was decided that all four façades of the palace should <b>look</b> <b>different.</b> After 17 months of construction, the new palace was inaugurated on 11 September 1911. In November Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna celebrated her 16th birthday at Livadia.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic {{approach}} to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and {{for the fact that}} columns that are viewed against the sky <b>look</b> <b>different</b> from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.|$|E

Speech recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United States that about 50% of all live captioning is through speech recognition as of 2005. Real-time captions <b>look</b> <b>different</b> from offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.|$|E
25|$|Geologic {{units from}} the same time but {{different}} parts of the world often <b>look</b> <b>different</b> and contain different fossils, so the same time-span was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America, the Lower Cambrian is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of trilobites. In East Asia and Siberia, the same unit is split into Alexian, Atdabanian, and Botomian stages. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons that can be used around the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{impaired}} {{functioning of}} autobiographical memory due to damage or disease can have profound effects on an individual's episodic memory. This can skew an individual's lifespan retrieval curve and influence {{the presentation of}} the reminiscence bump. Memories an individual has for personal life events can show a different pattern than the average individual if they have brain damage caused by an event like an accident, a blow to the head or disease. For these individuals with brain damage, the lifespan retrieval curve can <b>look</b> <b>different.</b> An example of this is an individual having the reminiscence bump between the age of 5 and 13 rather than 10 to 30, which is the pattern for the average individual.|$|E

25|$|The {{first major}} design {{decision}} Wertich made {{related to the}} complexity of the game's economic system. Due to the innovations he planned to introduce to the mechanics, and because the supply and demand-based gameplay of Settlers III was going to be more intricate than in previous titles, he felt that forcing players to concentrate too much on logistics would serve as an unwelcome distraction, and so decided to remove the need for a road network. Instead, settlers would have the freedom to move anywhere within the player's settlement, with the AI handling pathfinding. Another early decision was that the different races in Settlers III wouldn't just <b>look</b> <b>different,</b> they would have different abilities, different economic models and certain buildings unique to each one. Wertich, in consultation with Hertzler, also decided to create the game in high color, a first for the series, which had used 8-bit color for previous titles.|$|E
25|$|There {{really are}} two {{different}} kinds of DDD: Inside and Outside Abraded Die Doubling. This is because Die Deterioration Doubling manifests itself in two different ways. The two classes <b>look</b> <b>different,</b> and are caused by wear in two different places. Inside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by wear around the edges and inside the actual detail affected. It appears as an enlarged, irregular outline of the element overlapping the original design element. Outside Abraded Die Doubling is caused by actual wear {{in the field of}} the die. The field of a die is the highest point, so when a mint technician polishes the die or the metal flow of a coin wears it away, the field is the first thing to be worn down. The difference here is that Outside doubling does not overlap any of the original design, but rather appears like an irregular shelf around the object.|$|E
25|$|Meier {{provides}} several {{arguments for}} believing that ASL does not formally distinguish second from third person. For example, when {{pointing to a}} person that is physically present, a pronoun is equivalent to either 'you' or '(s)he' depending on the discourse. There {{is nothing in the}} sign itself, nor in the direction of eye gaze or body posture, that can be relied on to make this distinction. That is, the same formal sign can refer to any of several second or third persons, which the indexic nature of the pronoun makes clear. In English, indexic uses also occur, as in 'I need you to go to the store and you to stay here', but not so ubiquitously. In contrast, several first-person ASL pronouns, such as the plural possessive ('our'), <b>look</b> <b>different</b> from their non-first-person equivalents, and a couple of pronouns do not occur in the first person at all, so first and non-first persons are formally distinct.|$|E
