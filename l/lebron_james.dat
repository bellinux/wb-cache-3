5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the lockout, {{a higher percentage of}} players signed contracts worth the maximum amount possible under the cap.

After the expiration of that CBA, a lockout occurred in 2011; it was the fourth in league history and lasted for about five months before the sides came to an agreement.

5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of basketball players like <b>LeBron</b> <b>James,</b> Kevin Love, Tyreke Evans and Harrison Barnes, Miller was the 201011 high school diary keeper for SLAM Magazine. Once Miller and Bello were united, they were described as arguably the best high school basketball tandem in the country. Entering his senior season, Miller was a first team All-Southeast Region team selection by ESPN HS. At the time he was listed in third in the 2010-2011 Preseason ESPNHS Mr. Basketball USA voting (behind Austin Rivers and Mike Gilchrist). The team was preseason #32 in the POWERADE FAB 50 ESPNHS Boys' basketball team rankings. In December 2010, Miller suffered a torn ACL, ending his senior season, and high school career. As a senior, he was ineligible for the McDonald's All-American Game, but was an honorary All-American selection for the Jordan Brand Classic game. He did not play in the game, but participated in drills. His Jordan Brand workouts refueled Durant comparisons. He was also a first team All-American selection by SLAM Magazine (along with Gilchrist, Rivers, Bradley Beal, Anthony Davis and Marquis Teague).|$|E
