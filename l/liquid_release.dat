Schneider Electric (2014) performed and evaluated this operator training with 30 operation scenarios (15 scenarios each for CROPs and FOPs, respectively) via the EYESIM® immersive training package in a virtual reality simulation of the plant. Even though the above two strands of research try to develop FOP customized training solutions by integration of accident simulation or process simulation with immersive virtual reality systems, respectively, they are not able to train the whole process of accident initiated from process upsets and terminated at emergency response as they do not link the process simulation to accident simulation directly. To solve this limitation, Manca et al.

The fate of suspended sediments and natural and artificial particle-bound radionuclides in relation to extreme hydrological events was assessed at the lower course of the Rhne River, which provides {{the main source of}} water and sediment inputs to the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. We sampled water at a high frequency over the period 2001 - 2008 and measured suspended particulate matter (SPM) loads and particle-bound natural and artificial radionuclide concentrations at the SORA observatory station in Arles, France. We monitored various hydrological events (either natural or anthropogenic origin) and characterize their influence on concentrations and fluxes. The relationship between SPM concentration and the very wide range of water discharges did not differ significantly from previous periods, indicating no significant shift in the average sediment delivery over the last 20 years. Unexpected hydrological events of anthropogenic origin, in particular those associated with flushing of reservoirs that are generally not captured by sampling strategies, were recorded and were shown to transfer significant additional sediment and associated contaminants towards the marine environment. Concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides associated with sediment (i. e., Cs- 137, Co- 60, Mn- 54, Ag- 110 m, and Pu isotopes) varied over two to three orders of magnitude during periods of low and moderate flow due to variations in the <b>liquid</b> <b>release</b> from nuclear facilities. Except for Pu isotopes, the concentrations of the various particle-bound radionuclides generally showed a decreasing trend with increasing discharge, revealing the geochemical or anthropogenic background values, and providing a useful flood fingerprint for this large fluvial system before its entry into the marine environment.

40|$|The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) of the Department of Transportation is {{required}} to identify areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage {{in the event of}} a hazardous liquid pipeline accident. Pipeline operators that can affect these "unusually sensitive areas" (USAs) must develop and follow an integrity management program to continually assess and evaluate the integrity of their pipelines. After extensive consultation and pilot testing with conservation biologists, government agencies, drinking water experts, and other stakeholders, a process has been developed to identify USAs for both ecological resources and drinking water. The process begins by designating and assessing environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), then determining which ESAs are potentially more susceptible to permanent or long-term damage from a hazardous <b>liquid</b> <b>release.</b> Finally, criteria were identified to determine which resources can be affected by a release and sustain permanent or long-term damage. Ecological USAs are defined and mapped based on the presence of critically imperiled species, assemblages of multiple imperiled or endangered species, the presence of sensitive species that are aquatically dependent or have a limited terrestrial range, and concentrations of migratory waterbirds. Mapping these areas nationwide made use of ecological data from several sources, the majority coming from the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). Once created, maps of the USAs are posted on the RSPA Internet website in viewable format ([URL] and electronic versions of the GIS data layers are made available to pipeline operators for use with their GIS pipeline mapping systems. To identify and locate USAs, RSPA needed ecological data in a timely and standardized format. This included the location of imperiled, threatened, and endangered species.

This project represents the first time that detailed natural heritage data on specific locations of imperiled and endangered species have been aggregated nationwide for natural resource protection purposes.

40|$|Inspired by {{the current}} {{state-of-the-art}} and the progressing advancements {{in the field of}} self-healing materials, this thesis addresses several novel routes to advance the concept of liquid-based self-healing polymer systems. This thesis presents the concept and characterisation of a one-component solvent-based healing mechanism for thermoplastic materials and in addition to the healing strategy, a new capsular architecture is proposed for the purpose of simultaneous release of two reactants at the same location. Other liquid container designs are investigated to enhance the <b>liquid</b> <b>release</b> upon fracture (also in the case of multiple healing events) and come with less scarification of the intrinsic material properties. Chapter 2 describes the theoretical and experimental evaluation of all the material system parameters that are significant in the performance of a one component solvent-induced selfhealing mechanism for thermoplastic materials. Parameters that are investigated include solvent sorption rates, solvent induced depression of Tg and polymer diffusion coefficients. In Chapter 3 autonomous solvent-induced self-healing mechanism for PMMA are presented and investigated. The self-healing of the mechanical properties is experimental validated for different solvents and capsule volume concentration {{as a function of the}} healing time. In Chapter 4 the capsule-composite thermoplastic self-healing material is characterised qualitatively and quantitatively by X-ray tomography using SEM-based and Synchrotron X-ray facilities. The techniques allow detailed investigation into the release volume and kinetics ofhealing-agent at the damaged site. Chapter 5 presents a novel microcapsular architecture, designed for the encapsulation of two individual liquids within a single microscopic structure. These binary microcapsules have a central liquid core and are peripherally decorated with the second liquid component, which is achieved by the synthesis and application of liquid-filled Pickering particles. Chapter 6 presents a numerical study into the influence of the microcapsule geometrical shape on the performance of a self-healing material. Classical spherical shapes are compared to cylindrical ones with varying degree of anisotropy and spatial orientation. In Chapter 7 production routes are evaluated to obtain anisotropic rod-like microcapsules. The investigated routes involve droplet deformation and encapsulation in shear and elongational flow, by usage of a modified ink-jet printing technique and by creation of stable anisotropic droplets in suspension using Pickering particles. In Chapter 8 the concept for a compartmented liquid-filled fibre is given, providing an alternative to the continuous capillaries and discrete spherical microcapsules currently applied in the field of self-healing. Control over the morphology allows production of fibres with different mechanical properties that are in the order of standard composite matrix materials and have slightly lower failure strains.

40|$|This {{master s}} thesis {{continues}} the line of LNG related theses in cooperation with ComputIT AS. The Phoenix series large-scale LNG pool fire experiments have been simulated using the CFD software Kameleon FireEx (KFX) for validation purposes of the software to experimental data. A number of simulations were performed, and the main investigations of the experiment thermal radiation, pool spreading and flame morphology have been compared to results from KFX, using a range of different simulation scenarios. Scenarios included simulating the LNG as either a <b>liquid</b> <b>release</b> or as a gaseous release of methane from a circular equivalent of the quasi-steady LNG pool area obtained on the experiment. Other variations included transient or constant release, where the transient release {{was based on an}} approximated flow rate from the experiment, and the constant release was based on the average flow rate over the duration of the experiment. Due to limitations in the pool model in KFX, the liquid releases were simulated on a flat ground instead of on a pool of water, with various heat transfer coefficients to account for the heat transfer between the water and the LNG. The radiative heat fluxes from the simulations compared to experimental values were initially low by factors between two and four, regardless of simulation scenario. The soot model was investigated, and found to give an excess of relatively cold soot outside of the flame, acting as a radiation screen, thus reducing the thermal radiation from the fire to the surroundings. The soot model was modified, and subsequent simulations produced very comparable values for the radiative heat fluxes for the majority of simulation scenarios. For all liquid, transient simulations, the LNG pool spread much faster than in the experiment, and only the simulations with adiabatic conditions between the LNG and ground reached the same maximum area as the experiment. All simulations with non-adiabatic conditions had a maximum pool area below that of the experiment. As a result, it was concluded that the LNG vaporized too quickly, and consequently the duration of the fire was about 250 s shorter in the simulations than in the experiment. As a consequence of the high vaporization rate in the simulations, the flame grew to heights far above the experiment, and at some instances the flame in the simulations exceeded the flame height in the experiment of over 100 m. A new, simple model for LNG spreading through water was introduced, and initial computations in MATLAB produced highly promising results...|$|E

This dose was only 1. 1 % of the EPA public dose limit of 10 mrem/yr (DOE, 1990). Tritium oxide releases were responsible for 90 % of the atmospheric dose. Ninety-nine percent of the atmospheric dose was accounted for with the inclusion of I- 129, U- 235, U- 238, Pu- 238 and Pu- 239. The 50 -mile population received a collective dose of 7. 6 person-rem from 1993 atmospheric releases. Ninety-nine percent of this dose also resulted from the release of the same isotopes that dominated the maximum individual dose due to atmospheric releases. For both the individual and the population, atmospheric radiation dose was dominated by the inhalation and vegetation consumption pathways. The maximum dose received by an offsite individual as a result of SRS <b>liquid</b> <b>releases</b> in 1993 was 0. 14 mrem (See Table 1 for a 5 -yr history). This does was only 3. 5 % of the EPA limit for drinking water of 4 mrem/yr (DOE, 1990). This dose was dominated by Cs- 137 accumulated in Savannah River fish and tritium in drinking water. More than 99 % of the maximum individual dose from <b>liquid</b> <b>releases</b> resulted from tritium, Sr- 90, Cs- 137,and Pu- 239.

The major exposure pathway to the population was drinking water. Radiation dose to the general public from operations at the Savannah River Site continued to be a very small fraction of the natural background dose. A resident of the CSRA receives about 300 mrem per year from background radiation. The population within 80 km of the SRS (620, 000) and at the downstream water treatment facilities (65, 000), therefore, received a natural background population dose of approximately 200, 000 person-rem during 1993...|$|R

Nucleation {{has been identified as}} an important process in the early stage of flashing. The presence of strong nucleation and therefore flashing depends on the output of the balance of the promoting forces and dissipation forces inside the fluid released. A one dimensional model to classify the type of jet to be formed after the release has been developed based on the balance of these forces. The analysis {{is based on the assumption}} that the nucleation process can be modelled as a second order damped system. The model parameters are defined as a function of the pressure, temperature, fluid properties and geometric characteristic of the system. The results obtained have good agreement with the experimental results available for releases of different fluids, including both hydrocarbons and water. The calculation of the velocity discharge, void fraction and mass flow of a flashing jet generated after the release is made based on the thermodynamics jump formulation approach. Due to the nature of the nucleation process, the assumptions of adiabatic flow with non reversible work for the surface tension forces are made. Those considerations are found to be more realistic that the isentropic condition used until now by different authors. Numerical techniques are only applied after the flashing jet is formed, no droplets generation or vapour generation are included. Droplets are imposed as part of the boundary conditions of a gas jet. Droplets transport mechanics and momentum exchange with the gas current is made using Droplet Disperse Model (DDM) on the commercial code Fluent Ò. DDM determines the distribution of the disperse phase over the continuous phase using a Lagrangian Eulerian approach. The influence of velocity, the dimension of the nozzle and mass flow used in the CFD modelling were analysed. Nozzle dimensions have a large impact on the core region length of the velocity profile. The k −e turbulent model was used. As expected, the numerical results do approach experimental values in the far region, suggesting that the momentum of the two phase jet is conserved. The one dimensional model thus provides the necessary boundary conditions for the application of numerical methods to superheated <b>liquid</b> <b>releases</b> including flashing...|$|R
