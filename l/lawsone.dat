5000|$|<b>Lawsone</b> (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), {{also known}} as hennotannic acid, is a red-orange dye present in {{the leaves of the}} henna plant (Lawsonia inermis) {{as well as in the}} flower of water {{hyacinth}} (Eichhornia crassipes). Humans have used henna extracts containing <b>lawsone</b> as hair and skin dyes for more than 5000 years. <b>Lawsone</b> reacts chemically with the protein known as keratin in skin and hair, in a process known as Michael addition, resulting in a strong permanent stain that lasts until the skin or hair is shed. The darker colored ink is due to more lawsone-keratin interactions occurring, which evidently break down as the concentration of <b>lawsone</b> decreases and the tattoo fades. [...] <b>Lawsone</b> strongly absorbs UV light, and aqueous extracts can be effective sunless tanning and sunscreens. Chemically, <b>lawsone</b> is similar to juglone, which is found in walnuts.|$|E

It has a characteristic purple/brown coloration as opposed to the purple/blue associated with ninhydrin.Lawsone shows promise as a reagent for fingerprint detection because of its photoluminescence maximized at 640nm, which is high enough that it avoids background interference common for ninhydrin.|$|E

5000|$|Henna is {{an orange}} dye {{commonly}} {{used as a}} deposit-only hair color whose active component, <b>lawsone,</b> binds to keratin. It is therefore considered semi-permanent to permanent, depending on a person's hair type. Most people will achieve a permanent color from henna, especially after the second dye.

These variations usually contain ingredients from other plants and even synthetic dyes.|$|E
50|$|Whole, {{unbroken}} henna leaves {{will not}} stain the skin. Henna will not stain skin until the <b>lawsone</b> molecules are made available (released) from the henna leaf. Dried henna leaves will stain the skin {{if they are}} mashed into a paste. The <b>lawsone</b> will gradually migrate from the henna paste into the outer layer of the skin and bind to the proteins in it, creating a fast stain.Since {{it is difficult to}} form intricate patterns from coarse crushed leaves, henna is commonly traded as a powder made by drying, milling and sifting the leaves. The dry powder is mixed with {{one of a number of}} liquids, including water, lemon juice, or strong tea, and other ingredients, depending on the tradition. Many artists use sugar or molasses in the paste to improve consistency and keep it stuck to the skin better. The henna mix must rest for 1 to 48 hours before use, to release the <b>lawsone</b> from the leaf matter. The timing depends on the crop of henna being used. Essential oils with high levels of monoterpene alcohols, such as tea tree, cajeput, or lavender, will improve skin stain characteristics. Other essential oils, such as eucalyptus and clove, are also useful but are too irritating and should not be used on skin.The paste can be applied with many traditional and innovative tools, starting with a basic stick or twig. In Morocco, a syringe is common. In India, a plastic cone similar to those used to pipe icing onto cakes is used. In the Western world, a cone is common, as is a Jacquard bottle, which is otherwise used to paint silk fabric. A light stain may be achieved within minutes, but the longer the paste is left on the skin, the darker and longer lasting the stain will be, so it needs to be left on as long as possible. To prevent it from drying or falling off the skin, the paste is often sealed down by dabbing a sugar/lemon mix over the dried paste, or simply adding some form of sugar to the paste. After time the dry paste is simply brushed or scraped away.|$|E

50|$|Henna stains are orange {{when the}} paste is first removed, but darkens over the {{following}} three days to a deep reddish brown. Soles and palms have the thickest layer of skin and so take up the most <b>lawsone,</b> {{and take it to}} the greatest depth, so that hands and feet will have the darkest and most long-lasting stains. Some also believe that steaming or warming the henna pattern will darken the stain, either during the time the paste is still on the skin, or after the paste has been removed. It is debatable whether this adds to the color of the end result as well. After the stain reaches its peak color, it holds for a few days, then gradually wears off by way of exfoliation.|$|E

A women's group plays Arabic music, sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or mehndi, a temporary form of skin decoration using henna, on the bride and guests' skin â€” usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of keratin there, which binds temporarily to <b>lawsone,</b> the colorant of henna. The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration.|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} for migrant domestic workers in Lebanon is grim, as the circumstances for {{them are not}} improving; the migrant domestic workers {{have been subjected to}} violations of their freedom of movement and their right to residency. In early 2014, the general security began deporting children of migrant workers with one or both of their parents. The justification for this move was that the migrants were in Lebanon to work and not create families, it is worthy to note that the implementation of these deportations had been put on hold after pressure from civil society organisations like Insan. By the summer of 2015, the decision to expel migrant domestic workers and their children had been overturned. However, things did not get better for the migrant domestic workers; they now had to deal with tighter control over residency permits. The general security which is the body legally mandated to deal with foreign workers has refused to re-grant some workers their permits on the grounds of refusing to reside with their employees. Despite the fact that the general security exercises force on migrant domestic workers and their presence in the country, this is in fact in violation with the Lebanese legal international commitment, constitution and national <b>laws.One</b> significant problem the migrant domestic workers are subjected to is physical abuse, the problem mainly lies in that there are no repercussions from the behalf of the government. There have been many cases of migrant domestic workersâ€™ deaths even and despite that the police does not properly investigate the cases and no employee gets prosecuted for the death. The ministry of labour did take some initiative in creating a hotline for a dispute resolution system, but it is not working effectively because {{there is a lack of}} trust in the system and as well a lack of knowledge on the process to state a complaint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hair {{coloring}} {{products are}} one of the most important cosmetics for modern people; there are three major types of hair dyes, including the temporary, semi-permanent and permanent hair dyes. The selected hair dyes (such as ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, resorcinol and <b>lawsone)</b> are the important components for hair coloring products. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of these compounds on melanogenesis in B 16 -F 10 melanoma cells. The results proved that hair dyes resorcinol and <b>lawsone</b> can reduce the production of melanin. The results also confirmed that resorcinol and <b>lawsone</b> inhibit mushroom and cellular tyrosinase activities in vitro. Resorcinol and <b>lawsone</b> can also downregulate the protein levels of tyrosinase and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in B 16 -F 10 cells. Thus, we suggest that frequent use of hair dyes may have the risk of reducing natural melanin production in hair follicles. Moreover, resorcinol and <b>lawsone</b> may also be used as hypopigmenting agents to food, agricultural and cosmetic industry in the future...|$|E

Below pH 6 the color of the wool varied little with pH and was predominantly red, but above pH 6 the intensity decreased and the yellow component became pre-dominant. At pH 4. 5 the intensity of the red component increased with dyeing temperature between 15 and 50 Ã¸C, and became progressively more predominant. The color developed with henna increased with temperature, and also with time, probably because time was required to extract coloring matter from the plant tissue. In contrast to <b>lawsone,</b> henna gave a color which was predominantly yellow and had a greater blue component over the whole pH range. Both factors were attributed to the chlorophyll content.
