25|$|School {{psychology}} {{dates back}} to the beginning of American psychology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The field is tied to both functional and clinical psychology. School psychology actually came out of functional psychology. School psychologists were interested in childhood behaviors, learning processes, and dysfunction with life or in the brain itself. They wanted to understand the causes of the behaviors and their effects on learning. In addition to its origins in functional psychology, school psychology is also the earliest example of clinical psychology, beginning around 1890. While both clinical and school psychologists wanted to help improve the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>children,</b> they approached it in different ways. School psychologists were concerned with school learning and childhood behavioral problems, which largely contrasts the mental health focus of clinical psychologists.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{low profit}} margins and an {{increase}} in vaccine-related lawsuits led many manufacturers to stop producing the DPT vaccine by the early 1980s. In 1982, the television documentary DPT: Vaccine Roulette depicted the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> whose severe disabilities were incorrectly blamed on the DPT vaccine by reporter Lea Thompson. The ensuing negative publicity led to many lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. By 1985, vaccine manufacturers had difficulty obtaining liability insurance. The price of DPT vaccine skyrocketed, leading providers to curtail purchases, limiting availability. Only one manufacturer remained in the US by the end of 1985. To correct the situation, Congress in 1986 passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), which established a federal no-fault system to compensate victims of injury caused by mandated vaccines. The majority of claims that have been filed through the NCVIA have been related to injuries allegedly caused by the whole-cell DPT vaccine.|$|E
500|$|Two posthumously {{published}} collections {{were not}} as successful. [...] In August 1900 The Whilomville Stories were published, a collection of thirteen stories that Crane wrote {{during the last year}} of his life. [...] The work deals almost exclusively with boyhood, and the stories are drawn from events occurring in Port Jervis, where Crane lived from the age of six to eleven. [...] Focusing on small-town America, the stories tend toward sentimentality, but remain perceptive of the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>children.</b> [...] Wounds in the Rain, published in September 1900, contains fictional tales based on Crane's reports for the World and the Journal during the Spanish–American War. [...] These stories, which Crane wrote while desperately ill, include [...] "The Price of the Harness" [...] and [...] "The Lone Charge of William B. Perkins" [...] and are dramatic, ironic and sometimes humorous.|$|E

500|$|A week later, {{the figures}} for a brand-new station at Laurence Harbor were released, saying the station would take {{five years to}} construct, with costs ranging from $25 million$30 million (2001 USD) of funding {{from the state of}} New Jersey and the federal government. The station would also relieve the busy Aberdeen-Matawan station, which at the time hosted about 3,500 commuters daily. Most of the city council and mayor {{supported}} the deal, except for councilman Joseph Hoff. Hoff believed the train station was a good idea, but {{there were a number of}} outstanding issues before plans for one could go forward. Hoff stated that the additional truck traffic and the safety of the pedestrians in the area were also a concern. These concerns would also get worse when the Atrium II office complex would be completed on the western side of Exit 120. Another major issue was the traffic congestion at Exit 120 itself, which at rush hour was [...] "atrocious". By November 2002, the station had not received any studies on the general location were not conducted by New Jersey Transit. Although the proposal still had support by the community, several citizens, including Joseph Hoff, were still questioning it. Hoff cited that New Jersey Transit has not put any interest forward and would just end up becoming another parking lot rather than a tax revenue. He reported however, that if residential homes and commercial businesses were constructed, it would be beneficial to Laurence Harbor. The other issue that Hoff maintained, was that it would risk the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> heading to and from Laurence Harbor Memorial School by affecting the traffic in the area.|$|E
