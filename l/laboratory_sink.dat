50|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} that certain species of mycorrhizal fungi may obtain at least a portion of their carbon via saprotrophic nutrition, the bulk of mycorrhizal carbon acquisition happens by way of trading for host-derived photosynthetic products. Mycorrhizal systems represent a major carbon <b>sink.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> studies predict that around 23% of plant-derived carbon is allocated to extrametrical mycelium, although an estimated 15-30% of this is lost to fungal respiration.Carbon allocation is distributed unequally to extramatrical mycelium depending on fungal taxa, nutrient availability, and the age of the associated mycorrhizas. Much of the carbon allocated to extramatrical mycelium accumulates as fungal biomass, making up an estimated one-third of the total microbial biomass and one-half of the total dissolved organic carbon in some forest soils. Carbon also supports the production of sporocarps and sclerotia, with various taxa investing differentially in these structures rather than in the proliferation of extramatrical mycelium. Carbon acquisition also goes toward the production of fungal exudates. Extramatrical hyphae excrete a range of compounds into the soil matrix, accounting for as much as 40% of total carbon usage. These exudates are released primarily at the growing front, and are used in functions such as mineralization and homeostasis.|$|R
40|$|Experimentation to {{characterize}} the heat sink performance is often performed under different procedures and apparatuses specifically catered to {{the knowledge of the}} individual in the thermal testing laboratory. When simulating the heat load of the electronics package, the conventional practice is to use resistance heating elements such as cartridge resistive heaters or flexible thin film heaters. Recently, thermoelectric devices (TED) are also being used as the heat source in heat <b>sink</b> <b>laboratory</b> experiments. The primary benefit of using a TED as a heat source in laboratory testing is that the TED is a unidirectional heat pump. All input electrical power is discharged to the TED hot side when properly used. This unidirectional heat pump process provides a more conservative experimental result, especially when calculating the experimental heat sink resistance. Contrarily to a TED, the resistance heater is a heat diffusion device, where the heat is dissipated to the surroundings by conduction. Even when the heater is fully insulated on all sides but the heat sink, a portion of heat is still lost to the ambient through the insulation. The effect is less energy passes to the heat sink than is inputted to the resistive heater...|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is of twofold {{significance}} for the atmosphere: In the troposphere it con-tributes about 6 % to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect (IPCC, 1995). Simultaneously, it {{plays an important role}} in stratospheric ozone chemistry through the photochemical produc-tion of nitric oxide. However, the ongoing increase of atmospheric N 2 O concentrations is not well explained by our knowledge about the global N 2 O budget. Especially the strength of the individual N 2 O sources (nitrification and denitrification processes in waters and soils) is ill-constrained. The stratospheric sinks (photolysis and photodissociation) in contrast are rela-tively well quantified. One method to improve our current understanding of biogeochemical processes involving N 2 O is to trace the molecule through the atmosphere by measuring the abundance of its stable isotopes: 15 N, 17 O and 18 O. Hence, we perform isotopic analyses of tropospheric, stratospheric and firn air samples, <b>laboratory</b> experiments on <b>sink</b> and source reactions of N 2 O and possibly field studies of N 2 O sources. Recently developed mass spectrometric techniques allow to de-termine the intramolecular distribution of 15 N in the linear NNO molecule and quantification of the so-called mass-independent enrichment of 17 O in N 2 O. These add to the establishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 Nereocystis luetkeana forms {{extensive}} kelp beds in Kachemak Bay, Alaska. Salinity and turbidity gradients apparently regulate kelp {{bed distribution}} throughout this estuary. The beds are large {{at the entrance}} of the bay, only solitary stands occur in the inner bay, and no kelp is found {{at the head of the}} bay. The role of salinity and turbidity on Nereocystis sporophyte growth was investigated by performing reciprocal transplants among three beds along the bay axis and regularly measuring stipe growth. The effects of salinity and light on spores were studied in the <b>laboratory</b> by recording <b>sinking</b> tendency, settlement success, germination success, and germ tube length under different salinity and light levels. Grazing effects of Lacuna vincta impacted the survival of Nereocystis transplants in-situ and on plants of different age classes in the laboratory. Overall, this study suggests a possible negative estuarine effect on sporophytes transplanted from the outer to the inner bay and on certain aspects of spore development. Herbivory pressure had significant localized effects on Nereocystis survival and was most pronounced on juvenile plants. The dynamics of Nereocystis kelp beds in Kachemak Bay results from large-scale environmental factors and local-scale biological processes...|$|R
40|$|Plastic debris are {{resistant}} to degradation, and therefore tend to accumulate in marine environment. Nevertheless recent estimations of plastic concentrations at {{the surface of the}} ocean were lower than expected leading the communities to seek new sinks. Among the different processes suggested we chose to focus on the transport of microplastics from the surface to deeper layers of the ocean via phytoplankton aggregates that constitute most of the sinking flux. Interactions between microplastics and aggregates were studied by building a new device: the flow-through roller tank that mimics the behaviour of <b>laboratory</b> made aggregates <b>sinking</b> through a dense layer of microplastics. Three types of aggregates formed from two different algae species (the diatom Chaetoceros neogracile, the cryptophyte Rhodomonas salina and a mix) were used as model. With their frustule made of biogenic silica which is denser than the organic matter, diatom aggregates sunk faster than R. salina aggregates. Diatom aggregates were on average bigger and stickier while aggregates from R. salina were smaller and more fragile. With higher concentrations measured in R. salina aggregates, all model-aggregates incorporated and concentrated microplastics, substantially increasing the microplastic sinking rates from tenths to hundreds of metres per day. Our results clearly show that marine aggregates can be an efficient sink for microplastics by influencing their vertical distribution in the water column. Furthermore, despite the high plastic concentrations tested, our study opens new questions regarding the impact of plastics on sedimentation fluxes in oceans. As an effect of microplastic incorporation, the sinking rates of diatom aggregates strongly decreased meanwhile sinking rates of cryptophyte aggregates increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to develop and demonstrate separation methods for removing radionuclides from liquid process waste streams. As part of this program, Mound Laboratory will develop lower cost alternatives for use i n 1980 fuel reprocessing and waste solidification plants, evaluate the processes within the nuclear fuel cycle which contribute to low-level and intermediate-level waste, and determine the feasibility of ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, inorganic adsorbents and other separation concepts as additions to process design to reduce the generation {{of this type of}} waste. In the initial phase of this program, membrane equipment will be obtained from a commercial membrane manufacturer. After the pilot plant is installed, it will be checked out on cold feed in order to obtain initial flux and rejection data for comparison to data obtained later in the program. After completion of the cold tests, the membrane pilot plant will be run on a combined contaminated feed emanating from showers, <b>laboratory</b> drains, janitorial <b>sinks</b> and decontamination in processing areas, as well as a laundry waste stream containing alpha-contaminated wastes. This combined waste stream contains only alpha contamination (uranium and plutonium). However, as part of this program, gamma activity will be added to the waste stream. These wastes will be representative of those streams found at fuel reprocessing plants, as well as various ERDA processing facilities such as Mound, LASL, Hanford, and Rocky Flats. For {{the second part of the}} program, laboratory tests will be run on various adsorbents to evaluate their capacities for removing radionuclides. As part of this program, a technique for screening adsorbents developed at Mound Laboratory will be utilized...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this thesis were to {{quantify}} the behavior of gastropod larvae (mud snails Ilyanassa obsoleta) in turbulence, and to investigate how that behavior affects larval supply in a turbulent coastal inlet. Gastropod larvae retract their velums and sink rapidly in strong turbulence. Turbulence-induced sinking would be an adaptive behavior if it resulted in increased larval supply and enhanced settlement in suitable coastal habitats. In laboratory experiments, mud snail larvae {{were found to have}} three behavioral modes: swimming, hovering, and sinking. The proportion of sinking larvae increased exponentially with the turbulence dissipation rate over a range comparable to turbulence in a tidal inlet, and the mean larval vertical velocity shifted from upward to downward in turbulence resembling energetic nearshore areas. The larval response to turbulence was incorporated in a vertical advection-diffusion model to characterize the effects of this behavior on larval supply and settlement in a tidal channel. Compared to passive larvae, larvae that sink in turbulence have higher near-bed concentrations throughout flood and ebb tides. (cont.) This high larval supply enables behaving larvae to settle more successfully than passive larvae in strong currents characteristic of turbulent tidal inlets. A study was conducted at Barnstable Harbor, MA to estimate the responses of larvae to turbulence in the field. Gastropod larvae from different coastal environments had genus-specific responses to turbulence, suggesting that larvae use turbulence for large-scale habitat selection. On ebb tides, mud snail larvae had a similar response to turbulence as in the <b>laboratory,</b> with greater <b>sinking</b> velocities in strong turbulence. Behavior estimates differed for flood and ebb tides, indicating that additional physical cues influence behavior. Turbulence-induced sinking behavior would enhance retention and promote settlement of mud snail larvae in habitats like Barnstable Harbor. by Heidi L. Fuchs. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Suspension-feeding {{bivalves}} produce biodeposits (faeces and pseudofaeces) {{that have}} much higher sinking velocities than their constituent particles. Consequently they cause sedimentation {{of material that}} might otherwise not be deposited. The benthic remineralisation of biodeposits increases sediment oxygen demand and nutrient regeneration, thus enhancing the benthic-pelagic coupling of nearshore ecosystems. In New Zealand the mussel Perna canaliculus has a high natural abundance and is also intensively cultured. This thesis examines the dispersal and remineralisation characteristics of mussel P. canaliculus biodeposits and the impacts of sedimentation from a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames on sediment biogeochemistry by combining laboratory, field and modelling studies. Dispersal characteristics were examined in the <b>laboratory</b> by measuring <b>sinking</b> velocities and erosion thresholds of biodeposits produced by mussels of a wide size range fed three experimental diets. The results show that biodeposit dispersal {{is a function of}} mussel diet and size and thus could differ significantly between locations and seasons. Estimates of dispersal distances based on these results demonstrated that the initial dispersal of biodeposits produced by cultured mussels is not far. Depending on the hydrodynamic conditions, secondary dispersal via resuspension potentially plays a more important role in the dispersal of biodeposits from mussel farms than initial dispersal and almost certainly serves as the major means of transport of biodeposits from natural mussel beds. Biodeposit mineralisation was studied by incubating coastal sediments with added biodeposits and measuring oxygen and nutrient fluxes as well as sediment characteristics over an 11 d period. Sediment oxygen consumption and ammonium release increased immediately after biodeposit addition and remained elevated compared to control cores without additions for the incubation period. A biodeposit decay rate (0. 16 d- 1) was calculated by fitting a first-order G model to the observed increase in oxygen consumption. This rate is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher than published decay rates of coastal sediments without organic enrichment or plant material. Nutrient fluxes during the incubation period illustrated that biodeposit remineralisation alters the stoichiometry of the nutrients released from the sediments which may potentially be more significant than the changes of the individual fluxes. To determine the impact of a mussel farm in the Firth of Thames I measured sediment oxygen and nutrient fluxes by deploying benthic chambers, sediment characteristics by collecting sediment cores and sedimentation rates by deploying sediment traps in four seasons. Oxygen consumption and sediment nutrient release rates were generally higher under the farm compared to a reference site, demonstrating the typical response to increased organic input. Unusually low nitrogen release rates measured in summer may indicate enhanced denitrification under the farm. A simple budget demonstrated the importance of benthic nutrient regeneration in maintaining primary production in this region and that mussel culture can lead to a redistribution of nutrients. This study showed that site-specific hydrodynamic and biogeochemical conditions have {{to be taken into account}} when planning new mussel farms to prevent excessive modifications of nutrient dynamics. Results of the laboratory and field studies conducted in this thesis were used to parameterise, calibrate and validate models of mussel biodeposit dispersal and remineralisation. A particle tracking model showed that the maximum initial dispersal of faecal pellets from the mussel farm is approximately 300 m and that pellets can be transported several times this distance via resuspension. The remineralisation model was able to simulate the increased nitrogen fluxes from the sediments well and highlighted the need for thorough calibration and parameterisation of the model. This thesis contributed to the current understanding of the ecosystem impacts of mussel culture and provided numerical models and model parameters that will assist in the assessment of mussel culture sustainability and the contribution of mussels to the nutrient cycling in nearshore ecosystems...|$|R
