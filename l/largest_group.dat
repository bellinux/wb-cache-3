5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the <b>largest</b> <b>group.</b> It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E

40|$|Modern {{educators}} often oppose <b>large</b> <b>group</b> teaching, preferring {{small groups}} which facilitate interactive, experiential teaching and learning. <b>Large</b> <b>groups</b> can be daunting, both {{for teachers and}} students. However, resources are finite and <b>large</b> <b>group</b> teaching remains a reality with which most educators have to grapple sooner or later. In this chapter, the term <b>large</b> <b>group</b> refers to class sizes of between twenty to a hundred or more. The discussion explores {{the pros and cons}} of <b>large</b> <b>group</b> teaching, confronts fears and challenges in such teaching, and identifies strategies for tackling this. In palliative care, the most common situations for <b>large</b> <b>group</b> teaching that educators face are teaching big groups of students in lecture theatre settings and delivering lectures or presentations to large conference audiences...|$|R

5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are the second <b>largest</b> <b>group</b> of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food {{as they do}} not need to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} <b>largest</b> <b>group,</b> which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features {{as the number of}} vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E

40|$|Emergence {{of a group}} {{analytic}} {{perspective on}} the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> Group analysts tend to agree that in <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> we learn about primitive defence mechanisms, the fear of psychotic fragmentation, the fragility of communication and the socially divisive and destructive potential in the foundation matrix of each culture. The focus of attention in the literature {{has been on the}} decivilising and not on the civilising processes within the interactions between social actors in the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> setting (Elias 1976). Despite their differences, Foulkesian and Kleinian thinkers agree that the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> repeatedly fails to learn from experience and almost always regresses into a psychotic state of mind. This negative dialectic between <b>large</b> <b>group,</b> individual member and conductor is so unquestioned that it is the first thing that deserves rethinking. Foulkes, in his refusal to integrate his work with that of Bion, shaped the understanding of small and <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> in three generations of group analytic practitioners.

5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly into two groups. The <b>largest</b> <b>group</b> consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, the medial octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the <b>largest</b> <b>group),</b> the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E

The Northern language group is tonal and includes 12 languages: Caac, Cemuhî, Fwâi, Jawe, Kumak, Nemi, Paicî, Pije, Pwaamei, Pwapwa, Yalayu, and Yuaga. Approximately 60,000 residents of New Caledonia speak {{at least one of}} the Kanak languages. Most of these {{languages are}} only in spoken form. There is no one unified language among the Kanaks; however, the <b>largest</b> <b>group</b> of Kanaks speak Drehu.|$|E
40|$|In the {{literature}} on the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> there are two omissions which need to be confronted: one is theoretical, the other empirical.

The “blank pages ” are no accident, they have a dynamic meaning within the social foundation matrix of the group analytic movement. (1) The omissions mirror Foulkes’s ambivalence towards the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and are reflected in the different approaches adopted by the group analytic heirs of the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> which pay more homage to Bion than to Foulkes. The intention of the paper is to show that there is a third position which assumes a dialectical relationship between destructive and creative forces in the <b>large</b> <b>group</b> and which returns to Foulkes's ideas on the conductor role...|$|R

Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs. Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755. From this situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.|$|E

Around 400 Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned at Auschwitz, at least 152 of whom died. An estimated 5,000 to 15,000 gay men prosecuted under German Penal Code Section 175 (proscribing sexual acts between men) were detained in concentration camps of which {{an unknown number}} were sent to Auschwitz; of those sent to Auschwitz 80 percent died.|$|E

From six preschool teachers perspective we also wanted to find out the <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children positive and negative sides. The reason behind our choice of purposes is both our own experiences of mostly negative opinions of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of children among preschool teachers, as well as the news reports about the negative consequences that <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers may cause. The study draws on a approach of the term constructionism in the understanding of the teachers’ perceptions of <b>larger</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. We applied a qualitative method based on interviews with six preschool teachers working on two different preschools. The result of our study shows that the interviewed preschool teachers sees mostly advantages rather than disadvantages with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers. The preschool teachers describe that to be able to work with <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers there has to be a good structure and organization guaranteeing that the pedagogues have the right competence and that the preschools environment is well designed. The conclusion we have been able to draw is that the preschool teachers in our study is not sharing the same negative view that previous research and media reports have shown. Instead the preschool teachers in our study sees more positive than negative aspects of <b>large</b> <b>groups</b> of preschoolers, as long as there is a good structure and organization...|$|R
