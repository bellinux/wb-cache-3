The main objective {{of this study was}} to assess the institutional arrangements of <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> and role of multi-stakeholders partnership in employment creation, income generation and encouraging <b>local</b> enterprise <b>development</b> in Mekelle city. It is a cross sectional survey of 117 <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> beneficiaries using semi-structured questionnaires and focuse group discussion. In-depth interview with stakeholders of the project and <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> expert was also conducted. The study reveals that multi-stakeholders of the project (local government, youth and women association and chamber of commerce) have been involved in different activities of the <b>local</b> economic <b>development.</b> This study concluded that the partnership among the stakeholders is not functional in almost all process of the <b>local</b> economic <b>development.</b> To overcome the poor involvements of multi-stakeholders of the project, starting from the <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> project beneficiary selection up to the repayment period of the loan, multi-stakeholders should give due emphasis in following up and delivering valuable support. Local governments should also internalize <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> project as a prime task, not secondary task of the city. The Chamber of Commerce which is expected to implement the project as a potential stakeholder should assist the <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> beneficiaries through capacity building in business development activities and in the whole <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> process through actively participating starting from designing of the plan up to monitoring and evaluations.

5|$|A {{second tranche}} of development, {{undertaken}} in two stages, was approved in November 2009. This included a general refurbishment and {{improvement of the}} existing facilities at the stadium, adding cover, better toilet and new refreshment facilities to the exposed East Stand, improving wheelchair access, adding extra catering and conferencing facilities and a new media and management centre. This was funded by collaboration between Gateshead Council, <b>local</b> <b>development</b> funds and Gateshead College. The covering of the 4,000-seat East Stand with a new canopy roof was completed in July 2010, immediately prior to Gateshead hosting a Diamond League event.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{satellite}} communications had started to take an increasing share of the station's business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar. In the radio station's penultimate year to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio telex calls. In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. The long-range services (HF bands 3–30MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999. The short-range VHF maritime band services (156–174MHz) closed at 12:00 on Sunday 30 April 2000, and the medium-range services (MF maritime band 1.6–3.0MHz) at 12:00 on Friday 30 June. The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a <b>local</b> <b>development</b> plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development. Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an early period, and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the <b>local</b> <b>development</b> of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E

5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that are just beginning emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the <b>local</b> <b>development</b> of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations have been moved when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with <b>local</b> <b>development</b> projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve <b>Local</b> Economic <b>Development</b> (LED) through {{effective}} communication strategies between Local Government and the Private sector in Nelson Mandela Bay. The study has been carried out by means of a literature and a primary study.

40|$|The {{construction}} and demolition (C and D) recycling industry creates economic opportunity through business activity; promotes equity through workforce training and partnerships; {{and helps to}} conserve natural resources through the reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of C and D debris. While C and D recycling satisfies traditional <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> goals, it also addresses broader goals of progressive, and sustainable <b>local</b> economic <b>development.</b> The general planning literature shows an increasing interest in sustainability; however, there have been fewer studies on sustainable <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> initiatives. This research examines {{the current state of}} <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agency support for the C and D recycling industry as an economic development strategy. In doing so, the dissertation assembles the array of activities <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agencies used to support the industry; identifies distinguishing policy or contextual characteristics of agencies that actively supported the industry from those that did not; and assesses whether the agencies support for C and D recycling fit within the rational planning model. Using data from a national survey of <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agencies, the study categorizes the <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> tools used to support the industry. Results show that a combination of traditional, progressive, and sustainable <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> tools are adapted and newly created to satisfy the specific needs of this specialized industry. Multiple discriminant analyses identify key characteristics of the agencies that support C and D recycling. These characteristics include previous support for the general recycling industry, the presence and support of environmental enterprise zones and eco-industrial parks, and knowledge of local landfill capacity issues. Overall, the agencies that actively supported C and D recycling engage in activities associated with sustainable <b>local</b> economic <b>development.</b> The descriptive and statistical analyses are combined with the surveys qualitative responses to determine that <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agencies do not operate under a strict interpretation of the comprehensive rational planning model in their support of C and D recycling. Instead, <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agencies use modified rational and reactive planning strategies in their support of the industry. The study concludes with policy recommendations to increase <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> agency support for C and D recycling. Ph. D.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} government tourism policy and <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> in the United Kingdom. The economic contribution {{of the tourism industry}} in the United Kingdom is discussed {{and the ways in which}} the tourism policies of the previous thirteen year labour party government attempted to harness this for <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> are critiqued. The tourism policy of the United Kingdom’s new coalition government is then analysed in the context of the global financial crisis.

This analysis shows that, although the current government’s tourism policy continues with many of the assumptions of previous policies about the links between tourism and economic development, it does introduce some new thinking that may create an environment in which the tourism industry can contribute to progressive <b>local</b> economic <b>development</b> that promotes sustainable economic growth.
