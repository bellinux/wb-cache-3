5|$|Centuries after Lisa's death, Mona Lisa {{became the}} world's most famous {{painting}} and {{took on a}} life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made {{the work of art}} a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> definitively identified as the model for the Mona Lisa.|$|E
5|$|In casting, Nancy Cartwright {{originally}} planned {{to audition for}} the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried out for Bart. Smith's voice was too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa. Cartwright found that <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> not interesting at the time, so instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better role.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> born in Florence on June 15, 1479, on Via Maggio, {{although}} {{for many years}} it was thought she was born {{on one of the}} family's rural properties, Villa Vignamaggio just outside Greve. She is named for Lisa, a wife of her paternal grandfather. The eldest of seven children, Lisa had three sisters, one of whom was named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.|$|E

5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> more like a temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984 Chrisye {{approached}} {{another young}} composer, Adjie Soetama, {{to help him}} prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided {{that it would be}} the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye– known as having a stiff stage persona– struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss <b>Lisa),</b> <b>was</b> released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.|$|E

25|$|The Apple <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> {{immediately}} {{recognized as}} a significant machine, with BYTE opining it {{more important than the}} IBM PC. Further, though a limited number of Lisas were sold, the Lisa software, in combination with an Apple dot-matrix printer, could produce documents that surpassed other comparably priced options available at the time. This one compelling usage meant that the <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> introduced into a number of larger offices, and due to the price, {{the number of people who}} had used a <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> much larger than the number of Lisas sold.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> {{a scholar}} of the USSR Ministry of Culture when she entered the Vaganova Choreographic Institute, {{currently}} known as the Academy of Russian Ballet at Saint Petersburg, Russia.

At the Leningrad Choreographic School, <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> coached by Natalia M. Dudinskaya, then, under the artistic director Konstantin Sergeyev. She graduated {{at the top of}} her class in 1984, as she became the first foreign soloist to be invited to join the Kirov ballet. At the Kirov, <b>Lisa</b> <b>was</b> taught by Galina P.

The war interrupted trade with the upper Missouri River tribes until 1816, and during this time the company focused its efforts at Council Bluff.
