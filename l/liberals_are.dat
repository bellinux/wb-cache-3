5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. <b>Liberals</b> <b>are</b> often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically delusional views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E

On a continental level, <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> organised in the Africa Liberal Network, which contains influential parties such as the Popular Movement in Morocco, the Democratic Party in Senegal, and the Rally of the Republicans in Côte d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> organized through the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats, which includes powerful parties such the Liberal Party in the Philippines, the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, and the Democrat Party in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence {{can be found in}} India. In India, the most populous democracy in the world, the Indian National Congress has long dominated political affairs.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Liberals</b> <b>are</b> also {{pushing a}} {{significant}} {{expansion of the}} city's light rail network, which Labor opposes. The Liberals were criticised for not putting forward a comprehensive plan for public transport at the election.

When asked, most Canadians said the Conservatives would handle the economy better, while most said the Liberals would handle the environment better.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with being}} the capital of Canada, Ottawa is {{politically}} diverse in local politics. Most of the city has traditionally supported the Liberal Party. Perhaps the safest areas for the <b>Liberals</b> <b>are</b> the ones dominated by Francophones, especially in Vanier and central Gloucester. Central Ottawa is usually more left-leaning, and the New Democratic Party have won ridings there. Some of Ottawa's suburbs are swing areas, notably central Nepean and, despite its francophone population, Orléans. The southern and western parts {{of the old city}} of Ottawa are generally moderate and swing to the Conservative Party. The farther one goes outside the city centre like to Kanata and Barrhaven and rural areas, the voters tend to be increasingly conservative, both fiscally and socially. This is especially true in the former Townships of West Carleton, Goulbourn, Rideau and Osgoode, which are more in line with the conservative areas in the surrounding counties. However, not all rural areas support the Conservative Party. Rural parts of the former township of Cumberland, with a large number of Francophones, traditionally support the Liberal Party, though their support has recently weakened.|$|E
500|$|Ethan Gutmann, a {{journalist}} reporting on China {{since the early}} 1990s, has attempted to explain the apparent dearth of public sympathy for Falun Gong as stemming, in part, from the group's shortcomings in public relations. Unlike the democracy activists or Tibetans, who have found a comfortable place in Western perceptions, [...] "Falun Gong marched to a distinctly Chinese drum," [...] according to Gutmann. This, coupled with western skepticism of persecuted refugees, {{has resulted in a}} perception that Falun Gong practitioners tended to exaggerate, or [...] "spout slogans rather than facts." [...] Gutmann also observes that Falun Gong also lacks robust backing from the American constituencies that usually support religious freedom: <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> wary of Falun Gong's conservative morality, Christian conservatives don't accord the practice the same space as persecuted Christians, and the political center is wary of disrupting commercial and political relations with the Chinese government. Thus, Falun Gong practitioners have largely had to rely on their own resources in responding to the persecution.|$|E

2500|$|If this {{election}} campaign has proved anything, it is this: Labor has completely lost its way on policy – and the <b>Liberals</b> <b>are</b> {{no good at}} politics ...

If anything, the fact that spin-driven Labor has shown that it is vastly better at politics is of itself a reason to chuck them out.|$|E

2500|$|While the {{differences}} between Nixon and the <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> obvious—the liberal wing {{of his own party}} favored politicians such as Nelson Rockefeller and William Scranton, and Nixon overtly placed an emphasis on [...] "law and order" [...] over civil liberties, and Nixon's Enemies List was composed largely of liberals—in some ways the continuity of many of Nixon's policies with those of the Kennedy-Johnson years is more remarkable than {{the differences}}.

2500|$|In a 2005 article {{published}} by National Review, Gorsuch argued that [...] "American liberals have become {{addicted to the}} courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda" [...] {{and that they are}} [...] "failing to reach out and persuade the public". Gorsuch wrote that, in doing so, American <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' [...] "overweening addiction" [...] to using the courts for social debate is [...] "bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary".|$|E

[...] The Times (not connected to The Sunday Times) wrote: [...] "In an extraordinary inversion of its traditional role, Amnesty has stifled its own still small voice of conscience," [...] and journalist Nick Cohen wrote in The Observer [...] "Amnesty is living in the make-believe world ... where it thinks that <b>liberals</b> <b>are</b> free to form alliances with defenders of clerical fascists who want to do everything in their power to suppress liberals, most notably liberal-minded Muslims." [...] Antara Dev Sen wrote in Daily News and Analysis: [...] "It was a gutsy stand, given the dread of political correctness that cripples our thought and makes us bend over backwards till we almost topple over.... Suspending Sahgal was an illiberal knee-jerk response unbecoming of this cherished human rights organisation."

[...] Feminist historian Urvashi Butalia also spoke up in her support. [...] Douglas Murray wrote in The Telegraph that [...] "Amnesty is longer an organisation worth listening to, let alone supporting", and The Wall Street Journal wrote: [...] "it's a pity that a group that was born to give voice to the victims of oppression should now devote itself to sanitizing the oppressors".|$|E
