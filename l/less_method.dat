40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the position-sensor less direct {{torque and}} {{indirect}} flux control of brushless dc (BLDC) motor with non sinusoidal {{back electromotive force}} (EMF) has been extensively investigated. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for BLDC motor drives to obtain optimum current and torque control with minimum torque pulsations. Most methods are complicated and do not consider the stator flux linkage control, therefore, possible high-speed operations are not feasible. In this study, a novel and simple approach to achieve a low-frequency torque ripple-free direct torque control (DTC) with maximum efficiency based on dq reference frame is presented. The proposed sensor <b>less</b> <b>method</b> closely resembles the conventional DTC scheme used for sinusoidal ac motors such that it controls the torque directly and stator flux amplitude indirectly using d-axis current. This method does not require pulse width modulation and proportional plus integral regulators and also permits the regulation of varying signals. Furthermore, to eliminate the low-frequency torque oscillations, two actual and easily available line-to-line back EMF constants (kba and kca) according to electrical rotor position are obtained offline and converted to the dq frame equivalents using the new line-to-line park transformation. Then, they are {{set up in the}} look-up table for torque estimation. The validity and practical applications of the proposed sensor less three-phase conduction DTC of BLDC motor drive scheme are verified through simulations and experimental results.

It is desirable {{in any kind}} of machine to use a method which is less dependable on the sensors and complex circuits, so in this paper a sensor <b>less</b> <b>method</b> is used to commutate and trigger the inverter connected to BLDC motor. A low pass filter arrangement with comparator is used for detection of back EMF with hall effect sensors. Hall effect signals gives the information of the operations in the BLDC motor in this work hall effect signals are used for the gate pulses for the inverter. In this research work rotor position is determined by the Zero Crossing Detection (ZCD) of back EMF. Unlike old methods of calculating Back EMF of the BLDC by creating a virtual neutral point, a complimentary method is used. This method provides a wide range of speed. A simple approach of detecting back EMF using comparator and RC filter is defined. This method provides an improved version of the back EMF. It is shown that BLDC motor is a good choice in automotive industry due to higher efficiency, higher power density and higher speed ranges compare to other motor types. BLDC motor model with improved back EMF and rotor position detection method is presented in this research work with stator current, Back EMF and rotor speed. The proposed model is simulated in MATLAB / SIMULINK.

40|$|A bomb {{explosion}} {{within or}} immediately nearby a building can cause catastrophic {{damage on the}} building's external and internal structural frames, collapsing of walls, blowing out of large expanses of windows, and shutting down of critical life-safety systems. Loss of life and injuries to occupants can result from many causes, including direct blast-effects, structural collapse, debris impact, fire, and smoke. The indirect effects can combine to inhibit or prevent timely evacuation, thereby contributing to additional casualties. In addition, major catastrophes resulting from gas-chemical explosions result in large dynamic loads, greater than the original design loads, of many structures. Due to the threat from such extreme loading conditions, efforts have been made {{during the past three}} decades to develop methods of structural analysis and design to resist blast loads. Studies were conducted on the behavior of structural concrete subjected to blast loads. These studies gradually enhanced the understanding of the role that structural details play in affecting the behavior.
