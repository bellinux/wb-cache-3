40|$|The primary {{challenge}} of globally distributed work is minimizing the perceived social distance such that people at distributed sites who might never meet one another {{can work together}} in a collaborative way. This paper draws from World Systems Theory, originally developed by Immauel Wallerstein (1974), to examine how the model of core and periphery {{can be used to}} understand the structural impediments to developing these collaborative relationships. We use this framework to examine the distributed site relationships in an IT/IS company which we refer to as GLOBALIS. The paper demonstrates that national boundaries should not be considered as the primary unit of analysis. Rather, it is important to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distributed sites in relation to the central site, and how the arrangement of these locations within a global politico-organizational framework can inform our understanding of the social relationships that emerge in and through the work they do.

40|$|As an {{increasing}} number of small cities and communities are beset by the emergence and growth of youth gangs—once regarded as the problem of major metropolitan cities—concerns about gang migration and its effects on gang proliferation have grown. Evidence of gang migration for pur-poses of drug distribution and other activities has been presented by law enforcement, the media, and others. But what is the true scope of gang migration and what types of gangs migrate? A clear understanding of the nature and scope of gang migration and its impact on local gang activities is critical. Gang Members on the Move attempts to clarify the concepts of “gang ” and “gang migration, ” and draws on the National Survey on Gang Migration and other literature to provide a preliminary but enlightening look at the relationship between gang migration and proliferation. Although the author, noted researcher Cheryl Maxson, acknowledges the need for additional research on gang migration and its effects, she concludes that communities should examine their own dynamics before attributing their gang problems to migration. Indeed, we need to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factors that contribute to gang problems locally if we are to design a preven-tion, intervention, and suppression strategy to address them effectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} two years there has been an {{exponential}} {{growth in the number of}} people questioning the explanations we have been given, by official U. S. government bodies, concerning the collapses of the three WTC buildings in NYC on 9 / 11 / 2001. It is probably safe to say that much of this growth can be attributed to the Internet publishing of a paper by Physics Professor Steven Jones in November 2005, which put forth the hypothesis that the Twin Towers and WTC 7 were actually demolished with prepositioned cutter charges. 3 This hypothesis is in tension with the present government explanation of impact damage and fires being the causes for the complete collapses of the buildings. My intent here is to show that any honest and objective <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theories, for the destruction of the twin towers, including the present government explanation, will cause one to realize that only the controlled demolition hypothesis is sustainable. I believe an honest look at the evidence will convince anyone that the controlled demolition hypothesis provides the best explanation for the complete collapses of the towers, as well as the damage to the buildings and objects surrounding them. The remarkable collapse of WTC 7 seems to have had a separate cause in its own controlled demolition. Video of the collapse of WTC 7 can be viewed quickly a...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} in Australia of a serum ELISA {{test for}} allergen specific IgE in canine atopy {{was met with}} initial enthusiasm by many small animal veterinarians. The hope was for an accessable test {{to assist in the}} diagnosis and treatment of canine atopy. Atopy is a frustrating disease to diagnose and treat, but the new ELISA does not provide the easy solution to this problem. It would be more accurately characterised as as a serum ELISA for discriminating allergens in canine atopy. The dog should first be characterised as atopic, and then it is suitable to screen the dog 2 ̆ 7 s blood for individual allergen identification to guide treatment. ELISA and intra-dermal testing correlate poorly, so which test should be believed? This is controversial and raises the possibility that both tests are right, each corresponding to different sub-types of atopy. Perhaps allergens are percutaneously absorbed leading to atopic dermatitis. There may also be another similar disease process whereby the primary mode of access is via inhalation to produce a syndrome akin to hayfever or asthma in humans. The two syndromes may commonly occur together. Preliminary research with skin patch testing supports the notion of a percutaneous route of absorption of allergens causing atopic dermatitis. Challenge tests in dogs using inhaled allergens produced mainly non-dermatological signs. A fresh <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence is needed to guide future research and assist in solving the conundrum surrounding the definition and diagnosis of canine atopy...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} new framework for transportation evaluations. Most evaluation techniques fail to adequately assess all factors involved in transportation projects, with qualitative and institutional issues typically receiving less attention than easily quantifiable technical factors. This dissertation uses quantitative decision-theory techniques {{to develop a}} flexible approach that allows an analyst to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> myriad issues involved {{in the evaluation of}} transportation projects. The research approach focuses on identifying an overall worth, which provides decision-makers with a quantitative measure to compare different system components. The innovative technique developed here integrates the multiple-attribute value function (MAVF) technique with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The overall worth of a project may be a combination of its worth under various operational conditions, with subjective relative weights, depending on the decision-makers. A hierarchy of such combinations are possible where the values for individual attributes themselves can be derived from the decision-makers using MAVF schemes. Certain complications arise in the technique, which require {{the development of a new}} scaling approach through the use of a universal scaling proxy. The research utilizes a hierarchical approach throughout the analysis while examining a total of four weighting schemes. The methodology is applied to the Anaheim Field Operational Test, a federally funded project, that implemented new traffic control technologies in Anaheim, California's special events area. The research's primary focus is on the city Traffic Engineer's values and preferences over the entire hierarchy. The development of six testing scenarios creates an opportunity to investigate the effects of many evaluation components as well as individual branches within the hierarchy. The evaluation looks at the percentage change in value between the system "before" and "after" implementation across scenarios. While the new system appears to decrease in value for most scenarios, one scenario, the alternate data set, actually shows an overall increase in value. The special event only operations scenario shows improvement over the base case, which indicates the system performs better under these conditions. The evaluation provides valuable insight into the behavior of the system under various conditions and provides guidance for future applications of this evaluation tool...|$|E
40|$|This thesis draws its {{examples}} and conclusions from a four month participatory research project that {{was carried out}} with artisan micro-enterprises operating on {{the lowest level of}} poverty in Zimbabwe, early 2007. Before that field study was carried out the focus of this research project was almost entirely on the role of design alongside the skills, materials and techniques already possessed by artisans living in poverty in Zimbabwe. However, had this initial project plan been strictly kept the project would have been unsatisfying both as a research project and for the participants in the study. This is because on the ground it became imperative to adapt this study into a more holistic <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues I encountered. This was partially because of the conditions in Zimbabwe, and partially because the four participating artisan groups were living and operating on such a low level of poverty. Although there are many organisations aimed at improving the self-sustainability of artisans living in poverty, with approaches ranging between individual "championed" efforts, such as the Mogalakwena Craft Art centre to wide ranging, but targeted efforts that address many artisan groups, such as the AT A's project in Ghana, it became apparent that for various reasons the support available for this study was to an extent, inappropriate or beyond the means of the participants, and as a result needed to be adapted and appropriated to suit their specific needs. The need to expand and appropriate this current support for artisans and subsequently the aims on the original project has led to the examination of several more appropriate aims: Importantly the identification of all the issues that were important to the artisan micro-enterprises that I worked with in this study will be examined, {{as well as some of}} the solutions that were instigated on the ground in Zimbabwe. These issues are not just design related issues, as was first thought, but also issues relating to basic business and self-promotion as well. Importantly, using a comparative study carried out in South Africa this thesis will also examine which of these issues are unique to specific groups and which are generically felt by all artisans operating in poverty and therefore which could have the potential to be generically addressed in the future...|$|E
