5000|$|The XL-R was {{a runaway}} {{hit on the}} racing market and soon {{followed}} by the XL-S and XL-T versions for different performance levels. The XL series were also well known for the way they allowed water to leak into the boot where the lower cuffs folded over each other near the toe, and prompted many owners to cover the area with duct tape. The liners also tended to [...] "pack down" [...] fairly quickly, flattening out and no longer offering support. An improved version of the basic XL design was later introduced as the Z-model, which included a new low-profile <b>locking</b> <b>buckle</b> design that would not accidentally open once locked, and a small plastic tab {{in front of the}} toe flaps to prevent snow forcing its way in.|$|E
50|$|Tears produce rough {{surfaces}} inside the knee, which cause catching, <b>locking,</b> <b>buckling,</b> pain, {{or a combination}} of these symptoms. Abnormal loading patterns and {{rough surfaces}} inside the knee, especially when coupled with return to sports, significantly increase the risk of developing arthritis if not already present.|$|R
5000|$|The knee may be not {{be fully}} mobile; there may be the {{sensation}} of knee <b>locking</b> or <b>buckling</b> in the knee.|$|R
5000|$|The {{metallic}} hardware (the <b>lock,</b> keys, <b>buckle</b> hardware, {{and base}} studs) are plated with gold or palladium. Detailing with diamonds is another custom option.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The Z-R {{followed}} the XL-R {{with a number}} of minor upgrades. The <b>buckles</b> <b>lock</b> closed, and are released by pulling on the small tabs. A control for the [...] "cant" [...] of the boot has been added, the small black square over the ankle. Minor changes like this followed all the way to current examples.|$|R
50|$|During 1969 the Hansons were {{building}} prototypes {{of their new}} boot design, and in June 1970 they formed Hanson Industries to produce them. The boot was moulded in two halves, front and back, both of relatively simple shaping that made them very easy to remove from the moulds, at least compared to traditional front-entry designs like Lange where the shaping results in complex moulds. A single <b>buckle</b> <b>locked</b> the rear portion forward onto the front for closure.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{part of the}} Black Country, Bloxwich grew {{rapidly in}} the 18th century around coal mining, iron {{smelting}} and various manufacturing industries, {{as part of the}} Industrial Revolution. Manufacturing in the area consisted of bridle bits, stirrups, keys, cabinet <b>locks,</b> plane irons, <b>buckle</b> tongues, chains and saddles. Its most famous product of manufacture were awl blades, which it is reputed to have surpassed all other places in the United Kingdom in manufacturing. In the early 19th century, Bloxwich was still a village. Most of its inhabitants were employed in the newly founded mining and forging industries, as well as light metalworking. [...] It is also known for its canals.|$|R
40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model for buckling analysis of hybrid piezoelectric beams under electromechanical load is presented in this work. The coupled zigzag theory is used for making the model. The inplane displacement is approximated as {{a combination of a}} global third order variation across the thickness with an additional layer wise linear variation. The longitudinal electric field is also taken into account. The deflection field is approximated to account for the transverse normal strain induced by electric fields. Two nodded elements with four mechanical and a variable number of electric degrees of freedom at each node are considered. To meet the convergence requirements for weak integral formulation, cubic Hermite interpolation function is used for deflection and electric potential at the sub-layers and linear interpolation function is used for axial displacement and shear rotation. The expressions for the variationally consistent stiffness matrix and load vector are derived and evaluated in closed form using exact integration. The present 1 D-FE formulation of zigzag theory is validated by comparing the results with the analytical solution for simply-supported beam and 2 D-FE results obtained using ABAQUS. The {{finite element model}} is free of shear <b>locking.</b> The critical <b>buckling</b> parameters are obtained for clamped-free and clamped-clamped hybrid beams. The obtained results are compared with the 2 D-FE results to establish the accuracy of the zigzag theory for above boundary conditions. The effect of lamination angle on critical buckling load is also studied...|$|R
