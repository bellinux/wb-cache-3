40|$|In this thesis, I {{present a}} method for {{simulating}} three characteristics of depth of field image: partial occlusion, bokeh and blur. Retrieving color from occluded surfaces is achieved by constructing a per-pixel linked <b>list</b> <b>buffer,</b> which only requires two render passes. Additionally, per-pixel linked <b>list</b> <b>buffer</b> eliminates the memory overhead of empty pixels in depth layers. Bokeh and blur effect are accomplished by image-space point splatting (Lee 2008). I demonstrate how point splatting {{can be used to}} account for the effect of aperture shape and intensity distribution on bokeh. Spherical aberration and chromatic aberration can be approximated using a custom pre-built sprite. Together as a package, this method is capable matching the realism of multi-perspective methods and layered methods. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{combined}} a {{mechanistic model}} of episodic encoding with theories on the functional significance of two event-related potential (ERP) components {{to develop an}} integrated account for the Von Restorff effect, which refers to the enhanced recall probability for an item that deviates in some feature from other items in its study <b>list.</b> The <b>buffer</b> model of Lehman and Malmberg (2009, 2013) can account for this effect such that items encountered during encoding enter an episodic buffer where they are actively rehearsed. When a deviant item is encountered, in order to re-allocate encoding resources towards this item the buffer is emptied from its prior content, a process labeled “compartmentalization”. Based on theories on their functional significance, the P 300 component of the ERP may co-occur with this hypothesized compartmentalization process, while the frontal slow wave may index rehearsal. We derived predictions from this integrated model for output patterns in free recall, systematic variance in ERP components, as well as associations between {{the two types of}} measures in a dataset of 45 participants who studied and freely recalled lists of the Von Restorff type. Our major predictions were confirmed and the behavioral and physiological results were consistent with the predictions derived from the model. These findings demonstrate that constraining mechanistic models of episodic memory with brain activity patterns and generating predictions for relationships between brain activity and behavior can lead to novel insights into the relationship between the brain, the mind, and behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the 21 st century, as {{technologies}} of perceptual recognition develops, devices of information generation begin to accurately sense, measure and monitor {{the physical world}} in real time. Complex Event Processing(CEP), {{which can be used}} to extract user level information from raw data, becomes the key part of the IoT middleware. Most of the current study of complex event processing has not focus on distributed uncertain event streams. In this paper, a high performance method over distributed uncertain event streams is proposed. This method uses improved matched tree that include node <b>buffer</b> <b>list</b> and probability calculation to detect complex event in single uncertain event stream. Distributed stream processing platform Storm also is brought in to improve the performance and stability. Based on Storm, two level parallel methods are proposed to increase the throughput. The experiment study shows that this method is efficient to process complex events over distributed uncertain event streams.

30|$|In another work, Burns et al. [28] propose Meets and Visits (MV), {{a scheme}} that learns the {{frequency}} of meetings between nodes and how often they visit a certain region. This information is used to rank each bundle according to the likelihood of delivering a bundle through a specific path. However, many bundles with the same destination may exist in a node’s buffer. Hence, in this case, {{all of them have}} the same priority to be forwarded whereas their different TTL values can affect bundle delivery. In another work, Pan et al. [27] propose a comprehensive buffer management policy based on state information such as node ID, <b>list</b> of <b>buffered</b> bundles and the five nodes that have the highest encounter rate. During routing, for a given bundle, a sender determines whether encountered nodes have recently met the bundle’s destination. If so, the sender forwards the bundle to these nodes. It then arranges bundles in ascending order based on the hop-count and number of forwards. Bundles with a hop-count greater than a threshold as well as having a size that is larger or equal {{to the size of a}} newly received bundle are selected for dropping and are arranged in ascending order based on the number of forwards. Accordingly, a node drops the bundle that has been forwarded the most. In another drop policy, Ayub and Rashid [26] propose T-drop, a policy that considers the size of bundles during congestion. Specifically, by defining a threshold range, a bundle is dropped if its size is within said threshold.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for the usage of energy exponents in motion detection from video sequences is explored. The wavelet domain was chosen for the research due to the optimality of Hilbert's space for energy calculations and Parseval's equation for energy equivalence between domains. Five algorithms were considered: wavelet energy motion detection algorithm based on wavelet pairs and <b>buffer,</b> <b>listed</b> in the references, and four which are the contributions of this paper: modification by the application of different wavelet pairs, a modified algorithm without buffer, a modified algorithm without buffer and pairs, newly developed algorithms for energy exponents with and without buffer, but with wavelet pairs. The considered algorithms are background subtraction algorithms modified not to use pixels values, but rather energy/energy exponent backgrounds and the current situation models. These models are described by wavelet descriptors, the introduction {{of which is the}} contribution of this paper. They are compared by standard statistical criteria and execution time. The results suggest that an increase in the energy exponent decreases precision, recall and F-measure. However, the percentage of correct classifications remains almost constant. Higher exponentials reduce noise, but are more susceptible to shadows, the waving tree effect and similar abnormalities. Algorithms without buffers are less robust to illumination changes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was performed over 10 months {{as part of}} a Masters in Biotechnology (Plant Biotechnology). This thesis was previously assessed and updated in accordance with the corrections suggested by the examiners. The main focus of the research is essentially the same as proposed initially in the literature review, although slight modifications {{have been made in the}} methodology and the focus of the study has been further narrowed. Only the E. coli expression system was used to express the proteins instead of both Pichia pastoris and E. coli. Also, one glycosylsyltransferase (GT) family, GT 43 and one clade of GT 47 family were characterized instead of three. Thus, the title in the manuscript is narrower as opposed to the title of the thesis. Although the research manuscript contained herein will provide the first draft of a future publication to be submitted to Plant Physiology, due to time constraints, all the data required for the publication has not been finalised. Further experiments are needed to verify and obtain more comprehensive data for the study. However, data which was collected but is not included in the manuscript due to space constraints is provided within the appendices such as the transcript profiling of glycosyltransferase family GT 61 genes. Protein expression of genes in this family could not be achieved as amplification of the GT 61 cDNA was not successful. The research manuscript begins by outlining the significance of heteroxylans in plant cell wall biology and in the utilization of cereals and grasses, and pointed to glycosyltransferases that had been implicated in their synthesis. The results of the study consisted of phylogenetic and bioinformatic analysis of barley GT 43 family and one clade of barley GT 47 family, transcript profiles of the GT 43 and GT 47 genes in a series of barley tissues, heterologous expression and the purification of two proteins of interest, and finally an assay of the purified proteins. In addition, the appendices contain data collected for family GT 61, nucleotide and protein sequences for all the GT genes studied, <b>buffer</b> <b>list,</b> Plant Physiology’s “instructions for authors” acknowledgements, and a dedication.
