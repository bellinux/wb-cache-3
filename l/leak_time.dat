40|$|ObjectiveBioGlue (CryoLife, Europa Ltd, Surrey, UK) is {{effective}} in reducing alveolar air leak after pulmonary resection. However, concerns exist {{regarding the use of}} bovine-derived products. Vivostat (Vivostat A/S, Alleroed, Denmark) is an autologous fibrin sealant that confers certain advantages. It shows superior elastic properties, a faster absorption time, and the absence of risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases. MethodsWe conducted a randomized, single blind controlled study to compare BioGlue and Vivostat in the control of postoperative air leak. Primary endpoints were duration of air <b>leak,</b> <b>time</b> to intercostal drain removal, and length of hospital stay. Secondary endpoints related to postoperative complications. ResultsBetween December 2005 and December 2007, 103 patients were randomized. The analysis included 102 patients; 67 % were male. Median age was 56 ± 19 years. Indications for surgery were primary lung cancer in 41 patients (40 %), secondary malignancy in 48 patients (47 %), carcinoid in 6 patients (6 %), and 7 patients underwent surgery for benign disease (7 %). Bilobectomy was performed in 2 patients (2 %), lobectomy in 41 patients (40 %), lobectomy with lesser resection in 3 patients (3 %), segmentectomy in 16 patients (16 %), precision excision in 34 patients (33 %), and 6 patients underwent other resections (6 %). Median duration of air leak was 3 (0 – 32) days versus 2 (0 – 33) days for patients who received BioGlue and Vivostat, respectively (P =. 677). Time to intercostal drain removal was 5 (1 – 32) days in the BioGlue group compared with 5 (1 – 34) days for the Vivostat group (P = . 473). Median hospital stay was 8 (3 – 22) days versus 7 (2 – 29) days for the BioGlue and Vivostat groups, respectively (P =. 382). There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of complications between the 2  groups (20 patients receiving BioGlue versus 19 patients receiving Vivostat, P =. 839). ConclusionsThere were no significant differences in the 3 clinical outcome measures of duration of air <b>leak,</b> <b>time</b> to intercostal drain removal, and length of hospital stay in those patients receiving BioGlue or Vivostat. Given the inherent advantages of our institutional preference is to use Vivostat in the control of postoperative air leaks after pulmonary resection...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} a {{model for}} the neural integrator based on hysteretic units connected by positive feedback. Hysteresis is assumed to emerge from the intrinsic properties of the cells. We consider the recurrent networks containing either bistable or multistable neurons. We apply our analysis to the oculomotor velocity-to-position neural integrator that calculates eye positions using the inputs that carry information about eye angular velocity. By analyzing this system in the parameter space, we show the following. The direction of hysteresis in the neuronal response may be reversed for the system with recurrent connections compared to the case of unconnected neurons. Thus, for the NMDA receptor-based bistability, the firing rates after ON saccades may be higher than after OFF saccades for the same eye position. The reversal of hysteresis occurs in this model only when the size of hysteresis differs from neuron to neuron. We also relate the macroscopic <b>leak</b> <b>time</b> constant of the integrator to the rate of microscopic spontaneous noise-driven transitions in the hysteretic units. Finally, we investigate the conditions under which the hysteretic integrator may have no threshold for integration...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{biological}} {{evaluation of a}} nonresorbable acrylic cement loaded with alendronate {{for the treatment of}} osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The cement formulation was based on polymethyl methacrylate and acrylic monomers; one of these had covalently linked vitamin E residues. The same cement in the absence of alendronate was used as a control. The setting of the charged cement presented a maximum polymerization temperature of 44 ºC, a setting time of 24 min, a residual monomer content lower than 3 wt. %, a compressive strength of 99 ± 10 MPa and an elastic modulus of 1. 2 ± 0. 2 GPa. Cytotoxicity studies using human osteoblast cultures revealed that the leachable substances of the alendronate loaded cement collected between 1 and 7 days decreased cell viability to values lower than 80 %. However, morphological changes and cellular damage in cells produced by the extracts decreased with the <b>leak</b> <b>time.</b> Cell adhesion and growth on charged cement was significantly lower than on the control. Implantation of the cement paste in the intra-femoral cavity of rabbits showed that initially the osteogenic activity was evident for the cement charged with alendronate, and the osteosynthesis process took place mainly in the trabeculae and was manifested by the presence of a non-mineralised osseous spicule. The interface between material and adjacent bone tissue was initially characterized by a variable fibrous response that in many cases it appeared reduced to thin connective tissue after a 24 -week-period.

40|$|The haemolysis of {{individual}} human erythrocytes {{has been observed}} using an inverted microscope and cine-camera. 2. With each permeant (glycerol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, urea and water) haemolysis is a multistage process. The stages are swelling, popping, reduction in volume possibly accompanied by ion leakage and, finally, haemoglobin leakage. 3. The classical haemolysis time (Th) {{is made up of}} a swelling time (Tsw) and a stress time (Tst). Tst is not negligible and with the faster permeants it may occupy more than 75 % of the haemolysis time. 4. The stress time can also be divided into two parts: a K+ <b>leak</b> <b>time</b> (TK) during which the cell shrinks and a time (THb) during which haemoglobin is leaving the cell. THb occupies a substantial part of Th, from 25 to 65 %, and is relatively longer in fast haemolysis. 5. There is a wide spread in the permeability coefficient to glycerol in a population of erythrocytes. The distribution is compatible with a Gaussian distribution. The mean permeability is 1 - 79 X 10 (- 6) cm/sec and the S. D. is +/ 0 0 - 45 X 10 (- 6) cm/sec. 6. The correlation between haemolysis time and swelling time for individual erythrocytes is poor, especially for fast haemolysis. Consequently, a measure of the distribution of haemolysis time does not give a related distribution of the swelling time or of the calculated permeability for individual erythrocytes...|$|E
