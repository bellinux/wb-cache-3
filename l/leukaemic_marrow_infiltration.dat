40|$|Summary. -When the clonogenic {{survival}} of mouse haemopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) and leukaemia L 1210 cells grown as ascites tumours are compared after being heated in vitro and assayed in vivo by spleen-colony assay, {{there is no}} significant difference in the terminal slopes of the survival curves. The shoulders of the survival curves differ, but this may be explained by differences in cell kinetics. By contrast, L 1210 <b>leukaemic</b> <b>marrow</b> cells are considerably more susceptible to the lethal effects of hyperthermia (43 °C) than either normal marrow stem cells or L 1210 leukaemic cells grown as ascites tumours. Moreover, the killing of L 1210 ascites cells by hyperthermia can be enhanced by heating L 1210 ascites cells with an equal number of normal marrow cells, or as upernatant removed from heated marrow cells. Most cells in <b>leukaemic</b> <b>marrow</b> are normal, and it is postulated that the increased thermal sensitivity of L 1210 cells in <b>leukaemic</b> <b>marrow</b> is caused by diffusible factors (e. g. lysosomal enzymes) released by heating normal marrow cells.

40|$|Primary extra nodal lymphomas (EN-NHL) are {{different}} from primary nodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (N-NHL) and are comparatively less common. Hemogram findings and bone marrow involvement is less studied and very few reports {{are available in the}} literature. The present study is a retrospective analysis of bone marrow samples evaluated for staging of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The age, sex distribution, clinical features, and site of presentation, hemogram findings, pattern of bone marrow involvement and grade of reticulin fibrosis was noted. These findings were compared with the type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and prognostic information was determined. A total of 647 cases of NHL, which underwent bone marrow examination for staging, over a seven year period, were retrieved and analyzed for all hematological parameters. Prevalence of EN-NHL was 23. 5 % (152 / 647), while nodal NHL comprised 76. 5 % (495 / 647) of all NHL cases. 90. 1 % (137 / 152) cases of EN-NHL were adult patients, out of which 15. 3 % (21 / 137) cases showed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> as compared to 89 % (441 / 495) adult primary nodal NHL cases, of which 39 % (175 / 441) showed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration.</b> 9. 9 % (15 / 152) cases of EN-NHL were pediatric patients, out of which 40 % (6 / 15) showed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration,</b> while 10. 9 % (54 / 495) of nodal NHL cases were pediatric, of which 20. 3 % (11 / 54) showed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration.</b> Hemogram findings were not found useful in predicting bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> in both nodal as well as EN-NHL. 100 % (6 / 6) of pediatric patients had high grade lymphoma as compared to 48 % (9 / 21) of adult patients, showing bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> in EN-NHL group. Reticulin fibrosis also did not reveal relation with grading of NHL. Prognostically EN-NHL of stomach and central nervous system were found to be better than EN-NHL of other sites, as none of these cases showed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration.</b> EN-NHL can involve various sites and the prognosis depends upon the sites of disease as well as the type of NHL. Moreover, pediatric EN-NHL cases are likely to have poorer prognosis, due to increased risk of bone marrow involvement as compared to their counterparts having primary nodal NHL. Bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> at times cannot be assessed reliably from hemogram findings only and a bone marrow biopsy for staging is mandatory...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of MRI and 18 FDG-PET in bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> of the spine due to metastases of solid tumours and lymphoma in cancer patients. In 35 cancer patients (solid tumours n =  26, lymphoma n =  9) MRI of the spine and 18 FDG-PET were reviewed and the detectability of metastases, infiltration of the spine, extent of disease, and therapeutic implications were compared. In 8 / 35 cases (23 %) imaging technique showed concordantly no bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration.</b> In 19 / 35 patients (54 %), both MRI and 18 FDG-PET revealed bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> of the axial skeleton. In 12 / 19 patients (63 %), MRI showed more extensive disease which lead to subsequent therapy. The imaging findings of MRI and 18 FDG-PET were discordant in 8 / 35 cases (23 %). 18 FDG-PET was false positive in two patients. In six patients, 18 FDG-PET failed to detect bone metastases and bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> of the spine, which was detected by MRI and proven by clinical follow-up with subsequent therapy in two cases.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of flow cytometry (FC) and bone marrow biopsy (BMB) to evaluate bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> {{was made in}} 114 patients suffering from B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs; 51 at diagnosis, 63 during post-therapy follow-up). The following parameters were indicative of bone marrow infiltration: altered surface k/l ratio; specific immunophenotypic pattern in particular NHLs (CLL, mantle cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia). FC and BMB agreed in 89. 5 % of cases (i. e. both showed 48 positive and 54 negative cases). In discordant cases (7. 9 %) and in cases not evaluable by FC (2. 6 %) IgH rearrangement and bcl- 1 gene expression, both evaluated by PCR methods, were used to detect bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with higher precision.

40|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is {{the most}} common soft tissue sarcoma in {{children}} younger than 15 years. According to the World Health Organization, there are embryonal, alveolar and pleomorphic types of RMS. Most RMS patients present with a tumor mass {{in the head and neck}} region, urogenital tract or lower extremities. Unusual clinical presentation of the disease with massive bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> at the disease onset and mimicking hematologic neoplasm is rarely seen. A case is presented of a 14 -year-old, previously healthy girl hospitalized for outpatiently detected leukocyte elevation. For the last two weeks, she had complained of fatigue, myalgia and frequent bruising. On admission, clinical examination revealed numerous petechiae and hematomas, enlarged left inguinal lymph node and palpable spleen 2 cm below left costal arch. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow fine needle aspiration (FNA) produced a hypercellular bone marrow sample with suppression of all three hemocytopoiesis lines and bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with numerous undifferentiated tumor cells. Considering the morphological, cytochemical and phenotypic characteristics, the cytologic diagnosis was: bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with RMS cells. Abdominal computerized tomography revealed a primary tumor occupying the entire retropeoritoneal space. Tumor biopsy confirmed alveolar subtype of RMS. In conclusion, in cases of bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with primitive, immature cells, RMS should be considered as differential diagnostic possibility. Adjuvant technologies (cytochemistry, immunocytochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, flow cytometry, and molecular analysis) can be very helpful in diagnostic work-up, and may lead to definitive diagnosis in some cases...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the significance of}} the dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) parameters of diffuse spinal bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> in patients with hematological malignancies. Materials and Methods: Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the lumbar spine was performed in 26 patients with histologically proven diffuse bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration,</b> including multiple myeloma (n = 6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 5), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 7), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2). Twenty subjects whose spinal MRI was normal, made up the control group. Peak enhancement percentage (Emax), enhancement slope (ES), and time to peak (TTP) were determined from a timeintensity curve (TIC) of lumbar vertebral bone marrow. A comparison between baseline and follow-up MR images and its histological correlation were evaluated in 10 patients. The infiltration grade of hematopoietic marrow with plasma cells was evaluated by a histological assessment of bone marrow. Results: Differences in Emax, ES, and TTP values between the control group and the patients with diffuse bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> were significant (t =- 11. 51,- 9. 81 and 3. 91, respectively, p < 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Limited {{information}} is available from developing countries in patients of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Hence, we reviewed the demographical profile along with bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> pattern in patients with NHL presented at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive study, adult patients with NHL were enrolled from January 2011 to December 2015. RESULTS: One hundred and Eighty-four histopathologically confirmed cases of NHL were identified. There were 139 males and 45 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 3 : 1. The mean age was 48. 5 ± 16. 0 years with {{the median age of}} 50 years. B-symptoms were present in 80. 4 % of patients. Lymph node enlargement was present in 71. 1 % of the cases. One hundred and sixty-eight patients had B-cell lymphoma (91. 3 %) and 16 patients had T-cell lymphoma (8. 6 %). Overall 158 (85. 8 %) patients had aggressive lymphoma. The frequency of bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> in our NHL patients was found to be 31. 5 %. Pattern of infiltrate was diffuse (14. 6 %) predominantly followed by interstitial (6. 5 %) and paratrabecular (5. 4 %) types of infiltration. The least common was nodular infiltrate accounted in 9 (4. 8 %) patients. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell lymphoma is more frequent than T-cell lymphoma. Younger age, aggressive lymphoma, and predominance of B-symptoms are more frequently seen. Diffuse bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> is more common in our set up probably because of a relatively late presentation in our patients...|$|R

40|$|Bone marrow aspirates and biopsy {{specimens}} {{were taken}} at diagnosis from 51 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The diagnosis {{was based on}} morphological and cytochemical analyses, and the leukaemias were classified by FAB criteria. A considerable difference was observed between the results of bone marrow aspirates and the findings of plastic-embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens, particularly in marrow cellularity, extent of blast cell infiltration, and cell type involved in the leukaemic process. The myelomonocytic cell type seemed to predominate in the sections. In four cases there was considerable <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with maturing, but dysplastic, granulocytic cells in the sections, {{but not in the}} aspirate smears. Features of potential prognostic importance, such as bone <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> with inflammatory cells, were easily recognised and quantified in the sections.

40|$|A logical {{approach}} to bone marrow alterations is proposed {{that takes into}} account the high sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging for the detection of marrow fat. Marrow signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images is assumed to reflect the balance between fat and nonfat marrow components. Elementary patterns of marrow change include <b>marrow</b> depletion, <b>infiltration,</b> replacement and signal void. These patterns can be observed alone or in combination, and can be distributed in a focal or diffuse manner. Marrow depletion pattern shows high signal intensity reflecting increase in fat content and is frequently irrelevant clinically. Signal intensity is decreased in <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration,</b> replacement and signal void patterns, which indicates partial or complete disappearance of fat. Focal <b>marrow</b> <b>infiltration</b> is frequently reactive to an adjacent abnormality, whereas focal marrow replacement more frequently indicates a more profound marrow alteration. The T 1 -weighted spin-echo sequence is satisfactory for lesion detection by virtue of its relatively high sensitivity in the detection of altered fat/nonfat marrow balance. T 2 -weighted sequences with saturation of the signal of fat protons or out-of-phase gradient-echo sequences improve lesion conspicuity in all situations in which the difference in fat/nonfat marrow balance between the abnormal area and the adjacent normal marrow is reduced...|$|R
