40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} the chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor <b>lufenuron</b> on the various developmental stages of red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum was determined by exposing them to different sub-lethal concentrations (LC 10, LC 20 and LC 40) of <b>lufenuron</b> through diet for 24 hrs. There was a dose dependent effect on the larval weight, time taken for pupation, and adult emergence, percentage pupation and percentage adult emergence. When two day old larvae were fed on sublethal concentrations through diet {{a small proportion of}} pupal –adult intermediates were observed at LC 20 and LC 40. Adults emerging from the larvae fed on diet containing LC 10, LC 20 and LC 40 of <b>lufenuron</b> did not show any variation in the fecundity and hatchability of eggs from that of control. The fecundity of adults fed with sub-lethal concentration of <b>lufenuron</b> (obtained against two day old larvae through diet) was not affected, however, percentage hatching and survival was affected. Interestingly there was a reversal of the effect within ten days of treatment with respect to percentage hatching and survival. When eggs were exposed to treated diet hatching was not affected.

40|$|Compatible use of {{biocontrol}} agents with insecticides {{is often}} essential to {{integrated pest management}} because the targets of each agent are normally restricted to a single or only a few species of pests and because the agent does not always provide satisfactory pest control. Selective use of chemicals least harmful to biological control agents is then ideal. In the present study, five insecticides, namely imidacloprid, pymetrozine, <b>lufenuron,</b> ethofenprox and clothianidin, were tested to determine their toxicity to Neochrysocharis okazakii (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a larval parasitoid of pest Liriomyza leafminers.

This study measured changes in feeding and mortality of the Eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes when exposed to diets treated with one of four chitin synthesis inhibitors including; diflubenzuron, triflumuron, hexaflumuron and <b>lufenuron.</b> All were benzoylphenyl ureas (BPUs). The tests included five different concentrations of each. The first objective {{of this study was to}} determine the concentration of each of the four different benzoylphenyl ureas that was acceptable to R. flavipes in a food source. The second objective was to observe the effects of these insecticides on R. flavipes in laboratory testing. The third objective was to determine preferences by R. flavipes had when given a choice between treated and untreated cellulose. Evidence of the "jackknifed" pose characteristic of chitin synthesis inhibition, overall mean survivorship and the slope of survivorship were all observed. The results varied with chemical and concentration, but almost all treatments caused more mortality than untreated controls. All treatments resulted in jackknifing of the fed termites. When presented with choices, R. flavipes did not show definitive preferences in a majority of the tests. <b>Lufenuron,</b> a benzoylphenyl urea not yet approved for use on termites, was highly acceptable to R. flavipes. Termites fed on <b>lufenuron</b> also exhibited high rates of mortality. Hexaflumuron and triflumuron showed similar acceptability and mortality at two concentrations tested.

40|$|Results of {{previous}} laboratory {{studies suggest that}} high population density often buffers the effects of chemical stressors that predominately increase mortality. Mortality stressors act to release more resources for the survivors and, therefore, produce less-than-additive effects. By contrast, growth stressors {{are expected to have}} opposite results or more-than-additive effects. We investigated the effects of a growth inhibitor (<b>lufenuron)</b> on larval growth and survival of Chironomus riparius and examined its joint effects with density on population growth rate (PGR). Exposure to 60 mu g/kg sediment or greater inhibited larval growth, and exposure to 88 mu g/kg or greater often resulted in mortality before reaching emergence. The effects of <b>lufenuron,</b> however, differed with population density. At 88 mu g/kg, mortalities and, to a lesser extent, reduced fecundity resulted in a reduction in PGR at low density. Conversely, when populations were initiated at high density, PGR was similar to that of controls, because the few survivors reached maturity sooner and started producing offspring earlier. The effect of density as a growth stressor therefore was stronger than the effect of <b>lufenuron,</b> which had effects similar to those of a mortality stressor and produced less-than-additive effects. Longterm studies under field conditions, however, are needed before less-than-additive effects are considered to be the norm...|$|E

Vines in vineyards with white and red grapes located in Central Greece were sprayed once with commercial formulations of each insecticide at the recommended doses in experiments carried out in 2004 and repeated in 2006. The insecticide residues in grapes showed slow reduction {{for a period of}} 42 days after application following first-order kinetics with dissipation rates ranged from 0. 011 to 0. 018 mg kg- 1 day- 1. However, at the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) residues did not exceed 0. 27 +/- 0. 03 mg kg- 1 for flufenoxuron and <b>lufenuron</b> and 0. 68 +/- 0. 07 mg kg- 1 for tebufenozide, and they were clearly lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by the European Union for grape (2 mg kg- 1 for flufenoxuron, 1 mg kg- 1 for <b>lufenuron</b> and 3 mg kg- 1 for tebufenozide). Grape processing into wine caused an almost complete reduction for flufenoxuron and <b>lufenuron</b> as their residues in wine were below the method LOQs (0. 01 mg l- 1), but only a moderate reduction for tebufenozide with concentrations from 0. 13 to 0. 26 mg l- 1 measured in the produced wines.

40|$|The {{long-term}} response, including recovery, {{of aquatic}} macroinvertebrates to short-term insecticide exposure {{may be affected}} by the presence of uncontaminated refuges in the stressed ecosystem. Experimental ditches were used to study the influence of non-sprayed ditch sections regarding the ecotoxicological effects on and the recovery of macroinvertebrates following treatment with the insecticide <b>lufenuron.</b> The treatment regimes differed in the proportion of the ditch (0, 33, 67, and 100 % of surface area) that was sprayed to reach a <b>lufenuron</b> concentration of 3 µg/L in the water column of the sprayed ditch section. The magnitude and duration of effects on macroinvertebrates, and on arthropods in particular, were higher when a larger proportion of the ditch was treated. Initially, more pronounced responses were observed for bivoltine and multivoltine insects and macrocrustaceans than for univoltine and semivoltine arthropods. Most macroinvertebrate arthropods showed delayed responses, with maximum treatment-related effects observed two to six weeks after <b>lufenuron</b> application. This latency of effects {{can be explained by the}} mode of action of <b>lufenuron,</b> involving inhibition of chitin synthesis, which affects arthropod molting and metamorphosis. The observed effects were short-lived only in those ditches where 33 % of the surface area was sprayed. In the ditches where 67 and 100 % of the surface area was sprayed, some insects and macrocrustaceans showed long-term effects. In the 100 % sprayed ditches in particular, the treatment-related reduction in arthropods resulted in indirect effects, such as an increase in snails, and later in an increase in the ephemeropteran Cloeon dipterum, probably because of an increase in periphyton, and release from competition and predation.

Bait-cards with eggs of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) were used to capture larvae from treated plants; five of them were fixed in plant canopy and five others left on the soil around stem. A protective barrier made up of galvanized steel sheet was used for each plant to avoid loss of larvae. The number of larvae feeding on the bait-cards was measured for four days. According to the number of captured larvae, each insecticide effect was estimated and classified into toxicity categories as stated by the International Organization for Biological and Integratec Control of Noxious Animals and Plants (IOBC). Based on observations, the insect growth regulator <b>lufenuron</b> was harmless, while the neurotoxins deltamethrin and malathion were slightly harmful; and lastly, fenthion and phosmet were moderately harmful to C. externa larvae in semi-field conditions. Thus, <b>lufenuron</b> should be recommended for integrated pest management, since it would preserve this predator species in peach orchards...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract The {{dissipation}} {{of three}} insecticide flufenoxuron, <b>lufenuron</b> and tebufenozide residues in grapes after field treatments {{and during the}} winemaking process was evaluated. Residues were determined in grape, must, centrifuged must and wine samples by HPLC-UV after cyclohexane extraction and clean up on Silica phase cartridges. Vines in vineyards with white and red grapes located in Central Greece were sprayed once with each insecticide's commercial formulation at the recommended doses in experiments carried out in 2004 and repeated in 2006. The insecticide residues in grapes showed slow reduction {{for a period of}} 42 days after application following first-order kinetics with dissipation rates ranged from 0. 011 to 0. 018 mg kg- 1 d- 1. However, at the recommended pre-harvest interval (PHI) residues did not exceed 0. 27 ± 0. 03 mg kg- 1 for flufenoxuron and <b>lufenuron</b> and 0. 68 ± 0. 07 mg kg- 1 for tebufenozide and they were clearly lower than the maximum residue limits (MRLs) set by EU in grape (2 mg Kg- 1 for flufenoxuron, 1 mg kg- 1 for <b>lufenuron</b> and 3 mg kg- 1 for tebufenozide). Grape processing into wine caused an almost complete reduction for flufenoxuron and <b>lufenuron</b> as their residues in wine were below the method LOQs (< 0. 01 mg L- 1), but only a moderate reduction for tebufenozide as concentrations from 0. 13 to 0. 26 mg L- 1 were measured in the produced wines. Mean transfer factors for tebufenozide of 0. 45 for white 'Roditis' and 0. 34 for red 'Cabernet Sauvignon' were found from grapes into wine for the wines processed without maceration for tebufenozide. The wine-making technique (with or without maceration) had the same influence on tebufenozide residues in wine. Between various clarifying agents studied, charcoal was found the only one to be effective for removing tebufenozide residues from wine.

40|$|New topical and {{systemic}} adulticides and insect growth regulators (IGRs) make controlling flea infestations much easier. But flea infestations can at times be persistent or reoccur, even after application of seemingly effective flea control products. While insecticide resistance may cause organophosphate- and pyrethroid-based flea products to fail, {{no one knows}} the extent of insecticide resistance to fipronil, imidacloprid, <b>lufenuron,</b> methoprene, pyriproxyfen, or selamectin in cat flea populations. 1 - 3 Even today, if a product containing fipronil, imidacloprid, <b>lufenuron,</b> methoprene, pyriproxyfen, or selamectin fails, some veterinarians cite resistance as the cause. But in my experience, true product failures are rare, and most problems stem from poor compliance, application or administration errors, and a lack of understanding of important biologic and epidemiologic parameters in the flea life cycle. This article will focus on the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, its biology, and its impact on control strategies...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{few studies}} have {{evaluated}} chitin synthesis inhibitors against bed bugs, although they would provide an alternative mode of action to circumvent insecticide resistance. Acute and sublethal effects of <b>lufenuron</b> were evaluated against two strains of the common bed bug. Combined acute and sublethal effects were used to calculate effective doses. The dose that was effective against 50 % of Harlan strain bed bugs was 0. 0081 % (w/v), and was much higher against Bradenton strain bed bugs (1. 11 % w/v). Sublethal doses were chosen {{to determine the effect}} that leg abnormalities had on pulling force. Both Harlan and Bradenton strain bed bugs had significantly lower locomotion ability (p < 0. 0001) following topical application of <b>lufenuron.</b> The observed sublethal effects that limit locomotion could prevent bed bugs from moving within a domicile and taking a blood meal, subsequently reducing a bed bug population over time...|$|E
