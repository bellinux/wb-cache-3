5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson.

Directed by Robert Z. <b>Leonard</b> <b>and</b> written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original.

5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed.
