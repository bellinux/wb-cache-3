5|$|Between 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, {{film and}} stage {{productions}} appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of Pride and Prejudice starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It {{has long been}} said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. <b>Leonard</b> <b>and</b> written {{in collaboration with the}} English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.|$|E

5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael <b>Leonard</b> <b>and</b> Jack Cushing at the Black Maria.

In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout.

Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.|$|E

5|$|The union {{rejected}} the offer on November 9 {{and asked for}} another bargaining session. The two sides met again as the deadline passed.

If accepted by the players, Stern hoped to start a 72-game season in mid December. On November 14, the union {{rejected the}} last offer and dissolved the union. The NBPA was converted into a trade association, enabling the players as individual employees to participate in a class action antitrust lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. Attorney David Boies, who represented the NFL owners in their 2011 lockout, agreed to represent the players and join Keesler, who also represented the players in the NFL lockout. On November 15, one group of NBA players (including Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kawhi <b>Leonard,</b> <b>and</b> Leon Powe) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA in a California federal court, while another (including Anthony Tolliver, Ben Gordon, Caron Butler and Derrick Williams) filed their own suit against the NBA in a Minnesota federal court.
