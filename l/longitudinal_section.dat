A verandah running around the outside of this structure extends the habitable space still further. This form begins to give an emphasis to the central area between the four innermost columns.|$|E

At the bottom is a thick, often crumpled base attached to a cord-like rhizomorph, which is often encrusted with surrounding soil. The rhizomorphs are well developed, and when cut into <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section,</b> reveal three distinct tissues: an outer cortex, a subcortical layer, and a central core. The thin and fragile exoperidium (the outer layer of [...] "skin") is whitish-gray to gray, and initially smooth before becoming areolate (divided by cracks into discrete areas). The base extends up one-third to one-half way into the puffball (where it becomes the columnella) tapering to a point. The gleba is initially whitish, and then yellow-green, and finally brownish-green in older specimens with mature spores.|$|E

6000|$|The {{flexible}} petiole {{of a half}} or {{a quarter}} grown leaf which has clasped an object {{for three or four}} days increases much in thickness, and after several weeks becomes so wonderfully hard and rigid that it can hardly be removed from its support. On comparing a thin transverse slice of such a petiole with one from an older leaf growing close beneath, which had not clasped anything, its diameter was found to be fully doubled, and its structure greatly changed. In two other petioles similarly compared, and here represented, the increase in diameter was not quite so great. In the section of the petiole in its ordinary state (A), we see a semilunar band of cellular tissue (not well shown in the woodcut) differing slightly in appearance from that outside it, and including three closely approximate groups of dark vessels. Near the upper surface of the petiole, beneath two exterior ridges, there are two other small circular groups of vessels. In the section of the petiole (B) which had clasped during several weeks a stick, the two exterior ridges have become much less prominent, and the two groups of woody vessels beneath them much increased in diameter. The semilunar band has been converted into a complete ring of very hard, white, woody tissue, with lines radiating from the centre. The three groups of vessels, which, though near together, were before distinct, are now completely blended. The upper part of this ring of woody vessels, formed by the prolongation of the horns of the original semilunar band, is narrower than the lower part, and slightly less compact. This petiole after clasping the stick had actually become thicker than the stem from which it arose; and this was chiefly due to the increased thickness of the ring of wood. This ring presented, both in a transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section,</b> a closely similar structure to that of the stem. It is a singular morphological fact that the petiole should thus acquire a structure almost identically the same with that of the axis; and it is a still more singular physiological fact that so great a change should have been induced by the mere act of clasping a support. {23} ...|$|E

40|$|Sampling schemes {{developed}} {{for use with}} a geometric model of rat small bowel are tested against a design-based scheme (vertical sectioning with cycloid test lines) which offers unbiased estimates of surface amplifications due to villi. The model-based methods comprise transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sectioning</b> coupled with putative correction factors. Comparisons are based on proximal, middle and distal segments of six small bowels. Transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>sections</b> through the same segments of each animal were analysed by conventional intersection counting (using straight test lines). Appropriate intersection ratios were multiplied by their respective correction factors in order to calculate surface amplifications. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>sections</b> were employed further as vertical sections and intersections were counted with cycloid arcs to obtain unbiased estimates of surface amplifications. Both model-based schemes (transverse and longitudinal) gave group mean values similar to those obtained by vertical sectioning. Therefore, {{the use of a}} geometric model in past studies on rat small bowel can now be justified on grounds of negligible bias...|$|R
60|$|The reader must {{observe that}} the great {{sturdiness}} of {{the form of the}} bars, 5, 9, 17, 24, 25, is a consequence of the peculiar office of Venetian traceries in supporting the mass of the building above, already noticed in Vol. II.; and indeed the forms of the Venetian Gothic are, in many other ways, influenced by the difficulty of obtaining stability on sandy foundations. One thing is especially noticeable in all their arrangements of traceries; namely, the endeavor to obtain equal and horizontal pressure along the whole breadth of the building, not the divided and local pressures of Northern Gothic. This object is considerably aided by the structure of the balconies, which are of great service in knitting the shafts together, forming complete tie-beams of marble, as well as a kind of rivets, at their bases. For instance, at b, Fig. II., is represented the masonry of the base of the upper arcade of the Ducal Palace, showing the root of one of its main shafts, with the binding balconies. The solid stones which form the foundation are much broader than the balcony shafts, so that the socketed arrangement is not seen: it is shown as it would appear in a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>section.</b> The balconies are not let into the circular shafts, but fitted to their circular curves, so as to grasp them, and riveted with metal; and the bars of stone which form the tops of the balconies are of great strength and depth, the small trefoiled arches being cut out of them as in Fig. III., so as hardly to diminish their binding power. In the lighter independent balconies they are often cut deeper; but in all cases the bar of stone is nearly independent of the small shafts placed beneath it, and would stand firm though these were removed, as at a, Fig. II., supported either by the main shafts of the traceries, or by its own small pilasters with semi-shafts at their sides, of the plan d, Fig. II., in a continuous balcony, and e at the angle of one.|$|E
