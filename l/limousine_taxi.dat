40|$|This project designs a {{small scale}} transit system that runs between five wineries in San Luis Obispo. San Luis Obispo County {{is known for its}} many wineries ranging up and down the central coast. Transportation options for wine tasters are limited to tour bus, <b>limousine,</b> <b>taxi,</b> and private cars. This does not leave an option for wine tasters who prefer a cheaper mode of {{transportation}} than limo, tour bus, or taxis, and do not want the hassle of driving and worrying about how much alcohol they consume. Selection criteria methods were used to choose bus stop locations at a specified number of wineries. In order to do this, a survey of Cal Poly students and surrounding wineries was taken and analyzed. Operations research techniques were used to select an optimal route for the bus that will reduce travel time and waiting time for passengers. Finally, a simulation verified the proposed solution and determined an optimal number of buses and ticket price. The final design is integrated with the San Luis Obispo Transit System by connecting with the Downtown Transit Center in the city. Five year projections show that implementation of this system will result in profits of $ 354, 829 while offering San Luis Obispo community members a safer, cheaper, more convenient way to wine taste...|$|E
40|$|What is {{decision}} making? Psychological {{research is}} often organized around particular tasks, such as {{problem solving and}} categorization. Decision making work has also historically taken this Decision Making 2 approach. Decision situations are generally defined as those in which the decision maker has some unsatisfied goal {{and a set of}} options that might satisfy the goal. The decision maker must then evaluate the options in some way and select one. For example, a business executive may fly to Chicago and have to get from the airport to a downtown hotel. There are many ways to get there, including <b>limousine,</b> <b>taxi,</b> shuttle, and train. These options differ in their comfort, convenience and price. Typically these attributes trade off, so that higher priced options provide greater comfort and convenience. The executive might be on an expense account, in which case comfort and convenience may be factored into the decision more heavily than price. The executive may choose to ride downtown by taxi and then implement this decision by standing on line and taking a taxi to the hotel. To bring these sorts of decision situations into the laboratory, researchers commonly focused on the goal of obtaining money, which they assume is shared across people. In the prototypical task, subjects are given choice options that differ in probability and amount. The use of gambles enabled researchers to explore decision making under risk. Often, a number of different choices are made in a single experimental session, and the pa tern of choices across sets is analyzed. For example, people might be asked whether they prefer a 45 % chance to win $ 200 or a 50 % chance to win $ 150. Later in the same session, they might be asked whether they prefer a 90 % chance to win $ 200 or a 100 % chance to win $ 150. At issue in studies like these is the consistency of people's choices. The analyses would involve an examination of whether the people who preferred the 45 % chance to win $ 200 also preferred the 90 % chance to win $ 200...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the state}} of Queensland, there is no legal {{requirement}} for a private vehicle's owner to have periodic vehicle inspections. The only time a vehicle inspection is mandatory is when a vehicle is being sold and must display a current Roadworthy Certificate (RWC) as an assurance to buyers that a vehicle meets minimum safety standards. Without a RWC, the vehicle can only be sold on an [...] "as-is" [...] basis, which does not entitle the vehicle to be lawfully driven on public roads or registered until a RWC is obtained. Heavy vehicles (e.g.: trucks) and public passenger vehicles (e.g.: <b>limousines,</b> <b>taxis,</b> public buses) have dedicated inspection schemes that must be complied with periodically, usually every 6-12 months.|$|R

50|$|The Traction Avant used a longitudinal, {{front-wheel drive}} layout, {{with the engine}} set well within the wheelbase, {{resulting}} in a very favourable weight distribution, aiding the car's advanced handling characteristics. The gearbox was placed {{at the front of}} the vehicle with the engine behind it and the differential between them, a layout shared with the later Renault 4 and 16 and first generation Renault 5 but the opposite way round to many longitudinal front-wheel drive cars, such as the Saab 96 and Renault 12 and 18 and most Audi models. The gear change was set in the dashboard, with the lever protruding through a vertical, H-shaped gate. Because this vertical orientation could have resulted in the car dropping out of gear when the lever was in the upper positions (i.e. second or reverse gears), the gear-shift mechanism was locked when the mechanical clutch was engaged and released when the clutch pedal was depressed. The result of this layout, along with pendant pedals, umbrella-type handbrake control and front bench seats, was a very spacious interior, with a flat and unobstructed floor. The low-slung arrangement also eliminated the need for running boards to step into or out of the vehicle. These features made them ideal for use as <b>limousines</b> and <b>taxi</b> cabs, and they were quite popular among drivers and passengers alike. Until 1953, black was the only colour available.|$|R
