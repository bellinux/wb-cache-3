500|$|In February 2006, Dan Ford, from Wareham in Dorset, {{received}} permanent scarring to {{his face}} after being sprayed with CS during an arrest by police. Ford was subsequently advised by doctors {{to stay out of}} sunlight for at least 12 months. After the incident, his cousin, Donna Lewis, was quoted as saying, [...] "To look at him, it was <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a melting man, with liquid oozing from his face." ...|$|E
500|$|In a February 21, 2015 {{interview}} with Billboard, Violent J stated that Mike E. Clark {{will not be}} producing either album due to prior engagements, which include working with Kid Rock, so they will have other people do the production. He also said that [...] "LOST" [...] will have darker beats, and no comedy on it. The album is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the world through negative lenses. He said that [...] "FOUND" [...] is like you have been found, and has songs about the good times, and songs with comedy. Also in the interview {{it was announced that}} the [...] "20th Anniversary Riddle Box Tour" [...] has been temporarily sidelined. They plan to tour in early spring into most of the summer, ending at the GOTJ 2015, then tour again ending at the annual Hallowicked concert.|$|E
500|$|Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Here I Stand" [...] {{a throwback}} to Stevie Wonder, and was {{disappointed}} that it was placed {{near the end of}} the parent album. USA Today Steve Jones noted the track as a highlight of the album. Joshua Alston from The A.V. Club wrote that the song [...] "lyrically and musically sounds more passionate and more adult than Usher ever has," [...] and called it a [...] "syrupy ballad". However, Blender Josh Eells called the [...] "chivalrous" [...] number [...] "sweet but taxing, <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> photos from someone else’s wedding," [...] while Jim Farber of the Daily News wrote that [...] "the [...] melody fails [...]" [...] The song ranked at number one on AOL Radio's list of top Usher songs. At the 51st Grammy Awards, [...] "Here I Stand" [...] was nominated for the Best Male R Vocal Performance award, but lost to Ne-Yo's [...] "Miss Independent" [...] from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{were pleased}} with the game's premise and setting, {{variously}} describing it as [...] "weird", [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "silly". [...] Hope Falls, especially the area of Creepy Hollow, was compared {{to the work of}} Tim Burton. [...] Dead Head Fred's graphics were warmly received, with GameSpy noting [...] "The game looks simply phenomenal on the PSP screen." [...] Pocket Gamer UK said [...] "graphically the game won't blow your head off but it is undeniably stylish." [...] Pocket Gamer also felt that the game's level design, with its emphasis on changing heads to solve environmental puzzles, made up for the [...] "mediocre combat system". [...] The character design was praised; GameSpy said [...] "Fred {{is one of the most}} interesting and entertaining characters to ever hit gaming," [...] and GameZone said [...] "Fred’s freakish form is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a car crash … you really don’t want to stare but you just can’t help it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kiyohiko Koike for Listenmusic {{felt the}} song was an [...] "aggressive number erupting all the band member's fervour" [...] created by aspects such as the [...] "quick beat, {{growling}} bass line and Ringo's freaky passionate voice". He felt {{the song was}} not a song you could call a single feeling it had an [...] "eccentric spirit of adventure", but praised Sheena {{being used as a}} resource by her bandmates in the production of a song, and felt that the [...] "mental aspects" [...] of the band had evolved. Hot Express reviewer Tetsuo Hiraga praised Sheena's [...] "charming" [...] vocals in the song, and felt as if the song were exploding from every direction. He believed that this [...] "broken" [...] Sheena had not been seen in her previous works before. CDJournal reviewers noted the song's structure, describing it as [...] "developing into a constantly changing song, as if many songs were in a single song." [...] Reviewer Naoko Saito was very positive on the song, praising the [...] "exploding tricky band sound", calling the song [...] "full of thrills and excitement, <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> something you shouldn't be". What's In? reviewers called the song a [...] "wild rock tune", noting its [...] "bewildering structure".|$|E

50|$|Windows can be intimidating {{because you}} don't know what's out there. But once you step through it, you're {{faced with this}} {{enormous}} amount of possibility. I never <b>liked</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> windows directly, because once I see one, I {{have to go through}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "We mustn’t {{quarrel with}} people’s opinions," [...] he said, at last. [...] "It’s a free country, {{and people can}} believe what they <b>like.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Protestants and Catholics, for instance; their belief isn’t the same, and yet I’ve known ’em to be staunch friends." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1891 {{postscript}} to The Civil War in France (1872) pamphlet, Friedrich Engels said: [...] "Well and good, gentlemen, do {{you want}} to know what this dictatorship <b>looks</b> <b>like?</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> the Paris Commune.

6000|$|... "That's right, my boy, nothing <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> matters cheerfully. You know, lad, how warmly {{all your}} old friends are with you. Would {{you like me}} to bring Charlie next time I come?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{the last}} thing I remember, {{wondering}} if you would. You seemed such miles and miles away. It was <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> something in a mist through {{the wrong end of}} a telescope. Oh, Kirk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{satisfied}} her {{by giving}} the small mummy a butterfly kiss, and then putting {{his hand on her}} shoulder and turning her face towards him, said, [...] "You <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the baby better than looking at your husband, you false one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} ask a {{barrister}} that question," [...] he answered, laughing; [...] "it is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the pictures which an artist {{has turned to}} the wall. No, to be frank, I have not. I have only taken to practising in earnest {{during the last two}} years. Before I was a barrister in name, and that is all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In a moment--with pleasure. I <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{her from}} here." [...] He ceased {{to look at}} her, however, very soon; his eyes {{constantly}} reverted to Mrs. Osmond. [...] "Do you know I was wrong just now in saying you had changed?" [...] he presently went on. [...] "You seem to me, after all, very much the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole--yes," [...] said Hirst. [...] "I like observing people. I <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> things. This {{country is}} amazingly beautiful.

60|$|Ashurst, {{full length}} on the {{horsehair}} sofa, and jutting far beyond its end, smoked a deeply-coloured pipe, {{and did not}} listen, thinking of the girl's face when she brought in a relay of cakes.

6000|$|... "Oh, various reasons. For one thing, {{although}} you SEE plenty of whites there, you can't understand any of them, hardly, {{and so you}} go about as hungry for talk as you do here. I <b>like</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a Russian or a German or an Italian--I even <b>like</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a Frenchman if I ever have the luck to catch him engaged in anything that ain't indelicate--but LOOKING don't cure the hunger--what you want is talk." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{could not}} shoot {{them down in}} cold blood, uncle. It is almost <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a village of human beings at work. One can shoot {{a man who is}} wanting to shoot you, without feeling much about it, but to fire at a man labouring in the fields is murder. Of course, if we wanted the flesh for food it would be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to think of him," [...] she said; [...] "his face does not tell me anything, it is <b>like</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a mask; but you see I am not {{accustomed}} to read brown men's characters, they are so different from Europeans, their faces all seem so impassive.

6000|$|Her heart {{died within}} her. Never had {{she felt so}} utterly strange and far-off.

6000|$|She knew he {{only wanted}} to play because he could sit nearer, joined by the evening paper over their knees, hand her the cards after dealing, touch her hand by accident, look in her face.
