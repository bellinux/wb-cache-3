It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines {{to take full}} advantage of the higher <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.|$|E

5|$|Since 1983, large festivals have {{required}} licences from local authorities.

5|$|After this, a pizza eating {{contest between}} WWE Tag Team Champions Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) {{occurred}} in the ring. Tazz was the host and Maria and Melina were the judges. In order to win the competition, one competitor had to eat more slices of pizza than the opponent in two minutes. Hardy finished two slices in the time <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> then proceeded to vomit on MVP, who didn't finish any, which won Hardy the competition.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their <b>limit,</b> <b>and</b> resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what they could find. They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the surfaces are both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the rule}} changes, {{there were still}} protesters among the spectators; {{in the first stage}} all riders except Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq {{punctured}} due to 125kg of nails spread along the road. The first stage was won by Louis Trousselier. Trousselier was serving the army, and had requested his commander leave for the Tour de France; this was allowed for 24 hours. After he won the first stage and led the classification, his leave was extended {{until the end of the}} Tour. From 60 starting cyclists, only 15 cyclists reached the finish line within the time limit; 15 more reached the finish after the <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> the rest took the train.|$|E

5|$|However if {{the white}} dwarf merges with another white dwarf (a very rare event), it will {{momentarily}} exceed the <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> begin to collapse, again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point. Within {{a few seconds of}} initiation of nuclear fusion, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} were {{to exceed the}} Chandrasekhar <b>limit,</b> <b>and</b> nuclear {{reactions}} did not take place, the pressure exerted by electrons {{would no longer be}} able to balance the force of gravity, and it would collapse into a denser object called a neutron star. Carbon-oxygen white dwarfs accreting mass from a neighboring star undergo a runaway nuclear fusion reaction, which leads to a Type Ia supernova explosion in which the white dwarf may be destroyed, before it reaches the limiting mass.|$|E

5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian <b>limit</b> <b>and</b> treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
