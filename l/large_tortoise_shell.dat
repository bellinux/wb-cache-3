50|$|The adarga was a {{traditional}} defense {{employed by the}} Moorish light horseman, who used it along with the lance. Throughout the 14th and 15th centuries the adarga was also used by Spanish Christian soldiers including their own light cavalry (la jineta), some of whom adopted Moorish fighting patterns. The adarga was in widespread use in Europe until the 16th century and the progress of firearms. The adarga continued to be used until the early 19th century by soldado de cuera in New Spain. These adargas were often decorated with the Spanish coat-of-arms. Some impressive examples of the adarga are preserved in the Royal Armoury of the Royal Palace of Madrid, while one unique example is made from a <b>large</b> <b>tortoise</b> <b>shell,</b> taken at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 from the Turks, and is preserved in the armory of the Mons Clara Monastery at Częstochowa, Poland. The majority of surviving adargas are highly ornamental with painted decoration and were used by Spanish nobles in tournament cavalry combat, particularly in the juego de las cañas ("game of canes"), a sport of the 16th and 17th centuries involving teams of horsemen who hurled javelins made of cane at one another {{that had to be}} dodged or deflected with the adarga, imitating past battles against the Moors.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of views about the origin. According to Nihon gaishi (unofficial history in Japan) written by Raisanyō in 1880s, in the second Siege of Jinju (1593), Toyotomi Hideyoshi {{commanded}} Katō Kiyomasa to invasion of Korea. Toyotomi Hideyoshi was a daimyo, warrior, general and politician of the Sengoku period in Japan and Katō Kiyomasa was famous liegeman of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The reason was Toyotomi Hideyoshi commanded to Korea twice is the breakdown in negotiations between Korea and Japan. In 1593 June, Katō Kiyomasa attacked the Jinju castle in Korea. When Ushi-oni was useful. Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier made a <b>tortoise</b> <b>shell</b> cart. Japanese soldier could hide by entering a <b>tortoise</b> <b>shell</b> cart so that they can save themselves for arrows and stones. As the result, Katō Kiyomasa and Japanese soldier attacked a behind castle and they could collapsed for castle. The <b>tortoise</b> <b>shell</b> cart was wrapped hard board and cowhide.
