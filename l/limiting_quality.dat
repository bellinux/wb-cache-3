50|$|Although not the {{intention}} of most parents, putting children {{in the middle of}} conflict is particularly detrimental. Examples of this are asking children to carry messages between parents, grilling children about the other parent's activities, and putting the other parent {{down in front of the}} children. Children involved in high-conflict divorce or custody cases can experience varying forms of parental alienation, which courts often consider to be a form of child abuse. Specific examples of parental alienation include brainwashing the child to cease their relationship with the other parent, telling the child that the other parent does not love them, teaching the child to call another adult by a parental name in effort to replace the other parent, limiting communication between the child and the other parent, and <b>limiting</b> <b>quality</b> time between the child and the other parent. If evidence reveals that a parent is actively alienating the child from their other parent, their case for custody can be severely damaged.|$|E

40|$|A common {{approach}} {{to the design of}} an acceptance sampling plan is to require that the operating characteristic (OC) curve should pass through two designated points that would fix the curve in accordance with a desired degree of discrimination. This paper presents a search procedure for the selection of double sampling inspection plans of type DSP - (0, 1) for specified two points on the OC curve, namely acceptance quality limit, producer's risk, <b>limiting</b> <b>quality</b> and consumer's risk. Selection of the plans is discussed for both the cases of fraction non-conforming and the number of non-conformities per unit.

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{acceptance}} sampling {{plans have been}} developed 80 years ago, a number of selection principles have emerged. The majority of these principles are characterised {{by the fact that}} they look upon producer and consumer as two opposing parties. However, in many occasions, e. g., in final inspection, producer and consumer represent the same party and, therefore, the used sampling plan should not make an attempt to discriminate between their interests. In this case, the interest is to avoid wrong decisions, i. e., reject product of sufficient quality and accept product of insufficient quality. Thus, the natural objective in these cases is to use overall risk for a wrong decision as optimisation criteria. Optimum result can be arrived further by the weighted Poisson distribution. In this paper, a table and procedure are given for finding the tightened-normal-tightened system involving minimum sum of producer's and consumer's risks for specified acceptable quality level and <b>limiting</b> <b>quality</b> level using the weighted Poisson distribution. This is the case with the tightened-normal-tightened system for given acceptable quality level and <b>limiting</b> <b>quality</b> level involving minimum risks using the weighted Poisson distribution. acceptable quality level; AQL; attribute plan; <b>limiting</b> <b>quality</b> level; tightened-normal-tightened system; weighted Poisson distribution; acceptance sampling plans; minimum risks...|$|E
