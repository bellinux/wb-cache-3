40|$|The Centaur is a high-energy rocket used as {{a second}} stage to the Atlas launch vehicle. The Centaur is cryogenically fueled, using liquid {{hydrogen}} and liquid oxygen, and requires insulation to prevent fuel boiloff prior to launch. The original insulation system used on Centaur {{is a set of}} fiberglass honeycomb panels, which are jettisoned after <b>launch.</b> These <b>panels</b> are still used on the Atlas I version of Atlas/Centaur...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "War Of The Gods, Parts One And Two", the charismatic miracle worker Count Iblis {{promises}} to Adama {{that he will}} deliver [...] "the enemy", meaning Baltar, to the Colonials. Baltar, irritated that {{neither he nor his}} Cylon crew can explain the mysterious lights dogging his basestar, transmits a direct message to the Galactica requesting permission to board on a proposal of [...] "universal truce". Adama instead seizes the opportunity to capture Baltar and his Raider, and have him tried by the Council for crimes against humanity, of which he is soon found guilty. For the remainder of the series, Baltar is a prisoner on board the Colonial prison barge. The episode [...] "Baltar's Escape" [...] features an attempt by Baltar and other imprisoned villains (Borellian Nomen and some Eastern Alliance officers) to escape from the prison barge. All do escape except for an overconfident Baltar, who witnesses a (cleverly exploited) malfunction in his re-activated Centurions which makes them destroy his Raider's <b>launch</b> <b>panel</b> instead of starting it, allowing the Galactica's people to re-apprehend him with little struggle.|$|R
2500|$|In June 2009, Quinn <b>launched</b> a <b>panel,</b> {{chaired by}} Abner Mikva, to {{investigate}} unethical practices at the University of Illinois amid fears that a prior investigation would be ineffective in instituting necessary reforms. The panel {{was charged with}} searching the admissions practices, amid reports that the public university {{was a victim of}} [...] corruption. The panel found evidence of favoritism and its investigation culminated in the resignation of all but two University trustees.|$|R
50|$|Sinosat-2 {{was based}} on the DFH-4 bus. It was {{launched}} at 16:20 GMT on 28 October 2006, also using a Long March 3B. After <b>launch,</b> its solar <b>panels</b> and communications antenna failed to deploy, making the satellite unusable.|$|R
50|$|In Latin America, {{after the}} first Secodip <b>panel</b> <b>launch</b> in Argentina in 1996, a {{partnership}} between IBOPE and NDP <b>launched</b> another new <b>panel</b> in Chile in 1998. In 2000, IBOPE, NPD and TNS created the LatinPanel joint venture, representing the existing Brazil, Argentina and Chile operations. The acquisition of Samimp added the existing panels in Peru and Bolivia to LatinPanel in 2002. In 2004 TNS acquired two additional companies, Data in Central America and CIMA in Colombia and Venezuela, bringing their consumer panels into the regional network. Finally, Ecuador and Mexico panels were also built and launched in 2004 and 2005 respectively, consolidating LatinPanel business in the region. In 2007 TNS became owner of LatinPanel to bring together the Latin American network with Worldpanel in other regions.|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2004 SAE International Loop Heat Pipe (LHP) Technology {{has become}} an {{accepted}} technology for thermal management of spacecraft. Despite {{the acceptance of the}} technology, there remains a lack of understanding about how to analyze these devices, creating the myth that inadequate tools exist for modeling LHPs and CPLs (capillary pumped loops). LHPs are two-phase devices with a very tight thermal coupling to their environment. Consequently these systems must be modeled in a manner capable of capturing both thermal and fluid behavior. Over the past decade various programs have been written to model LHPs and CPLs, however the majority of them have been either design-specific or focused on capturing a specific behavior within the system. SINDA/FLUINT is a thermal/fluid modeling code fully capable of capturing both heat transfer and fluid dynamics of an LHP. In addition it provides the flexibility to model any portion of the system in as much or as little detail as needed. Unfortunately, the perception that FLUINT is too difficult to learn has precluded many engineers and technologists from learning how to model LHPs. A recently developed Application Programming Interface (API) provides a means of launching and controlling SINDA/FLUINT from a separate stand-alone software program. To support the analysis needs of engineers who are interested in evaluating LHPs and performing system level studies, but who do not have the resources required become fluent with SINDA/FLUINT, a Microsoft Excel-based front end has been developed using this API. The resulting LHP <b>Launch</b> Control <b>Panel</b> is a simple Excel-based user interface requiring no knowledge of SINDA/FLUINT nor any need to purchase licenses if no changes are required to the underlying model. This paper will provide an overview of the LHP <b>Launch</b> Control <b>Panel,</b> discuss typical analysis results, and provide some guidelines on bracketing the LHP performance for stochastic phenomena such as evaporator core state. In addition it will provide information for the advanced user on how to further customize the tool for their needs. The Excel-based LHP model is available in a licensed or unlicensed SINDA/FLUINT mode...|$|R
50|$|Five {{minutes after}} liftoff, the Atlas and Agena-Mariner separated, {{followed}} by the first Agena burn and second Agena burn. The Agena-Mariner separation injected the Mariner 2 spacecraft into a geocentric escape hyperbola at 26 minutes 3 seconds after liftoff. The NASA NDIF tracking station at Johannesburg, South Africa, acquired the spacecraft about 31 minutes after <b>launch.</b> Solar <b>panel</b> extension was completed approximately 44 minutes after launch. The Sun lock acquired the Sun about 18 minutes later. The high-gain antenna was extended to its acquisition angle of 72°. The output of the solar panels was slightly above the predicted output. As all subsystems were performing normally, as the battery was fully charged, and the solar panels were providing adequate power, {{the decision was made}} on August 29 to turn on cruise science experiments. On September 3, the Earth acquisition sequence was initiated, and Earth lock was established 29 minutes later.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{increasing}} population, {{the natural resources}} are becoming extinct. People started to search for alternative resource that can generate electricity and solar panels are one among them. Solar panels convert the sun’s energy to electricity. The performance of panels is to be tested before they are <b>launched.</b> Replacing a <b>panel</b> to test involves {{a lot of money}} and time. This project helps the user to predict the efficiency of the Solar panel and choose a best efficient panel to their climatic conditions. Here we consider three conditions Temperature, Irradiance and Wind Speed...|$|R
