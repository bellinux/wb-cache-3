50|$|Hypera nigrirostris, {{commonly}} known as the <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> is a species of weevil that is native to Europe and northern Africa and has been introduced to North America and Japan. Both adults and larvae feed on red clover and other plants in the Fabaceae family.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> is an oligophage, {{limited to}} certain {{plants in the}} legume family. Its main hosts are red clover (Trifolium pratense), white clover (T. repens) and alsike clover (T. hybridum), {{but it can also}} feed on pea, alfalfa and vetch. Adults chew holes in leaves and create hollows in stems, while the larvae target the buds and flowers, each larva {{damaging}} some three or four inflorescences.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 3 to 4 mm. The rostrum or beak is three times {{as long as it}} is broad, and is notched at its base. The eyes are large, {{transverse}} and non-protuberant. The frons is narrower than the rostrum while the pronotum is broad. The proximal ends of the elytra have parallel sides and bear prominent humeral humps. The general colour of the insect is black, with a reddish tinge to the legs and antennae. The pronotum has a greenish-gold sheen and the elytra have a greenish metallic appearance, both being the result of the presence of dissected scales.|$|E
40|$|In 1991, {{there has}} been a lot of concern about the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> in alfalfa in eastern Nebraska. Many farmers in the eastern one-third of the state {{experienced}} problems with the regrowth of alfalfa after the first cutting in 1990, caused by the feeding of the adult of this insect. This NebFact discusses the difference between the alfalfa <b>weevil</b> and the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> and to control them in the field(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} from 1990 through 1992 to determine consumption rates and feeding duration of adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils,</b> Hypera punctata (F.), {{to characterize the}} injury potential of this species during alfalfa regrowth. Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion. The peak consumption rate occurred ~ 5 d after adult emergence. Because the highest consumption rates and the greatest percentage of defoliation were within the first 11 d of emergence, adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils</b> potentially can delay regrowth of alfalfa stubble when adult emergence coincides with the 1 st harvest. Further, because adult consumption patterns between <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils</b> and alfalfa weevils are similar, alfalfa stubble defoliation thresholds developed for alfalfa weevils and cutworms {{also can be used}} for <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils.</b> Injury equivalents (injury by 1 species in terms of another species) are determined for adult <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils,</b> larval variegated cutworm, Peridroma saucia (Hubner), and larval and adult alfalfa weevils, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) ...|$|R
50|$|Hypera zoilus (syn. H. punctata), {{commonly}} known as the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> is a species of weevil that can be found in clover fields throughout North America and Europe. It is typically brown in color and 5-9 mm in length.|$|R
40|$|Low {{respiration}} rates, immobility, lack of feeding, and undeveloped reproductive systems confirmed {{a summer}} diapause in the overwintered and current-year adults of the clover leaf weevil, Hypera punctata, and <b>lesser</b> <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> Hypera nigrirostris. The prolonged summer diapause and extended winters in Wisconsin set strict {{limitations on the}} available time for damaging populations to develop on red clover, Trifolium pratense thus assuring the status of these weevils as minor pests...|$|E
40|$|The <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hypera punctata F.) is a {{sporadic}} {{but potentially}} serious pest of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Feeding of newly emerged adult fourth instar <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> was simulated {{in a field}} study at the University of Nebraska Haskell Agricultural Research Lab near Concord, Nebraska, in May 2001 and 2002. Twelve 1 - by 1 -m plots were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three treatments and four replications. Treatments consisted of two levels of simulated <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> defoliation of alfalfa and an undefoliated check. Leaflets were removed over 10 d. Dry matter yield and other plant responses were measured {{during the first two}} growth cycles. Yield differences among all three treatments were significant for the first growth cycle. The relationship be-tween percentage defoliation and percentage yield reduction was linear both years. Defoliation did not significantly affect percentages of acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and protein. Alfalfa development also was not significantly affected in the second growth cycle. Dry matter yield reduction as a result of leaf removal at the early bud stage was the most important effect of first growth cycle defoliation...|$|R

50|$|The {{alfalfa weevil}} grows to {{a length of}} about 4 to 5.5 mm. The rostrum or beak is short and broad. The frons is half {{as wide as the}} rostrum while the pronotum is {{broadest}} in the centre. The general colour of the insect is brown, with a dark mid-dorsal stripe. The larva has a distinctive black head and no legs; it is yellowish-green, with a white dorsal stripe and faint white lateral stripes. It is about 1 cm long just before pupation. It pupates in a white, pea-sized cocoon made of loosely-woven silk. It resembles the <b>clover</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> (Hypera punctata), but that species is nearly twice as large, the larvae have tan heads and they seldom cause much damage to alfalfa crops.|$|R
