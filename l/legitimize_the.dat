5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic {{community}} and Jewish groups in the United States and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli-occupied territories. When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{liberate}} Talcahuano {{was followed by}} naval reinforcements from the North. The viceroy of Peru sent Mariano Osorio {{in an attempt to}} reconquer Chile. The royalists would then advance by land to the northern Chile. San Martín thought that {{it was not possible to}} defend Concepción, so he ordered O'Higgins to leave the city. 50,000 Chileans took cattle and grain and moved north, burning everything else, so that they did not leave supplies for the royalists. As he had done with the Tucumán Congress, San Martín urged a declaration of independence, to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> government and the military actions. The Chilean Declaration of Independence was issued on 18 February 1818, one year after the battle of Chacabuco.|$|E

5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an easy task. Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E

25|$|Authors such as Hannah Arendt, in her 1951 book The Origins of Totalitarianism, {{have said}} that the racist {{ideology}} (popular racism) which developed {{at the end of the}} 19th century helped <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> imperialist conquests of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the Herero and Namaqua Genocide of 1904–1907 or the Armenian Genocide of 1915–1917). Rudyard Kipling's poem The White Man's Burden (1899) is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the European culture over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The Shah advertised the White Revolution as a {{step towards}} westernization and was a {{way for him to}} <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for {{launching}} the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped {{to get rid of the}} landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.|$|E

In exchange for Russian support against forces loyal to the ousted Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, he agreed to join the Commonwealth of Independent States and <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> Russian military bases in Georgia: Vaziani Military Base, Gudauta, Akhalkalaki and Batumi.|$|E
25|$|According to critic Roger Ebert, both {{executive}} producer Darryl F. Zanuck and director John Ford were odd choices {{to make this}} film because both were considered politically conservative. Zanuck was nervous about the left-wing political views of the novel, especially the ending. Due to the red-baiting common to the era, Darryl Zanuck sent private investigators to Oklahoma to help him <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> film.|$|E
25|$|The Cancelleria Reliefs depict {{events from}} the life of Domitian and the history of the Flavian dynasty, which was founded by Domitian's father Vespasian in 69 AD.

As a source of historical information, the reliefs are thought to have been part of a propaganda effort to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> rule of the Flavian dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Members of the Uranverein, Wolfgang Finkelnburg, Werner Heisenberg, Carl Ramsauer, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker were {{effective}} in countering {{the politicization of}} academia and effectively {{putting an end to}} the influence of the Deutsche Physik movement. However, in order to do this they were, as were many scientists, caught between autonomy and accommodation. Essentially, they would have to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> National Socialist system by compromise and collaboration.|$|E

25|$|Aspects of {{propaganda}} {{can be traced}} back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> state and the policies of leaders. The CPC successfully made use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population.|$|E

25|$|Bloodletting was the ritualized self-cutting or {{piercing}} of an individual's {{body that}} served {{a number of}} ideological and cultural functions within ancient Mesoamerican societies, in particular the Maya. When performed by ruling elites, the act of bloodletting was crucial {{to the maintenance of}} sociocultural and political structure. Bound within the Mesoamerican belief systems, bloodletting was used as a tool to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> ruling lineage's socio-political position and, when enacted, was important to the perceived well-being of a given society or settlement.|$|E
25|$|Around 1270, a new dynasty was {{established}} in the Abyssinian highlands under Yekuno Amlak who deposed the last of the Zagwe kings and married one of his daughters. According to legends, the new dynasty were male-line descendants of Aksumite monarchs, now recognized as the continuing Solomonic dynasty (the kingdom being thus restored to the biblical royal house). This legend was created to <b>legitimize</b> <b>the</b> Solomonic dynasty and was written down in the 14th century in the Kebra Negast, an account of the origins of the Solomonic dynasty.|$|E

His influence on the Salafi movement was large, {{and most of the}} prominent judges and religious scholars of Saudi Arabia today are former students of his.|$|E
