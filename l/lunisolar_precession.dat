5|$|The {{orientation}} of Earth's axis and equator are not fixed in space, but rotate about the poles of the ecliptic with {{a period of}} about 26,000 years, a process known as <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession,</b> as it is due mostly to the gravitational effect of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. Likewise, the ecliptic itself is not fixed. The gravitational perturbations of the other bodies of the Solar System cause a much smaller motion of the plane of Earth's orbit, and hence of the ecliptic, known as planetary precession. The combined action of these two motions is called general precession, and changes the position of the equinoxes by about 50 arc seconds (about 0.014°) per year.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession,</b> {{the actions of}} the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about 174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so-called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of 0.47 seconds of arc per year (more than a hundred times smaller than <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession).</b> The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.|$|E
25|$|With {{improvements}} {{in the ability to}} calculate the gravitational force between and among planets {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as 1863, while the dominant component was named <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession.</b> Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lunisolar</b> <b>precession</b> {{is caused}} by the {{gravitational}} forces of the Moon and Sun on Earth's equatorial bulge, causing Earth's axis to move with respect to inertial space. Planetary precession (an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane (the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. <b>Lunisolar</b> <b>precession</b> is about 500 times greater than planetary precession. In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in 2006 the International Astronomical Union recommended that the dominant component be renamed, the precession of the equator, and the minor component be renamed, precession of the ecliptic, but their combination is still named general precession. Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the above}} {{explanation}} involved the Sun, the same explanation {{holds true for}} any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession.</b> In addition to the steady progressive motion (resulting in a full circle in about 25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the nutation. The most important term has a period of 18.6 years and an amplitude of 9.2.|$|E

50|$|Axial {{precession}} is {{the movement}} of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the precession of the equinoxes, <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession,</b> or precession of the equator. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both equatorial coordinates and ecliptic longitude. Over this cycle, Earth's north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of Polaris, in a circle around the ecliptic pole, with an angular radius of about 23.5°.|$|E

50|$|Earth's {{precession}} was historically {{called the}} precession of the equinoxes, because the equinoxes moved westward along the ecliptic {{relative to the}} fixed stars, opposite to the yearly motion of the Sun along the ecliptic. This term is still used in non-technical discussions, that is, when detailed mathematics are absent. Historically, {{the discovery of the}} precession of the equinoxes is usually attributed in the west to the Hellenistic-era (2nd century BC) astronomer, Hipparchus, although there are claims of its earlier discovery, such as in the Indian text, Vedanga Jyotisha, dating from 700 BC.With improvements in the ability to calculate the gravitational force between and among planets {{during the first half of}} the nineteenth century, it was recognized that the ecliptic itself moved slightly, which was named planetary precession, as early as 1863, while the dominant component was named <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession.</b> Their combination was named general precession, instead of precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

All of the distant (r more than 0. 2 kpc) stars of the Hipparcos catalog {{have been found to}} rotate around the Galactic y axis with an angular velocity of - 0. 36 +- 0. 09 mas/year. One of the causes of this rotation may be an uncertainty in the <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession</b> constant adopted when constructing the ICRS. In this case? the correction to the IAU (1976) <b>lunisolar</b> <b>precession</b> constant in longitude is shown to be - 3. 26 +- 0. 10 mas/yr. Based on the TRC catalog, we have determined the main Oort constants: A = 14. 9 +- 1. 0 and B = - 10. 8 +- 0. 3 km/s/kpc. The component of the model that describes the rotation of all TRC stars around the Galactic y axis is nonzero for all magnitudes, My= - 0. 86 +- 0. 11 mas/yr...|$|E
