25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then cut into small pieces and wrapped with fresh <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves,</b> with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings. The suffix gui is often omitted in the names of meat-based gui such as galbi, the name of which was originally galbi gui.|$|E
25|$|Cebiche, several {{historical}} sources {{claim that}} this dish originated about 2000 {{years ago in the}} ancient Moche culture. which had its capital south of the city of Trujillo. The dish is prepared using 5 basic ingredients: fish fillet cut in chunks with lemon, onion, salt and chili or chili Moche. The dish is added to a variety of ingredients to taste, one result of this combination is mixed cebiche. Fish that can be used are very diverse and include species of both freshwater and sea, also includes other seafood such as shellfish and seaweed and even vegetables. The dish can be accompanied by products such as sweet potatoes, boiled corn, cassava, <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves,</b> roasted corn, etc. According to historical sources Peruvian ceviche had originated first in the Moche culture on the coast of its present territory for over two thousand years. Different chronicles report that along the Peruvian coast was consumed fish with salt and chili. This dish has been declared National Cultural Heritage by the Peruvian government.|$|E

500|$|As {{described}} around 50 AD, <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves</b> {{were often}} cooked and {{served by the}} Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, {{as well as the}} method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves. Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil. Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads, with a dressing that includes anchovies and eggs. <b>Lettuce</b> <b>leaves</b> can also be found in soups, sandwiches and wraps, while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked. The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, [...] "salads" [...] were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys. Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.|$|E

Fearing to ask any more advice, {{she did her}} best alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus {{for an hour and}} was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves.</b> The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.|$|E

40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} {{commercial}} doses of the fungicide, Mancozeb, on the photosynthetic apparatus of <b>lettuce</b> young <b>leaves</b> (YL) and expanded leaves (EL). Seven days after Mancozeb application, chlorophyll a fluorescence, pigment contents, lipid peroxidation, and proline content were evaluated. Independently of leaf age, Mancozeb treatment reduced the efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry, increased the nonphotochemical quenching and proline content, decreased pigment contents, and induced lipid peroxidation. Moreover, EL showed a more stable photosynthetic apparatus, less prone to oxidative damages compared with YL.

The scientists' crops resulted in 40 micrograms of miraculin per gram of <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves,</b> which was considered a large amount. Two grams of <b>lettuce</b> <b>leaves</b> produced roughly {{the same amount of}} miraculin as in one miracle fruit berry.|$|E
