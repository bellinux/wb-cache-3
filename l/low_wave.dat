Methods A total of 33 healthy subjects from China Rehabilitation Research Center were enrolled in this study. Based on the median value (17 score) of Ford Insomnia Response to Stress Test-Chinese Version (FIRST-C), they were divided into 2 groups: 16 cases of high stress-related sleep vulnerability and 17 cases of low stress-related sleep vulnerability. Multi-parameter physiological indexes monitoring system of Thought Technology Ltd. was used to gather physiological indicators [blood volume pulse (BVP), skin temperature, skin conduction, respiration rate, respiration amplitude and heart rate], and brain wave [δ <b>wave,</b> θ <b>wave,</b> <b>low</b> α <b>wave</b> and high α wave, α wave, sensory - motor rhythm (SMR), <b>low</b> β <b>wave</b> and high β wave].   Results Compared with low vulnerability subjects, high vulnerability subjects had significantly higher skin conduction (P = 0. 003, 0. 001), amplitude of SMR (P = 0. 015, 0. 031) and <b>low</b> β <b>wave</b> (P = 0. 000, 0. 001) before and after treatment, while had significantly increased high β wave after treatment (P = 0. 004). After treatment, all subjects had significantly reduced BVP (P = 0. 000), increased skin temperature (P = 0. 000), increased respiration rate (P = 0. 008) and reduced heart rate (P = 0. 000). Compared with before treatment, high vulnerability subjects had significantly reduced skin conduction (P = 0. 001), respiratory amplitude (P = 0. 032), high α wave (P = 0. 017)  and <b>low</b> β <b>wave</b> (P = 0. 013) after treatment. Compared with before treatment, low vulnerability subjects had significantly reduced skin conduction (P = 0. 039), <b>low</b> α <b>wave</b> (P = 0. 035), high α wave (P = 0. 031), α wave (P = 0. 044) and <b>low</b> β <b>wave</b> (P = 0. 015) after treatment.   Conclusions Both physiological and cortical hyperarousal are presented in people with high stress-related sleep vulnerability in resting state.

40|$|In {{tropical}} seas, many platform reefs {{are found}} with nearly elliptical or circular shapes submerged just below {{mean sea level}} (MSL). Coral cays/ islands form on top of these reefs, possibly {{as a result of}} wave refraction, wave-generated currents and sediment transport. Due to climate change and human interventions these diverse, but vulnerable ecosystems are at risk of disappearing. It is therefore of interest to understand how coral cays form. In a previous study, a ray tracing model was used to simulate the process of waves refracting into energy convergence zones (ECZ), where sediment may accumulate and cays may form. In this thesis the advanced numerical wave, flow and sediment transport model XBeach, is employed to examine the effect of additional processes on the formation of coral cays, such as wave breaking, bottom friction and advection of sediment by wave-generated flow. Model simulations are performed for cases of <b>low</b> and high <b>waves</b> and of <b>low</b> and high tidal levels. In the case of <b>low</b> <b>waves,</b> the numerical model reproduces the ECZs as found in previous work. However, on elliptical platforms a secondary low energy convergence zone is not reproduced. The absence of this secondary ECZ on the elliptical platform is likely, due to the absence of diffraction in the model. <b>Low</b> <b>waves</b> together with the wave-generated flow are not able to mobilise the coarse sediment. When the wave height is large, most of the energy dissipates close to the reef-edge, such that {{only a fraction of the}} remaining energy flux convergences. However in contrast to the case of <b>low</b> <b>waves</b> sediment is transported to the ECZ. The driving mechanism behind the wave-generated flow that induces sediment transport is the divergence in radiation stress by wave dissipation balanced by the wave-induced water level gradient and bed friction. During high tidal levels the wave-induced set-up is small, but significant during MSL and low tidal levels. For high tidal levels and at MSL the spatial erosion and sedimentation patterns are relative similar, but the intensity is larger during high tide. The conditions in the surf zone during low tidal levels are complex and need further study...|$|R

50|$|A superficially related {{concept is}} the Whitcomb area rule, {{which states that}} wave drag due to volume in {{transonic}} flow depends primarily {{on the distribution of}} total cross-sectional area, and for <b>low</b> <b>wave</b> drag this distribution must be smooth. A common misconception is that the Sears-Haack body has the ideal area distribution according to the area rule, but this is not correct.

40|$|Our recent {{method to}} {{calculate}} renormalized functional determinants, the partial wave cutoff method, is extended {{for the evaluation}} of 4 -D fermion one-loop effective action with arbitrary mass in certain types of radially symmetric, non-Abelian, background gauge fields (including instanton-like and instanton-antiinstanton-like configurations). A detailed study on functional determinants for matrix-valued radial differential operators is presented, explicating both our analytic treatment on the high partial wave contribution and the application of the generalized Gel'fand-Yaglom formula to determine the <b>low</b> partial <b>wave</b> contribution. In general, some numerical work is needed for the <b>low</b> partial <b>wave</b> part. In the massless limit, however, the factorizable nature of our partial-wave radial differential operators can be exploited to evaluate semi-analytically even the <b>low</b> partial <b>wave</b> part, and we thus have the full fermion effective action calculated explicitly in a class of non-Abelian background gauge fields. With nonzero mass, we also perform necessary numerical analysis as regards the <b>low</b> partial <b>wave</b> contribution to produce numerically exact results for the massive effective action. Comparing these against the results of the large mass expansion, the validity range of the large mass expansion is addressed. Also studied is the fermion mass dependence of the effective instanton-antiinstanton interaction. Comment: 50 pages, 11 figures, revtex, fig 10 replace...|$|R
