It does not kill target cells but rather silences or inhibits them.

In this process, we have called tumor vessel abnormalization, the co-administered chemotherapeutic drug, melphalan or liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil), can traverse more easily from the blood circulation into the surrounding tumor tissue. This increased intratumoral drug accumulation ultimately results in an improved tumor response...|$|R
