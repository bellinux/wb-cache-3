The main technical {{parameters of the}} modified loader are described. The feasibility of the application and major programme of the FlexRay communication protocol in full electric <b>driven</b> <b>loader</b> are discussed. Finally, the corresponding designing and controlling schemes are given to the main controller and minor controller, the design plan for th...|$|R
40|$|A {{circuit of}} the {{front-end}} <b>loader</b> hydraulic <b>drive</b> {{has been developed}} and {{it is based on}} a counterbalance valve, which provides load fixation in a certain position, proportional speed control and energy saving due to the load lowering under its own weight. Mathematical models of the <b>loader</b> boom hydraulic <b>drive</b> has been elaborated and the solutions have been obtained in MATLAB Simulink environment. The mathematical model takes into account pressure losses of the counterbalance valve, the results of computer simulation of the loader boom inertia moment and hydrodynamic force at the main spool of the counter-balance valve, calculated using Autodesk software product. Optimization criterion has been developed and optimal design parameters are found...|$|R

Rover (the security of the Village) deflates and is destroyed (to the accompaniment of [...] "I, Yi, Yi, Yi, Yi (I Like You Very Much)") upon exposure to the flames of the rocket's exhaust.|$|R
50|$|In {{the time}} from 1957 to 1958, a special {{department}} for industrial and construction machines was set up. It caused a sensation, when Kramer introduced in 1968 the first German wheel <b>loader</b> with four-wheel <b>drive</b> and equal sized tires. A lot other four-wheel steered machines followed this example.|$|R

After attempting to go out along [...] "the low road"—Bluff Creek Road—and finding it blocked by a mudslide, they went instead up the steep Onion Mountain Road, off whose shoulder their truck slipped; extracting it required the (unauthorized) borrowing of a nearby front-end <b>loader.</b> The <b>drive</b> home from their campsite covered about 580 miles, the initial 28.8 miles on a low-speed logging road, and then about 110 miles on twisty Route 96. Driving a truck with three horses, and allowing for occasional stops, it would have taken 13 hours to get home Saturday evening, at an average speed of 45mph; it would have taken 14.5 hours at a 40mph average speed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{characteristics}} of high fluctuation and periodicity of output power during working process of wheel <b>loader,</b> hybrid <b>drive</b> technology can provide a solution for fuel saving and fuel reduction of wheel loader through power adjustment function and energy recycle feature. Aiming at power output motion of wheel loader duty cycle, 7 means for hybrid wheel loader to save fuel have been proposed; contribution to save fuel and easiness to realize the goal under current technical conditions of each means has also been assessed. It is considered that there are two categories of wheel loader energy saving technology: one is to increase fuel utilization rate, and the other is improve transmission efficiency of torque converter. However, realizing one of these two aspects can not save fuel ideally; improvement in both aspects will bring satisfactory energy materials saving effects...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{show that}} {{instruction}} manuals are rarely read, and Volvo CE often finds the manual in the bookshelf {{at the office}} at customer visits. The instruction books are thus far from the users. How will information reach users? In this study I have worked with Volvo CE, Eskilstuna based on the question "How can information about how best driving economy be achieved and be designed to motivate drivers of wheel <b>loaders</b> to <b>drive</b> fuel efficiently?". Based on literature studies, interviews, analyzes and hearings, a prototype with accompanying concepts has been developed for Volvo CE for continued development. The prototype consists of a design where three factors that affect fuel efficient driving have been selected and constructed. The elements are text and image-based and then placed in an ECO OPERATOR program in the Volvo CE Co-pilot. Volvo CE already works with information via Co-pilot, which is a display located in the wheel loaders cab. Conclusions are that human centered design where the user is put in focus {{can be used to}} generate fuel efficient driving information adapted for wheel loaders...|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{computer}} with one operating system per storage device is a dual-booting computer that stores Windows on one disk drive and Linux on another disk drive. In this case a multi-booting boot loader is not strictly necessary because the user can choose to enter BIOS configuration immediately after power-up and make the desired drive first in the boot-order list. However, {{it is more convenient}} to have a multi-booting boot loader on one of the drives, set BIOS once to always start booting from (i.e., load the boot <b>loader</b> from) that <b>drive,</b> and then allow the user to choose an operating system from that boot loader's menu. No special disk partitioning is necessary when each operating system has its own dedicated disk drive.|$|R
40|$|Universal {{educational}} and research stand {{was developed for}} analyzing an electrical drive’s behavior with different load disturbance effects. Major components of the stand are two electrical drives with rigidly coupled shafts. As a result, first electrical <b>drive</b> (<b>loader)</b> has a capability to imitate effects of different loading types to another one (trial drive). Control software for the stand is developed. It allows us to combine a variety of loading types and change parameters of current loading such as joint moment, damping, additional inertia, and external torque. Also there is a capability to imitate effects of elasticity and backlash of mechanical transmissions. The paper considers the main challenge of creating the given system, i. e. discretization with a variable step. Some methods to decrease its negative effects on system stability are suggested. The given system allows to change loading parameters more rapidly and in a wider range as compared to a system with real mechanical outfit. These stands are currently used for laboratory classes within the course “Electrical robotic drives” at SM 7 department in Bauman Moscow State Technical University. Also the system of interdepended stands for semi-realistic simulation of manipulation systems is under development. </p...|$|R
