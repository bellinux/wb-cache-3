40|$|Abstract: Despite {{being one}} of the fastest growing {{alternative}} fuel sources, little attention has been given to control of the air fuel ratio at the point of combustion in <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) <b>engines.</b> In this paper a mean value engine model is presented for LPG throttle body injected engines.

5000|$|Since {{natural gas}} (methane) {{has long been}} a clean, economical, and readily {{available}} fuel, many industrial engines are either designed or modified to use gas, as distinguished from gasoline.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate and compare the performance and emission characteristics of the <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG) -fuelled <b>engine</b> generator and the conventional gasoline-fuelled engine generator. The approach involves converting a gasoline engine generator, commonly used in Malaysian night markets to generate electricity, to the LPG engine generator. A four-stroke SI single-cylinder engine is equipped with an LPG injection system with minor modifications and then tested with both LPG and gasoline fuels. A venturi mixer (carburettor) was designed and in house constructed and then installed to deliver a proper A/F ratio to the combustion chamber. The commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT was used for simulation of air flow inside the mixer. The converted engine was tested at constant speed for its brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), efficiency, exhaust temperature, and exhaust gas emissions. The results show that the performance and emission characteristics of the LPG-fuelled engine are well suited for use in night markets. Average BSFC and average efficiency for the LPG engine over a range of loads were quite similar to those for the gasoline engine: the average BSFC was 0. 95 kg/kWh for the LPG engine and 1 kg/kWh for the gasoline engine. The lower energy content of LPG causes only a slight reduction in efficiency as 17 per cent reduction in average efficiency was recorded over the entire load range; however, the LPG engine fared better at higher loads than the gasoline engine for which only as low as 4 per cent reduction was recorded at high loads. Emission testsseemto verify the minimal pollution products; there are significant reductions in the emission concentration results when LPG is used. Average decreases of 32 per cent for nitrogen oxide, 10 per cent for carbon dioxide, and 40 per cent for carbon monoxide were recorded. However, higher values of hydrocarbon were recorded, but as high as 50 per cent reduction in HC was found for loads higher than 700 W. The study verified the more favourable features ofLPGcompared to gasoline as it is one of the best alternative fuels to gasoline for spark-ignition engine generators to solve the air pollution problem in night markets...|$|R

In the first stage, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in all six countries increased with household expenditure and the highest level of education attained by female and male household members. Electricity connection increased, and engagement in agriculture and increasing household size decreased, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in five countries; urban residence increased selection in four countries; and rising firewood and kerosene prices increased selection in three countries each. In the second stage, the quantity of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumed increased with rising household expenditure and decreasing price of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in every country. Urban residence increased and engagement in agriculture decreased <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumption.

Although fuel prices faced by individual households could not be tested, the findings largely supported those from the first six countries. Once the education levels of men and women were separately accounted for, the gender of the head of household was not statistically significant in most cases across the ten countries.
