An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of Missoulians sometimes needing to drive with headlights on during the day to navigate through the smog. In 1979, still almost 40% of the county's <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> came from the wood and paper products sector. The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify.

25|$|Just as higher-income {{groups are}} more likely to enjoy {{financial}} gains when economic times are good, they are also likely to suffer more significant income losses during economic downturns and recessions when they are compared to lower income groups. Higher-income groups tend to derive relatively more of their income from more volatile sources related to capital income (business income, capital gains, and dividends), as opposed to <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> (wages and salaries). For example, in 2011 the top 1% of income earners derived 37% of their income from <b>labor</b> <b>income,</b> versus 62% for the middle quintile. On the other hand, the top 1% derived 58% of their income from capital as opposed to 4% for the middle quintile. Government transfers represented only 1% of the income of the top 1% but 25% for the middle quintile; the dollar amounts of these transfers tend to rise in recessions.|$|E
25|$|According to the CBO, {{the major}} reason for {{observed}} rise in unequal distribution of after-tax income {{was an increase in}} market income, that is household income before taxes and transfers. Market income for a household is a combination of <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> (such as cash wages, employer-paid benefits, and employer-paid payroll taxes), business income (such as income from businesses and farms operated solely by their owners), capital gains (profits realized from the sale of assets and stock options), capital income (such as interest from deposits, dividends, and rental income), and other income. Of them, capital gains accounted for 80% of the increase in market income for the households in top 20%, in the 2000–2007 period. Even over the 1991–2000 period, according to the CBO, capital gains accounted for 45% of the market income for the top 20% households.|$|E

2500|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} views inequalities in {{the distribution}} of income as arising from differences in value added by labor, capital and land. [...] Within <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers.

[...] Thus, in a market economy, inequality {{is a reflection of the}} productivity gap between highly-paid professions and lower-paid professions.|$|E
2500|$|In late 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Paris, wealth was growing rapidly, {{and it became}} {{increasingly}} concentrated. [...] Paris from 1872 to 1927 was a [...] "rentier society". Rentiers (that is, people who relied primarily on inherited wealth) made up about 10% of the population, but owned 70% of aggregate wealth; they spent heavily on luxuries as their income from capital assets could sustain a living standard far beyond what <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> alone would permit. [...] Paris became world-famous for making consumerism a social priority and economic force, especially through its grand department stores and upscale arcades filled with luxury shops. These were [...] "dream machines" [...] that set the world standard for consumption of fine products by the upper classes {{as well as the}} rising middle class. Aristide Boucicaut, the son of a small clothing-shop owner, became partner in a variety store called Le Bon Marché in Paris in 1848. He became owner in 1852 and transformed it into the first modern department store in Paris with high-volume buying, low profit margins, seasonal sales, discounts, advertising, a mail-order catalog, and entertainment and prizes for customers, spouses and children.|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} element {{of the labor market}} in Argentina is the high participation of informal jobs, over which no contributions are made. The inclusion into pre- and post-SS lifetime <b>labor</b> <b>incomes</b> of earnings from jobs for which there were no contributions, informal income, means an important reduction in the Gini coefficients of pre- and post-SS lifetime <b>labor</b> <b>incomes.</b> This result derives from the fact that those for whom informal income {{is an important part of}} their pre-SS lifetime labor earnings are mostly low-wage earners, so the inclusion of this type of income increases the participation of the low end of the income distribution.|$|R

50|$|The Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem {{states that}} if {{non-linear}} taxes on earnings are available as policy tool, differential taxation of first- and second period consumption is not optimal if all consumers have preferences weakly separable between consumption and labor. Furthermore, consumers {{need to have}} homogeneous subutility functions of consumption. When applied to capital income taxation, the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem argues that since present and future consumption are equally complementary to leisure due to weakly separable preferences (and hence there is no Corlett-Hague motive for capital income taxation), capital income taxes do not alleviate the tax distortions caused by <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> taxation while additionally distorting capital income. Thus, capital income taxation, i.e. differentiated consumption taxation, is more costly (and therefore less optimal) than pure non-linear <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> taxation.|$|E

40|$|Weakening {{bargaining}} power of unions {{and the increasing}} integration {{of the world economy}} may affect the volatility of capital and <b>labor</b> <b>incomes.</b> This paper documents and explains changes in income volatility. Using a theoretical framework which builds distribution risk into a real business cycle model, hypotheses on the determinants of the relative volatility of capital and labor are derived. The model is tested using industry-level data. The data cover 11 industrialized countries, 22 manufacturing and services industries, and a maximum of 35 years. The paper has four main findings. First, the unconditional volatility of <b>labor</b> and capital <b>incomes</b> has declined, reflecting the decline in macroeconomic volatility. Second, the idiosyncratic component of income volatility has hardly changed over time. Third, crosssectional heterogeneity in the evolution of relative income volatilities is substantial. If anything, the <b>labor</b> <b>incomes</b> of high- and low-skilled workers have become more volatile in relative terms. Fourth, income volatility is related to variables measuring the {{bargaining power}} of workers. Trade openness has no significant impact...|$|R

50|$|For a government, {{distinguishing}} between capital and labor incomes can be difficult. This shortcoming becomes critical when individuals shift from <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> to capital income {{so as to}} take advantage of tax differentials, as evidenced in Finland by Pirttilä and Selin (2011) and in the United States by Gordon and MacKie-Mason (1995) and more recently Gordon and Slemrod (2000). The difficulty in distinguishing labor and capital income might be the most important reason for governments' reluctance to engage in the full tax exemption of capital income. Specifically, Christiansen and Tuomala (2008) find a positive optimal tax on capital income due to the presence of the ability to shift income, while Reis (2007) demonstrates that the Chamley-Judd result does not hold when tax authority cannot effectively distinguish entrepreneurial <b>labor</b> <b>income</b> and capital income.|$|E
30|$|An {{interesting}} {{result from}} the inclusion of informal income arises when we use the alternative definitions of pre- and post-SS lifetime <b>labor</b> <b>incomes,</b> which exclude employee and employer contributions. Now, with the only exception {{of men in the}} public sector, the SS system is always regressive, and moreover, the regressivity of the system is stronger than when informal income is excluded. This result {{can be explained by the}} fact that when pre- and post-SS lifetime <b>labor</b> <b>incomes</b> exclude employee and employer contributions, Social Security works like an untied transfer program improving the conditions of those who benefit from it, 25 which as we saw earlier (see Fig.  4) are the ones with higher wages, since low-wage workers are less likely to fulfill the conditions to access a retirement benefit.|$|R
