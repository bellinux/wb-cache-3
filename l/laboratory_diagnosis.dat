5|$|A <b>laboratory</b> <b>diagnosis</b> {{is usually}} made based on {{recovery}} of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E

25|$|Today it is {{established}} {{that at least}} some primate species are highly susceptible to B. pertussis and develop clinical whooping cough in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses.

Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against whooping cough.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, <b>laboratory</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of measles can be {{done with}} {{confirmation}} of positive measles IgM antibodies or isolation of measles virus RNA from respiratory specimens. For people unable to have their blood drawn, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific IgA testing. Positive contact with other patients known to have measles adds strong epidemiological evidence to the diagnosis. Any contact with an infected person, including semen through sex, saliva, or mucus, can cause infection.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} in culturing Borrelia bacteria in the <b>laboratory,</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings {{and a history of}} exposure to endemic Lyme areas. The EM rash, which does not occur in all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative. Serological testing can be used to support a clinically suspected case, but is not diagnostic by itself.|$|E

25|$|Stool and swab samples {{collected}} in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for <b>laboratory</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is V. cholerae O1. If V. cholerae serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for V. cholerae O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, {{it is necessary to}} send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to treat is usually made after {{a combination of}} physical exam and <b>laboratory</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> with additional testing including audiometry, tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion can resolve spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant adenoidectomy.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{transfusion}} {{therapy to}} maintain the patient’s hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/dL (normal levels are 13.8 for males, and 12.1 for females). Patients are transfused by meeting strict criteria ensuring their safety. They must have: confirmed <b>laboratory</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of thalassemia major, and hemoglobin levels less than 7g/dL, {{to be eligible for}} the transfusion. To ensure quality blood transfusions, the packed red blood cells should be leucoreduced with a minimum of 40g of hemoglobin content. By having leucoreduced blood packets, the patient is at a lower risk to develop adverse reactions by contaminated white cells and preventing platelet alloimmunisation. Pre-storage filtration of whole blood offers high efficiency for removal and low residual of leukocytes; It is the preferred method of leucoreduction compared to pre-transfusion and bedside filtration. Patients with allergic transfusion reactions or unusual red cell antibodies must received “washed red cells” or “cryopreserved red cells.” Washed red cells have been removed of plasma proteins that would have become a target of the patient’s antibodies allowing the transfusion to be carried out safely. Cryopreserved red cells are used to maintain a supply of rare donor units for patients with unusual red cell antibodies or missing common red cell antigens. The transfusion programs available involve lifelong regular blood transfusion to main the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/gL. The monthly transfusions promote normal growth, physical activities, suppress bone marrow activity, and minimize iron accumulation.|$|E
