40|$|This article {{looks at}} reasons why income {{inequality}} could rise and then explores whether, in fact, workers are losing out. It examines whether workers are <b>falling</b> <b>behind</b> {{relative to the}} wealthy and whether real wages have been falling or perhaps only manufacturing wages. It also examines {{whether there is a}} growing “wealth gap” and why it could be developing. Finally, it examines the hypothesis that relatively inexperienced or unskilled workers are <b>falling</b> <b>behind.</b> The paper concludes that there is a wealth gap, but that it is due to falling real interest rates not declining compensation. Other indicators of inequality may be growing as well, but it is not because compensation is falling short of rapid productivity growth or because workers are <b>falling</b> <b>behind</b> other income recipients.
