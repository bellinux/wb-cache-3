[...] Regarding going solo, Walker said, [...] "Management {{came to me and}} I thought {{that it was time to}} do my own show.

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Abrams to promote 10 Cloverfield Lane, he said the creative team behind the original had some ideas on developing Cloverfield 2, but the release of movies such as Godzilla and Pacific Rim led them to abandon them as they found the concept of Kaiju movies played out. However, Abrams also suggested that he has thought of something {{that if they are}} <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it made [...] "could be really cool that [...] connects some stories" [...] in a future film, even teasing a larger Cloverfield universe. Interviews with Dan Trachtenberg and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, director and actress of 10 Cloverfield Lane, respectively, confirm that the movie is, and always was intended to be, an expansion of the first film, with Trachtenberg calling it the [...] "Cloververse".|$|E

He is {{hardened}} and tough physically, and hasty and boyish in his manner and speech, belonging as he does to the large class of English gentlemen of property (solicitor-managed) who have never developed intellectually since their schooldays. He is a muddled, rebellious, hasty, untidy, forgetful, always late sort of man, who very evidently needs {{the care of a}} capable woman, and has never been <b>lucky</b> or attractive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it. All the same, a likeable man, from whom nobody apprehends any malice nor expects any achievement. In everything but years he is younger than his brother the General.|$|R
2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, we were <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|E
2500|$|The Thompson {{was used}} in World War II {{in the hands of}} Allied troops as a weapon for scouts, non-commissioned {{officers}} (corporal, sergeant, and higher), and patrol leaders, as well as commissioned officers, tank crewmen, and soldiers performing raids on German positions. In the European theater, the gun was widely utilized in British and Canadian commando units, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Army paratrooper and Ranger battalions, where it was issued more frequently than in line infantry units because of its high rate of fire and its stopping power, which made it very effective in the kinds of close combat these special operations troops were expected to undertake. Military Police were fond of it, as were paratroopers, who [...] "borrowed" [...] Thompsons from members of mortar squads for use on patrols behind enemy lines. The gun was prized by those <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one and proved itself in the close street fighting that was encountered frequently during the invasion of France. A Swedish variant of the M1928A1, the Kulsprutepistol m/40 (submachine gun, model 40), served in the Swedish Army between 1940 and 1951. Through Lend-Lease, the Soviet Union also received the Thompson, but due to a shortage of appropriate ammunition, its use was not widespread.|$|E

5000|$|Though he {{was born}} in Italy, Cavallari forged most of his career with the Stuttgart Ballet, from where he came {{directly}} to join the WAB in 2007. It is his first experience as an artistic director, and his achievements have been considerable.First and foremost has been the company’s ambitious and interesting programming. Cavallari has presided over an excitingly rich repertoire that has raised the company’s national standing and made it a very desirable place for dancers to be.He engaged the work of some of Europe’s hottest choreographers, such as Paul Lightfoot, Petr Zuska, Youri Vamos and Uwe Scholz. He also staged John Cranko’s Taming of the Shrew (which was repeated due to public demand). And he engaged the distinguished former Cranko ballerina, Marcia Haydee, to stage her own full-length production of The Sleeping Beauty.While making full use of his international contacts, Cavallari did not ignore the artists on his doorstep. Locals with European links - such as Margaret Illman (a former Stuttgart ballerina), Kim McCarthy (an alumnus of the Hamburg Ballet and Nacho Duato’s Compania de Danza) and Terence Kohler (resident choreographer at the Bavarian State Ballet). Nor was young blood overlooked.Cavallari cultivated fledgling choreographers such as Tim O’Donnell, Cass Mortimer, Reed Luplau and company dancer Jayne Smeulders, giving them main-stage opportunities. And he sought out and paid due respect to local venerables, such as former ballerina Lucette Aldous (commissioning from her a new Don Quixote), and Barry Moreland (former artistic director of the company), whose L’apres midi d’un Faune will be included in the forthcoming Diamonds season.Altogether Cavallari's record is of a well balanced mix of traditional and new, international and local, safe and risky, that is especially impressive given the company’s size and location.In fact, the WAB’s size is another achievement. Cavallari was certainly not the first director to campaign for more dancers at the WAB, but he has been persistent or <b>lucky</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>get</b> that for what he asked. When he began his tenure the number was 19 - it is now 36 (32 of them professional). He is aiming for 40, a number he believes is the absolute minimum for a proper classical ballet company. He also increased the number of mainstage seasons per year from three to four.|$|R
