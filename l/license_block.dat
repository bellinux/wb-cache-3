50|$|Copylefted {{software}} is free software whose distribution terms {{ensure that all}} copies of all versions carry {{more or less the}} same distribution terms. This means, for instance, that copyleft licenses generally disallow others to add additional requirements to the software (though a limited set of safe added requirements can be allowed) and require making source code available.

The field covers approximately 60 km2 in an average water depth of 1000 m. The field was discovered in 1996, with government approval for its development given in 2002. The field began first production in November 2005. The field is produced via a FPSO vessel.

A more immediate threat, however, are the numerous oil exploration projects operating nearby or on the reef itself. In the past decade, the Brazilian government had sold 80 <b>license</b> <b>blocks</b> to oil energy companies in the region, with an environmental baseline based on [...] "sparse museum specimens".

Using visual imagery, we calculate the average conventional well site footprints to be 10, 800 m 2 in the UK, 44, 600 m 2 in The Netherlands and 3000 m 2 in Poland. The average area per well is 541 m 2 /well in the UK, 6370 m 2 /well in The Netherlands, and 2870 m 2 /well in Poland. Average access road lengths are 230 m in the UK, 310 m in The Netherlands and 250 m in Poland.

40|$|Masters of ScienceThis {{study is}} focused on the Coal Bed Methane {{resources}} of Botswana with specific reference to the Central Kalahari basin where prospect <b>license</b> <b>blocks</b> forming the focus of this study are located. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the fracture network in the coal seams and the fracture systems in the surrounding coal bearing sedimentary sequences and their contribution to dynamic flow. Coal bed methane sources are dual-porosity media documented on the natural fracture network, seen as micropores (matrix/natural fractures) and macropores (cleat). The coals of this region belong to the Ecca Group’s Morupule Fm (Permian) (70 m), focus of this study and have been preserved in the extensive Karoo basin within the Southern Africa region. Fractures can easily be identified in Acoustic Televiewer logs (ATV) and their orientation and structural character interpreted by rose plots, tadpoles and stick dip plots. In-situ stress fields have been determined from breakout structural evaluation and maintains a general E-W dip direction and N-S strike, thus most fractures are orientated optimally with inferred in-situ stress and enhancing flow potential in pore systems. A qualitative (MID plots & M-N cross-plots) and quantitative description of the fracture system is fundamental to the petrophysical evaluation, and involves the estimation of fracture parameters (fracture porosity, resistivity fracture index and both horizontal and vertical fracture indices) ...|$|R

The methods and instruments used in the study. To perform the economic analysis of resources and to assess the efficiency and risks of subsoil exploration and development, the authors used the results of in-house regional geological and geophysical modelling and economic research.

The basin has proven hydrocarbon reserves and potential for further discoveries. The study area is located within South African exploration <b>license</b> <b>blocks</b> 3 A/ 4 A and 3 B/ 4 B and covers a region of roughly 97 km by 150 km. The study aims at understanding the geological processes responsible {{for the formation of}} the Orange Basin with a focus on the evolution of source rocks maturity. The Petrel software was used for seismic interpretation and well correlation and PetroMod (IES, Version 10) for basin modelling and assessing source rock maturity. Preliminary seismic interpretation of the post Hauterivian succession shows a relative thickening of the sedimentary sequence westward as the basin evolves from the early drift to complete drift phase. Initial results from petroleum system modelling indicate that the Barremian- early Aptian source rock is at present over mature and producing mostly gas in the shelf areas, whereas potential for oil is most likely still present in the deep water area of the basin where Tertiary progradation has resulted in renewed petroleum generation. The younger Cenomanian-Turonian source rock shows a lower transformation ratio than the older source rocks an...|$|R

Currently, the petroleum and petroleum products needs of the island state are satisfied by own sources by less than a half. The prospects of the hydrocarbon resource base development are connected with the adjacent water area of the Gulf of Mexico where foreign companies had been granted <b>license</b> <b>blocks</b> for geological study and further development since 2001.

Commercial oil-and-gas bearing prospects have been established in neither of them for both geological and technological reasons. However, only a small part of the water area has been covered by drilling and the productivity of the drill core has been tested at the depth of Cretaceous sediments only. In our opinion, oil-and-gas bearing prospects of the exclusive economic zone of the Republic of Cuba in the Gulf of Mexico remain undervalued and the mentioned water area needs additional geological exploration.
