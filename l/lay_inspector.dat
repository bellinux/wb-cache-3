50|$|After that Gwynoro {{concentrated}} on his business activities, and from 1993 until 2012 {{was head of}} EPPC-Severn Crossing Ltd, a school inspection and conferencing business. During that period the company inspected over 10,000 educational establishments in England and Wales. Gwynoro visited some 1000 of Wales’s schools on inspections and regularly expressed concerns about standards in teaching, learning and performance. In August 2012 {{it was reported that}} EPPC-Severn Crossing had debts of £180,000 in the autumn of 2011 and some sub-contracted inspectors had not been paid for inspections they had done. During the following year these matters were resolved. When the contractual arrangements for the administration of school inspections were changed by the Welsh Government and Estyn from September 2012 the company ceased trading. In addition to being a <b>Lay</b> <b>Inspector</b> of schools he was also an Investors in People Adviser/Assessor, External Assessor Performance Management of Headteachers, External Assessor for EFQM European Business Excellence Model, Consultant/Assessor Law Society Lexcel Standard and Health Inspectorate Wales <b>lay</b> <b>inspector.</b>|$|E

She was also a <b>lay</b> <b>inspector</b> at the Crown Prosecution Service and a Justice of the Peace. In 1990 she was nominated to the Manchester Magistrates’ Bench where she served for 14 years.

In many smaller forces, the senior superintendent was also the ACC. Some forces had chief inspectors, and some later acquired chief superintendents, but this was by no means universal. Today, however, every force in the country has all three ranks.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Emperor, exiled to Jehol, {{agreed to}} a {{proposal}} presented by British ambassador Sir Frederic Bruce in July 1861 to purchase British gunboats. Robert Hart, interpreter of the Imperial Maritime Customs Service is given credit for creating the proposal. Prince Gong, {{the head of the}} Zongli Yamen, appointed <b>Lay</b> as <b>Inspector</b> General of the new flotilla. Lay left China for England on 14March 1862 with written instructions from Prince Gong.|$|R
40|$|A rapid gross visual {{appraisal}} of enzootic pneumonia lesions {{was made of}} 87 lungs at a local abattoir and the lungs were then set aside and examined in more detail. A sample of pulmonary tissue was taken from each lung and submitted for bacterial and histological examination. The principal investigator who had performed the gross and detailed lung scores was then {{used to assess the}} agreement of two inspectors who were scoring lung lesions in the abattoir. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between grossly scored lungs and scores derived from a detailed examination was 0. 94. Using histological examination as the gold standard, rapid gross examination had a sensitivity of 76 % and a specificity of 71 %. Using bacterial recovery as a gold standard yielded a sensitivity of 77 % and a specificity of 51 %. The sensitivity and specificity of inspectors 1 and 2 compared to the principal investigator were: sensitivity = 97. 5 % and specificity = 97. 4 % for inspector 1, and 97 % and 98 % for inspector 2. The kappa values for both of the inspectors compared to the principal investigator were 0. 95 suggesting that designated <b>lay</b> <b>inspectors</b> consistently agreed with the principal investigator.

40|$|Many {{inspectorates}} use {{lay people}} in their teams but how the term ‘lay’ is understood varies significantly across inspectorates. A typology of the term's use is proposed, drawing specific operational examples from four inspectorates: the Office for Standards in Education, the Social Services Inspectorate, HM Inspectorate of Probation and HM Inspectorate of Prisons. This leads into {{an exploration of the}} concept of the term ‘lay’, that is {{what it means to be}} a <b>lay</b> <b>inspector</b> rather than what lay inspectors actually do. An examination of the term's historical roots in relation to the professions, particularly the Church, reveals some abiding features, including the notion of common sense. Although it is recognized that the term ‘lay’ can be defined as non‐professional, a more positive and distinctive definition is offered based on the research data. This definition sees the fact that to be lay and, therefore, outside the professions, as enabling lay people to bring a fresh perspective and added value to the process of inspection and to the working of the team...|$|E
50|$|In {{the field}} of education, Rouland {{continued}} his struggle against the clergy. He enforced the ban on private institutions taking the title of college.All schools were forced to charge for tuition, regardless of their statutes, thus removing any competitive advantage of religious schools over state-run schools.Rouland regulated municipal schools run by brothers, gave teachers more protection against priests and limited transfers of schools from lay to religious teachers.He also enacted stricter control on private schools, and obtained more funds for public education.Rouland appointed <b>lay</b> women <b>inspectors</b> to investigate {{the quality of education}} for girls in schools around the country.One of these, Marie Caillard, recommended requiring each commune to provide a separate girls' primary school, improving the training of both lay and religious teachers and giving them the same pay.|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the {{traditional}} account, there was a turnaround after the 1867 Metropolitan Poor Act and a popular reaction against expensive refonns. Moreover, poor law medical officers (PLMOs) were regularly charged with negligence from then. This thesis explains why those events were connected, how charges were brought against PLMOs and builds a framework for understanding negligence in the New Poor Law. First, the power of judiciary is located: <b>lay</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Second, a concept of standard(s) of care is articulated by reconstituting contemporary expectations of 'care' and 'duty'. Third, a textual analysis {{of the rules of}} PLMO employment demonstrates that the Local Government Board (LGB) framed them so that medical officers were legally culpable for system faults and a handy 'fall-guy'. In short, the LOB practiced a 'culture of blame' and, for the first time, this study explains why and how this impacted on New Poor Law medical welfare. An original methodology was created to research a wide-range of records. Quantitative, qualitative and comparative analyses, together, reconstitute poor law practice, avoiding the misleading aspects of policy documents. Database analyses maps the spatial and temporal incidence of negligence and, from this, provides evidence of a regionally-nuanced New Poor Law. The highest density of negligence occurred in North-West England, Wales and the Welsh-English border counties. Most of those 'charges' stemmed from salary or attendance issues. Part-time contracts and low salaries resulted in PLMOs prioritising private over public duties: they were compelled to ignore some medical orders. That clash of prerogatives caused a fault-line in the poor law medical welfare system and was the root cause of most negligent practice. F~om 1870, those tensions were strained by a shift in policy, known as the crusade against out-relief The 'crusade' lowered the standard of care by increasing PLMOs' workload, withdrawing vital expenditure and not investing in medically trained staff. A decline of care in the community during the 'crusade' caused higher numbers of incarcerated mental-health patients and systemic negligence: incurables, such as the disabled, were ignored by PLMOs. The thesis, thus, culminates with a case study, examining the negligent treatment of a disabled workhouse patient; restoring the 'lost' perspective ofpauper patients.

50|$|Keangsoo was {{a wooden}} {{dispatch}} vessel, laid down at Whites' shipyard at Cowes on the Isle of Wight in 1862 and launched on March 5, 1863. Whites had become {{well known for}} winning contracts with the Ottoman Navy during the 1850s. She was the flagship of the Lay-Osborne Flotilla, the name given to a grouping of vessels which had been arranged {{to be sent to}} China by Horatio Nelson <b>Lay,</b> then the <b>Inspector</b> General of Customs for Imperial China, to help suppress the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty gave permission for Lay to proceed with this task, and provided the funds to procure the ships. While some, such as HMS Africa (subsequently renamed China) were purchased from the Royal Navy, Keangsoo was one of three dispatch vessels alongside Tietsin and Kwangtung which were procured as new builds. Permission was given by the British Government to enlist British sailors for the Chinese flotilla, and Captain Sherard Osborn was co-opted to command the fleet, with the ship under the direct command of Forbes.|$|R
