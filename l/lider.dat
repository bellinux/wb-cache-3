40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to formulate solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for improving the dermal delivery of a local anesthetic agent lidocaine (<b>LID).</b> SLN and NLC were characterized for particle size distribution, polydispersity index, entrapment efficiency, X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRD), thermal behavior by differential scanning colorimeter (DSC) and surface morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). LID-loaded SLN and NLC were formulated into hydrogels for topical application. The in vitro permeation profiles of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) were evaluated by using guinea pig skin. The in vivo efficacy of <b>LID</b> SLN gel, <b>LID</b> NLC gel, and a marketed <b>LID</b> formulation (Xylocaine® gel) gel was evaluated on guinea pig using pinprick test. <b>LID</b> SLN showed a particle size of 78. 1  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 556, whereas <b>LID</b> NLC showed a particle size of 72. 8  nm with a polydispersity index of 0. 463. The entrapment efficiency of <b>LID</b> in both SLN and NLC was 97 % and 95. 9 %, respectively. The TEM studies revealed the almost spherical nature of <b>LID</b> SLN and NLC formulations.

25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe <b>Líder</b> and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking <b>Líder,</b> who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and <b>Líder</b> with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and <b>Líder</b> inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his hand out to <b>Líder,</b> offering to help him up. <b>Líder</b> grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for <b>Líder</b> in his upcoming match.|$|E

These can all be avioded by meticulous attention to surgical details and dressing techniques.

25|$|One of the {{featured}} matches of Triplemanía XX saw three former tag teams, and current rivals, reunite and {{face each other}} in a Parejas Suicidas match. The first team is the former La Familia de Tijuana of Extreme Tiger and Halloween. Together, Tiger and Halloween held the AAA World Tag Team Championship from April to September 2008, after which the team disbanded, when Halloween left AAA to join Perros del Mal Producciones. Halloween returned to AAA on June 6, 2010, at Triplemanía XVIII as a member of Los Perros del Mal and has ever since remained {{on the opposite side of}} Extreme Tiger, who turned técnico during Halloween's time away from the promotion. The rivalry between Halloween and Tiger ignited in early 2012, when the two ended up on opposite sides during the rivalry between Tiger's tag team partner Jack Evans and Los Perros del Mals leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. The second team in the match is the former The Hart Foundation 2.0 of Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, who joined AAA together in early 2008 as representatives of the rudo stable La Legión Extranjera (Foreign Legion). In May 2009, the team disbanded with Evans turning técnico, after which the two started feuding over the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. The feud ended without a proper conclusion in early 2010, when AAA suspended Hart indefinitely. Hart finally returned to AAA on March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, and was on April 1 revealed as the newest member of Los Perros del Mal, taking over El Hijo del Perro Aguayo's feud with Evans as Aguayo moved on to chasing the AAA Mega Championship. The final team in the match is the former La Hermandad 187 of Joe <b>Líder</b> and Psicosis. After winning the AAA World Tag Team Championship from La Familia de Tijuana in September 2008, <b>Líder</b> and Psicosis, then known as Nicho el Millonario, held the title for 18 months, becoming the longest reigning champions in AAA history. Even after losing the title, <b>Líder</b> and Nicho remained together as a técnico team, feuding with the La Sociedad stable. In June 2011, AAA, in storyline, suspended Nicho, after he interfered in a six-man tag team match at Triplemanía XIX, where <b>Líder,</b> Heavy Metal and Electroshock, replacing the previously injured Nicho, faced Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador. On July 16, Nicho turned on <b>Líder,</b> believing that <b>Líder</b> had not stood up for him as he was, in his mind, being wronged by AAA. With Nicho joining Los Perros del Mal, he and <b>Líder</b> have had a bloody rivalry ever since. On April 6, 2012, the rivalry took another twist, when <b>Líder</b> burned Nicho's face with a fireball. Following the burning, Nicho began once again wearing his old mask and working under the ring name Psicosis, with the storyline being that Líder's fireball had not only severely burned Nicho's face, but the incident had also driven him insane. On July 11, it was announced that the Parejas Suicidas match would be taking place inside a steel cage. At the following day's Triplemanía XX press conference, the team of Chessman and AAA Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera was added to the match. Unlike the other teams in the match, Chessman and Guerrera have no prolonged history with each other, though they are on opposite sides in the battle between La Sociedad and AAA. In the months before Triplemanía XX, Chessman had been feuding with Vampiro, while Guerrera was busy with his former protégé Daga, who had turned on him and joined Los Perros del Mal. The losing team in the match would then face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. If La Familia de Tijuana lost, the match would be a Mask vs. Hair match, in other cases it would be a Hair vs. Hair match.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} factors and {{possible}} mechanisms associated with decreased self-awareness of levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<b>LIDs)</b> {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We enrolled 30 PD patients with <b>LIDs.</b> Patients were video-recorded in an "on" phase while experiencing <b>LIDs.</b> <b>LIDs</b> were objectively rated {{by means of the}} Unified Dyskinesias Rating Scale (UDyRS) by two movement disorders specialists while examining the patients. Patients were asked to rate the body site and the severity of their <b>LIDs</b> according to the 5 -point UDyRS. Patients then rated their own <b>LIDs</b> while watching the video recording of themselves. Lastly, the patients rated the <b>LIDs</b> of other reference PD patients on a video recording. The same reference video recordings were shown to 15 healthy individuals matched for age, gender and education. Results: Seven of the 30 PD patients investigated were subjectively unaware of the presence of their <b>LIDs.</b> The majority of patients, however, recognized their <b>LIDs</b> when watching video recording of themselves. Patients displayed a specific poor self-awareness of trunk <b>LIDs,</b> in both the subjective evaluation and in the video recording-based subjective evaluation. By contrast PD patients correctly recognized <b>LIDs</b> in video recordings of reference PD patients. Poor self-awareness correlated with predominance of motor symptoms on the left body side. Conclusions: Poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> is present in a proportion of PD patients as a form of anosognosia. The poor self-awareness of <b>LIDs</b> in the trunk is likely to be due to a complex interplay involving both anosognosic mechanisms and deficits in proprioceptive axial kinesthesia.

40|$|Lipases {{naturally}} {{function at}} the interface formed between amphiphilic molecules and the aqueous environment. Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL) is a well-characterised lipase, known to exhibit interfacial activation during which a <b>lid</b> region covering the active site becomes displaced upon interaction with an interface. In this study, we investigate the effect the {{amino acid sequence}} of the <b>lid</b> region on interfacial binding and <b>lid</b> dynamics of TLL. Three TLL variants were investigated, a wild-type variant, a variant containing an esterase <b>lid</b> region (Esterase), and a Hybrid variant, containing both wild-type <b>lid</b> residues and esterase <b>lid</b> residues. Multiple coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the interfacial binding orientation of TLL was significantly affected {{by the nature of}} amino acids in the <b>lid</b> region, and atomistic simulations indicated effects on the structural dynamics of the <b>lid</b> itself. The atomistic simulations, as well as steered molecular dynamics simulations, also indicated that the Esterase <b>lid</b> region was less flexible than the wild-type <b>lid</b> region, whereas the Hybrid variant displayed superior <b>lid</b> flexibility and stability in the open conformation both at the interface, and in aqueous solution. Additional experiments performed to investigate the activity and binding behaviour of the lipase variants indicated a slightly higher specific activity for the Hybrid variant compared to the wild-type variant, correlating the observations of increased <b>lid</b> flexibility. Together, these results are in line with previous experimental studies, highlighting the importance {{of the nature of the}} amino acid residues within the functional <b>lid</b> region of lipases, particularly regarding interfacial binding orientation, activation, and structural stability...|$|R
