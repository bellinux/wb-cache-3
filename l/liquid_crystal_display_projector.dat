The polymer based material with composition of 1, 6 -Hexanediol dicrylate, Phenylbis(2, 4, 6 -trimethylbenzoyl) -phosphine oxide with varied Sudan I concentrations was used to build 3 D structures. The structure was fabricated using a three different photo absorber composition of Sudan I then the photoreactive polymer solidification phenomena was evaluated. Based on the result obtained, higher exposed time of the photo absorber will reduced the surface roughness values and increased the solidification layer time.

As such, designers can obtain sales predictions based upon configuration changes and make tradeoffs with other requirements.

40|$|AbstractTo {{innovate}} {{in education}} is to create something new which deviates from long established traditional practices; in this case to impart learning at different levels. With the advent of modern instruments such as computers, <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays,</b> overhead <b>projectors,</b> slide projectors etc., classroom teaching has seen a phenomenal change towards {{a better understanding of}} the course content of various university syllabi. Internet facilities have, to a great extent, given access to the literature related to any topic under the sun, thus enhancing knowledge. A stagnant and unproductive economy may be turned into a productive economy with the help of the above mentioned modern equipment. Scientists, engineers and technocrats are continuously trying to find a viable solution to enrich and empower citizens of the world. One such marvel helping in this process is the computer. Universities have a responsibility to focus on the employability of candidates rather than teach them outdated syllabi. The processes of learning and teaching should facilitate feedback opportunities. In bringing about a change in the educational pattern in this world of ours, care should be taken that the younger generation of students do not spend their time on internet education for hours together, ruining at an early age the physiological functions of their eyes, backbone, wrists, neck etc. Reading books must be made compulsory at all levels of learning. The computer should serve as a supplementary tool or a device, technologically driven, giving new information for the benefit of mankind...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of multifocal techniques {{to the visual}} evoked cortical potential permits objective electrophysiological mapping of the visual field. The multifocal visual evoked cortical potential (mfVECP) presents several technical challenges. Signals are small, are influenced {{by a number of}} sources of noise and waveforms vary both across the visual field and between subjects due to the complex geometry of the visual cortex. Together these factors hamper the ability to distinguish between a mfVECP response from the healthy visual pathway, and a response that is reduced or absent and is therefore representative of pathology. This thesis presents a series of methodological investigations with the aim of maximising the information available in the recorded electrophysiological response, thereby improving the performance of the mfVECP. A novel method of calculating the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of mfVECP waveform responses is introduced. A noise estimate unrelated to the response of the visual cortex to the visual stimulus is created. This is achieved by cross-correlating m-sequences which are created when the orthogonal set of m-sequences are created but are not used to control a stimulus region, with the physiological record. This metric is compared to the approach of defining noise within a delayed time window and shows good correlation. ROC analysis indicates a small improvement in the ability to distinguish between physiological waveform responses and noise. Defining the signal window as 45 - 250 ms is recommended. Signal quality is improved by post-acquisition bandwidth filtering. A wide range of bandwidths are compared and the greatest gains are seen with a bandpass of 3 to 20 Hz applied after cross-correlation. Responses evoked when stimulation is delivered using a cathode ray tube (CRT) and a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) <b>projector</b> system are compared. The mode of stimulus delivery affects the waveshape of responses. A significantly higher SNR is seen in waveforms is shown in waveforms evoked by an m= 16 bit m-sequence delivered by a CRT monitor. Differences for shorter m-sequences were not statistically significant. The area of the visual field which can usefully be tested is investigated by increasing the field of view of stimulation from 20 ° to 40 ° of radius in 10 ° increments. A field of view of 30 ° of radius is shown to provide stimulation of as much of the visual field as possible without losing signal quality. Stimulation rates of 12. 5 to 75 Hz are compared. Slowing the stimulation rate produced increases waveform amplitudes, latencies and SNR values. The best performance was achieved with 25 Hz stimulation. It is shown that a six-minute recording stimulated at 25 Hz is superior to an eight-minute, 75 Hz acquisition. An electrophysiology system capable of providing multifocal stimulation, synchronising with the acquisition of data from a large number of electrodes and performing cross-correlation has been created. This is a powerful system which permits the interrogation of the dipoles evoked within the complex geometry of the visual cortex from {{a very large number of}} orientations, which will improve detection ability. The system has been used to compare the performance of 16 monopolar recording channels in detecting responses to stimulation throughout the visual field. A selection of four electrodes which maximise the available information throughout the visual field has been made. It is shown that a several combinations of four electrodes provide good responses throughout the visual field, but that it is important to have them distributed on either hemisphere and above and below Oz. A series of investigations have indicated methods of maximising the available information in mfVECP recordings and progress the technique towards becoming a robust clinical tool. A powerful multichannel multifocal electrophysiology system has been created, with the ability to simultaneously acquire data from a very large number of bipolar recording channels and thereby detect many small dipole responses to stimulation of many small areas of the visual field. This will be an invaluable tool in future investigations. Performance has been shown to improve when the presence or absence of a waveform is determined by a novel SNR metric, when data is filtered post-acquisition through a 3 - 20 Hz bandpass after cross-correlation and when a CRT is used to deliver the stimulus. The field of view of stimulation can usefully be extended to a radius of 30 ° when a 60 -region dartboard pattern is employed. Performance can be enhanced at the same time as acquisition time is reduced by 25 %, by the use of a 25 Hz rate of stimulation instead of the frequently employed rate of 75 Hz.

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{deals with}} <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays</b> where the incident light and reflected light {{going through the}} display are not specularly related. The incident light can be at a range of angles to the display while the reflected light, i. e. the viewing direction is at or nearly normal to the display. For such nonspecular <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>displays,</b> the polarizer angles, the input/output directors of the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> cell, and <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> cell retardation have to be specially optimized to obtain the best viewing effects.
