5|$|According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu {{metropolitan}} area has an estimated population of 722,664.

Like the rest of Nigeria most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English alongside the dominant <b>language</b> <b>in</b> the region. In this case the dominant language is Igbo. Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because of the diversity of dialects in the Igbo <b>language.</b> <b>In</b> cultural and linguistic terms Enugu is within the Northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other towns and cities like Awka and Nsukka.|$|E
