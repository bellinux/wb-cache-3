To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|SJS has {{roots in}} {{criminal}} trials during the Vietnam War era, but {{in modern times}} is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as {{to the effectiveness of}} the practice, though {{it is clear that the}} evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.|$|E

5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation. Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on their migration. The whales summer in the cool, high latitudes, where they feed in krill-abundant waters; they winter in warmer, low latitudes, where they mate and give birth.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the federal government would not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E

Further comparison of the X and Y reveal regions of homology between the two.

40|$|The {{association}} between personality and personal relationships is mostly studied within dyadic relationships. We examined these variables {{within the context}} of personal network types. We used Latent Class Analysis to identify groups Of Students with similar role relationships with three focal figures. We performed Latent Class Logistic Regression to explore the relationships of the latent classes with the Big Five personality factors. Personality was assessed with the Five Factor Personality Inventory. We found three personal network types: a primarily family oriented network, a primarily peer oriented network, and a mixed family/peer oriented network. We found significant associations between personality and personal network type. Extraverted students were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> primarily peer oriented network relative to a primarily family oriented network.
