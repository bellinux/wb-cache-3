40|$|SANS {{experiments}} on blends of linear, high density (HD) and long chain branched, <b>low</b> <b>density</b> (LD) <b>polyethylenes</b> indicate that these systems form a one-phase mixture in the melt. However, the maximum spatial resolution of pinhole cameras is approximately equal to 10 3 Å {{and it has}} therefore been suggested that data might also be interpreted as arising from a bi-phasic melt with large a particle size (~ 1 µm), {{because most of the}} scattering from the different phases would not be resolved. We have addressed this hypothesis by means of USANS experiments, which confirm that HDPEILDPE blends are homogenous in the melt on length scales up to 20 µm. We have also studied blends of HDPE and short-chain branched <b>linear</b> <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (LLDPEs), which phase separate when the branch content is sufficiently high.

40|$|The {{present study}} compares the {{properties}} of five films: one film of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), two films of <b>linear</b> <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (1 -octene comonomer) - one made by metalllocene catalyst (mLLDPE) and the other by Ziegler-Natta (zLLDPE) - and two blend films, one of mLLDPE/LDPE (film A) and the other of zLLDPE/LDPE (film B). The effect of LDPE (22 % by weight) on the thermomechanical properties of LLDPE-based films is investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and stress-strain in the yield region measurements. The mechanical, dynamic, and thermal properties of film A are quite similar to a single component system (mLLDPE). The addition of this amount of LDPE {{does not affect the}} melting temperature of mLLDPE but it enhances its crystallinity. Film B is a rather inhomogeneous material, as opposed to film A, and its properties seem to be dependent on stretching conditions. Further-more, the thermally activated rate process (Eyring's theory) is applied to analyze the yielding behavior of the two blend films.

40|$|A simple {{technique}} employing {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) {{to investigate}} the molecular structure of ethylene copolymers is presented in this paper. Three commercial Ziegler-Natta catalysed <b>linear</b> <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (LLDPE) and a commercial single-site catalysed very <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (VLDPE) were subjected to continuous cooling at a slow rate of 0. 08 degreesC min(- 1). Like other thermal fractionation techniques, the slow continuous cooling (SCC) technique segregates polymers according to their branching density, allowing the short chain branching (SCB), lamellar thickness (L) and methylene sequence length (MSL) distribution to be determined using the DSC melting curves. It {{was found that the}} single-site catalysed VLDPE exhibits narrow SCB, L and MSL distributions, with shorter methylene sequences. In contrast, the Ziegler-Natta catalysed LLDPEs have much broader bimodal SCB, L and MSL distributions, with less SCB, and are composed of both short and long methylene sequences. LLDPEs have thicker lamellae compared with VLDPE (12. 9, 12. 5, 9. 8 nm versus 6. 7 nm) and the lamellar thickness values are consistent with the results measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The slow continuous cooling and stepwise cooling techniques are complementary: the former provides a continuous distribution profile and the latter a well-defined histogram for the lamellar thickness.

40|$|The {{influence}} of branching on {{the properties of}} polyethylenes has gained great interest during the last years. In particular, a controlled amount of short-chain branches (SCBs) can be incorporated by polymerizing ethylene with a comonomer, such as 1 -olefins, in order to primarily improve the mechanical properties of the materials in the solid state [1 - 2]. More recently, the development of metallocene catalysts {{has led to a}} new class of polyethylenes with narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD). Although linear metallocene catalysed resins exhibit better physical and mechanical properties, they also suffer from poor melt processability [3]. In this work the {{influence of}} sparse short-chain branching and molecular weight distribution on the melt fracture behavior of poly(ethylene/ 1 -olefin) copolymers was investigated. Four commercial <b>linear</b> <b>low</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylenes</b> (LLDPE) were employed for this study: three conventional LLDPE/ 1 -olefin copolymers (with butene, hexene and octene) and a metallocene LLDPE/ 1 -hexene. Rheological measurements were performed both in shear and extensional flow, and melt extrusion experiments were carried out using a controlled rate capillary rheometer. A single capillary geometry was used to focus on the effects of materials properties rather than geometric factors on flow instability. Correlations between the molecular characteristics of the resins and their processing behavior (melt fracture performance) were established. In particular, it was found improved processability with increasing SCB length for conventional LLDPE, which have similar molecular weight (Mw) and MWD. Comparing the metallocene and conventional LLDPE samples, polymerized using the same comonomer (hexene), the metallocene catalysed resin exhibited early onset and more severe melt fracture, that can be reasonably attributed to its narrow MWD...|$|R

40|$|A new {{fluorinated}} N-alkylmaleimide, N-(2 -pentadecafluoro-n-octanoyloxy) -ethyl) maleimide (FOMI), was synthesized from perfluoro-octyl {{carboxylic acid}} (FOCA) by {{reaction of the}} furan adduct of maleic anhydride (MAH) with ethanolamine and esterification of the resulting alcohol-imide. The reactivity of FOMI in free-radical reactions such as copolymerization with butyl vinyl ether (BVE) and grafting onto olefin copolymers (OCP) was investigated. Copolymerization with 2 / 1 molar excess BVE yields a copolymer with 63 mol% FOMI in moderate conversion, indicating that homopropagation of the maleimide prevails over comonomer alternation. The thermal stability of FOMI is quite poor, with onset of the pyrolytic loss of the N-perfluoroalkylcarboxyethyl moiety just above 100 degreesC, similarly to that of FOCA. This restricts the possibilities for direct melt functionalization of OCP with FOMI To bypass this limitation three distinct approaches were preliminarly investigated. These were respectively based on either direct grafting of FOMI at low temperature, or reaction of a MAH-grafted polyolefin with a low molecular weight amine or amino-terminated oligomer bearing the perfluoroheptyl group.

40|$|In polymer extrusion, a melt {{instability}} called gross melt fracture {{is often}} observed when the extrusion rate is increased beyond a critical value. Because gross melt fracture limits the production rate, much {{attention has been}} devoted to predicting when it will occur. However, there is still no general understanding of the origin of this phenomenon. Several criteria have been proposed for the onset of gross melt fracture (OGMF), but these depend on the procedure used for measuring them and thus are not material properties. The use of a critical extensional stress (CES) is proposed here as a criterion for OGMF. This stress is estimated using the entrance pressure drop analyses proposed by Cogswell and by Binding. Orifice dies were used to eliminate the complication arising from the presence of a capillary. The entrance angle and contraction ratio were varied to study the effect of die geometry. Various materials including conventional <b>linear</b> <b>low</b> and high <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> and new polyethylenes produced by metallocene and constrained geometry catalysts were used in a study of the effect of molecular structure on OGMF. The latter materials are of special interest, because they have very well-defined molecular structure in terms of molecular weight (MW), molecular weight distribution (MWD), and long chain branching (LCB). In addition, the effect of particulate additives (boron nitride and carbon black) was investigated. It was found that CES is independent of the die, contraction ratio, and entrance angle, as long as the angle is equal to or greater than 90 degrees. This result suggests that CES is, indeed, a material property. The CES was found to be independent of additive content up to a level of 0. 5 wt%. Further, it was found that while CES is independent of MW, increasing levels of LCB and broadening MWD increase CES. Finally, brittle fracture at the entrance of the die is proposed as the cause of gross melt fracture...|$|R
