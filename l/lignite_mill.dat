40|$|A {{numerical}} {{algorithm is}} developed {{for a detailed}} 3 D simulation of the two-phase flow field in fluid-energy mills used for pulverization and drying of fossil fuels in large power plants. The gas phase equations are solved using finite differences and the control volume method, whereas a Lagrangian formulation with a stochastic particle dispersion model is adopted for the particulate phase. Fluid-particle interaction is taken into account to calculate the mass, momentum, and heat transfer between phases. Advanced numerical techniques for partially-blocked cells and local grid refinement have been utilized to achieve an accurate representation of the domain geometry and to enhance {{the accuracy of the}} results. Particle collisions, fragmentation mechanism, and moisture evaporation are simulated by corresponding models, whereas the special treatment employed for the rotating fan region provides the capability to solve the two-phase flow simultaneously in the entire rotating and nonrotating mill domain. The flow and the operation characteristics of a recently developed <b>lignite</b> <b>mill</b> are measured, and the numerical algorithm is used to predict the mill performance under various inlet profiles of the fuel mass flow rate. The predicted results are reasonable, and in agreement with the available measurements and observations, thus offering a deeper insight into the complex dynamic and thermal behavior of the two-phase flow in the mill. © 2001 ASME...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} particle-velocity measurements {{obtained with}} an one component fiber optic, back scatter laser Doppler anemometer {{in a model}} of a <b>lignite</b> beater wheel <b>mill.</b> The mill-model has been constructed with the aim to retain the same particle motion characteristics as in the mills used by the Greek Public Power Corporation (P. P. C.) for the pulverization and drying of lignite. An analysis of the particle motion characteristics and the adopted scaling down procedure for the design of the model mill, which retains geometrical and fluid dynamic similarity, are presented. The real and model beater wheel mills are described and the simplifications adopted are discussed. The experimental results shed light into the particle motion inside the mill and allowed to locate areas, where particles tend to accumulate and where erosion-wear is expected to be high...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Four {{samples of}} <b>milled</b> <b>lignite</b> {{used in the}} “Nikola Tesla A ” power plant, located in Obrenovac near Belgrade, were {{subjected}} to a five-step sequential extraction, comprising of the following phases: distilled water, 1 M ammonium acetate, 0. 2 M ammonium oxalate/ 0. 2 M oxalic acid, acidic solution of H 2 O 2 anda 6 Msolution of HCl. The concentrations of the different elements obtained in the extractions were statistically analysed. The majority of the examined elements {{were found to be}} most probably associated with inorganic fractions of lignite, only aluminum, silicon, chromium and arsenic have a larger extractable organic/sulfide fraction than an extractable inorganic fraction. Alumosilicates of magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, lead, copper and chromium), silicates of potassium (scavengers of lead and nickel), mixed aluminates of iron and magnesium (carriers of arsenic, zinc, copper and chromium) and compounds of iron that do not contain aluminum and magnesium (scavengers of manganese) were dissolved in the fifth phase of the sequential extraction. Copper is a substrate of alumosilicates of potassium and magnesium, while zinc and chromium are substrates of compounds of iron leached in the third phase of the sequential extraction. Interphase correlation revealed that the adsorbed and ion-exchangeable fractions of most of the examined elements do not exhibit preferential binding to the components of the inorganic matrix of lignite ash...|$|R
