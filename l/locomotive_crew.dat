5|$|The Canoe River train crash {{occurred}} on November 21, 1950, near Valemount in eastern British Columbia, Canada, when a westbound troop train and the eastbound Canadian National Railway (CNR) Continental Limited collided head-on. The collision killed 21people: 17Canadian soldiers {{en route to}} the Korean War and the two-man <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> of each train.|$|E
5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and disc signals controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> to change the token before proceeding.|$|E
25|$|On 22 March 1931, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train was derailed at , Bedfordshire due to excessive speed through a crossover. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E

500|$|The Clan Class had a mixed {{reception}} {{when first}} introduced to British Railways <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> {{because there were}} only 10 locomotives in a class that was mostly confined to the North West of the railway network. This {{was due to the}} fact the low number of class members prevented effective training of <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> throughout the nationalised network, and a degree of partisanship amongst <b>crews</b> towards newer <b>locomotives</b> further ensured this. [...] The entire class was also based predominantly at two depots throughout their working lives, these being Glasgow Polmadie and Carlisle Kingmoor, compounding their restricted circulation. However, factors such as these meant that they spent most of their short careers out of the limelight that the Britannias had, resulting in a relatively camera shy class of <b>locomotive.</b> <b>Crews</b> that used them on regular duties displayed their liking for the locomotives, and as such, could produce good work. [...] However, the predominant number of crews who were unfamiliar with the Clans found them difficult to handle, leading to an undeservedly bad reputation.|$|R
50|$|The {{single-track}} Ledbury Tunnel, {{immediately to}} the east of the station, was notorious among steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> for its bad atmosphere, the result of its unusually narrow bore combined with a steep gradient and a bend at the north end.|$|R
25|$|When No.42 first appeared, it was {{equipped}} {{only with a}} weatherboard and the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> must have found {{the lack of a}} proper cab very unpleasant in wet weather. The Ramsbottom safety valves were placed over the firebox and exhausted in front of the weatherboard.|$|E
25|$|With all {{the obvious}} {{differences}} between the original and the replica, added {{to the fact that}} the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> used had only four days experience of operating the locomotive, it cannot be said that in this restaging of the trial the replica of Novelty gave the performance that the original could have achieved if more time had been made available in 1829.|$|E
500|$|The {{restoration}} was {{supervised by}} the PRR's chief mechanical officer, Theodore N. Ely. Ely was confident enough in its 50-mile (80.5km) test run to Perth Amboy, New Jersey (which took {{two hours and}} fifteen minutes), that the governors of all the states that the locomotive was to pass through and the then President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, were invited to ride behind the engine on its first leg toward Chicago. The John Bull was to pull a few passenger cars in a train that would carry dignitaries {{and representatives of the}} press. The train traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the charge of one <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew.</b> From Philadelphia, local engineers (train drivers) were employed to ride on the locomotive's footplate as pilots to advise the operators for the trip over the local engineers' territories {{for the rest of the}} journey to Chicago. Traveling at , the train departed from the Pennsylvania Railroad's Jersey City station at 10:16a.m. on April 17 and reached Chicago on April 22. [...] The locomotive operated during the exhibition giving rides to the exhibition's attendees, and then the train left Chicago on December 6 for the return trip to Washington. The locomotive arrived back in Washington on December 13.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} in service by <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews,</b> the 0415's tenure on the London suburban services was relatively short-lived. [...] This was especially true {{with the introduction}} of the Adams T1 class of 0-4-4 tanks displacing some of the class from the London area.|$|R
5000|$|They were affectionately called [...] "Pikku-Jumbo" [...] (The Little Jumbo) {{because of}} their good {{performance}} despite their low weight. They had a low fuel consumption (usually Tk3s used birch wood) and good riding characteristics. They also had good steaming characteristics and were very popular among <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the length}} and noise of the <b>locomotive,</b> <b>crews</b> found {{difficulty}} in hearing warning detonators. To rectify the situation, tubes were fitted to convey the sound from the leading wheels to the cab. This mechanism can still be seen today on 6040 at the NSW Rail Museum.|$|R
2500|$|... 25 September 1902. A special {{troop train}} from Ballincollig, County Cork to Larne Harbour became divided. The {{detached}} rear portion subsequently collided {{with that in}} front between Greenisland and Trooperslane. Four vehicles were destroyed and many others damaged; three cavalry horses were killed {{but there were no}} other injuries. Major Pringle felt that the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> had not been sufficiently vigilant in keeping a proper lookout. Furthermore, he censured the Great Southern and Western Railway, the GNR(I) and the BNCR, over whose metals the train had run, for treating it as goods or cattle and marshalling the passenger vehicles behind the non-braked cattle wagons with the result that the vacuum brake was not in operation throughout the train.|$|E
50|$|On 13 December 1911, {{a freight}} train was derailed at the station due to the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> being incapacitated.|$|E
50|$|On 13 December 1911 {{a freight}} train ran away and was derailed at the station. Both <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel was notorious among steam <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> for its bad atmosphere, {{the result}} of its unusually narrow bore {{combined}} with a steep gradient (1:80) and a bend at the north end. Special rules for evacuation of passengers are in place due to the tight clearance in the tunnel.|$|R
60|$|Hardie could {{understand}} his sensations {{and did not}} rebuke him. So far as his experience went, the western <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> were of an excellent type, and {{he was willing to}} admit that there were occasions when the indignation of an honest man might be expressed in vigorous action.|$|R
25|$|Before its closure in 1962, the Waikaka Branch ran in {{a valley}} {{parallel}} to that occupied by the Tapanui Branch, and trivia associated with operation of the lines is that <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> in one valley claimed they were sometimes able to see smoke from a steam engine operating in the other valley.|$|R
5000|$|On 13 December 1911, {{a freight}} train ran away and was derailed at [...] station, Yorkshire. Both <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E
5000|$|... 259 {{was spotted}} in {{use as a}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> {{sleeping}} van in 1918, and it was withdrawn from service around 1936.|$|E
50|$|On 22 March 1931, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train was derailed at , Bedfordshire due to excessive speed through a crossover. The <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E
50|$|Although the CLR had {{directors}} and several secretaries over the years, it listed very few staff on its books. Kynochs (and later Cory's) kept costs {{down to a}} minimum by counting only the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> (ie the drivers and firemen) as actual employees of the CLR. Like {{many aspects of the}} CLR, not much has been recorded of them.|$|R
5000|$|... 100 S160s {{were shipped}} to South Korea in 1947, where the Korean National Railroad {{designated}} them Sori2 (소리2) class, numbering them 소리2-1 through 소리2-100. They were not popular with Korean <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews,</b> {{as they were}} right hand drive on a left-running railway. In KNR service they were used primarily in yard duty and occasional short local trains.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{introduction}} of the continuous brake system in 1903 it became possible to operate trains with five locomotives, and on [...] descending passenger trains up to five Fell brake vans could be used – two next to the locomotives, one in the middle, and two at the rear. [...] As each brake van had its own guard and the train had a train guard and <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews,</b> a train with five brake vans and four <b>locomotives</b> had a <b>crew</b> of 14, which added to the expense of the operation.|$|R
50|$|An earlier {{accident}} occurred near Penmaenmawr on 12 January 1899 when {{an express}} freight train was derailed because a storm had washed away the trackbed. Both <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E
50|$|All {{passenger}} trains in New South Wales operate with a driver and guard. Guards {{were removed from}} freight trains in the 1980s, but these still operate with a two-man <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 12 January 1899, An express {{freight train}} was derailed at Penmaenmawr, Caernarfonshire {{due to the}} {{trackbed}} being washed away by the sea during a storm. Both <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> were killed.|$|E
500|$|The first <b>locomotive</b> and <b>crew</b> change {{occurred}} in Barstow after the train {{had passed through}} Cajon Pass. [...] At one point after passing Cajon summit, the train was clocked at 96mph (155km/h). The <b>locomotive</b> and <b>crew</b> were again changed successively at Needles, Seligman, Williams, Winslow and Gallup before the train arrived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 9:30am on July 10.|$|R
50|$|The {{modified}} no. 3454 {{was put to}} work in February 1985. Results, {{as reported}} by <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> and shed staff, were noticeable savings in coal and water consumption when compared to a standard Class 25NC, although the amounts were never quantified. The locomotive was also noticeably more sure-footed than the Class 26, which tended to slip every time it started.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives, such as Stephenson's Rocket, had no cab; {{the locomotive}} controls and a footplate {{for the crew}} were simply left open to the elements. However, to protect <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> against adverse weather conditions, locomotives gradually came to be equipped with a roof and protective walls, and the expression [...] "cab" [...] refers to the cabin created by such an arrangement.|$|R
50|$|These direct-acting spring valves {{could be}} {{adjusted}} by tightening the nuts retaining the spring. To avoid tampering, {{they were often}} shrouded in tall brass casings which also vented the steam away from the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At 01:30 {{the freight}} train entered the station {{travelling}} at 140 km/h and {{collided with the}} rear of the passenger train, destroying three carriages and killing 106 people and injuring more than 100 (including the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew</b> of the freight train).|$|E
50|$|On railway {{locomotives}} {{it is to}} keep smoke {{clear of}} the line of sight of the <b>locomotive</b> <b>crew.</b> Many Belgian locomotives that were built in the late 19th or early 20th centuries were fitted with distinctive high capuchons, for example the Type 8 4-6-0 compounds.|$|E
2500|$|North American locomotives, such {{as those}} built by EMD or General Electric, have nine {{throttle}} positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many UK-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. [...] The power positions are often referred to by <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> as [...] "run 3" [...] or [...] "notch 3", depending upon the throttle setting.|$|R
50|$|They proved unpopular {{with both}} <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews</b> because of rough riding and track {{maintenance}} staff {{because of their}} high axle load and were displaced from mainline working and relegated to branch line work following {{the arrival of the}} P6 class. In 1905/06, new boilers with Belpaire fireboxes were fitted, the smokeboxes shortened and the cylinder diameter reduced. In 1924 the class was renumbered becoming the Z17 class.|$|R
50|$|The T14 s {{were the}} most {{successful}} of Drummond's abysmal 4-6-0 designs for the LSWR, though they still displayed the old, costly liabilities of heavy coal and water consumption on a railway that did not employ water troughs, which was combined with a high frequency of hot axle boxes. Both were complaints that had afflicted all his previous 4-6-0s, and did not endear them to <b>locomotive</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
