Second, beams or shafts of direct sunlight radiating down from openings {{at the top of}} the canyon are much more common in Upper than in Lower. Beams occur most often in the summer months, as they require the sun to be high in the sky. Winter colors are more muted.

50|$|The Wagman Observatory hill, {{located in}} the {{northeast}} corner of Deer Lakes Park at , is ideally suited for an astronomical facility. At 1340 feet elevation {{it is one of the}} highest points in Allegheny County, and one of the few such sites not already occupied by a radio mast, microwave relay tower, or water tank. It is believed that local Indian tribes in the area, such as the Seneca, once used the hill as a lookout for watching game and the activities of neighboring tribes. The hill affords an almost 100% view of the sky. Because of its location in a relatively rural country park, the observatory is protected from the majority of commercial or residential development that could cause excessive stray and misdirected <b>lighting</b> (<b>Light</b> Pollution). Yet the site can be reached from downtown Pittsburgh in 45 minutes, and even from the southern reaches of the county in less than an hour, thanks to the proximity of the route 28 expressway, and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.|$|E

We present and discuss Light Collages, a lighting design system with geometry-dependent lights for effective feature-enhanced visualization. Our algorithm segments the objects into local surface patches and places lights that are locally consistent but globally discrepant to enhance the perception of shape. We use spherical harmonics for efficiently storing and computing light placement and assignment. We also outline a method to find the minimal number of light sources sufficient to illuminate an object well with our globally discrepant lighting approach.

Half-strength Hoagland's solution was applied to plants grown in perlite in an indoor controlled environment room, with metal halide lamps providing artificial <b>lighting.</b> <b>Light</b> distribution (photosynthetic photon flux density, PPFD) and yield (shoot fresh weight) within each system were assessed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pansy (Viola cornuta) is a facultative {{long-day plant}} that flowers from October until March in Turkey. During the winter months, low light levels can limit plant growth and development. Light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) can provide supplemental lighting in greenhouses which produce same light intensity with less energy than conventional incandescent <b>lighting.</b> <b>Light</b> emitting diode technologies have enabled affordable and efficient light systems {{to be installed}} in greenhouses and plastic tunnels in the field. In this experiment we evaluated the effects of supplemental red-orange LED lightening on the growth and development of pansy cv. Blue Blotch grown in plastic tunnels. The energy, which LEDs are to consume, was provided through a solar panel system {{with the aim of}} drawing attention to the cleanliness of solar energy source. Five hours of supplement LED lighting was applied after dusk starting from November to February. Pansy growth and development parameters were compared with non-light supplied control plants. Supplemental LED lighting significantly increased plant biomass weight, flower number and leaves number at the rate of 52 %, 72 %, and 47 %, respectively. Moreover, LED lighting increased plant growth rate (0. 109 and 0. 306 g of fresh weight), compared with the no light control. LED lighting, however, had no effect on length of stems, number of branches and the diameter of flowers. Thus, this study indicated that pansies are light limited during the winter months and supplemental LED lighting can significantly increase pansy growth and development...|$|E
