60|$|There were, however, two {{elements}} of weakness among the Covenanters in 1679 which rendered all their efforts vain, despite the righteousness of their cause. One {{was that they}} were an undisciplined body, without appointed and experienced officers; while their leader, Robert Hamilton, was utterly unfitted by nature as well as training for a military command. The other weakness was, that the unhappy differences of opinion among them as to <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> to which we have before referred, became more and more embittered, instead of being subordinated to the stern necessities of the hour.|$|R

When such a grant was made {{for the maintenance of}} temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

5|$|The Memorial {{attracted}} {{criticism from}} some families of officers {{killed in the}} <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>duty,</b> regarding the high cost, and that the roll of honour lists only those officers killed during arrests or {{as a result of}} criminal acts, rather than all officers killed in the line of duty; also that, with the book being behind glass, friends and relatives of the deceased are not able to view the relevant page. Before construction, objections were also raised to the Memorial's construction by the London Historical Parks Group and the local residents' association. Concern was also raised by some Irish republicans that the Memorial includes the names of those RUC officers killed in The Troubles.|$|E
6000|$|At his demise, in December 1851, {{the value}} of his estate was, I [...] think, near Â£600,000.
