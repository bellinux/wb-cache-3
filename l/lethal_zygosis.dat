40|$|When F− {{cells are}} mixed with an excess of Hfr cells there is a lethal event which results in a {{decrease}} in the number of F− survivors. We have described and discussed the parameters affecting this phenomenon of <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis,</b> and these include the cultural conditions of both donor and recipient cells prior to mixing and the use of aeration throughout the period of the experiment. The absence of <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> with filtrates and supernatant fluids from donors suggests a dependence on direct cell-cell contact as found in conjugation. The phenomenon, which is normally observed in liquid media, also occurs on solid media, and use of these two methods has allowed examination of strains of different mating types. Whereas most Hfr strains capable of producing normal yields of recombinants showed killing activity, no F+ and only one F′ donor produced <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis.</b> Only F− strains were sensitive to this phenomenon. The relationship between <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> and the various stages of conjugation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recipient (F−) {{cells of}} Escherichia coli are {{sensitive}} to an excess of Hfr donor cells. This phenomenon of <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> is associated with conjugation and is observed as a continuous fall in F− viable cells during liquid mating, or as inhibition of F− growth on solid media. One class of survivors, which arose in the zones of inhibition on solid media, was no longer sensitive to <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> and exhibited the following properties: sensitivity to male-specific phage, donor ability, and surface exclusion. Since these characteristics were sensitive to acridine orange treatment, the strains carry an F factor extrachromosomally. They are, however, defective in some way since they retain sensitivity to female-specific phage. Temporary sensitivity to <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> in these and in standard F+ strains can be induced by the formation of F− phenocopies. We have suggested {{that there is an}} immunity to <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> (Ilz+) associated with the F factor and discuss the results in terms of this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} viable F− cells {{decreases}} when Escherichia coli recipient cells {{are mixed with}} an excess of Hfr cells. Evidence is presented showing that <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> was accompanied by changes in the physiology of the recipient cells, including (i) inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, (ii) inhibition of β-galactosidase induction, (iii) altered transport and accumulation of galactosides, and (iv) leakage of β-galactosidase into the supernatant fluid. The results are {{discussed in terms of}} possible conjugation-associated changes that, at high Hfr to F− ratios, lead to <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the molecular cloning of various DNA segments generated by partial EcoRI endonuclease digestion {{of the sex}} factor F. These segments have been analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis of EcoRI digests and were arranged {{in a series of}} overlapping fragments using the EcoRI fragment map of F established by H. Ohtsubo and E. Ohtsubo. The clones isolated demonstrate {{one or more of the}} following F-specified functions: inhibition of female-specific phage (T 7) multiplication, formation of F pili, surface exclusion, or immunity to <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis.</b> These properties are discussed in terms of the EcoRI fragments of F that specify them...|$|E
40|$|Methodology {{which allows}} {{consistent}} shotgun cloning of streptomycete genes is presented. Parameters that increase transformation efficiency of Streptomyces lividans 66 were adjusted to generate reproducibly {{a population of}} cloned genes likely to represent the entire genome. Factors which influence the recovery of viable transformants include: growth phase of the mycelium, ionic and osmotic characteristics of the medium during protoplast formation and transformation, and moisture content and protoplast density during regeneration. A modified transformation procedure was devised which increased transformation frequency more than 20 -fold (allowing up to 10 (7) primary transformants per microgram of SLP 1. 2 covalently closed circular DNA) and greatly facilitated the cloning of drug resistance genes and biosynthetic genes, using one of two plasmid vectors. Viomycin resistance genes on BamHI or PstI fragments were cloned from S. vinaceus genomic DNA into S. lividans, using the SLP 1. 2 vector. At least three different S. vinaceus BamHI fragments (1. 9, 5. 8, or 8. 5 kilobases) confer viomycin resistance; only one PstI fragment (4. 3 kilobases) was found. Recombinant plasmids were all able to produce <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> and to be transferred by conjugation within S. lividans. SCP 2 was used to clone S. coelicolor A 3 (2) genes that "complemented" the auxotrophic mutation hisD 3, argA 1, or guaA 1. Recombinant DNA technology can now be applied to economically and academically interesting problems unique to streptomycete molecular biology...|$|E
40|$|Entry {{exclusion}} is {{a property}} of plasmids {{by which the}} cells that contain them become bad recipients in additional conjugation rounds. This work reviews entry exclusion essential features and analyzes the mechanisms of action of the best studied systems. We searched for homologs of the proteins responsible for experimentally known exclusion systems. Results were used to classify exclusion systems in families of related elements. We arrive {{to the conclusion that}} all conjugative plasmids contain at least one entry exclusion gene. Although entry exclusion genes seem {{to be part of the}} plasmid conjugative machinery, they are systematically absent in phylogenetically related type IV protein exporting machines involved in virulence for plants and animals. We infer from this fact that entry exclusion is an essential feature of conjugative plasmid biology. Mathematical models suggest that plasmids expressing entry exclusion selectively eliminate plasmids lacking it, reinforcing its essential character and suggesting that entry exclusion plays a direct role in plasmid survival. Other experimental results confirm that entry exclusion is essential for the stability of a conjugative plasmid. We suggest that entry exclusion limits the damage of <b>lethal</b> <b>zygosis</b> (bacterial death produced by excessive rounds of conjugation). Additionally, it avoids competition in a host among identical plasmid backbones. Conversely, the lack of entry exclusion in conjugative transposons can be understood as a means of generating rapid evolutionary change. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
