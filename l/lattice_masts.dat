5|$|The ships {{initially}} {{carried a}} pole mast above the conning tower, though shortly after commissioning, both ships had <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> added aft, and in 1910, the forward masts were also replaced with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Wrangler {{became the}} first ship of her class to be {{converted}} into a Type 15 anti-submarine frigate. This was a major reconstruction that involved {{the removal of the}} superstructure, masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the usable volume of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the forecastle deck was extended almost {{all the way to the}} stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> were added to carry the Type 277Q surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns mounted aft and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40mm Bofors guns above the bridge. The pair of triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortars were shifted to the quarterdeck aft and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 ASDIC systems.|$|E
25|$|Built {{originally}} with pole masts {{fore and}} aft, these ships were fitted with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts</b> forward and modernizing the bridges in 1912. In early 1917, Washington (by then renamed USS Seattle) was {{fitted with a}} seaplane catapult and one other Tennessee-class cruiser, probably Montana, was scheduled to receive one. While the plane {{was seen as a}} potential aid in reconnaissance, the catapult precluded use of the aft main guns. This program was cancelled and the catapult removed before the United States entered World War I. During the war, the 6-inch and 3-inch armament was removed and the corresponding ports sealed. This was done to provide guns for arming merchant ships and auxiliaries and to improve watertightness under North Atlantic conditions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mast crane {{integral}} installation technology {{is one of}} the ten new technologies in the construction field, which are put forward by the ministry of construction and are in key application. It is widely applied in the field of construction engineering. However, at present, the design of the mast crane hoisting is generally based on traditional mechanical model and adopts manual calculation, which is lack of safety and reliability, and the model needs to be perfect. As a result, this paper studies the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> crane hoisting system, explores and improves the traditional mechanical model, and develops the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting aided design system (WGCAD 1. 0), {{in order to meet the}} design requirements. Main content includes: introduction to the development in engineering of the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting crane and the application status in hoisting engineering of computer technology; introduction of the development environment of ViusalBasi 6. 0 and Access database which are used in cad system development of the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting. By using the reasonable <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> lifting design mechanics model, from the <b>lattice</b> <b>mast</b> hoisting system designer's perspective, the software adopts Visual Basic 6. 0 development environment and Microsoft Access database as development tools, the design idea of engineering design are simulated...|$|R

25|$|Assessment of {{the damage}} {{incurred}} in the Battle of the Yellow Sea led the NTC to another incorrect conclusion. The NTC tacticians noted that a single artillery hit in the mast of Tsesarevich nearly knocked it down; a fallen mast would, most likely, disable the secondary artillery turrets of its central citadel. <b>Lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> introduced with the American s, {{seemed to be a}} robust solution. However, they required substantial deck area to fit their wide bases. Instead of clearing deck space, the NTC designed the masts too narrow to be stable. Instead of Shukhov's hyperboloid profile, their structural beams were arranged in a weaker conical shape. Their deficiency was evident from the start, but the Navy needed something new to dispel the curse of Tsushima, and eagerly accepted the flawed novelty.|$|E

They were completed in October 1910, but the ship entered service on 10 March 1911. Andrei Pervozvanny joined the Baltic Fleet on completion and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in September 1912.

Imperator Pavel I joined the Baltic Fleet on completion and she made a port visit to Copenhagen in September 1912. The following September she visited Portland, Cherbourg, and Stavanger.

500|$|By 1926, the New York {{class was}} {{considered}} obsolete {{compared with other}} battleships in service, so both ships received a complete refit. While several other battleships in service, including [...] and [...] were converted to training ships or scrapped, New York and Texas were chosen to be overhauled to increase their speed, armor, and armament, {{in accordance with the}} Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. An additional [...] were added for defense against aerial targets and submarines. Her 14 coal-fired boilers were replaced by six Bureau Express oil-fired boilers and the twin funnels were trunked into one, aft of the forward superstructure. Tripods were fitted in place of the <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> and atop the forward tripod a control tower was installed. A tower was built amidships that contained additional fire control to backup the system on the foremast. A new aircraft catapult was installed atop turret Number 3, and cranes were installed {{on either side of the}} funnel for boat and aircraft handling. Additional deck protection was added, and each ship's beam was widened. The ships were fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, though these made maneuvering harder at low speeds and both rolled badly, and gunfire accuracy was reduced in rough seas.|$|E
500|$|In reserve, Belfasts {{future was}} uncertain: post-war defence cuts made manpower-intensive cruisers {{excessively}} costly to operate, {{and it was}} not until March 1955 that the decision was taken to modernise Belfast. Work began on 6 January 1956. Although described as only an extended refit, the cost was substantial for this large middle aged cruiser, 5.5 million pounds [...] Changes included: providing the new twin MK 5 40mm and the twin 4-inch mount with individual MRS8 directors; the 4-inch guns training and elevation speed was increased to 20 degrees a second; and protecting key parts of the ship against nuclear, biological or chemical attack. This last consideration meant significantly enlarging and enclosing her bridge, creating a two-tiered, five-sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance. The most significant change was better accommodations for a smaller crew more fitting of post-war needs, her tripod masts replaced with <b>lattice</b> <b>masts,</b> and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck. The overall effect was to create a cruiser significantly more habitable but different internally and to a degree in external appearance from wartime cruisers but only marginally superior in capability from its late-war fit. Belfast recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959. Her close-range armament was standardised to six twin Bofors guns, and her close-range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close-range blind fire directors fitted with Type 262 radar. Her 1959 radar fit also included Type 274, retained for main armament direction, Type 277Q and 293Q for height-finding and surface warning, Type 960M for air warning, and 974 for surface warning. In order to save weight, her torpedo armament was removed.|$|E
