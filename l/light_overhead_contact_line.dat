40|$|<b>Overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> {{equipment}} is important equipment that supplies power to trains. In order thus {{to maintain the}} soundness of the equipment, we inspect wearing depth of contact wires and positions (height and deviation) of <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> {{a few times a}} year using inspection cars. Some equipment, however, cannot be measured by inspection cars, so that is measured or just visually checked and manually measured only about once a year. One way to acquire accurate information of the condition of such {{equipment is}} by shortening the inspection period, but that would be quite difficult to implement due to a considerable increase in the amount of work. Furthermore, some items such as temperature of compression joints of feeders and displacement of springs of STBs constantly vary according to load current and weather. Depending on the timing of the inspection, {{we may not be able}} to check the items at their poorest condition. We thus developed an <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> equipment monitoring system where equipment measurement devices attached to <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> periodically measure temperature and displacement and transmit that measurement data to trains running there in commercial operation. In this way, the monitoring system enables highly frequent inspection. In this article, we will give an overview of the system and report on some of the field test results...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefit of}} trolley truck systems is the {{substitution}} of the diesel fuel by the cheaper and more ecological electrical energy. Trolley trucks are powered by electricity from two <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines,</b> where one is the supply and the other the return conductor. Such trolley trucks are used for haulage at open pit mining sites but {{could also be used}} for freight traffic at roadways in the future. Automatic guidance prevents the trolley-powered trucks from leaving the track and thus allows higher operating speeds, higher loading capacity, and greater efficiency. Radar is the ideal sensing technique for automatic guidance in such environments. The presented radar system with two-dimensional digital beamforming capability offers a compact measurement solution as it can be installed on top of the truck. Besides the distance measurement, this radar system allows to detect the location and inclination of the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> by digital beamforming in two dimensions. Besides automatic guidance, the knowledge of the inclination of the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> could allow automatic speed adaption, which would help to achieve maximum speed especially in hilly terrain...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As the {{requirements}} for <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> systems increase due to higher train speeds, the need of safety equipment for these systems increases as well. Developing a component for {{the case of a}} contact wire cut to prevent further damage from the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> system requires an extensive knowledge about the system behaviour. Therefore, a comprehensive multi body system model (MBS) is developed in Matlab SimMechanics environment. In order to validate the datas generated from the simulations, a contact wire test stand has been constructed where cutting experiments can be run by releasing a pretensioned wire. Consequently, the force distribution during the contact wire cut is analyzed and these values are compared with the simulation results. For the comparisons, much attention is given to the period after the contact wire cut...|$|R

Specifically, longer life of batteries and less power consumption for reducing required capacity are the top priority issues. Fig. 2 is the block diagram of this system.

ZigBee is a wireless communication standard for sensor networks conforming to IEEE 802. 15. 4 that focuses on reduced power consumption and cost reduction 1), 2). The sensor-integrated RFID tags use solar cells and electric double layer capacitors for power supply. Low-price and high-performance solar cells have recently become available. And electric double layer capacitors have longer life than ordinary secondary batteries, eliminating the need for power supply replacement. JR East carries out inspections of <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> systems using electric inspection cars a few times a year to maintain soundness of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> equipment that supplies electric power to trains. Electric inspection cars however can inspect only limited items, such as the positions and abrasion condition of main <b>line</b> <b>contact</b> wires and the configuration of crossovers and main lines. Many items thus remain dependant on manual inspection. Inspections of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> equipment that spans long distances require a huge amount of labor, so efficient inspection methods {{need to be}} examined from a viewpoint of reducing labor and maintenance costs.

40|$|A new {{measurement}} system {{able to detect}} the occurrence of arcing between the pantograph and the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> was studied and set up. The system uses photomultiplier tubes to measure {{the duration of the}} ultraviolet emission due to electric arcing.

Correlation with data acquired during high-speed test runs from different sensors (e. g. currents measured in an equipotential wire between the front and the rear pantographs, images acquired from a TV camera), provided the opportunity to perform an efficient calibration and an analysis of selectivity of the phototube sensor. Data from the phototube sensor along with various other information lead to the definition of a reliable index for evaluating the quality of the current collection.

In large-scale station yards into which many tracks enter, however, it is difficult to turn off electricity to all feeders circuits together. Therefore, work often has to be done with some wires live and others not. Moreover, personnel sometimes moves from the work site where they performed voltage detection and grounding to another site.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the 3 kV {{power supply system}} of Polish {{high-speed}} lines is described. Basic OCL parameters and test results of current collection quality is presented. One of the basic parameters limiting the maximum service speed on a given line is the pantograph-OCL cooperation quality. In this paper three types of <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> designed and implemented in Poland are described. There are also specified basic parameters and materials of catenaries, as well as OCL geometry or mechanical and electrical design values. The measured values obtained {{as a result of}} the performed tests are given in this paper which allows them to be compared with the design intents. One of the <b>overhead</b> <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> system examples is an OCL system implemented on CMK mainline. The line was built in the 1970 s and nowadays is a backbone of Warsaw to Silesia rail connection. Today PKP provides 200 km/h commercial intercity services on this line. The CMK trunk line is commonly considered as a leading one on the Polish rail network. On this line several tests were performed which allowed the following two types of traction stock to enter service on the domestic network. The first of them was Siemens ES 64 U 4 electric locomotive and the second one was ED 250 Pendolino electric multiple unit, manufactured by Alstom Ferroviaria. All these tests were carried out according to the requirements described in Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) of Trans-European high-speed rail network for both Test pantograph and catenary on compliance with the TSI Energy and locomotives subsystems. During the Pendolino test runs two consecutive speed records were attained, first one (250. 1 km/h) by a modified FS ETR 460 train in 1994 and the latter (293 km/h) by a PKP ED 250 train in 2013. It is to be noticed that the speed records mentioned above were determined not only by the power supply system parameters but were dependent on other factors as well. During the test runs the current collection quality was checked, for both single-unit and multiple-unit operation. In this paper the results of pantograph-OCL cooperation are described, according to TSI “Rolling stock” and “Energy” subsystems. These specifications state that the general current collection quality assessment criteria are the contact wire uplift and the contact force (calculated between a collector head and the contact wire) ...|$|R
