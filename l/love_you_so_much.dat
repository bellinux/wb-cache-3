According to George Lang of The Oklahoman, [...] "Kittie's lyrics {{are full of}} spit and venom, {{directed}} at preppy cheerleaders, rich kids, rude boys and women who trade on their sexuality". According to the Sun-Sentinel, [...] "Raven" [...] is [...] "inspired by a death threat" [...] from another band.

According to Morgan Lander, [...] "Do You Think I'm a Whore" [...] "is about not judging a book by its cover" [...] and the song's title was given [...] "basically to prove people wrong". [...] "Charlotte" [...] was inspired by a serial killer from the book Rites of Burial by Tom Jackman and Troy Cole. [...] "Brackish" [...] "is a commentary on a friend of" [...] Kittie [...] "and the relationship that she was in at the time".|$|E

At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with every day, every hour more and more. I wish it were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise.
