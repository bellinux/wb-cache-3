5000|$|A. & J. Stewart & Menzies Ltd. {{was founded}} as A. & J. Stewart. Andrew Stewart was {{originally}} {{employed as a}} salesman by Eadies of Dalmarnock, South Lanarkshire, specialists {{in the manufacture of}} lap-welded and <b>loose</b> <b>flange</b> tubes. Stewart saw a market for gas pipe but the company would not acknowledge his proposals. In 1860, Andrew set up business as a maker of butt-welded and lap-welded tubes, establishing a small works at St. Enochs, Glasgow, taking his brother James into partnership in 1862. The company met with rapid success and in 1867 moved to a large site at Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, where they built the Clyde Tube Works. In 1882 the company was incorporated with limited liability as A. & J. Stewart Ltd.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project consists of designing and constructing a RTM mould for a <b>loose</b> <b>flange</b> of {{glass fibre reinforced plastic}} (GRP). The design phase has the mission to realise a quality and simple design of the RTM mould, with the objective to obtain an easy and economic phase of construction and the more possible great characteristics of the <b>loose</b> <b>flange.</b> In fact this RTM mould will be a mould prototype, which will be developed in the future to obtain an RTM mould able to support a <b>loose</b> <b>flange</b> production. Therefore when more steps are developed in this project, then the future objective will be nea...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Photon Source (APS) booster {{and storage}} ring RF system {{consists}} of five 1 -MW klystrons, four 5 -cell cavities, and sixteen single-cell cavities. The RF power is distributed through {{many hundreds of}} feet of WR 2300 waveguide with H-hybrids and circulators. In order to protect personnel from the danger of RF radiation due to <b>loose</b> <b>flanges</b> or other openings in the waveguide system, three detector systems were implemented: an RF radiation detector, a waveguide pressure switch, and a Radiax aperture detector (RAD). This paper describes RF radiation measurements on the WR 2300 waveguide system...|$|R
50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs movement in an axial direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, fixed <b>flanges</b> and <b>loose</b> <b>flanges.</b> Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large axial movements in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R
