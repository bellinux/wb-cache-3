Then, the AC feasibility and stability checks are conducted and the CB condition monitoring data are employed to perform a CB reliability and <b>line</b> <b>availability</b> assessment. Ultimately, the operator will be offered multiple AC feasible and stable switching options with associated benefits.

40|$|Abstract: The {{liberalization}} {{of the basic}} telecommunications sector in Asian countries is examined in this paper {{with a view to}} identify the elements of good policy and examine how it can be promoted through multilateral negotiations. We find that despite the move away from traditional public monopolies, most Asian governments are still unwilling to allow unrestricted entry, eliminate limits on private and foreign ownership, and establish strong independent regulators. Where comprehensive reform— including privatization, competition and regulation—has been implemented, there are significantly higher levels of main <b>line</b> <b>availability,</b> service quality and labor productivity. Somewhat surprisingly, there has not been much unilateral liberalization since the last round of GATS telecommunications negotiations. The new round therefore faces the challenge of not merely harvesting unilateral liberalization as in the past, but of negotiating away existing restrictions. Furthermore, since quantitative restrictions on the number of suppliers are pervasive, deepened GATS rules could help ensure the transparent and non-discriminatory allocation of licenses. There may also be a need to sharpen the regulatory principles established in the last round, and to create rules that safeguard not only the rights of foreign suppliers but also those of consumers...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionChanging health {{behaviors}} and health-related environments {{is important in}} reducing chronic disease. Minority workplaces are potential venues to provide regular, effective health promotion opportunities to underserved individuals. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the feasibility of changing workplace policy, programs, and practices in minority-owned workplaces. MethodsFour minority Native American-owned businesses were recruited to participate in this study. The intervention was a set of recommended standards and guidelines gleaned from the US Preventive Task Force and The Community Guide relevant to workplaces. Each workplace selected between 4 and 6 target areas to improve over the year-long intervention period. The evaluation tool was a semi-structured survey conducted at baseline and at one-year follow-up, with workplace staff responsible for benefits and services to employees. Feasibility was evaluated by assessing the likelihood that the workplaces implemented health promotion activities in the year-long intervention. ResultsSeveral practices and policies changed significantly during the intervention in the four workplaces, including coverage for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), elimination of out of pocket costs for screening and tobacco cessation, accountability systems for providers, posted stair use, cessation <b>line</b> <b>availability</b> that included NRT, offering weight loss programs, offering physical activity programs, and conducting targeted communication programs about health promotion. Other practices and polices changed in the expected direction, but were not significant. ConclusionChanging workplace programs, practices, and policies is feasible in minority workplaces, with support and tools provided by outside organizations. These findings could drive a full-scale test of the intervention in minority businesses in order to improve the health of disadvantaged workers.

This paper shows the results of an O&M cost and availability analysis when different design {{for maintenance}} techniques are applied to wind turbines. The design for maintenance techniques considered, reduce repair times and the need for jack up vessels as well as introducing redundancy to the power train of the wind turbines. A detailed lifetime O&M cost and availability model is used in this analysis and populated with empirical operational and cost data from a population of ~ 350 offshore wind turbines from between 5 and 10 offshore wind farms throughout Europe. A base <b>line</b> <b>availability</b> and O&M cost per MWh are obtained from the model and input data, these inputs are then adjusted based on different design for maintenance techniques. The subsequent outputs from the model using the adjusted inputs allow for the quantification of O&M savings and availability improvements for the different design for maintenance techniques. These design for maintenance techniques may have different effects on different wind turbine types. As a means of investigating this, a comparison of the O&M saving and availability improvements will be carried out for both a DFIG turbine type and a PMG FRC turbine type. For a hypothetical site located 50 km offshore using a verified O&M model and empirical operational and cost data this paper shows that the overall combination of these improvements reduces the total O&M cost by ~ 16 % for the DFIG and ~ 17 % for the PMG FRC. It also shows that in both turbine types the largest reduction in O&M costs are seen to come from the elimination of the need for heavy lifting vessels...|$|E
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that rare copy number variants (CNVs) {{have a role in}} susceptibility to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Much research has focused on how CNVs mediate a phenotypic effect by altering gene expression levels. We investigated an alternative mechanism whereby CNVs combine the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of two genes, creating a 'fusion gene'. Any resulting mRNA with an open reading frame could potentially alter the phenotype via a gain-of-function mechanism. We examined 2382 and 3096 rare CNVs from 996 individuals with ASD and 1287 controls, respectively, for potential to generate fusion transcripts. There was no increased burden in individuals with ASD; 122 / 996 cases harbored at least one rare CNV of this type, compared with 179 / 1287 controls (P= 0. 89). There was also no difference in the overall frequency distribution between cases and controls. We examined specific examples of such CNVs nominated by case-control analysis and a candidate approach. Accordingly, a duplication involving REEP 1 -POLR 1 A (found in 3 / 996 cases and 0 / 1287 controls) and a single occurrence CNV involving KIAA 0319 -TDP 2 were tested. However, no fusion transcripts were detected by RT-PCR. Analysis of additional samples based on cell <b>line</b> <b>availability</b> resulted in validation of a MAPKAPK 5 -ACAD 10 fusion transcript in two probands. However, this variant was present in controls at a similar rate and is unlikely to influence ASD susceptibility. In summary, although we find no evidence that fusion-gene generating CNVs lead to ASD susceptibility, discovery of a MAPKAPK 5 -ACAD 10 transcript with an estimated frequency of ~ 1 / 200 suggests that gain-of-function mechanisms should be considered in future CNVs studies...|$|E

Danio rerio (zebrabish) is an ideal vertebrate model of human mitochondrial diseases because of its high conservation of physiological processes and genomic structure, transgenic <b>lines</b> <b>availability</b> and embryonic transparency. Using zebrabish embryos, we have performed a transient knock-down of the polg gene, inducing a dilated cardiomyopathy and an increased heart bit rate. Moreover, we have developed a transgenic line able to show in vivo the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (Hif 1) signaling. Taking advantage of this reporter line, we established that Hypoxia pathway is up-regulated in polg morphants. In addition, using a pharmacological approach targeting OXPHOS complexes NADH:ubiquinone reductase (Complex I) and Succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II), we have investigated the effect of mitochondrial dysfunctions on the Hypoxia pathway. We established that Hypoxia pathway is signibicantly reduced, both in normoxia and in hypoxia conditions, perhaps due to an increase in ROS production. In conclusion, our data suggest the existence of cross-talk mechanisms sensing mitochondrial dysfunction and changing Hypoxia signaling.
