40|$|Improving the {{performance}} and reducing {{the costs associated with}} export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> is critical to the competitiveness of export coal mines. The fundamental practices {{associated with the use of}} export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> made up of mine, trucking, rail and port operations are being challenged by the advent of third party operators on rail systems and the use of the Internet. Whilst individual mines can improve their processes to drive down their mining costs, they face major challenges in their endeavour to improve {{the performance}} of export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> and reduce the significant logistics costs of moving coal from the mine to export ships, via the shared infrastructure of rail systems and ports. There is an increasing realisation that global competition is not only between mines but between coal export regions that are defined by their rail system and ports infrastructure. The development and use of a joint industry planning platform for the export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> of the Western Australian Grain Industry has demonstrated that an industry facing significant restructuring and increased competitiveness can achieve major throughput and cost reduction gains when stakeholders in export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> share key planning information using the Internet and state of the art planning tools. Joint industry planning platforms for export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> are being considered or are at initial stages of development for a number of Australasian coal export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains.</b> This paper reviews the development of a joint industry platform for the W A Grain industry and reports on the state of development of similar planning platforms for the export <b>logistics</b> <b>chains</b> of the Illawarra, Hunter Valley, SE Queensland, Blackwater / Moura. Goonyella and Mt Isa / Townsville export coal regions. This paper addresses the key components of joint industry planning platforms, the key information that should be shared, the use of the internet and information servers, and the contractual Structures required to enable stakeholders of an export logistics chain,w ho are competitors or potential competitors, to work together to improve the competitiveness of a coal export region...|$|R

50|$|Analysis by the World Bank {{suggests}} that raising global capacity in trade facilitation (port efficiency, customs, regulatory transparency, {{and information technology}} used in trade transactions) halfway to the global average would increase world trade by $377 billion (Wilson, et al. 2005). This is an increase of about 9.7 percent in global trade {{with the majority of}} the gains due to domestic reform and capacity building. About $107 billion of the total gain comes from the improvement in port efficiency and about $33 billion results from the improvement in customs environment. The gain from the improvement in regulatory environment is $83 billion. The largest gain ($154 billion) comes from an improvement in information technology infrastructure which is increasingly applied all across the trade value and <b>logistics</b> <b>chain.</b> The important work ahead to lower trade costs however is outside the scope of trade policy, therefore, and squarely centered within domestic reform agendas, including services such as transport, telecommunication, and others that affect trade transactions costs.
