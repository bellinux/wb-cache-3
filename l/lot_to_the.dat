25|$|Hermann Ebbinghaus {{contributed a}} <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{research}} of {{the memory of the}} brain.

Resulting from the findings of Ebbinghaus, the first theory of forgetting was established, the decay theory. It says that if something new is learned, a memory trace is formed. This trace will decay, if not used in the course of time, and by decaying of this trace, forgetting occurs (Weltens 1987).|$|E
