5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little had changed since the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> into a replica of the 1920s <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> City Council chambers.|$|E
