5|$|Brin had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} three ships, but their great cost forced him to settle for two. At the time, Italy's industrial capacity was insufficient to build the ships out of domestic material. Everything from the iron used to build the hulls to the ships' machinery and guns had to be imported. The Caio Duilio class {{formed the basis for}} the following two ironclad designs, the , also designed by Brin and <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> 1876, and the , designed by Giuseppe Micheli and <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> 188182.|$|E

5|$|The four Bayern-class {{ships were}} the first super-dreadnoughts built by the German navy. The class {{comprised}} Bayern, Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg.

Only Baden and Bayern were completed, as ship building priorities shifted as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, Bayern and Baden were the last German battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine.|$|E
