The free nobles under a prince {{may have a}} bond of vassalage that <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>get</b> out of serving, so kings, princes, bishops and archbishops were able to recruit unfree persons into military service. Such a body made up the group called ministeriales.|$|E
2500|$|... but the peloton did not <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>get</b> away {{very far}} until Dumoulin and Schröder {{broke away from}} the group. The other six were caught and Dumoulin and Schröder were allowed to take a lead of up to 12'50" [...] over the peloton. Meanwhile, the sprinters in the peloton did not want to sprint for the 2 points left at the three {{intermediate}} sprints, so every time Johan Van Summeren attacked just a few kilometers before every sprint to take the points. Jérôme Pineau also was very active today, as he did the same thing as Van Summeren but then on the climbs, taking points to maintain his lead in the standings for the polka dot jersey.|$|E
2500|$|Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines {{broadcast}} radio shows suggesting {{the end to}} toleration of the Tutsi, repeating the Hutu Ten Commandments, and building support for the Hutu Power ideology. Two main voices of RTLM were announcers Valérie Bemeriki and Georges Ruggiu. The repetition of Hutu Ten Commandments {{was an attempt to}} mobilize the population to help eradicate the Tutsi, who were portrayed as threatening the social and political order achieved since independence, and as envisioned by the Akazu. Politician Léon Mugesera gave a speech in November, 1992, allegedly stating, [...] "Do not be afraid, know that anyone whose neck you do not cut is the one who will cut your neck...Let them pack their bags, <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>get</b> going, so that no one will return here to talk and no one will bring scraps claiming to be flags!" [...] The radio programs frequently referred to the Tutsi as inyenzi, a Kinyarwanda word meaning 'cockroach', though the term had also been a self-description by members of the Rwanda Patriotic Front.|$|E

2500|$|The Ratline {{experience}} culminates with Resurrection Week {{ending in}} [...] "Breakout," [...] an event where the Rats are formally [...] "welcomed" [...] to the VMI community. After the {{successful completion of}} Breakout, Rats are officially fourth class students and {{no longer have to}} strain in the barracks or eat [...] "square meals." [...] Many versions of the Breakout ceremony have been conducted. In the 1950s, Rats from each company would be packed into a corner room in the barracks and brawl their way out through the upperclassmen. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s the Rats had to fight their way up to the fourth level of the barracks through three other classes of cadets determined not to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>get</b> to the top. The stoops would often be slick with motor oil, packed with snow, glazed with ice, greased, or continuously hosed with water. The barracks stairs and rails were not able to take the abuse, so the Corps moved the breakout to a muddy hill, where Rats attempt to climb to the top by crawling on their stomachs while the upper classes block them or drag them back down. The Rats no longer breakout in the mud but instead participate in a grueling day of physical activity testing both physical endurance and teamwork.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but I feel pretty strongly that we don't want to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>get</b> away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic {{reviewer}} Alex Henderson {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "This is essentially a folk recording, although Lang's brand of folk easily incorporates elements of southern country blues, bluegrass, and Appalachian music...
