40|$|The {{generalized}} truck-and-trailer routing problem (GTTRP) {{constitutes a}} uni model for vehicle routing problems with trailers and a fixed lorry-trailer assignment. The GTTRP is a generalization of the truck-and-trailer routing problem (TTRP), which itself {{is an extension}} of the well-known vehicle routing problem (VRP). In the GTTRP, the vehicle fleet consists of single lorries and lorry-trailer combinations. Some customers may be visited only by a single lorry or by a lorry without its trailer, some may also be visited by a <b>lorry-trailer</b> <b>combination.</b> In addition to the customer locations, there is another relevant type of location, called transshipment location, where trailers can be parked and where a load transfer from a lorry to its trailer can be performed. In this paper, two mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations for the GTTRP are presented. Moreover, an exact solution procedure for the problem, a branch-and-price algorithm, and heuristic variants of this algorithm are described. Computational experiments with the algorithms are presented and discussed. The experiments are performed on randomly generated instances structured to resemble real-world situations and on TTRP benchmark instances from the literature. The results of the experiments show that instances of realistic structure and size can be solved in short time and with high solution quality by a heuristic algorithm based on column generation...|$|E

El GTTRP es una generalización del truck-and-trailer routing problem (TTRP), que es una extensión del conocido problema de rutas de vehículos (vehicle routing problem, VRP). En el GTTRP, la flota de vehículos consiste en camiones sin remolque (camiones solos) y trenes de carretera. Algunos clientes pueden ser visitados exclusivamente por un camión solo o un camión sin su remolque, otros pueden ser visitados también por un tren de carretera. Además de las ubicaciones de los clientes hay otro tipo de localización llamada ubicación de trasbordo. Allí los remolques pueden ser aparcados, y es posible efectuar un trasbordo de carga desde un camión a su remolque. En este trabajo se presentan dos modelos de programación lineal entero mixto (MIP). Además, se describen un algoritmo exacto branch-and-price y variantes heurísticas de este algoritmo. Se presentan y analizan estudios computacionales con los algoritmos. Se usan problemas generados aleatoriamente, diseñados para semejar situaciones reales, y problemas TTRP de la literatura. Los resultados muestran que, utilizando un algoritmo heurístico basado en generación de columnas, se pueden resolver problemas de estructura y tamaño real en poco tiempo y con solución de alta calidad...|$|E
40|$|This study mainly {{examines}} the traffic safety {{effects of the}} following measures: (1) An increase in the articulated vehicle speed limit from 60 km/h to 80 km/h on the secondary road network. The background to this measure is that the 60 km/h regulation for both <b>lorry-trailer</b> <b>combinations</b> and for buses with multi-axle trailers will not {{be included in the}} revised Traffic Regulations and Road Traffic Signs Code (RVV 1990). (2) The general speed limit increase for lorries from 80 km/h to 90 km/h. A general or maximum speed limit of 90 km/h for lorries is under discussion {{within the framework of the}} harmonization of the European legislation. Both measures should be judged differently, when evaluating them as an indication for the required speed behaviour. Compliance to the 80 km/h speed limit for articulated vehicles on the secondary road network is expected to have a negative traffic safety effect. Compliance to the 90 km/h speed limit for lorries on motorways is expected to have a positive traffic safety effect...|$|R
