5|$|Puerto Rico's turtle fauna {{includes}} both freshwater (5 species, including two extinct species) and marine turtles (5). Two of these species, the hawksbill turtle and the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> are critically endangered. Threats to these species include habitat destruction and illegal capture of eggs and individuals. The spectacled caiman, an introduced species, {{is the only}} representative of the order Crocodilia in Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers {{are difficult to}} determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat {{that had previously}} been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.|$|E

25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} the sea turtle populations, five species are known to nest in Burma at well known island and {{mainland}} beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the {{olive ridley sea turtle}} (Lepidochelys olivacea), the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>turtles</b> can {{sometimes}} {{escape from the}} trawls. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kemp’s ridley turtles recorded most interactions, followed in order by loggerhead, green, and <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> In the US Atlantic, the interactions were greatest for loggerheads, followed in order by Kemp’s ridley, <b>leatherback,</b> and green <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{coloration}} of mosasaurs {{was unknown}} until 2014, when {{the findings of}} Johan Lindgren of Lund University and colleagues revealed the pigment melanin in the fossilized scales of a mosasaur. Mosasaurs were likely countershaded, with dark backs and light underbellies, much like a great white shark or <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> the latter of which had fossilized ancestors for which color was also determined. The findings were described in the journal Nature.|$|E
500|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) {{extinction}} event, {{also known}} as the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K–T) extinction, was a mass extinction of some three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth that occurred over a geologically short period of time, approximately 65 million years ago. With the exception of some ectothermic species such as the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and crocodiles, no tetrapods weighing more than [...] survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and with it, the entire Mesozoic Era, opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today.|$|E
500|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is the world's largest {{hard-shelled}} turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the green sea turtle and the Galapagos tortoise.

50|$|There are two nature {{preserves}} {{located in}} the estuary region on the Surinamese side of the river, {{near the village of}} Galibi. They provide protection for the birds and the <b>Leatherback</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtles</b> that hatch there.|$|R
500|$|Carl Linnaeus {{gave the}} loggerhead its first {{binomial}} name, Testudo caretta, in 1758. Thirty-five other names emerged {{over the following}} two centuries, with the combination Caretta caretta first introduced in 1902 by Leonhard Stejneger. The English common name [...] "loggerhead" [...] refers to the animal's large head. The loggerhead sea turtle belongs to the family Cheloniidae, which includes all extant sea turtles except the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle.</b> The subspecific classification of the loggerhead sea turtle is debated, but most authors consider it a single polymorphic species. Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the loggerhead sea turtle with the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, and green sea turtles. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second-generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting some hybrids are fertile.|$|E
500|$|While the jaguar often {{employs the}} deep throat-bite and {{suffocation}} technique typical among Panthera, it sometimes uses a killing method unique amongst cats: it pierces directly through the temporal {{bones of the}} skull between the ears of prey (especially the capybara) with its canine teeth, piercing the brain. This may be an adaptation to [...] "cracking open" [...] turtle shells; following the late Pleistocene extinctions, armored reptiles such as turtles would have formed an abundant prey base for the jaguar. The skull bite is employed with mammals in particular; with reptiles such as the caiman, the jaguar may leap {{onto the back of}} the prey and sever the cervical vertebrae, immobilizing the target. When attacking sea turtles, including the huge <b>Leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> which weighs about [...] on average, as they try to nest on beaches, the jaguar will bite at the head, often beheading the prey, before dragging it off to eat. Reportedly, while hunting horses, a jaguar may leap onto their back, place one paw on the muzzle and another on the nape and then twist, dislocating the neck. Local people have anecdotally reported that when hunting a pair of horses bound together, the jaguar will kill one horse and then drag it while the other horse, still living, is dragged in their wake. [...] With prey such as smaller dogs, a paw swipe to the skull may be sufficient to kill it.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{total of}} 5 {{different}} species of marine turtle that are sighted periodically in the islands, {{the most common of}} these being the endangered loggerhead sea turtle. The other four are the green sea turtle, hawksbill sea turtle, <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and Kemp's ridley sea turtle. Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [...] However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.|$|E
50|$|Sherbro Island is {{believed}} to be a breeding ground for green <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> as well as <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> The waters surrounding the island hold some of the biggest tarpon in the world. Records of the sportfishing organisation IGFA have been made by catches from this area.|$|R
50|$|<b>Leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are known}} to lay large {{clutches}} of viable eggs interspersed with yolkless eggs. This {{may be due to}} too much albumen, or it may function to separate viable eggs from each other and thereby improve gas exchange.|$|R
50|$|Turtles are ectotherms—animals {{commonly}} called cold-blooded—meaning that their internal temperature {{varies according to}} the ambient environment. However, because of their high metabolic rate, <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> have a body temperature that is noticeably {{higher than that of}} the surrounding water.|$|R
2500|$|Coconut crabs (Birgus latro) {{live on the}} islets, {{which are}} also nesting sites for the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) ("Fonu" [...] in tuvaluan). The IUCN Red List {{identifies}} only the green turtle as being found in Tuvalu. The green turtle is recognised as critically endangered. The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) lists 2 additional turtle species as being found in Tuvalu: hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys Imbricate) and <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea), with both species being recognised as critically endangered.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seagrass}} beds, {{which forms}} {{an area of}} around [...] across the island, [...] provide crucial food for turtles and [...] dugongs, with four species of marine turtles reported: Chelonia mydas (green sea turtle), Dermochelys coriacea (<b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle),</b> and [...] Eretmochelys imbricata (Hawksbill sea turtle) and Lepidochelys olivacea (Olive Ridley sea turtle). There are 7 species of seagrass reported here, out of 14 found in the Lakshadweep Islands, including the Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea rotundata. Seaweeds recorded consist of 34 species, out of which 14 species are of Rhodophyceae, 13 (red algae) [...] are Chlorophyceae (green algae) and 7 species are Phaeophyceae (brown algae). 20 species of Phytoplankton and 19 groups of Zooplankton have been recorded in the reef slope and lagoon area; 33 species of benthic organisms have also been noted in the same vicinity.|$|E
2500|$|A disease {{known as}} fibropapillomatosis {{manifests itself in}} turtles through {{external}} tumors. [...] These tumors often grow to be so large that they hinder a sea turtle’s ability to see, eat, and swim, therefore rendering the sea turtle unable to survive. [...] Inexplicably, {{the majority of the}} cases of fibropapillomatosis have been diagnosed in the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) while none have been in the <b>leatherback</b> <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea). [...] Cases of this disease have been found in all major oceans. [...] Although the causes of this disease are not clear, many believe the source to be viral. [...] These tumors are either smooth or contain pointed projections and they are red, pink, grey, black, or purple in color. These tumors are usually located anywhere on the soft skin tissue of the sea turtle, either the neck, eyes, or bottom of the flippers and range in size anywhere from a pea to a grapefruit.|$|E
