40|$|This thesis covers angle-resolved {{spectrophotometric}} {{measurements and}} modelling of diffuse reflectance and luminescence. Most {{of the work}} related to diffuse reflectance is performed in view of providing SI-traceability to radiative transfer codes used in Earth observation. The angle-resolved measurements of luminescent surfaces are used to study goniometrical properties of reflectance and luminescence of reference materials used in appearance measurements. Radiative transfer models that simulate the transmission of light through atmosphere and vegetation are used to interpret the measurements of on-orbit sensors. One way of validating these models is using artificial targets that are characterised by SI-traceable measurements of reflectance and shape. The bidirectional reflectance factors of many roughened anodised and non-anodised surfaces were measured, and {{used to test the}} suitability of micro-facet scattering functions to present the scattering properties of such surfaces. Based on the results, a grooved and an identical flat target were constructed and characterised for bidirectional reflectance factors. The bidirectional reflectance factors of the flat target were used to parametrise the scattering functions for rough surfaces. The grooved target was measured for its coordinates describing shape, which were used to construct a structural model of the grooved target. The structural model, with its optical properties defined by the parametrised scattering functions, was used to simulate the bidirectional reflectance factors of the grooved target with the tested radiative transfer model. The measured and modelled bidirectional reflectance factors agreed within corresponding expanded uncertainties for most of the measured geometries, but not all. Non-Lambertian emission of luminescence from solid luminescent materials has been established, however, instrumentation for angle-resolved measurements of luminescence have not been readily available. The MIKES-Aalto goniofluorometer was extensively characterised to improve the accuracy of bispectral <b>luminescent</b> <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> measurements. In addition, a method for goniometrical measurements of quantum efficiency and quantum yield was validated against interlaboratory measurements. The improved measurement capability was used to describe absorbance dependent reflectance angular profiles in solid amorphous luminescent materials. In addition, a reference material for luminescence measurements was proposed and characterised. The new material showed more Lambertian angular luminescence emission and reflectance profiles than the conventionally used materials...|$|E
40|$|Reflectance and {{fluorescence}} {{are important}} properties when determining the colour and appearance of solid opaque material. They are also useful {{in several other}} industrial applications {{such as those in}} biochemical and medical industry and in remote sensing. In most industrial applications, the reflectance and / or fluorescence characteristics of samples are measured relative to a known reference standard. The uncertainty of the measurements is naturally dependent on the uncertainty of the reference standard and therefore it is vital to have high-accuracy calibration instruments capable of absolute measurements. In addition, the standards should be calibrated in the same measurement geometry as the application where they are used. Particularly, instruments capable of absolute fluorescence measurements commonly use a fixed measurement geometry and therefore {{there is a need for}} an instrument that does not have this limitation. In the thesis, goniometric measurement facilities for measuring reflectance and fluorescence characteristics of reference standards have been designed and developed. The significance of light scattering in goniometric diffuse reflectance measurements has been studied. The effect can cause errors of the order of 1 % in the measurements if it is not properly taken into account. Also, this effect may be at least partly responsible for the discrepancies reported earlier between goniometric and integrating-sphere-based diffuse reflectance measurements. The wavelength range of an existing gonioreflectometer for calibrating reflectance and <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> has been extended and an extensive bilateral comparison in the wavelength range 250 nm - 1650 nm is reported. Such extensive comparisons between goniometric instruments are very rare even though it is the only way to verify the reliability of the absolute scales in National Metrology Institutes. A goniofluorometer has been designed and developed for measuring bispectral <b>luminescent</b> <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> in various measurement geometries. Also, the theory and mathematics of a new method for measuring absolute fluorescence quantum yield based on goniometric measurements has been derived. One of the most significant results of this thesis is the discovery of non-Lambertian behaviour of fluorescence emission from solid amorphous material. In addition, it has been observed that the angular pattern of fluorescence emission is not very tightly linked to the angular pattern of reflectance. This is an important result since most commercial and research instruments are only capable of measurements in a fixed geometry and usually rely on the assumption of Lambertian emission of fluorescence...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent {{effects have}} been {{observed}} for thousands of years. Stokes, in 1852, began the science of fluorescence culminating in his law of fluorescence, which explained that fluorescence emission occurs at longer wavelengths than the excitation wavelength. This phenomenon is observed extensively in the art world. Daylight fluorescent colors known as Day-Glo have become an artistic medium since the 1960 s. Modern artists exploit these saturated and brilliant colors to glitter their painting. Multispectral imaging as a noninvasive technique {{has been used for}} archiving by museums and cultural-heritage institutions for about a decade. The complex fluorescence phenomenon has been often ignored in the multispectral projects. The ignored fluorescence results in errors in digital imaging of artwork containing fluorescent colors. The illuminant-dependency of the fluorescence radiance makes the fluorescence colorimetry and consequently spectral imaging more complex. In this dissertation an abridged imaging bi-spectrometer for artwork containing both fluorescent and non-fluorescent colors was developed. The method developed included two stages of reconstruction of the spectral reflected <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> and prediction of the fluorescent <b>radiance</b> <b>factor.</b> The estimation of the reflected <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> as a light source independent component was achieved by imaging with a series of short-wavelength cutoff filters placed in the illumination path. The fluorescent <b>radiance</b> <b>factor,</b> a light source dependent component, was estimated based on a proposed model, the abridged two-monochromator method. The abridged two-monochromator method was developed for reconstructing the bi-spectral matrix of a fluorescent color based on a calibrated UV-fluorescence imaging. In this way, one could predict the fluorescence <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> under any desired illuminant and consequently a better color evaluation and rendering could be obtained. Furthermore, this method easily fitted in a general system for spectral imaging of paintings containing both fluorescent and non-fluorescent colors. The abridged two-monochromator method could predict fluorescent <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> of a fluorescent color via prediction of the true emission and the number of absorbed quanta by a fluorescing specimen for a given viewing light source. The superiority of the abridged fluorescence spectral imaging to the traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging for a few light sources was confirmed using fluorescent and non-fluorescent targets. Additionally, an exploratory visual experiment using a paired-comparison method was performed to evaluate the performance of the abridged fluorescence spectral imaging in comparison to the traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging for rendering images of a reference painting. The abridged fluorescence spectral imaging had better performance than traditional spectral and colorimetric imaging in rendering images for daylight...|$|R
40|$|It has earlier {{been shown}} that light {{reflected}} {{from the body of}} paper exhibit anisotropic behavior. On the other hand, fluorescence emission is often assumed to be distributed in a Lambertian manner. The angular behavior of light reflected and fluoresced from paper is examined using measurements from a spectral goniophotometer. The angular dependency of the <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> was measured for a range of excitation wavelengths. Moreover, the influence of fillers and fluorescent whitening agents (FWA) on the anisotropy was studied. The measurements show that the anisotropy of the total <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> of paper decreases when an increasing amount of FWA is added to the paper. The same effect was also observed when an increased amount of filler was added to the paper. In addition, it was shown that the presence of fillers reduce the effect of the FWA. The results show that in comparison to the anisotropy of the total <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> from the paper samples, the anisotropy of the fluorescence alone is negligible. Hence, for paper samples containing FWA evenly distributed in the bulk, the fluorescence alone should not induce significant differences between color measuring instruments of different measurement geometries...|$|R

40|$|During {{recent years}} the need for {{accurate}} color measurements has been increasing. One of the most wide spread techniques to measure color is based on spectrophotometric measurements. However, when dealing with hardcopy materials (paper and inks) that contain fluorescent components, the color measurements become questionable. Conventional spectrophotometers measure total <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> of fluorescent materials for the light source within the instrument. Such measurements cannot be used to obtain accurate colorimetry for other illuminants or sources. On the other hand using bispectral methods, which measure reflected and fluorescent spectral <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> {{as a function of}} incident wavelength, produces illuminant independent data and thus more accurate colorimetric calculations. The main goal of the present work is to determine colorimetric errors created by conventional spectrophotometry compared to bispectral measurements for a collection of printed materials.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{feasible}} method of computer colour matching involving fluorescent dyes was developed. An ordinary abridged-spectroreflectometer with polychomatic illumination and a simulated D 65 xenon light source was employed for all measurements. In {{addition to the}} normal K/S constants for non-fluorescent dyes and the non-fluorescent portion of the fluorescent dye' [...] constants responsible for the fluorescent portion were necessary. Two sets of equations to relate the total <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> of dyeings with a fluorescent dye and its concentration were developed respectively for self and compound shades where a non-fluorescent dye is admixed. Finding constants responsible for the compound shades required a number of calibration mixture dyeings. Negative K/S constants were found useful when the total <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> was above that for the substrate but below one hundred. Three computer programs? s were developed to deal with calibration constants for self and compound shade and also for match prediction. Optimization was used in all cases to minimize errors in total <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> or colour differences. Half of the actual dyeingq formulations from the predicted were visually passed {{by a panel of}} five dyers. In this study, disperse dyes on polyester were used. Moreover, a commercial matching package was studied using non-fluorescent dyes. The dyeing system affected its accuracy.

The impact of this LED illumination for various colorimetric applications has been generally considered {{in terms of its}} colour rendering index (CRI). However, for certain applications, such as the whiteness assessment of papers, this performance metric is insufficient since it only considers the spectral power distribution (SPD) in the visible range. To improve the appearance and commercial value of white paper, papermakers often use fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) which absorb in the near-UV and emit in the blue region. The shape and intensity of this added fluorescent light depend critically on the SPD of the irradiating source in both the UV and visible wavelength regions.

This builds upon the work reported in part-one of this series which described in detail the design, characterization and validation of this new instrument for realizing a total spectral <b>radiance</b> <b>factor</b> scale in a bidirectional (45 a: 0) geometry. To extend the measurement capabilities to a sphere geometry, it was configured with a large diameter integrating sphere accessory. Preliminary results using a substitution-mode operating procedure showed large sphere errors that were characterized and corrected for. To improve this traceability, the sphere was modified to operate in comparison-mode and this effectively eliminated many of the sphere-related errors that typically limit the accuracy of sphere-based fluorescence measurements. The performance of the instrument configured for a sphere geometry (8 :d) with this modified sphere design has been validated by means of comparison measurements of both non-fluorescent and fluorescent artifacts. The reflectance component has been validated using non-fluorescent comparison samples that have been calibrated under the same geometric conditions with traceability to the NRC Absolute Reflectometer (d: 0 geometry). The fluorescent-only component has been validated using near-Lambertian fluorescent reflecting materials with traceability to the NRC Reference Spectrofluorimeter (45 : 0 geometry), under the assumption that this component is nearly the same for these two geometries.

This feature appears on the night every 9 terrestrial days during more than 8 months, and introduces a dramatic and abrupt increase of the cloud opacity and reducing the thermal <b>radiance</b> in a <b>factor</b> of about 1 : 2 from its brightest to the darkest side.

40|$|An {{approximate}} analytic {{solution is}} derived for the radiative transfer equation describing particulate surface light scattering, {{taking into account}} multiple scattering and mutual shadowing. Analytical expressions for the following quantities are found: bidirectional reflectance, <b>radiance</b> coefficient and <b>factor,</b> the normal, Bond, hemispherical, and physical albedos, integral phase function and phase integral, and limb-darkening profile. Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as corrections for comparisons of experimental transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra. The theory should be useful for the interpretation of reflectance spectroscopy of laboratory surfaces and the photometry of solar system objects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Rosetta {{mission of}} the European Space Agency has been {{orbiting}} the comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P) since August 2014 {{and is now in}} its escort phase. A large complement of scientific experiments designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted are onboard Rosetta. Aims. We present results for the photometric and spectrophotometric properties of the nucleus of 67 P derived from the OSIRIS imaging system, which consists of a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC). The observations presented here were performed during July and the beginning of August 2014, during the approach phase, when OSIRIS was mapping the surface of the comet with several filters at different phase angles (1. 3 °– 54 °). The resolution reached up to 2. 1 m/px. Methods. The OSIRIS images were processed with the OSIRIS standard pipeline, then converted into I/F <b>radiance</b> <b>factors</b> and corrected for the illumination conditions at each pixel using the Lommel-Seeliger disk law. Color cubes of the surface were produced by stacking registered and illumination-corrected images. Furthermore, photometric analysis was performed both on disk-averaged photometry in several filters and on disk-resolved images acquired with the NAC orange filter, centered at 649 nm, using Hapke modeling. Results. The disk-averaged phase function of the nucleus of 67 P shows a strong opposition surge with a G parameter value of - 0. 13 ± 0. 01 in the HG system formalism and an absolute magnitude Hv (1, 1, 0) = 15. 74 ± 0. 02 mag. The integrated spectrophotometry in 20 filters covering the 250 - 1000 nm wavelength range shows a red spectral behavior, without clear absorption bands except for a potential absorption centered at ∼ 290 nm that is possibly due to SO 2 ice. The nucleus shows strong phase reddening, with disk- averaged spectral slopes increasing from 11 %/(100 nm) to 16 %/(100 nm) in the 1. 3 °– 54 ° phase angle range. The geometric albedo of the comet is 6. 5 ± 0. 2 % at 649 nm, with local variations of up to ∼ 16 % in the Hapi region. From the disk-resolved images we computed the spectral slope together with local spectrophotometry and identified three distinct groups of regions (blue, moderately red, and red). The Hapi region is the brightest, the bluest in term of spectral slope, and the most active surface on the comet. Local spectrophotometry shows an enhancement of the flux in the 700 - 750 nm that is associated with coma emissions...|$|R
40|$|The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) was {{launched}} on 23 January 2009 to monitor global distributions {{of carbon dioxide}} and methane. The Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard GOSAT measures short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrum, and its radiometric accuracy directly influences the accuracy of the retrieved greenhouse gas concentrations. From a 2. 5 -yr retrieval analysis of GOSAT data, we found that the minimum of the mean-squared value of the residuals (the difference between observed and fitted spectra) and the <b>radiance</b> adjustment <b>factor</b> (one of the ancillary parameter to be retrieved with the gas concentrations for adjusting the radiance level between the bands) changed with time, possibly due to inaccurate degradation correction. In this study, the radiometric degradation of TANSO-FTS was evaluated from the on-orbit solar calibration data and modeled as a function of time and wavenumber for each spectral band. The radiometric degradation of TANSO-FTS Band 1 (centered at 0. 76 &mu;m) after the launch was evaluated to be about 4 to 6 %, varying with wavenumber, whereas the other two bands (Band 2 : 1. 6 &mu;m and Band 3 : 2. 0 &mu;m) showed about 1 % degradation and small wavenumber dependency. When we applied the new degradation model in the retrieval analysis, the above-mentioned issues disappeared...|$|R
40|$|The across-track {{illumination}} {{variation in}} Earth Observing- 1 (EO 1) Hyperion images {{is a result}} of wavelength-shift and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) -shift in the cross-track direction. Correction in across-track illumination variation is necessary for accurate spectral matching and classification. This contribution reviews the available methods for the correction of across-track illumination variation, and evaluates them for correcting a Hyperion image of study area around the Udaipur city in western India. We also describe and demonstrated a new technique for correcting these artefacts. For each band, the spatial trends of (a) nonlinear shifts in the nominal centre wavelengths of bands across the image columns and (b) nonlinear changes in the nominal FWHM of bands across the image columns are modelled using quadratic regression and are compensated using a <b>radiance</b> correction <b>factor</b> estimated from the columns characterized by minimum illumination variations in a spectrally flat area of the image. A series of statistical measures, spectral matching, minimum noise fraction transform (MNF) images, and post-correction classification results were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm vis-a-vis some of the previous methods on the Hyperion image of the study area. The results indicate that the proposed method effectively corrects the across-track illumination effects in the Hyperion image of the study area, and also show better performance in lithological as well as for land-use and land-cover mapping, as compared to the other previous methods...|$|R
40|$|Rosetta, the Solar System {{cornerstone}} {{mission of}} ESA's Horizon 2000 programme, {{consists of an}} orbiter and a lander, and is due {{to arrive at the}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in May 2014. Following its 2004 launch, Rosetta carried out a series of planetary fly-bys and gravitational assists. On these close fly-bys of the Earth, measurements were taken by the Visible Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS). Analysis of these spectra and comparison with spectra acquired by Earth-observing satellites can support the verification of the inflight calibration of Rosetta/VIRTIS. In this paper, measurements taken by VIRTIS in November 2009 are compared with suitable coincident data from Earth-observing instruments (ESA-ENVISAT/AATSR and SCIAMACHY, and EOS-TERRA/MODIS). Radiative transfer simulations using NEMESIS (Irwin et al., 2008) are fit to the fly-by data taken by VIRTIS, using representative atmospheric and surface parameters. VIRTIS measurements correlate 90 % with AATSR's, 85 - 94 % with MODIS, and 82 - 88 % with SCIAMACHYs. The VIRTIS spectra are reproducible in the 1 - 5 μm region, except in the 1. 4 μm deep water vapour spectral absorption band in the near-infrared in cases in which the radiance is very low (cloud-free topographies), where VIRTIS consistently registers more radiance than do MODIS and SCIAMACHY. Over these cloud-free regions, VIRTIS registers <b>radiances</b> a <b>factor</b> of 3 - 10 larger than SCIAMACHY and of 3 - 8 greater than MODIS. It is speculated that this discrepancy could be due to a spectral light leak originating from reflections from the order-sorting filters above the detector around 1. 4 μm. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Overheating, high cooling {{energy demand}} and glare are {{recurrent}} problems in office buildings in Santiago and Valparaíso, Chile. Santiago (33 °S) presents a Mediterranean climate, {{with a high}} temperature oscillation between day and night during cooling period. Valparaiso (33 °S), by the coast, shows lower temperature fluctuation compared with Santiago. In order to evaluate impact on thermal and lighting performance of office buildings of these cities, a sensitivity study has been made. Variations on window façade area, type of glazing, orientation, solar protection and nocturnal ventilation and respective impact on cooling energy demand and lighting performance has been considered. The methodology includes an evaluation of heating and cooling demand and variation of indoor temperature when no conditioning system is applied. For this purpose a simulation software under dynamic conditions was used (TAS). The effect on natural lighting was also analysed using <b>Radiance</b> software. Daylight <b>Factor,</b> Daylight Autonomy (DA) and Useful Daylight Iluminance (UDI) were used in this analysis, considering different sky conditions. Completely glazed facades, even with selective glazing are not recommended for these cities. Glare problems are possible to be avoided with appropriated solar protection, orientation of windows and selective glazing...|$|R
