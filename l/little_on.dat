5|$|The {{timeline}} of Ivalice {{as presented}} in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said <b>little</b> <b>on</b> the matter. A few sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice. The official timeline, however, was eventually given in the Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Omega, and placed the events of Final Fantasy XII before those of Final Fantasy Tactics.|$|E

These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave {{the bulk of the}} fossil on one side and <b>little</b> <b>on</b> the other.|$|E

5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is <b>little</b> <b>on</b> the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have been initiated, but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E
5|$|Morrell left Arsenal {{during the}} First World War and James McEwen served as {{caretaker}} manager, presiding over two matches. Both managers' work over 1914–15 resulted in Arsenal finishing in fifth place and aided the club's re-election to the First Division. When professional football resumed in 1919, Norris appointed Leslie Knighton as the club's manager. Arsenal remained under financial strain {{during this period}} and stagnated in the league; Kingston in his autobiography claimed he was under strict instruction to spend <b>little</b> <b>on</b> transfers. His working relationship with Norris moreover deteriorated and in 1925 he was dismissed. The decision to sack Knighton {{was said to have}} been made following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham United in the FA Cup, a competition which presented the club's only realistic chance of silverware.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{served under}} George Washington in the Braddock Expedition, a {{failed attempt to}} capture Fort Duquesne from the French. For most of 1756 and {{the early part of}} 1757, he divided his time between Fort Cumberland and Fort Washington, {{conducting}} scouting and escort missions. In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to Captain Robert McKenzie at Fort Pearsall. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned <b>little</b> <b>on</b> either mission. In November, Scott was part of the Forbes Expedition that captured the fort. He spent {{the latter part of the}} year at Fort Loudoun, where Washington promoted him to ensign.|$|E

5|$|The French media {{reported}} <b>little</b> <b>on</b> {{the event}} as it happened, and relatively little {{mention of the}} nationalist struggle was mentioned in Les Temps Modernes, the leftist publication that would become considered the leading anti-colonial advocate after {{the launch of the}} French offensive in Indochina. Other private publications served as forums for the Francophone intelligentsia to express their condemnation of the French government's response to the Uprising. The most commentary appeared in the left-leaning Catholic monthly L'Esprit, with criticisms also published in other leftist publications like Humanité, Combat, Franc-tireur and Témoignage Chrétien. Albert Camus penned a seething rebuke of the French colonial administration that was published on 10 May 1947 in Combat. Very few details of the rising and subsequent repression were reported at the time outside France.|$|E

25|$|Many street {{children}} spend 300 rupees {{a month on}} movies, though older children also use their money to buy cigarettes, chewing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.
