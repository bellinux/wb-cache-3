40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared video {{observations}} {{were used to}} study behaviour in the nestboxes of both adult wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> A total of 1080 hours of observations of wild rabbits and 1008 hours of observations of <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> kept in two enclosures with free access to two nestboxes and some other hiding-places were analysed. Both wild and <b>domestic</b> adult <b>rabbits</b> spent a considerable part of their time (54. 9 % in wild and 30. 6 % in <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits)</b> in pairs or in groups of three and voluntarily were in body contact between 65. 3 % (<b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits)</b> and 80. 4 % (wild rabbits) of the time. While crouching together, both wild and <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> used {{only a very small}} nestbox space: 0. 08 to 0. 125 m 2 /animal in wild and 0. 14 to 0. 21 m 2 /animal in <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m., an average of 2. 9 animals from a maximum of 3 wild rabbits stayed in the nestboxes. <b>Domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> used nestboxes less: an average of 0. 9 adults were in the nestbox between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m.

40|$|Chlamydia spp. are obligate {{intracellular}} bacteria distributed {{all over}} the world, known to cause various forms of diseases in animals and humans. In the present study, a serological survey was conducted to detect the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with rabbit chlamydiosis in northeast China, including Liaoning province, Jilin province, Heilongjiang province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

40|$|A benign, infectiqus, {{cutaneous}} tumor of rabbits, the Shope papilloma, {{is caused}} by a virus that upon inoculation in either <b>domestic</b> or cottontail <b>rabbits</b> induces papiUomas with great regularity (1). These tumors are not infrequently followed by cancers (2 - 6). On attempted recovery of the virus from these two varieties of rabbits, however, a marked difference in host reactivity becomes apparent; for the virus, which is readily recoverable from cottontail rabbits, is not recoverable, or but rarely recoverable, from <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits</b> (1, 7 - 9). This finding does not prove, of course, that the virus is absent from the papillomas of <b>domestic</b> <b>rabbits.</b> On the contrary, some immunological evidence for its presence in such papillomas and in the cancers derived from them has been presented (10, 11).
