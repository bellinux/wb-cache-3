Furthermore, a descriptive sensory analysis (flavour and texture) was performed in the final product (day 71). Time-related changes were observed for most of the characteristics studied. The effect of tumbling was only observed for the sensory attribute pastiness that was higher in tumbled legs. Methyl-branched butanal was only detected in tumbled legs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|On {{completion}} of all sonications in each <b>lamb</b> <b>leg,</b> three-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted images were re-acquired {{to assess the}} conspicuity of any thermal lesions that had been generated. An echo time of 2.3 ms and flip angle of 20 o were selected to maximise contrast between lesions and normal tissue, based on the expected T 1 values of muscle tissue at 3 T [22]. In addition, for maximum potential lesion conspicuity, {{an attempt was made}} to generate large thermal lesions in <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> number 8 by doubly sonicating two 4  mm cells at 160 W and by sonicating two 8  mm cells at 160 W and 200 W, achieved by operating the Sonalleve in uterine-mode, rather than bone-mode. After sonications, DWI and T 1 -weighted sequences were acquired. In addition, T 1 -weighted fat suppressed volume interpolated and T 2 -weighted images with and without fat suppression were obtained. In each case, parameters were selected to maximise image contrast between thermal lesions and un-sonicated regions, e.g. using a short echo time of 40 – 60 ms in the T 2 -weighted sequences, for an expected muscle T 2 value of approximately 50 ms [22].|$|R

30|$|After each sonication, the DWI {{sequence}} {{was acquired}} five more times at approximately 4  min intervals. The first was {{immediately after the}} mandatory thermal cooling monitoring period and the last approximately 20 min after sonication. The process was repeated for every sonication in each <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> during each imaging session.

30|$|As ADC is {{temperature}} dependent [21], it {{was important}} to understand the temperature behaviour of the ex-vivo <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> samples before and after sonication. Room temperature was measured using a standard alcohol thermometer. All other temperature measurements were made from a PRFS thermometry sequence using an echo planar imaging (EPI) accelerated, multi-slice two-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted sequence, acquired as a dynamic series (repetition time 25 ms, echo time 16 ms, flip angle 18 o, EPI factor 11, fat suppression ProSet, number of signal averages 2, voxel size 2.1 × 2.1 × 7.0 mm 3, field of view 400 × 300 mm 2, dynamic scan time 3 s). Data were obtained from three 7  mm thick slices automatically placed orthogonally through the treatment focus. In <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> number 1, six separate 1 min acquisitions of PRFS data (23 dynamics) were first performed in each of three separate cortical locations to determine the stability and accuracy of the PRFS predicted temperature. This was compared to the measured room/lamb leg temperature. The same sequence was then acquired before, during, and after sonication of a 4 and 12  mm cell at the maximum power permissible at each cell size (190 W for the 4  mm cell, 80 W for the 12  mm cell). Data were obtained for the maximum cooling period for which temperature data were available.|$|R

30|$|Ex-vivo <b>lamb</b> <b>legs</b> {{were used}} in this study because they {{represented}} a reasonable model without resorting to in-vivo animal models and allowed for macroscopic inspection of sliced tissues after exposure. The model was not ideal because there was no active perfusion, and samples were not at a physiological temperature. In vivo, it is likely that perfusion would contribute substantially to tissue cooling. The dissipation of heat may mean that the relationship between thermal dose, ADC, and tissue damage is influenced by local blood supply [27]. We are therefore extending the current work by evaluating the repeatability, temporal evolution, and permanence of ADC changes during MR-guided HIFU treatments for palliating pain from bone metastases in patients recruited to a clinical study [28] at our institution.|$|R

30|$|Prior to exposures, limited {{coverage}} three-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted images were acquired at interfaces between the membrane, gelpad, and <b>lamb</b> <b>leg</b> samples.

High-resolution (1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 voxel) three-dimensional gradient-echo T 1 -weighted imaging of each whole sample was then acquired and exported to the Sonalleve for treatment planning. Sonications were planned with the focus located on the outer bony cortex (the direct approach [19]).

Care was taken to ensure that sonications were placed far enough apart to avoid heating the location of neighbouring exposures and were planned to be in line with the MR markers. Sonications were delivered using treatment “cells” of a particular diameter. The smallest cell (2  mm diameter) was obtained from a sonication in a single position, whilst larger cells (4, 8, or 12  mm diameter) were obtained by electronically steering the focal point in predefined circular trajectories around a central point [20].|$|R

Intense optical {{fields in the}} form of dark solitons controlled by Gaussian pulses are used to trap and transport nanoscopic volumes of matter to the desired destination via an optical waveguide. Theoretically, the gradient and scattering forces are responsible for this trapping phenomenon, where in practice such systems can be fabricated and a thin-film device formed on the specific artificial medical materials, for instance, an artificial bone. The dynamic behavior of the tweezers can be tuned by controlling the optical pulse input power and parameters of the ring resonator system. Different trap sizes can be generated to trap different gold nanoparticles sizes, which is useful for gold nanoparticle therapy. In this paper, we have shown the utility of gold nanoparticle trapping and delivery for therapy, which may be useful for cosmetic therapy and related applications.

Meat Science, 85 (4), 684 - 690. Sponsorship: DEFRA; MDC; BBSRC IMPF: 02. 61 RONO: 00 A {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL) has been identified on chromosome 18 in Texel sheep (TM-QTL) that increases depth and area of the longissimus dorsi muscle. The study aimed to assess the pleiotropic QTL effects on key meat quality traits (toughness and intramuscular fat content after 7 days aging) of crossbred lambs carrying one copy of the TM-QTL. The results showed that male Texel ? Mule lambs carrying the TM-QTL had significantly less intramuscular fat (1. 86 % versus 2. 25 %) and higher toughness, with increased variation, in the loin muscle, compared to non-carrier males. Similar conclusions were obtained using {{two different types of}} tenderometer equipment: one using the Volodkevitch test (average shear force of 4. 17 kgF or 40. 9 N for carrier males, 2. 61 kgF or 25. 6 N for non-carrier males) and one using the MIRINZ test (average shear force of 6. 18 kgF or 60. 6 N for carrier males, 5. 22 kgF or 51. 2 N for non-carrier males).

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to determine content of biologically active biogenic amines and polyamines in mutton and lamb meat. There are not too many consumers of mutton in the Czech Republic. This kind of meat is consumed mostly during Easter, while in Anglo-Saxon countries {{it has been a}} sought-after food resource. Worlds mutton yearly consumption has been about 2 kg per capita. In the Czech Republic it is only 0. 4 kg. Meat of slaughter animals is rich in biogenic amines and polyamines, especially in spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD). Their contents in beef, pork and chicken meat have been determined previously. Literature data on mutton and lamb has been lacking for polyamines and information on biogenic amines has been very scarce. Liquid chromatography method in UPLC arrangement was used for the determination of putrescine (PUT), cadaverine (CAD), tyramine (TYR), phenylethylamine (PEA), histamine (HIM), tryptamine (TRM), SPD and SPM, the amines with considerable biological effects. Mutton and lamb loin (19 and 20, respectively) and leg (17 and 20, respectively) were analysed 24 hours after slaughter The samples originated from various minor breeders and they were hybrids of several breeds.
