30|$|The {{document}} of the “separation of powers” {{is composed of}} 1101 Japanese characters and six paragraphs. As the goal map building phase, we authors made the goal map composed of 16 nodes and 33 <b>links</b> (Fig.  10). Therefore, a subject was requested to build a learner map with 49 parts (Fig.  8) in the learner map building phase. Thirty learner maps were built by 30 subjects. As for the 30 learner maps, in individual comparison between the goal map and each learner map, KBmap Analyzer detected 63 excessive <b>links</b> (2.1 <b>links</b> in average in a learner map), 69 lacking <b>links</b> (2.3 <b>links</b> in average), and 6 leaving <b>links</b> (0.23 <b>links</b> in average). Because the number of leaving <b>links</b> was only 0.23 <b>links</b> in average, the subjects could use almost parts to build their maps. Then, their maps had usually several defects as excessive <b>links,</b> lacking <b>links,</b> and leaving <b>links.</b> Lacking <b>links</b> can be supplemented by excessive <b>links</b> or learning <b>links.</b> Here, a correction of a lacking <b>link</b> means that either a correction of an excessive <b>link</b> or a correction of leaving <b>link.</b> Therefore, a subject correctly connected 30.7 <b>links</b> (93  % of <b>links)</b> and failed to correctly connect 2.3 <b>links</b> (7  % of <b>links).</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Link</b> probabilities and {{probabilistic}} <b>link</b> fans : A process P with {{a result}} <b>link</b> that yields a stateful object B with n states s1 through sn shall {{mean that the}} probability of generating B at each one of its states shall be 1/n. The single result <b>link</b> shall be used instead of the result <b>link</b> fan. Usually, probabilities of following a specific <b>link</b> in a <b>link</b> fan are not equal. <b>Link</b> probability shall be a value assigned to a <b>link</b> in a XOR diverging <b>link</b> fan that specifies the probability of following that particular <b>link</b> among the possible <b>links</b> in the fan <b>link.</b> A probabilistic <b>link</b> fan shall be a <b>link</b> fan with probability annotations on each fan <b>link,</b> where {{the sum of the}} probabilities shall be exactly 1. Graphically, along each fan <b>link</b> an annotation shall appear in the form Pr=p, where p is the <b>link</b> probability numeric value or a parameter, which denotes the probability of the system control to select and follow that particular <b>link</b> of the fan.

5000|$|<b>Links</b> can <b>link</b> {{to other}} <b>links,</b> {{to deal with}} changes in {{granularity}} (for instance, adding a new key to a database table would change {{the grain of the}} database table). For instance, if you have an association between customer and address, you could add a reference to a <b>link</b> between the hubs for product and transport company. This could be a <b>link</b> called [...] "Delivery". Referencing a <b>link</b> in another <b>link</b> is considered a bad practice, because it introduces dependencies between <b>links</b> that make parallel loading more difficult. Since a <b>link</b> to another <b>link</b> is the same as a new <b>link</b> with the hubs from the other <b>link,</b> in these cases creating the <b>links</b> without referencing other <b>links</b> is the preferred solution (see the section on loading practices for more information).|$|R

30|$|In {{the first}} map of group A, {{the total number}} of lacking <b>links</b> is 45 <b>links</b> as shown on the {{right-hand}} side of Fig.  7, which is equal to 29.61 percentages of all possible lacking <b>links</b> (152 <b>links</b> from 4 <b>links</b> of each 38 learner maps). Moreover, the diagnosis results suggest an important <b>link</b> that is the most number of lacking <b>link.</b> So, the “pass through” <b>link</b> causes the most misunderstanding among learners (15 learners from 38 learners of the class), and the instructor took the <b>link</b> as the main content of feedback {{in the form of the}} supplementary lecture. Subsequently, the instructor gave the feedback that emphasized on the “pass through” <b>link</b> especially more than the other lacking <b>links.</b> A line graph on the left-hand side of Fig.  8 represents the effectiveness of the feedback. The line graph of group A shows the decreasing of lacking <b>links</b> of all three maps. In this context, the number of lacking <b>links</b> at the “second map” was decreased when compared with the lacking <b>links</b> of the “first map” that means the learner’s understanding was increased after the instructor gave the feedback to learners. The total number of lacking <b>links</b> at the second map of group A remained 25 <b>links</b> that were decreased 55.56 percentages from the first map, and the lacking <b>links</b> of this second map are equal to 16.45 percentages of all possible lacking <b>links.</b> Also, the diagnosis results of the second checkpoint of group A suggest that the “pass through” <b>link</b> still the most number of lacking <b>links,</b> although the “pass through” <b>link</b> is the most decreased <b>link</b> among the lacking <b>links</b> from the first map. Another candidate <b>link</b> is the “does not pass through” <b>link</b> (7 tagged number), which the number of the <b>link</b> is not too much different from the “pass through” <b>link</b> (8 tagged number). So, the instructor designed the second feedback of group A based on these lacking <b>links.</b> Finally, the lacking <b>links</b> of the third map are presented in the line graph on the left-hand side of Fig.  8 as the “third map”. The total number of the lacking <b>links</b> is 16 <b>links</b> that means in the third map remained only 10.53 percentages of all possible lacking <b>links.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} wireless networks with interference constraints. The network {{consists of}} a set of <b>links</b> and a set of users who generate packets that traverse these <b>links.</b> Each user is associated with a route consisting of a sequence of <b>links.</b> The <b>links</b> are subject to the usual interference constraints: (i) if <b>link</b> l interferes with <b>link</b> k, then <b>link</b> k also interferes with <b>link</b> l, and (ii) two <b>links</b> that interfere with each other cannot transmit simultaneously. The interference set of a <b>link</b> is defined to be the set of <b>links</b> that interfere with the <b>link,</b> along with the <b>link</b> itself. A greedy scheduler is one which selects an arbitrary set of <b>links</b> to transmit subject only to the interference constraint. We use a traffic regulator at each <b>link</b> along the route of each flow which shapes the traffic of the flow. We prove that the network is queue-length stable under any maximal greedy scheduling policy provided that the total arrival rate in the interference set of each <b>link</b> is less than one. I...|$|R
