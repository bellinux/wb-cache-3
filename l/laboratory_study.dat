5|$|Spiders often attach {{highly visible}} silk bands, called decorations or stabilimenta, to their webs. Field {{research}} suggests that webs with more decorative bands captured more prey per hour. However, a <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> showed that spiders reduce the building of these decorations if they sense the presence of predators.|$|E
5|$|A <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> {{examined}} the effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
40|$|The tiered {{approach}} to assessing ecological risk of insect-resistant transgenic crops assumes that lower tier <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies,</b> which expose surrogate non-target organisms to {{high doses of}} insecticidal proteins, can detect harmful effects that might be manifested in the field. To test this assumption, we performed meta-analyses comparing results for non-target invertebrates exposed to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry proteins in <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> with results derived from independent field studies examining effects on the abundance of non-target invertebrates. For Lepidopteran-active Cry proteins, <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> correctly predicted the reduced field abundance of non-target Lepidoptera. However, <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> incorporating tri-trophic interactions of Bt plants, herbivores and parasitoids were better correlated with the decreased field abundance of parasitoids than were direct-exposure assays. For predators, <b>laboratory</b> tri-trophic <b>studies</b> predicted reduced abundances that were not realized in field studies and thus overestimated ecological risk. Exposure to Coleopteran-active Cry proteins did not significantly reduce the laboratory survival or field abundance of any functional group examined. Our findings support the assumption that <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> of transgenic insecticidal crops show effects that are either consistent with, or more conservative than, those found in field studies, with the important caveat that <b>laboratory</b> <b>studies</b> should explore all ecologically relevant routes of exposure...|$|R

25|$|In some cases, {{third party}} species {{interfere}} {{to the detriment}} or benefit of the competing species. In a <b>laboratory</b> <b>study,</b> coexistence between two competing bacterial species was mediated by phage parasites. This type of interaction actually helped to maintain diversity in bacterial communities and has far reaching implications in medical research as well as ecology. Similar effects have been documented for many communities {{as a result of}} the action of a keystone predator that preys on a competitively superior species.|$|E
25|$|In one <b>laboratory</b> <b>study,</b> Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) given {{access to}} an operant feeding machine learned to pull a string to get food. However, the {{researchers}} had also tagged the fish by threading a bead {{in front of their}} dorsal fin. Some fish snagged the string with their bead, resulting in food delivery. These fish eventually learned to swim in a particular way to repeatedly make the bead snag the string and get food. Because the fish used an object external to their body in a goal-oriented way, this satisfies some definitions of tool use.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that circadian desynchronization and work overload may also impair performance. Specifically, a controlled <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> by Wright et al. evaluated {{the relationship between}} circadian rhythms and performance by assessing body temperature, which is regulated by the circadian mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is at its highest near the circadian peak and lowest near the circadian minimum (this is when the body is driven to sleep). It has long been recognized that a positive relationship exists between daily rhythms of the body temperature and neurobehavioral performance and alertness in humans.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, the {{hobo spider}} was {{considered}} to be a dangerous species based on a toxicology study on rabbits where lesions appeared after spiders were induced to bite the rabbits. This <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> has led to the proposal that {{in some parts of the}} U.S. nearly all bites attributed to the brown recluse spider are in reality the hobo spider's bite. The CDC and other U.S. government agencies have also used this same study as the basis for a report claiming that the hobo spider bite causes necrosis in humans, despite the absence of any confirmed cases. Subsequent attempts to replicate the study by injecting sufficient venom to ensure envenomation have failed to produce necrotic lesions, and there is even question as to whether the lesions observed in the original study were necrotic. The CDC no longer considers it a dangerously venomous species.|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is a diurnal foraging carnivore which, unlike other carangids, does not normally seek out individual prey items. The highly protractile mouth {{possessed by the}} species is used to form a tube to suck prey out of both reef- and algae-dominated habitats, as well as filtering organisms out of sandy substrates. In the latter case, both sand and any prey items are taken into the mouth and filtered through the gill rakers; sand is expelled, while small organisms are trapped and swallowed. The species takes a variety of prey including crustaceans such as shrimp, crabs, and amphipods, as well as molluscs and small fish. Golden trevally found inhabiting a mangrove swamp {{were found to have}} fed exclusively on fish (Mugil curema), suggesting the species also actively hunts down fleeing prey. A <b>laboratory</b> <b>study</b> using only four individuals being fed found that one fish will take the 'lead' position in this situation while another will attack the other fish in the school, apparently in competition for food.|$|E

2500|$|Addictive stimuli have {{variable}} {{effects on}} dopamine receptors, {{depending on the}} particular stimulus. [...] According to one study, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine, alcohol, and nicotine cause decreases in D2 receptor quantity.

A recent news article summarized a U.S. DOE Brookhaven National <b>Laboratory</b> <b>study</b> showing that increasing dopamine receptors with genetic therapy temporarily decreased cocaine consumption by up to 75%. The treatment was effective for 6days. Cocaine upregulates D3 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, possibly contributing to drug seeking behavior.|$|E

All subjects participated in both alcohol consumption and sleep deprivation, and the order of testing was counterbalanced so that half of the subjects participated in the alcohol consumption part first while the other half participated in the sleep deprivation part first. To avoid carry-over effects from one condition to the next, subjects were provided with a night of rest in a motel between each condition.|$|E
