40|$|The role of each histone tail in {{regulating}} chromatin structure is elucidated {{by using a}} coarse-grained model of an oligonucleosome incorporating flexible histone tails that reproduces the conformational and dynamical properties of chromatin. Specifically, a tailored configurational-bias Monte Carlo method that efficiently samples the possible conformational states of oligonucleosomes yields positional distributions of histone tails around nucleosomes and illuminates the nature of tail/core/DNA interactions at various salt milieus. Analyses indicate that the H 4 histone tails are most {{important in terms of}} mediating internucleosomal interactions, especially in highly compact chromatin with linker histones, followed by H 3, H 2 A, and H 2 B tails in decreasing order of importance. In addition to mediating internucleosomal interactions, the H 3 histone tails crucially screen the electrostatic repulsion between the entering/exiting <b>DNA</b> <b>linkers.</b> The H 2 A and H 2 B tails distribute themselves along the periphery of chromatin fibers and are important for mediating fiber/fiber interactions. A delicate balance between tail-mediated internucleosomal attraction and repulsion among <b>linker</b> <b>DNAs</b> allows the entering/exiting <b>linker</b> <b>DNAs</b> to align perpendicular to each other in linker-histone deficient chromatin, leading to the formation of an irregular zigzag-folded fiber with dominant pair-wise interactions between nucleosomes i and i ± 4...|$|R

However to enable this, the bio-compatibility of the resulting click-linked DNA must be examined. Click <b>DNA</b> <b>linkers</b> were incorporated into a plasmid within the gene encoding for an ampicillin resistance marker. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli and resulting colonies found to survive on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin. This indicated that the click <b>DNA</b> <b>linker</b> was replicated and transcribed correctly by the cellular machinery of E. coli. The observed bio-compatibility was further probed by demonstrating the functionality of the click-linked DNA in nucleotide excision repair deficient cells line. The bio-compatibility of the click <b>DNA</b> <b>linker</b> was then investigated in a non-essential gene by constructing a click-linked variant of the gene encoding for the fluorescent mCherry protein. Experiments carried out using a plasmid containing two click <b>DNA</b> <b>linkers</b> in the region of the gene encoding for the mCherry fluorophore provided further evidence that the click <b>DNA</b> <b>linker</b> was functional in E. coli.

40|$|In {{the cell}} nucleus, DNA wraps around histone proteins, forming {{nucleosome}} particles, and packs into a highly negatively charged structure, the chromatin fiber. The linker histone is a protein that binds to the nucleosome and determines how the nucleosomes {{are linked to}} each other. To simulate the nucleosome-linker histone interactions, a Brownian Dynamics (BD) technique together with normal mode analysis (NMA) was applied. NMA of the nucleosome revealed the most prominent modes of motion of its two <b>linker</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The results were used to generate conformations of the <b>linker</b> <b>DNAs</b> which were used in BD simulations of the rigid-body docking of a linker histone and its mutants to the nucleosome. From the simulations, two distinct binding sites and one non-binding site on the linker histone were identified. The amino acids found to be most important for binding in the simulations with the linker histone mutants are consistent with experimental data. Moreover, a dominant binding mode of the linker histone to the nucleosome was found {{for a wide range}} of conformations of the <b>linker</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The association kinetics of the linker histone to the nucleosome was modeled using the results obtained by the BD docking. The obtained high association rates close to the diffusional limit (10 ^ 9 M^{- 1 } s^{- 1 }) were attributed to electrostatic steering between both biomolecules. A new method accounting for molecular flexibility during BD simulation was developed. One of the binding partners is treated as a discrete set of structural conformations representing its flexibility. The transition between the conformations is described by a Markovian process with probability following four different selection algorithms: three are based on the interaction energy between the molecules and the fourth is based on random selection. The method was successfully applied to the linker histone-nucleosome system, where the nucleosome was modeled as a flexible molecule. The result suggests that the linker histone preferentially binds to more open nucleosome conformations. Following the BD results obtained, the encounter complex dynamics was modeled by atomic detail Molecular Dynamics (MD), taking into account all degrees of freedom in classical mechanics on $sim 10 :ns$ time scale. The simulation resulted in a stable biomolecular complex with a conformational change on the loop region of the linker histone, which could be attributed to an induced fit effect. As well as providing insights into the determinants of linker histone-nucleosome binding, the results are expected to be valuable for higher order modelling of the chromatin fiber...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{formation}} of colloidal macromolecules consisting of chains of micron-sized paramagnetic particles assembled using a magnetic field and linked with DNA. The interparticle spacing and chain flexibility were controlled by varying the magnetic field strength and the linker spring constant. Variations in the DNA lengths allowed for the generation of chains with an improved range of flexibility as compared to previous studies. These chains adopted the rigid-rod, semiflexible, and flexible conformations that are characteristic of linear polymer systems. These assembly techniques were investigated {{to determine the effects}} of the nanoscale <b>DNA</b> <b>linker</b> properties on the properties of the microscale colloidal chains. With stiff <b>DNA</b> <b>linkers</b> (564 base pairs) the chains were only stable at moderate to high field strengths and produced rigid chains. For flexible <b>DNA</b> <b>linkers</b> (8000 base pairs), high magnetic field strengths caused the linkers to be excluded from the gap between the particles, leading to a transition from very flexible chains at low field strengths to semiflexible chains at high field strengths.
