5000|$|In 1957, William Heckman and Robert Freer {{started the}} Black Hills Central Railroad which began {{operating}} a tourist passenger excursion train service on this line. In 1972, the Black Hills flood destroyed the last mile of the Burlington Northern/Black Hills Central <b>line</b> in <b>Keystone,</b> which was later restored in 2001.|$|R

50|$|Red Star thrived and by 1881 {{carried over}} 40,000 passengers. At the same time, the American <b>Keystone</b> <b>Line</b> was not {{profitable}} {{because of its}} higher cost structure. When the hoped for subsidy never came from Congress, PRR decided to reorganize American Steamship. In 1884, PRR offered to purchase 14,500 new shares in International Navigation for $725,000 to finance INC’s purchase of American Steamship’s four vessels {{as well as its}} name and good will. The money never actually left PRR's account because it was used to repay the railroad for the American Steamship bonds it guaranteed. When the transaction was completed, the American <b>Keystone</b> <b>Line</b> became INC’s second operating subsidiary.|$|R
50|$|Downingtown {{station is}} located along the Lincoln Highway and {{is served by}} both SEPTA Regional Rail's Paoli/Thorndale <b>Line</b> and Amtrak's <b>Keystone</b> Service. The town is also served by the {{regional}} Rover bus service, operated by Krapf bus lines and functionally {{an extension of the}} SEPTA bus system throughout Chester County. Both systems provide access to Philadelphia and other suburbs along the Main Line through the SEPTA and Amtrak train services.|$|R
50|$|New Holland is a {{terminus}} of the New Holland Secondary Rail Line, which splits {{off of the}} Amtrak <b>Keystone</b> <b>Line</b> {{just east}} of Lancaster Station in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The line is owned by Norfolk Southern Railway, and is operated often to supply a number of businesses along the way, notably, RR Donnelley and Sons Printing, in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, {{as well as one}} of the Dart Container factories, and L&S Sweeteners, both in Leola, Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|Cornwells Heights is a census-designated place {{located in}} Bensalem Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The {{community}} was formerly part of Cornwells Heights-Eddington, but was {{split into two}} separate CDP's. As of the 2010 census, the population was 1,391. The Cornwells Heights station {{is located in the}} community and serves SEPTA Regional Rail's Trenton <b>Line</b> and Amtrak's <b>Keystone</b> Service and Northeast Regional services along the Northeast Corridor. The train station also has a park-and-ride with access from Interstate 95.|$|R
50|$|Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter, the Union Navy commander, {{was not to}} be thwarted. He renewed {{the attack}} on Fort Fisher on 13 January 1865 with a force of 59 warships. He sent some 2,000 sailors and marines ashore to aid the 8,000 Army troops led by Major General Alfred H. Terry. After three days of bitter fighting, the bravely defended Confederate {{fortress}} fell, closing the South's last supply <b>line</b> with Europe. <b>Keystone</b> State reached the scene before dawn on 16 January and received the wounded.|$|R
25|$|In 1905, the PRR {{began to}} {{electrify}} its suburban lines at Philadelphia, {{an effort that}} eventually led to 11kV, 25Hz AC catenary from New York and Washington. Electric service began in September 1915, with multiple unit trains west to Paoli on the PRR Main <b>Line</b> (now the <b>Keystone</b> Corridor). Electric service to Chestnut Hill (now the Chestnut Hill West Line), including a stretch of the NEC, began March 30, 1918. Local electric service to Wilmington, Delaware, on the NEC began September 30, 1928, and to Trenton, New Jersey, on June 29, 1930.|$|R
5000|$|Red Star’s Antwerp - Philadelphia Service {{started in}} January 1873. Red Star took {{delivery}} of three new steamers built in England and supplemented its fleet with chartered tonnage. [...] Red Star was in {{better position to}} survive the depression of 1873 than the US-flagged American “Keystone” Line because operating as a US carrier resulted in about 30% higher costs. At the end of 1873, Griscom took over management of the American <b>Keystone</b> <b>Line.</b> In 1874, Red Star also started an Antwerp-New York service under a mail contract from the Belgian Government.|$|R
50|$|The Macestus Bridge has a {{width of}} 6.35 m and {{a length of}} 234 m, {{excluding}} the ramps at both ends. The distance between the centreline of the piers measures 17.80 m for each of its 13 arches, the clear span being 14.20 m and the pier width, accordingly, 3.60 m. The slender piers are protected upstream by triangular cutwaters and, owing to a favourable thickness against span ratio of almost 1 to 4, allowed the waterflow to pass the bridge relatively unrestricted. The rise from the springing <b>line</b> to the <b>keystone</b> is only 4.30 m (see drawing), giving the arcade a span-to-rise ratio of 3.3 to 1. The bridge is thus {{one of more than}} a dozen ancient segmental arch bridges known today.|$|R
5|$|Government of Ontario Transit (later {{abbreviated}} as 'GO Transit') {{started as}} a three-year long experiment on May 23, 1967 running single-deck trains powered by diesel locomotives in push-pull configuration on a single rail line along Lake Ontario's shoreline. GO Train service ran throughout the day from Oakville to Pickering with limited rush hour train service to Hamilton. The experiment proved to be extremely popular; GO Transit carried its first million riders during its first four months, and averaged 15,000 per day soon after. This line, now divided as the Lakeshore East and Lakeshore West <b>lines</b> is the <b>keystone</b> corridor of GO Transit. Expansion of rail service continued in the 1970s and 1980s, aimed at developing ridership in {{with the introduction of}} the Georgetown (now Kitchener) line in 1974 and the Richmond Hill line in 1978. The Milton GO Train line opened in 1981, followed by the Bradford (now Barrie) and Stouffville lines a year later, establishing the 7 rail corridors that today's rail service is based upon.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{standing}} {{house in}} Keystone today is on n 73rd and Bedford. According to the Douglas County Assessor {{the house was}} built in 1880. There are couple homes within a few blocks built just after 1900. The next oldest homes were built on present day N. 78th St just south of where Aurora forks off to the SE. Just south of that spot on Aurora is another home still standing built before 1900. Another home still standing built before 1900 is on Boyd just past where Boyd curves SE just east of where Boyd originally ended. Boyd Street {{used to be called}} Maple Avenue. It was originally a cul-de-sac but was extended all the way to N. 90th most likely in sections. Present day Keystone Drive ran from Military Road through towards present day N. 83rd Street. Boyd Street forked to the west and N. 83rd curved towards Maple Street. These roads made up the early network of the neighborhood. The earliest built and still standing homes <b>line</b> present day: <b>Keystone</b> Dr, Boyd St, N. 79th St, N. 83rd St, Glenvale, Aurora, Pinkney, and Wirt. Around this time the Cherrycroft farm was in operation. The farm was located at N. 77th and Military Rd on land occupied currently by the Mary Immaculate Catholic Church.|$|R
