60|$|Foremost {{among those}} <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> at the eminently aristocratic door {{before it is}} quite painted, are the Veneerings: out of breath, one might imagine, from the impetuosity of their rush to the eminently aristocratic steps. One copper-plate Mrs Veneering, two copper-plate Mr Veneerings, and a connubial copper-plate Mr and Mrs Veneering, {{requesting}} the honour of Mr and Mrs Boffin's company at dinner with the utmost Analytical solemnities. The enchanting Lady Tippins <b>leaves</b> a <b>card.</b> Twemlow <b>leaves</b> <b>cards.</b> A tall custard-coloured phaeton tooling up in a solemn manner <b>leaves</b> four <b>cards,</b> to wit, a couple of Mr Podsnaps, a Mrs Podsnap, and a Miss Podsnap. All the world {{and his wife and}} daughter <b>leave</b> <b>cards.</b> Sometimes the world's wife has so many daughters, that her card reads rather like a Miscellaneous Lot at an Auction; comprising Mrs Tapkins, Miss Tapkins, Miss Frederica Tapkins, Miss Antonina Tapkins, Miss Malvina Tapkins, and Miss Euphemia Tapkins; at the same time, the same lady <b>leaves</b> the <b>card</b> of Mrs Henry George Alfred Swoshle, NEE Tapkins; also, a card, Mrs Tapkins at Home, Wednesdays, Music, Portland Place.|$|R

6000|$|... "Resist! No! It {{would be}} the height of rudeness. Do you resist when people <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> at your house, 'with kind inquiries'? It's just like that; a way they have of showing a {{friendly}} interest." ...|$|R

5000|$|Prior to {{the death}} of Lee Kuan Yew, when he was hospitalised at the Singapore General Hospital on 5 February, Singaporeans {{expressed}} concern for his health through social media websites. On 17 March 2015, the Prime Minister's office announced that Lee's condition has worsened due to an infection. Following that, many Singaporeans went to the hospital to pay tribute to Lee Kuan Yew, however as Lee was in the Intensive Care Unit, no visitors were allowed and the hospital could not accept gifts such as flowers and cards. On 20 March 2015, the Singapore General Hospital designated an area for well-wishers to <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> and flowers for Lee Kuan Yew. Several Singaporeans and Foreigners were seen <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> and flowers at the designated site. Additionally, the Tanjong Pagar Community Club set up a [...] "get well corner" [...] for residents to write messages and <b>leave</b> flowers and <b>cards</b> for Lee Kuan Yew.|$|R

[...] "It's {{a sort of}} flourish.... And sometimes it's like <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> by footmen--a substitute for the real presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Montfort {{looked at}} him with a glance of curious scrutiny; not smiling, and yet not displeased. [...] "I will write her a little note in the morning," [...] said Lady Montfort thoughtfully. [...] "One may <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> for ever.

60|$|The {{morning was}} chiefly spent in <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> at {{the houses of}} Mrs. Jennings's {{acquaintance}} to inform them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing {{the direction of the}} wind, watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Silly fellow! Did {{you expect}} me to send you invitations and <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> on you, who are one of ourselves? Come to-morrow to dinner.

60|$|A {{person in}} society, here, who is desirous of {{relieving}} himself, for a time, from the labour and care {{of maintaining the}} necessary intercourse, can easily do it, by <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> of P.P.O. It might be awkward to remain long in a place very publicly after such a step, but I ventured on it once, to extricate myself from engagements that interfered with more important pursuits, with entire success. I met several acquaintances in the street, after the cards were sent, and we even talked together, but I got no more visits or invitations. When ready to return to town, all I {{had to do was}} to <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> again, and things went on as if nothing had happened. I parried one or two allusions to my absence, and had no further difficulty. The only awkward part of it was, that I accepted an invitation to dine en famille with a literary friend, and one of the guests, of whom there were but three, happened to be a person whose invitation to dinner I had declined on account of quitting town! As he was a sensible man, I told him the simple fact, and we laughed at the contretems, and drank oar wine in peace.|$|R

60|$|I must {{write this}} at {{railroad}} speed, for I {{have been at}} it all day, and have numbers of letters to cram into the next half-hour. I began the morning in the City, for the Theatrical Fund; went on to Shepherd's Bush; came back to <b>leave</b> <b>cards</b> for Mr. Baring and Mr. Bates; ran across Piccadilly to Stratton Street, stayed there an hour, and shot off here. I have been in four cabs to-day, {{at a cost of}} thirteen shillings. Am going to dine with Mark and Webster at half-past four, and finish the evening at the Adelphi.|$|R

You must come and call upon me. You may come every day if you like. Do not <b>leave</b> your <b>card.</b> I hate people who <b>leave</b> <b>cards.</b> I never see them; I order all to be burnt.

60|$|But {{however it}} came about, {{it came to}} pass, even while these gentlemen had the gloss of novelty upon them, that Mr Toots felt, he didn't know how, {{unsettled}} and uneasy. There were husks in his corn, that even Game Chickens couldn't peck up; gloomy giants in his leisure, that even Game Chickens couldn't knock down. Nothing seemed to do Mr Toots so much good as incessantly <b>leaving</b> <b>cards</b> at Mr Dombey's door. No taxgatherer in the British Dominions--that wide-spread territory on which the sun never sets, and where the tax-gatherer never goes to bed--was more regular and persevering in his calls than Mr Toots.|$|R
