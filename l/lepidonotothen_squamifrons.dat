40|$|New {{information}} on the biology and ecology of an abundant ‘rockcod’ species, <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons</b> (family: Nototheniidae), found at South Georgia is presented. Data collected from twenty demersal trawl surveys carried out at South Georgia and Shag Rocks (sub-Antarctic) from 1986 – 2012 were analysed to investigate distribution, size, maturity and diet. Distribution was patchy with large aggregations in consistent high-density ‘hotspots’ {{to the east of}} Shag Rocks and to the west of South Georgia. Fish density was shown to vary between regions of the shelf and between years but there was little evidence of significant changes in catch per unit effort (CPUE) over the duration of the study. Length at first maturity for males and females (37 – 38 cm, total length) was very similar to that described for the Indian Ocean population. Detailed stomach contents analysis (2005 – 12) indicated a varied diet dominated by salps/tunicates, but with ontogenetic and depth variations in prey composition. <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons</b> was shown to be an opportunistic bentho-pelagic forager. Enhanced knowledge of the ecology of L. squamifrons will be valuable in future research on food web modelling and marine spatial management in the Southern Ocean and to provide baseline data on the ecology of the species in a rapidly changing environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Antarctic Wsh fauna is {{characterized}} by high endemism and low species diversity with one perci-form suborder, the Notothenioidei, dominating the whole species assemblage on the shelves and slopes. Nototheni-oids diversiWed in situ through adaptive radiation and show a variety of life history strategies as adults ranging from benthic to pelagic modes. Their larval development is unusually long, lasting from {{a few months to}} more than a year, and generally includes a pelagic larval stage. There-fore, the advection of eggs and larvae with ocean currents is a key factor modulating population connectivity. Here, we compare the genetic population structures and gene Xow of seven ecologically distinct notothenioid species of the southern Scotia Arc based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences (D-loop/cytochrome b). The seven species belong to the families Nototheniidae (Gobio-notothen gibberifrons, <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons,</b> Tre-matomus eulepidotus, T. newnesi) and Channichthyidae (Chaenocephalus aceratus, Champsocephalus gunnari, Chionodraco rastrospinosus). Our results show low-popu-lation diVerentiation and high gene Xow for all investigated species independent of their adult life history strategies. In addition, gene Xow is primarily in congruence with the prevailing ocean current system, highlighting the role of larval dispersal in population structuring of notothenioids...|$|E

40|$|The Antarctic {{fish fauna}} from outer {{continental}} shelf/upper slope depths is under-sampled {{compared to that}} of the inner shelf, and there are limited quantitative data available on absolute abundance and taxonomic change with depth. A photographic survey of demersal fishes was conducted along a depth-gradient of 400 – 2099 m on the outer shelf and upper slope west of Anvers Island, Palmer Archipelago. A total of 1490 fishes were identified at least to the family level. Notothenioids composed 52. 7 % of absolute abundance and non-notothenioids 47. 3 %. The most abundant families were Nototheniidae (39. 4 %), followed by Macrouridae (28. 9 %), Zoarcidae (16. 9 %), and Channichthyidae (12. 1 %). The most abundant species were the notothenioids <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons</b> (30. 5 %) and Chionobathyscus dewitti (11. 7 %), and the non-notothenioid Macrourus spp. (29. 5 %). The absolute abundance of all fishes peaked at 400 – 599 m. Depths of maximum abundance were 400 – 599 m for L. squamifrons, 700 – 1499 m for Macrourus spp., and 900 – 1499 for C. dewitti. At 700 – 999 m the abundance shifted from primarily notothenioids to the non-notothenioids Macrourus spp. and zoarcids.

40|$|Background Loss {{of genetic}} {{variability}} due to environmental changes, limitation of gene flow between pools of individuals or putative selective pressure at specific markers, were previously documented for Antarctic notothenioid fish species. However, {{so far no}} studies were performed for the Gaudy notothen Lepidonotothen nudifrons. Starting from a species-specific spleen transcriptome library, we aimed at isolating polymorphic microsatellites (Type I; i. e. derived from coding sequences) suitable to quantify the genetic variability in this species, and additionally to assess the population genetic structure and demography in nototheniids. Results We selected 43, 269 transcripts resulting from a MiSeq sequencer run, out of which we developed 19 primer pairs for sequences containing microsatellite repeats. Sixteen loci were successfully amplified in L. nudifrons. Eleven microsatellites were polymorphic and allele numbers per locus ranged from 2 to 17. In addition, we amplified loci identified from L. nudifrons in two other congeneric species (L. squamifrons and L. larseni). Thirteen loci were highly transferable to the two congeneric species. Differences in polymorphism among species were detected. Conclusions Starting from a transcriptome of a non-model organism, {{we were able to}} identify promising polymorphic nuclear markers that are easily transferable to other closely related species. These markers can be a key instrument to monitor the genetic structure of the three Lepidonotothen species if genotyped in larger population samples. When compared with anonymous loci isolated in other notothenioids, i. e. Type II (isolated from genomic libraries), they offer the possibility to test how the effects of occurring environmental change influence the population genetic structure in each species and subsequently the composition of the entire ecosystem.

40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (Notothenia rossii)) exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (<b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons))</b> seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations.

40|$|Antarctic notothenioid {{fish are}} {{characterized}} by their evolutionary adaptation to the cold, thermostable Southern Ocean, which is associated with unique physiological adaptations to withstand the cold and reduce energetic requirements but also entails limited compensation capacities to environmental change. This study compares the capacities of mitochondrial acclimation to ocean warming and acidification between the Antarctic nototheniid Notothenia rossii and the sub-Antarctic <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons,</b> which share a similar ecology, but different habitat temperatures. After acclimation of L. squamifrons to 9 °C and N. rossii to 7 °C (normocapnic/hypercapnic, 0. 2 kPa CO 2 / 2000 ppm CO 2) for 4 - 6 weeks, we compared the capacities of their mitochondrial respiratory complexes I (CI) and II (CII), their P/O ratios (phosphorylation efficiency), proton leak capacities and mitochondrial membrane fatty acid compositions. Our results reveal reduced CII respiration rates in warm-acclimated L. squamifrons and cold hypercapnia-acclimated N. rossii. Generally, L. squamifrons displayed a greater ability to increase CI contribution during acute warming and after warm-acclimation than N. rossii. Membrane unsaturation was not altered by warm or hypercapnia-acclimation in both species, but membrane fatty acids of warm-acclimated L. squamifrons were less saturated than in warm normocapnia-/hypercapnia-acclimated N. rossii. Proton leak capacities were not affected by warm or hypercapnia-acclimation of N. rossii. We conclude that an acclimatory response of mitochondrial capacities may include higher thermal plasticity of CI supported by enhanced utilization of anaplerotic substrates (via oxidative decarboxylation reactions) feeding into the citrate cycle. L. squamifrons possesses higher relative CI plasticities than N. rossii, which may facilitate the usage of energy efficient NADH-related substrates under conditions of elevated energy demand, possibly induced by ocean warming and acidification. The observed adjustments of electron transport system complexes with a higher flux through CI under warming and acidification suggest a metabolic acclimation potential of the sub-Antarctic L. squamifrons, but only limited acclimation capacities for N. rossii...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{evidence}} for distribution shifts of single species and ecosystem changes {{as a reaction}} to climatic warming, little is known about direct implications of temperature changes on the role of physiology and adaptability for species distribution. In this study the effect of a short-term temperature increase on metabolic and lipid composition of liver tissue in the sub-Antarctic fish species <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons</b> and the high-Antarctic species Trematomus hansoni were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Data of this study seems to be the first data available for liver lipid composition of the two investigated species. Composition of succinate likewise phospholipid levels indicated temperature induced changes between 0 and 6 °C for T. hansoni and 2 and 9 °C for L. squamifrons. This complies well with observations of temperature dependent respiration, which indicated a rise in energy demand around 4 °C for the high- and sub-Antarctic species alike. Although changes in anaerobic metabolites found here were not significant, combination of results from this study and respiration experiments suggest that experimental temperature of 6 °C might be close to upper critical temperatures of T. hansoni, while L. squamifrons might be able to tolerate acute temperatures above 9 °C. Considering interspecies differences, higher total lipid and triacylglyceride levels support the suggestion of a higher degree of metabolic cold adaptation in high-Antarctic T. hansoni compared to sub-Antarctic L. squamifrons. The results of this study comply well with current ideas about temperature dependence of lipids and other metabolic compounds in fish. Recent suggestions about metabolic cold adaptation in Antarctic fish were confirmed and results indicated the existence of different degrees of cold adaptation in Antarctic fish, depending on variability of habitat temperature...|$|E
40|$|Like the Arctic, the Antarctic region hosts {{some of the}} {{hot spots}} of climatic change. At the western Antarctic Peninsula, {{alterations}} of air and water temperature, pH, salinity and sea-ice regime were reported and associated shifts in species abundance and changes in food web structure have already become evident. In contrast, for most high-Antarctic regions, no climate related changes have yet been found. However, future temperature increases are also projected for these areas. Ocean warming affects marine ectotherms by directly impacting their body temperature and thus physiology. Antarctic marine ectotherms, such as fish, are highly adjusted to the very cold and stable conditions of the Southern Ocean and are suggested to be highly temperature sensitive. Fish constitute an important link in Antarctic food webs by being prey and predator alike. While various studies focused {{on the impact of}} elevated temperature on lower organisational levels in Antarctic fish, trade-offs of increased temperature for the whole organism remain unclear, but are highly relevant from an ecological perspective. Thus, this thesis aimed {{to assess the impact of}} increasing temperature on Antarctic fish at the whole-organism level from an energy budget perspective. The energy taken up by an organism can be allocated to different vital functions, such as routine metabolism, growth, reproduction and excretion. When routine metabolic costs are covered, energy can be allocated to growth and reproduction, the factors influencing a species abundance and population structure. In the first study of this thesis, energy allocation to routine metabolism as well as response patterns to an acute increase of temperature in the fish species <b>Lepidonotothen</b> <b>squamifrons,</b> Trematomus hansoni and Lepidonotothen nudifrons were analysed using oxygen consumption measurements. While metabolic responses to changing temperature were comparable in all species, metabolic costs of high-Antarctic fish were higher at habitat temperatures. Starting from higher metabolic rates at habitat temperature, it was hypothesised that high-Antarctic species might achieve critical thermal thresholds much earlier than low-latitude species when temperature increases. In the second study, temperature-dependent trade-offs at the whole-organism-level in Antarctic fish were analysed measuring different energy budget parameters. The results indicated a lower thermal tolerance of the high-Antarctic Trematomus bernacchii compared to the low-Antarctic Lepidonotothen nudifrons. After nine weeks of acclimation to elevated temperatures (4 °C), routine metabolic rates of T. bernacchii returned to baseline levels (0 °C). However, mass growth was reduced by 84...|$|E
