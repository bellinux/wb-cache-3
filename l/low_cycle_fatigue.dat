The variation in the normalized acoustic nonlinearity parameter (β/β 0) was interpreted as resulting from microstructural changes supported by the electron microscopy. The β/β 0 of CrMo steel increased abruptly in the initial stage of degradation, and then changed little due to the coarsening of carbide and precipitation of stable M 6 C carbide during isothermal aging.

50|$|Low {{plasticity}} burnishing (LPB) is {{a method}} of metal improvement that provides deep, stable surface compressive residual stresses with little cold work for improved damage tolerance and metal fatigue life extension. Improved fretting fatigue and stress corrosion performance has been documented, even at elevated temperatures where the compression from other metal improvement processes relax.

50|$|The {{shockwave}} generated coldwork (plastic strain) in {{the workpiece}} material creates compressive and tensile residual stresses {{to maintain an}} equilibrium state of the material.

40|$|Abstract. Cylinder {{cover is}} an {{important}} component of the engine. It is damaged by <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue,</b> high <b>cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> and creep in operation. Thus, the life and reliability of the cylinder cover are important criteria for engines. The temperature field and stress field of the cylinder cover are computed by the sequentially coupled analysis method: the elastic strain, plastic strain and creep strain of the dangerous point on the cylinder cover are analyzed in ten startup-working-shut down cycles; and it is proved in theory that <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> is the primary factor affecting the service life of the cylinder cover and the startup time of the engine is an appropriate parameter to estimate the life of thecylinder cover. The creep has little influence on the stress amplitude, and makes the mean stress increased. The relaxation is coexisting with creep in high temperature; it reduces the increase speed of mean stress. After finite cycles, the mean stress tends to constant gradually. Therefore, the creep-fatigue interaction can equal to thermo-mechanical fatigue whose stress amplitude and mean stress are constant. At last, the mean service life of cylinder is predicted...|$|R

50|$|Cracking {{is limited}} mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around edges of holes drilled {{near the edge}} of the disc due to the disc's uneven rate of {{expansion}} in severe duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in the severe case the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced.These cracks occur due to the phenomenon of <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> as a result of repeated hard braking.|$|E

40|$|AbstractShape memory {{property}} {{characterizes the}} behavior of many Ti based alloys (SMAs). This property {{is due to a}} metallurgical phenomenon, which allows to change the lattice structure without boundaries changing as a reversible transition. Equiatomic NiTi alloys are among the most industrially used SMAs: they are characterized by two different mechanical behaviors in terms of shape recovering:• a shape memory effect (SME). This is obtained when the recovery of the initial shape takes place only after heating over a critical temperature, with a consequent crystallographic structure transition;• a pseudoelastic effect (PE). This is obtained when the critical temperature is lower than environmental temperature. In this case, the recovery of the initial shape takes place only after unloading. In recent years, research relating to materials of shape memory has gone in the direction of application in many fields of engineering such as aerospace or mechanical systems.

40|$|Hydraulics {{cylinders}} are {{mechanical components}} subjected to fatigue. Indeed, {{to assess their}} fatigue strength is essential to consider the presence of inhomogeneities, for example inclusions or surface defects, since inhomogeneities reduce the fatigue strength.

Besides, the so-called Kitagawa diagram is obtained through fatigue tests performed onto smooth and micro-notched specimens.

30|$|Based on {{the ramp}} loading test {{data and the}} <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> {{trapezoidal}} <b>fatigue</b> loading test data, the damage accumulation and the DOL effect on the rolling shear strength of CLT was investigated. Based on {{the results from the}} short-term ramp loading tests, rolling shear strength properties of CLT beam specimens were evaluated. In the ramp loading test, the 3 -layer CLT had lower maximum rolling shear stress (strength) at failure when compared to the 5 -layer CLT. In addition, the rolling shear failure mechanism and strength failure are suggested to be further investigated in the future. A stress-based damage accumulation theory was used to investigate the DOL effect of CLT rolling shear behaviour. This model included the evaluated rolling shear strength from the ramp loading tests. This model was calibrated and verified by the <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> trapezoidal <b>fatigue</b> loading test data. The results show that the model predictions fit well with the test measurements. The characteristic of this modelling theory lies in that the verified model is able to predict the DOL behaviour of wood-based products under arbitrary loading history, such as long-term dead load case; then, these predictions of time to failure from this damage accumulation model can elucidate duration of load in the future research.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the prediction of the <b>low</b> <b>cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> behavior of a component in a developmental (ATD) high pressure liquid oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) for the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME). This component is called the Turnaround Duct (TAD). The TAD is a complex single piece casting of MAR-M- 247 material. Its function is to turn the hot turbine exhaust gas (1200 F hydrogen rich gas steam) such that it can exhaust radially out of the turbopump. In very simple terms, the TAD consists of two rings connected axially by 22 hollow airfoil shaped struts with the turning vanes placed at the top, middle, and bottom of each strut. The TAD is attached to the other components of the pump via bolts passing through 14 of the 22 struts. Of the remaining 8 struts, four are equally spaced (90 deg interval) and containing a cooling tube through which liquid hydrogen passes on its way to cool the shaft bearing assemblies. The remaining 4 struts are empty. One of the pump units in the certification test series was destructively examined after 22 test firings. Substantial axial cracking was found in two of the struts which contain cooling tubes. None of the other 20 struts showed any sign of internal cracking.
