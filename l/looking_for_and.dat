5|$|Selection {{for what}} {{eventually}} became the Italian Heavy Draft was begun in 1860 at the Deposito Cavalli Stalloni (military stud) of Ferrara, Italy. The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses. While the resulting horses were strong, {{they were not}} light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians. To make the breed lighter and faster, Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added. However, the resulting horse was still not exactly what its creators were <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix, bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits. In 1926, a stud book was begun, and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities. The breeding programs suffered during World War II, but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes, Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian Heavy Draft to its current state.|$|E
5|$|The episode's finale is Don's day and {{the trip}} to Howard Johnson's Restaurant and Motor Lodge in Plattsburgh. As he and Megan eat in the restaurant, Megan expresses her {{frustration}} at having her needs and desires {{take a back seat}} to Don's. The discussion escalates into a fight, during which Megan makes a hurtful remark about Don's mother, and Don storms out and drives off without her. Don returns sometime later and begins to worry when he can't find Megan. He spends hours <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> waiting for her, calling Peggy (the other side of the conversation from the first part of the episode) as well as Megan's mother in Montreal.|$|E

25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} is also linked to knowledge as it involves manipulating existing knowledge {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent {{thinking is}} used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
25|$|Many {{practitioners}} {{say that}} the scrying medium initially serves to focus attention, removing unwanted thoughts from the mind {{in much the same}} way as repetition of a mantra, concentration on a mandala, inducing the relaxation response, or possibly by hypnosis. Once this stage is achieved, the scryer may begin free association with the perceived images. The technique of deliberately <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> declaring these initial images aloud, however trivial or irrelevant they may seem to the conscious mind, attempts to deepen the trance state. In this state some scryers hear their own disassociated voices affirming what they see, in a mental feedback loop.|$|E
25|$|Broccoli’s {{original}} {{choice for}} the role of Domino Derval was Julie Christie following her performance in Billy Liar in 1963.

Welch, however, was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film Fantastic Voyage the same year instead. French actress Claudine Auger was ultimately cast in the role. Thunderball launched Auger into a successful European film career but did little for her otherwise in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

500|$|A chance lunchtime {{meeting with}} a wartime {{colleague}} in 1958 led Arnold {{to apply for a}} position at the Ministry of Health. The Director of Establishments there asked if he might forward her details to his counterpart at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), which he knew was expanding due to the 1957 Windscale fire, there being multiple inquiries into the disaster. To her surprise, her secretariat skills in writing and coordinating reports and studies were exactly what the UKAEA was <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> she was hired. After a security background check, she commenced work on 2 January 1959, with the Authority Health and Safety Branch (AHSB).

Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a B+ and said, [...] "Collins has kicked the brutal violence up a notch in an edge-of-your-seat plot". Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it [...] "the best yet, a beautifully orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the [...] "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>and</b> that [...] "it will grab them and not let go".

500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If you have an idea which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{afternoon}} of July 7 an advance force of Confederates entered Brandenburg, Kentucky, where they rendezvoused with Capt. Thomas Hines, who assumed command. Hines had led a reconnaissance mission into Indiana in search of Confederate sympathizers to support Morgan's coming raid. He did not find the support he was <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> had been pursued by elements of the 6th and 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion who killed three of his men and captured several others before the remainder escaped back into Kentucky. Since then he had been waiting in the Brandenburg area for Morgan to arrive. The Ohio River was swollen from recent rain, making any hope of fording it impossible and requiring that the Confederates secure boats to ferry their men across. Under Hines' guidance, the Confederates set an ambush to capture the steamship John T. McCombs as it landed in Brandenburg to deliver the mail. The one ship {{would not be enough}} to allow the Confederate division to quickly cross the river, so to capture another boat the McCombs was used to simulate a distress call to lure in the fast sidewheel steamer Alice Dean. As the unsuspecting ship moved alongside the McCombs, the Confederates on board sprung out, lashed the two ships together, and boarded the Alice Dean. [...] Taking the two ships back to shore, they released the crew and passengers just as Morgan arrived with {{the main body of the}} army. Some of the passengers escaped the town and sent message to commanders in Louisville of the Confederate occupation of Brandenburg.|$|E
