The regional capital, Zakopane, {{has been a}} center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer Karol Szymanowski, who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals. Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> closely related to that found in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and Transylvania.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Notre Dame in 2000, Dunst {{continued}} the acting career {{that she had}} begun. As a teenager, she {{found it difficult to}} deal with her rising fame, and for a period she blamed her mother for pushing her into acting as a child. However, she later expressed that her mother [...] "always had the best intentions". When asked if she had any regrets about the way she spent her childhood, Dunst said: [...] "Well, it's not a natural way to grow up, but it's the way I grew up and I wouldn't change it. I have my stuff to work out... I don't think anybody can sit around and say, 'My <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> screwed up than yours.' Everybody has their issues." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{deals with}} the concept of realizing one's {{mortality}} and discovering that <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> precious because of it. [...] Learning that he is in fact not immortal as he once thought, Bender initially feels that living a life that is anything less than immortal is worthless. [...] He {{deals with the}} devastating news of his newfound mortality by trying to find the one person who he believes can answer his questions about the reason for his life and why he was allowed to [...] "be born" [...] only to die. [...] Though Bender cannot find the answers to his mortality, he ultimately ends up developing a new outlook on life, believing it to be more precious than it was before now that it is finite, and he resolves that life is worth living no matter how brief it is.|$|E
500|$|Humanist {{scholars}} {{shaped the}} intellectual landscape throughout {{the early modern}} period. Political philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas More revived the ideas of Greek and Roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. Pico della Mirandola wrote the [...] "manifesto" [...] of the Renaissance, the Oration on the Dignity of Man, a vibrant defence of thinking. Matteo Palmieri (1406–1475), another humanist, is most known for his work Della vita civile ("On Civic Life"; printed 1528), which advocated civic humanism, and for his influence in refining the Tuscan vernacular to {{the same level as}} Latin. Palmieri drew on Roman philosophers and theorists, especially Cicero, who, like Palmieri, lived an active public life as a citizen and official, as well as a theorist and philosopher and also Quintilian. Perhaps the most succinct expression of his perspective on humanism is in a 1465 poetic work La città di vita, but an earlier work, Della vita civile (On Civic <b>Life),</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> wide-ranging. Composed as a series of dialogues set in a country house in the Mugello countryside outside Florence during the plague of 1430, Palmieri expounds on the qualities of the ideal citizen. The dialogues include ideas about how children develop mentally and physically, how citizens can conduct themselves morally, how citizens and states can ensure probity in public life, and an important debate on the difference between that which is pragmatically useful and that which is honest.|$|E

500|$|The Economists Free Exchange blog {{argued that}} Cowen [...] "undersold" [...] recent {{innovations}} in digital technologies and that society {{was still in}} the process of re-organising itself around them. A growth spurt should be expected but this could take anything from years to decades, it warned. Furthermore, there are particularly large gains to be had in the area [...] "cognition-augmenting innovations (as opposed to labor-augmenting innovations)". Writing in Forbes, Steve Denning described Cowen's [...] "low-hanging fruit theory" [...] as [...] "folkloric nonsense". The world of 1953, when Denning was young, is inconceivable to a young person today, he wrote, adding that the qualification [...] "apart from the Internet" [...] is equivalent to saying [...] "apart from the wheel" [...] when discussing transport. The Financial Times reviewer recognized that Cowen, a prominent blogger, [...] "is no Luddite...he thinks <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> fun and interesting with the internet around". He argued that most economists do not look at consumer technology to find the internet's effect on productivity but rather organizations: super-efficient retailers such as Wal-mart and Tesco have already incorporated it into their logistics. Furthermore, the pace of change means it could be a generation at least before we see the full implementation. Timothy Noah seizes upon Cowen's [...] "concession" [...] that the internet could well increase scientific output by allowing better communication between scientists in remote places. Just as Davis and Wessel incorrectly predicted a coming boom in middle class incomes due to computers, Cowen [...] "seems equally wrong to suggest that computer technology is not on the verge of doing so." ...|$|E
500|$|Mahendra Kumar, one of {{the leaders}} of the Hindu militant youth organisation, denied that any Catholic churches were {{attacked}} by his group but reportedly accepted responsibility for the attacks on prayer halls belonging to the New Life Fellowship Trust. He stated that the Bajrang Dal were not against Christianity in the region, but were offended by the alleged forced conversions. Kumar had initially denied any involvement in the attacks before being arrested on 20 September. When asked again at a later date however if he had accepted responsibility for the attacks, he denied it. Kumar resigned from Bajrang Dal on 1 October 2008 after witnessing a Hindu woman who had decided to commit suicide with her three children but was saved by Christian missionaries. He stated [...] "That was the time I realised that <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> important than dharma (religion). A lot needs to be done for the betterment of life. My dream is to build a society that values life more than religion. In jail I read several literary works. I joined Bajrang Dal so that we could mobilise the youth for a good cause, but at the end of the day all our concepts were politically motivated." [...] In February 2011, after the commission reports into the attacks were published, Kumar formally apologised to the public for the attacks and accused the BJP Government of corruption. On 21 February 2011 he joined the JDS, declaring, [...] "I am today shedding the shackles of communalism to strive for communal harmony, for which the JDS is working." [...] His successor Suryanarayana also denied any involvement in the attacks. Some pro-Hindu elements believed that the attacks were politically motivated by the main opposition parties in the state rather than being purely based upon religious indifference, especially the Milagres Church attack.|$|E

2500|$|Rama's {{life story}} is imbued with symbolism. According to Sheldon Pollock, {{the life of}} Rama as told in the Indian texts is a {{masterpiece}} that offers a framework to represent, conceptualize and comprehend {{the world and the}} nature of life. Like major epics and religious stories around the world, it has been of vital relevance because it [...] "tells the culture what it is". Rama's <b>life</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> complex than the Western template for the battle between the good and the evil, where there is a clear distinction between immortal powerful gods or heroes and mortal struggling humans. In the Indian traditions, particularly Rama, the story is about a divine human, a mortal god, incorporating both into the exemplar who transcends both humans and gods.|$|E
2500|$|Belief in {{the afterlife}} varies among Wiccans, and does not occupy a central place within the religion.

Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife, it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death. Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from Hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} {{epilepsy}} {{on the quality}} of life of older people with epilepsy has rarely been investigated. As part of a large prevalence study of epilepsy conducted in one UK Health Region, we investigated the burden of their condition in older compared with younger people. A second analysis compared quality of life in those men and women diagnosed after the age of retirement from the workforce compared with those diagnosed before that age. Data were collected from men and women with epilepsy and from their primary and secondary care physicians. There were few differences between older and younger people with regard to their reported quality of life, though younger people <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to report feeling stigmatized by their condition. Older people with epilepsy diagnosed in later <b>life</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> anxious and depressed than those diagnosed earlier and their overall perception of quality of <b>life</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> negative. Our data emphasize that older people do not necessarily experience poorer quality of life than younger people, but those first diagnosed in later life do appear to have a quality of <b>life</b> which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> impaired. Consideration should be paid to the important psychosocial consequences of epilepsy in the older person...|$|R
