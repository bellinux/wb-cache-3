50|$|<b>Letterpress</b> <b>printing</b> was {{the normal}} <b>form</b> of <b>printing</b> text from its {{invention}} by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century until the 19th century and remained in wide use for books and other uses {{until the second}} half of the 20th century. <b>Letterpress</b> <b>printing</b> remained the primary way to print and distribute information until the 20th century, when offset printing was developed, which largely supplanted its role in printing books and newspapers.

More recently, <b>letterpress</b> <b>printing</b> has seen a revival in an artisanal form.|$|R
