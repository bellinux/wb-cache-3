Even when broken and disabled from overuse they {{have a kind of}} respectability which must commend itself to the observer, and which partakes of the pensive grace of ruin. An old table with one leg gone, and slowly <b>lapsing</b> <b>to</b> decay in the woodshed, is the emblem of a fitter order than the same table, with all its legs intact, stored {{with the rest of the}} furniture from a broken home. Spinning-wheels gathering dust in the garret of a house that is itself falling to pieces have a dignity that deserts them when they are dragged from their refuge, and furbished up with ribbons and a tuft of fresh tow, and made to serve the hollow occasions of bric-a-brac, as they were a few years ago. A pitcher broken at the fountain, or a battered kettle on a rubbish heap, is a venerable object, but not crockery and copper-ware stored in the possibility of future need. However carefully handed down from one generation to another, the old objects have a forlorn incongruity in their successive surroundings which appeals to the compassion rather than the veneration of the witness.|$|E
5000|$|Racial {{antisemitism}} {{has existed}} alongside religious antisemitism since the Middle Ages, if not earlier. In Spain {{even before the}} Edict of Expulsion of 1492, Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism (conversos in Spanish), and their descendants, were called New Christians. They were frequently accused of <b>lapsing</b> <b>to</b> their former religious practices ("Crypto-Jews"). To isolate conversos, the Spanish nobility developed an ideology of [...] "cleanliness of blood". The conversos were called [...] "New Christians" [...] to indicate their inferior status in society. That ideology {{was a form of}} racism, as in the past there were no grades of Christianity and a convert had equal standing. Cleanliness of blood was an issue of ancestry, not of personal religion. The first statute of purity of blood appeared in Toledo in 1449, where an anti-converso riot lead to conversos being banned from most official positions. Initially these statutes were condemned by the monarchy and the Church. However, the New Christians came to be hounded and persecuted by the Spanish Inquisition after 1478, the Portuguese Inquisition after 1536, the Peruvian Inquisition after 1570 and the Mexican Inquisition after 1571, as well as the Inquisition in Colombia after 1610.|$|E
40|$|Purpose To {{analyze the}} {{functional}} outcome {{with regard to}} the development of visual acuity and radiation induced optic neuropathy of patients with parapapillary choroidal melanoma treated with proton beam therapy. Design Clinical case series, retrospective study. Methods We evaluated 147 consecutive patients with parapapillary choroidal melanoma who received proton beam therapy as primary tumor treatment at the Helmholtz Center in Berlin from 1998 to 2005. A cumulative dose of 60 Cobalt Gray Equivalents CGE was delivered to the tumor and the optic disc received a minimum of 50 CGE. Kaplan Meier analysis was used to assess ocular outcome and survival rates. For trend analysis of functional development, Wilcoxon Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the medians of 2 groups and Kruskal Wallis test was used in the case of more than 2 groups. Results The mean follow up time was 6. 5 years range 0. 3 11. 7 years. The most common side effects were radiation induced optic neuropathy, retinopathy, and cataract. The median visual acuity before and within the first year after therapy was 0. 4 logMAR 20 50, <b>lapsing</b> <b>to</b> 1. 3 logMAR 20 400 after 3 years and 1. 4 logMAR 20 500 after 5 years. During follow up, no light perception developed in 17 cases 11. 6, mostly attributed to radiation induced retinopathy, optic neuropathy, and secondary glaucoma. Enucleation was carried out in 14 patients 9. 5 because of local recurrence or severe side effects. Conclusion Radiation induced optic neuropathy is an expected issue after proton beam therapy of parapapillary choroidal melanoma, and visual impairment is common during long term follow up, but some useful vision can be preserved in a considerable number of patients.

40|$|O médico, jurista islâmico e filósofo andalusino Ibn-Rud, nascido em Córdova em 1126 e morto em Marraqueche em 1198, é mais conhecido no Ocidente latino como Averróis, o comentador das obras de Aristóteles. A lógica do filósofo grego serviu de base para o filósofo andalusino empreender, de forma metódica, sua crítica aos métodos ortodoxos dos grupos religiosos de seu tempo. Ibn-Rud foi um dos representantes da chamada falsafah, filosofia árabe, ou filosofia em árabe, constituindo-se em seu último e ápice representante no período medieval. Deixou uma obra capital em todos os domínios do saber, sendo considerado o maior filósofo aristotélico do século XII, testemunha de uma época gloriosa do Ocidente islâmico, o Alandalus. O Fa½l almaql / Discurso decisivo é uma obra escrita com a finalidade de refletir sobre a relação entre a lei revelada e a filosofia. Instaura a reflexão filosófica no âmbito jurídico-religioso, justificando a validade da interpretação filosófica do Livro Sagrado islâmico, o Corão, que para o filósofo é uma prescrição a ser conhecida e não apenas acreditada. Nessa obra, Ibn-Rud preocupou-se em indicar com precisão as melhores formas de assentimento ao saber. Em relação às pessoas cultas no caso, os filósofos a mais elevada forma de conhecimento é aquela do conhecimento obtido via a demonstração; e, em relação aos outros, incluídos os teólogos, é a forma de conhecimento obtido via a discussão dialética e a persuasão retórica. Eis o grande projeto do filósofo andalusino: a defesa da filosofia a partir da leitura atenta e aprofundada do Corão, por um lado, e da interpretação jurídica da lei revelada, por outro.

40|$|Esta dissertação registra uma análise de situação da avaliação no ensino técnico em enfermagem com base nas diretrizes curriculares nacionais para o ensino técnico e na concepção de enfermagem como cuidado humano. Os atores reconhecidos e escutados pela pesquisa foram cuidadores (técnicos em enfermagem e enfermeiros), educadores (professores e supervisores de estágio), aprendizes e usuários, o que difere na totalidade dos estudos realizados até então, a maioria abordando apenas a díade professor-alunos ou a triangulação professor-aluno-alunos. A metodologia utilizada foi da abordagem qualitativa, mediante entrevista, análise dos documentos e realização de um grupo focal, a fim de evidenciar a existência de territórios avaliativos, mais que um sentido e prática únicos à avaliação, tendo em vista compreender a teia que a mesma se insere na formação profissional de técnicos em enfermagem. As entrevistas abrangeram educadores, aprendizes, cuidadores e usuários e um grupo focal que foi realizado com educadores. Trabalhar com ensino técnico em enfermagem exige um exercício de pensar e fazer saúde de forma intensa, pois este profissional é formado para permanecer muito tempo com os usuários, acolhendo, interagindo e escutando-os, além de prestar-lhes procedimentos diretos de cuidado em enfermagem e execução da prescrição médica. Avaliar alguém que está aprendendo a cuidar é tarefa complexa e que mobiliza muitos cenários (serviços, políticas e sistemas de saúde) e atores (educadores, aprendizes, cuidadores e usuários). A situação encontrada na análise foi a de que tanto a formação como a avaliação da aprendizagem das práticas laborais estão embasadas na prescrição médica, nas rotinas de enfermagem e na história natural da doença, mas não no cuidado humano. Os aprendizes não compreendem porque a teoria não é possível de ser aplicada na prática e gostariam de mais interpenetração teoria-prática, os educadores desconhecem as rotinas dos serviços e sofrem a descontinuidade dos processos formativos, os cuidadores manifestam o desejo de serem ouvidos nos processos avaliativos e os usuários, comunicação, mas não são desenvolvidas estratégias para vencer entraves a esses desejos e necessidades. Conclui-se que o tema deveria convocar as escolas e os serviços e saúde onde ocorrem as práticas de ensino, a fim de tecerem a integração de suas ações no processo de formação em saúde, implicando a gestão da educação na saúde no país para além da formulação de diretrizes do ensino e à autorização de cursos. This text {{shows an}} {{analysis}} of situation’s evaluation of the nursing technical studies based on national school lines of direction for technicians’ education and concept nursery as well-taken care of human being. The collaborators recognized and listened for the research were responsibles (graduates chiefs-nurses and nurses), educators (teachers and supervisors of apprentice), apprenticees and others users, on an aspect that differs on totality of the (until then) studies carried through, at most approaching only relations between professor-pupils or the triangulation professor-pupil-pupils. The methodology was of the qualitative boarding, by means of interview, analysis of documents and accomplishment of a focal group, in order to evidence the existence of evaluations notes of territories, more than a practical direction and only to the evaluation, in view of understanding the web that the one inserts itself in the professional formation of technician in nursing. The interviews had enclosed educators, apprenticees, nurses on charge and users and a focal group that was carried through with educators. To work with education technician in nursing demands an exercise to think and to make health of intense form, therefore this professional is graduated after {{spending a lot of}} time with the users, receiving, interacting and listening to them, besides giving to them to procedures right-handers of care in nursing and execution of the medical <b>lapsing.</b> <b>To</b> evaluate somebody that is learning how to be a responsible nurse is a complex task and that it mobilizes many aspects (services, politics and systems of health) and responsables (educators, apprenticees, people-in-charge and users). The situation found in the analysis was the formation and the evaluation of the learning of practical the labor ones is based in the medical lapsing, the routines of nursing and the natural history of the illness, but not in the human care. The apprenticees don’t understand because the theory is not possible of being applied and they would like more theory-practical interpenetration, the educators are unaware of the services’ routines and suffer the discontinuity from the formative processes, the people-in-reveal the desire to be heard on evaluation processes and the users communication, but strategies are not developed to win impediments to these desires and necessities. It is concluded that the subject would have to convoke schools, services and health where the use of educational theories really occur, in order to weave the integration of its action in the process of formation in health, implying the management of the education in the country’s health process for beyond the formularization of lines of direction of education and to the authorization courses...|$|E

40|$|Slice {{stretching}} effects such as slice sucking {{and slice}} wrapping arise when foliating the extended Schwarzschild spacetime with maximal slices. For arbitrary spatial coordinates these effects are quantified {{here in the}} context of boundary conditions where the lapse arises as a linear combination of odd and even lapse. Favourable boundary conditions are then derived which make the overall slice stretching occur late in numerical simulations. Allowing the <b>lapse</b> <b>to</b> become negative, this requirement leads <b>to</b> <b>lapse</b> functions which approach at late times the odd <b>lapse</b> corresponding <b>to</b> the static Schwarzschild metric. Demanding, however, that a numerically favourable lapse remains non-negative, as a result the average of odd and even lapse is obtained. At late times the lapse with zero gradient at the puncture arising for the puncture evolution is precisely of this form.
