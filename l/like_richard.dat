5|$|In {{addition}} to the main campaign, Medieval: Total War also features a game mode where the player can undertake various historical campaigns and battles. Historical campaigns allow the player to control a series of famous battles from a war of the medieval period, such as the Hundred Years War and the Crusades, playing as historic commanders <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> the Lionheart. Individual historic battles have the player controlling a historical figure in an isolated battle {{that occurred in the}} era, such as controlling William Wallace through the Battle of Stirling Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, biographers {{began writing}} about Lenin {{soon after his}} death; some – like Christopher Hill – were {{sympathetic}} to him, and others – <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Pipes and Robert Gellately – expressly hostile. Some later biographers, such as Read and Lars Lih, sought to avoid making either hostile or positive comments about him, thereby evading politicised stereotypes. Among sympathisers, he was portrayed as having made a genuine adjustment of Marxist theory that enabled it to suit Russia's particular socio-economic conditions. The Soviet view characterised {{him as a man}} who recognised the historically inevitable and accordingly helped to make the inevitable happen. Conversely, the majority of Western historians have perceived him as a person who manipulated events in order to attain and then retain political power, moreover considering his ideas as attempts to ideologically justify his pragmatic policies. More recently, revisionists in both Russia and the West have highlighted the impact that pre-existing ideas and popular pressures exerted on Lenin and his policies.|$|E
5|$|Many Flemish {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} eastern England during the 12th century, {{and they were}} persecuted after Henry II became king in 1154; {{a large number of}} them were killed near Bury St Edmunds in 1173 at the Battle of Fornham fought between Henry II and Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. Paul Harris has suggested that the green children's Flemish parents perished during a period of civil strife and that the children may have come from the village of Fornham St Martin, slightly to the north of Bury St Edmunds, where a settlement of Flemish fullers existed at that time. They may have fled and ultimately wandered to Woolpit. Disoriented, bewildered, and dressed in unfamiliar Flemish clothes, the children would have presented a very strange spectacle to the Woolpit villagers. The children's colour could be explained by green sickness, the result of a dietary deficiency. Brian Haughton considers Harris's explanation to be plausible, and the one most widely accepted, although not without its difficulties. For instance, he suggests it is unlikely that an educated local man <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> de Calne would not have recognised the language spoken by the children as being Flemish.|$|E

25|$|In English {{the word}} spleen was {{customary}} {{during the period}} of the 18th century.

William Shakespeare, in Julius Caesar uses the spleen to describe Cassius' irritable nature.|$|E
25|$|The radical liberal {{movement}} {{began in}} the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty.

25|$|On 4 May (5 {{days before}} Meinhof's death) the four {{defendants}} requested to provide {{data about the}} Vietnam War. They claimed that since the military intervention in Vietnam by U.S (and indirectly FRG), had violated international law, the U.S. military bases in West Germany were justifiably targets of international retaliation.

25|$|In 1904, Kraus {{supported}} Frank Wedekind to {{make possible}} the staging in Vienna of his controversial play Pandora's Box; the play {{told the story of}} a sexually enticing young dancer who rises in German society through her relationships with wealthy men but later falls into poverty and prostitution. These plays' frank depiction of sexuality and violence, including lesbianism and an encounter with Jack the Ripper, pushed against the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on the stage at the time. Wedekind's works are considered among the precursors of expressionism, but in 1914, when expressionist poets <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Dehmel began producing war propaganda, Kraus became a fierce critic of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Hackney was very broad, including a grounding in the Greek and Latin classics, mathematics, history, government, science, and, of course, religion. Much of his education there was along traditional lines; however, the tutelage having been {{strongly influenced by}} eminent Dissenting thinkers of the day <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Price and Joseph Priestley, there was also much that was nonconformist. Priestley, whom Hazlitt had read and who {{was also one of}} his teachers, was an impassioned commentator on political issues of the day. This, along with the turmoil {{in the wake of the}} French Revolution, sparked in Hazlitt and his classmates lively debates on these issues, as they saw their world being transformed around them.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{use of the}} ceratopsids' {{horns and}} frills was another long-running controversy in ceratopsian paleontology. Early researchers <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Swann Lull thought that bony frills served as the attachment site for enlarged jaw muscles. This explanation was followed by researchers like Russell, Haas, and Ostrom. Sternberg thought the horns of ceratopsians helped defend against predators. In 1961, Davitashvili proposed that ceratopsids used their horns and frills to compete over mates. Farlow and Dodson arrived at the same conclusion in the , and were followed by Ralph Molnar. Ostrom, who had previously followed the jaw musculature interpretation, came to support this view in 1986. The idea gained further support in the 1990s from researchers like Forster and Sampson.|$|E
25|$|It was Titiev that White {{brought to}} Michigan {{as a second}} {{professor}} in 1936. As a student of White—perhaps {{his status as a}} Russian immigrant was also salient—Titiev suited White perfectly. However, during the Second World War, Titiev took part in the war effort by studying Japan. Perhaps this upset the socialist White—in any case by war's end White had broken with Titiev and the two were hardly even on speaking terms. More faculty were not hired until after the war, when the two-man department was expanded. This, compounded by the foundation by Titiev of the East Asian Studies Program and the import of scholars <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> K. Beardsley into the department, created a split on which most professors fell one way or another.|$|E

5000|$|A {{third and}} final {{argument}} people have claimed Skocpol to make in “States and Social Revolutions” is that a general theory on revolutions can be made simply through the comparison of {{a select group of}} revolutions. Goodwin, <b>like</b> <b>Richards,</b> says Skocpol’s book does not try to create an overarching theory of revolution by using the three examples of revolutions. To the contrary, “she explicitly warns that her conjunctural explanation for social revolutions in this particular context cannot be mechanically extended to others.” ...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} into {{maturity of}} classical liberalism took place {{before and after}} the French Revolution in Britain. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of J. S. Mill's Principles in 1848. Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth, and the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth. And the radical liberal movement began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing natural rights and popular sovereignty. Radicals <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Price and Joseph Priestley saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of Protestant Dissenters, the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.|$|E
25|$|After the Soviet victory, various grandiose war {{memorials}} {{were built}} in Berlin, including one in the Tiergarten and another, larger one in Treptow. The first major Stalinist building in Germany was the Soviet embassy in Unter den Linden. This was initially mocked by Modernists such as Hermann Henselmann, and until around 1948, East Berlin's city planning (directed by Hans Scharoun) was Modernist, as in the galleried apartments that comprise {{the first part of}} a planned Stalinallee. However the government condemned these experiments and adopted the Russian style, {{and the rest of the}} Stalinallee was designed by Henselmann and former Modernists <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Paulick in what was disrespectfully dubbed Zuckerbäckerstil ('wedding cake style'). Similar, if less grandiose, monuments were designed in other cities, such as Leipzig, Dresden, Magdeburg, Rostock or the new town of Stalinstadt.|$|E
25|$|On value, Petty {{continued}} the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose {{to develop an}} input-based theory of value: all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour (p.44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. <b>Like</b> <b>Richard</b> Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the 'mother and father' of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one's 'art and industry'. He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production.|$|E

25|$|After World War II {{the term}} School of Paris often {{referred}} to Tachisme, the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to Cobra. In 1952 Michel Tapié authored the book Un Autre art which gave name and voice to Informalism. Important proponents being Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, and Georges Mathieu, among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist), and de Staël, abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and {{he became one of}} the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American Bay Area Figurative Movement, as many of those abstract painters <b>like</b> <b>Richard</b> Diebenkorn, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Wayne Thiebaud, Nathan Oliveira, Joan Brown and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël 's late work – in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. Nicolas de Staël's bold and intensely vivid color in his last paintings predict the direction of much of contemporary painting that came after him including Pop art of the 1960s.|$|E

50|$|Lou's {{personality}} was outwardly {{that of a}} tough loner and {{a workaholic}} man's man, with little subtlety. The real Lou Grant was somewhat more complicated. He was quick to anger and had a violent streak, at times threatening the barely competent Ted Baxter and once causing him physical injury. However, those who understood him best, <b>like</b> Mary <b>Richards,</b> knew he was also painfully shy, with a particular awkwardness around women. With those few people he trusted, again <b>like</b> Mary <b>Richards,</b> Lou was protective and could at times confide his emotional vulnerability.|$|R
