5000|$|Two {{days after}} the death of Joseph Stalin the Politburo decreed placing his remains on display in the Mausoleum; it officially reopened in November 1953 with Lenin and Stalin side-by-side. Another plan decreed in March 1953, {{construction}} of the Pantheon to where the bodies of Lenin and Stalin would be eventually relocated, did not take off. Eight years later, removal of Stalin's body from the Mausoleum was unanimously sanctioned by the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party. On October 31, 1961, the Mausoleum was quickly covered with plywood. Red Square itself was routinely closed in preparation to November 7 parade. Stalin's remains were quickly re-interred in a deep grave, <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks,</b> behind the Mausoleum; the ceremony was attended only by the state commission led by Nikolay Shvernik. Harold Skilling, who attended the Mausoleum in November of the same year, noted that [...] "everyone was so curious to see the new grave of Stalin... Unlike others, his grave was not yet graced by a bust and was marked only by a tablet with the name I.V.Stalin and dates of birth and death". The existing tomb of Stalin carved by Nikolai Tomsky was installed in June 1970.|$|R
5000|$|To {{meet the}} growing {{demands for a}} {{drinking}} water supply to Hastings, trial boreholes were sunk in 1892, initially close to Brede Bridge, but then further to the west {{on the south side}} of the river. A continuous pumping test was conducted in 1896, and the boreholes were able to supply [...] per day for six months, and so parliamentary approval was obtained for the scheme. However, landowners demanded high prices for their land, and extraction royalties for the water. Church Farm was located on the north bank of the river, and when it was offered for sale, Hastings Council bought it, assuming that water would be available beneath it. Work commenced in 1899, to sink two wells on the farm, numbered 1 and 3, while well number 2 was to the south of the river, on land sold to them by Miss Brisco. The ground conditions were treacherous, but after 4 years, the two north bank wells had reached 275 ft while the south bank well had reached 200 ft. Some 2700 ft of headings and adits to connect the wells together were also constructed. Unexpectedly, the soft ground meant that the wells had to be <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the work cost £38,412, against the original estimate of £14,630.|$|R
50|$|The mansions {{were viewed}} by local {{government}} {{as symbols of}} Anglo-Canadian power over the French Canadians and a massive demolition spree was undertaken between 1930 and 1975. For example, Drummond Street in 1925 was a quiet, tree-lined avenue on which stood several Queen Anne and Neo Gothic mansions. By 1975, it had become another bland, treeless street <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> back-to-back <b>concrete</b> tower <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
