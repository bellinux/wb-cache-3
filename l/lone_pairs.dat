Presumably the resulting repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a significant}} destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Dinitrogen {{is able to}} {{coordinate}} to metals in five different ways. The more well-characterised ways are the end-on M←N≡N (η1) and M←N≡N→M (μ, bis-η1), in which the <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation. The less well-characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond, either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations (μ, bis-η2) or to just one (η2). The fifth and unique method involves triple-coordination as a bridging ligand, donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond (μ3-N2). A few complexes feature multiple N2 ligands and some feature N2 bonded in multiple ways. Since N2 is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide (CO) and acetylene (C2H2), the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds, although N2 is a weaker σ-donor and π-acceptor than CO. Theoretical studies show that σ donation is a more important factor allowing {{the formation of the}} M–N bond than π back-donation, which mostly only weakens the N–N bond, and end-on (η1) donation is more readily accomplished than side-on (η2) donation.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen may be usefully {{compared}} to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen {{as well as}} its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth). Although each period 2 element from lithium to nitrogen shows some similarities to the period 3 element in the next group from magnesium to sulfur (known as the diagonal relationships), their degree drops off quite abruptly past the boron–silicon pair, so that the similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present. Nitrogen resembles oxygen far more than it does carbon with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> of electrons. It does not share carbon's proclivity for catenation, with the longest chain of nitrogen yet discovered being composed of only eight nitrogen atoms (PhN=N–N(Ph)–N=N–N(Ph)–N=NPh). One property nitrogen does share with both its horizontal neighbours is its preferentially forming multiple bonds, typically with carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms, through pπ–pπ interactions; thus, for example, nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and thus has very much lower melting (−210°C) and boiling points (−196°C) than the rest of its group, as the N2 molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles. This is not possible for its vertical neighbours; thus, the nitrogen oxides, nitrites, nitrates, nitro-, nitroso-, azo-, and diazo-compounds, azides, cyanates, thiocyanates, and imino-derivatives find no echo with phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth. By the same token, however, the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen.|$|E

50|$|One of the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> {{electrons}} {{moves down}} {{to form a}} pi bond with an electron from an adjacent (alpha) bond. The other electron from the bond moves to an adjacent atom (not one adjacent to the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> atom) creating a radical. This creates a double bond adjacent to the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> atom (oxygen is a good example) and breaks/cleaves the bond from which the two electrons were removed.|$|R
25|$|Place <b>lone</b> <b>pairs.</b> Each oxygen must be {{bonded to}} the nitrogen, which uses four electrons—two in each bond. The 14 {{remaining}} electrons should initially be placed as 7 <b>lone</b> <b>pairs.</b> Each oxygen {{may take a}} maximum of 3 <b>lone</b> <b>pairs,</b> giving each oxygen 8 electrons including the bonding pair.

25|$|Water, , {{also has}} a {{tetrahedral}} structure, with two hydrogen atoms and two <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> of electrons around the central oxygen atoms. Its tetrahedral symmetry is not perfect, however, because the <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> repel more than the single O–H bonds.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the total}} number of {{available}} electrons has been determined, electrons must be placed into the structure. They should be placed initially as lone pairs: one pair of dots for each pair of electrons available. <b>Lone</b> <b>pairs</b> should initially be placed on outer atoms (other than hydrogen) until each outer atom has eight electrons in bonding pairs and lone pairs; extra <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> may then be placed on the central atom. When in doubt, <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> should be placed on more electronegative atoms first.|$|E

The calculated electronic densities in BiB 3 O 6 picture the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> lobe at Bi for the first time. The formation of the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> lobe in BiB 3 O 6 is studied and discussed in much detail based on the density of states of BiB 3 O 6 assuming several isostructural cells expanded and compressed isotropically with respect to the experimental geometry. The factors that lead to the stereochemically active <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> lobe are identified as the covalent interactions between Bi 6 s 6 p orbitals and O 2 p orbitals. The influence of the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> electrons on lattice movements of BiB 3 O 6 is clarified by first calculating the vibrational frequencies of BiB 3 O 6 and assigning all modes, and then subsequently comparing BiB 3 O 6 with the vibrations of the hypothetical isostructural compound TlB 3 O 6 without metal <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> electrons in it...|$|R
50|$|Other {{molecules}} have a tetrahedral {{arrangement of}} electron pairs around a central atom; for example ammonia (NH3) with the nitrogen atom surrounded by three hydrogens and one <b>lone</b> <b>pair.</b> However the usual classification considers only the bonded atoms {{and not the}} <b>lone</b> <b>pair,</b> so that ammonia is actually considered as pyramidal. The H-N-H angles are 107°, contracted from 109.5. This difference is attributed {{to the influence of}} the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> which exerts a greater repulsive influence than a bonded atom.|$|R

25|$|Satisfy the octet rule. Both oxygen atoms {{currently}} have 8 electrons assigned to them. The nitrogen atom has only 6 electrons assigned to it. One of the <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> on an oxygen atom must form a double bond, but either atom will work equally well. Therefore, {{there is a}} resonance structure.|$|E
25|$|Heterocycles {{are often}} {{activated}} towards cation-π binding when the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> on the heteroatom is in {{incorporated into the}} aromatic system (e.g. indole, pyrrole). Conversely, when the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> does not contribute to aromaticity (e.g. pyridine), the electronegativity of the heteroatom wins out and weakens the cation-π binding ability.|$|R
5000|$|Nitrogen {{has five}} valence {{electrons}} and in simple amines it is trivalent, {{with the two}} remaining electrons forming a <b>lone</b> <b>pair.</b> Through that pair, nitrogen can form an additional bond to hydrogen making it tetravalent and with a positive charge in ammonium salts. Many nitrogen compounds can thus be potentially basic but its degree depends on the configuration: the nitrogen atom in amides is not basic due to delocalization of the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> into a double bond and in pyrrole the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> {{is part of an}} aromatic sextet.|$|R

25|$|In {{molecules}} {{in which a}} central atom does not complete the octet rule (has less than {{the maximum number of}} electron pairs), then it gives rise to partial double bonding characteristics and thus, making the bonds shorter than 54pm.

25|$|Ethers are {{slightly}} polar. The C–O–C bond angle in the functional group is about 110°, and the C–O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes {{but not as}} polar as alcohols, esters, or amides of comparable structure. The presence of two <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> of electrons on the oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.|$|E
25|$|All {{the ring}} {{atoms in the}} {{pyridine}} molecule are sp2-hybridized. The nitrogen {{is involved in the}} π-bonding aromatic system using its unhybridized p orbital. The <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> is in an sp2 orbital, projecting outward from the ring in the same plane as the σ bonds. As a result, the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> does not contribute to the aromatic system but importantly influences the chemical properties of pyridine, as it easily supports bond formation via an electrophilic attack. However, because of the separation of the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> from the aromatic system of the ring affects, the nitrogen atom cannot exhibit a positive mesomeric effect.|$|R

25|$|Alcohols can be {{oxidised}} to give aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids, or {{they can}} be dehydrated to alkenes. They can react with carboxylic acids to form ester compounds, and they can (if activated first) undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. The <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> of electrons on the oxygen of the hydroxyl group also makes alcohols nucleophiles. For more details, see the reactions of alcohols section below.|$|E
25|$|Once all <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> are placed, atoms—especially {{the central}} atoms—may {{not have an}} octet of {{electrons}}. In this case, the atoms must form a double bond; a {{lone pair of electrons}} is moved to form a second bond between the two atoms. As the bonding pair is shared between the two atoms, the atom that originally had the lone pair still has an octet; the other atom now has two more electrons in its valence shell.|$|E

40|$|The <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> lies at {{the heart}} of chemistry, and is often in a {{conceptual}} respect the site of chemical reactivity. Here we show how the analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) can be improved upon by introducing intra-basin partitioning. The high-ELF localization domain population (HELP), is presented as a probe of the more chemically relevant and electron-localized regions of the ELF <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> basin, and shown to correlate with a range of physical properties and quantum mechanical constructs, such as the ESP, e and H+ affinity, IP, HOMO/LUMO energies, atomic charge, NBO <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> orbitals, and molecular geometry. A strong connection between topological density and orbital-based analysis of chemistry is intuitively expected, yet this is the first time that an average electron population, obtained by any localization method, can be linked to properties of molecules.

5000|$|Given the {{molecular}} geometry, the researchers surmised {{that this could}} happen only if the sulfur <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> forms a new S-C bond as the electron pair of the breaking S-C bond becomes the new <b>lone</b> <b>pair.</b> Later shown to be incorrect, this idea nevertheless led to a key insight. Lemal and coworkers recognized {{that there are many}} cyclic concerted processes in which nonbonding and bonding electrons can interchange roles, processes that are not subject to the orbital symmetry rules. This led to a term pseudopericyclic. The idea is nicely illustrated by ester pyrolysis, which has been shown to proceed via a planar transition state:At the carbonyl oxygen, a <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> forms the bond to hydrogen, and the pi bond becomes the new <b>lone</b> <b>pair.</b> Because these orbitals lie in perpendicular planes and are thus orthogonal, there is effectively a [...] "disconnection" [...] in the cyclic orbital array that exempts the reaction from orbital symmetry constraints.|$|R
25|$|Reed and Schleyer, {{who were}} skeptical of Pauling’s proposition, {{suggested}} another model in 1990. They determined {{that there was}} no significant back-bonding, but instead proposed that there is extra pi bonding, which arose from the donation of ligand <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> into X-F orbitals. Therefore, Reed and Schleyer believed that the observed shortening of bond lengths in fluorine molecules was {{a direct result of the}} extra pi bonding originating from the ligand, which brought the atoms closer together.|$|E
25|$|For some {{molecules}} and ions, {{it is difficult}} to determine which <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> should be moved to form double or triple bonds, and two or more different resonance structures may be written for the same molecule or ion.
