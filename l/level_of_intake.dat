The present update of the French system is based on the building and interpretation through meta-analysis of large databases on digestion and nutrition of ruminants. Equations involved in the calculation of UF and PDI have been updated, allowing: (1) prediction of the out flow rate of particles and liquid depending on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> and the proportion of concentrate, and the use of this in the calculation of ruminal digestion of protein and starch from in situ data; (2) the system {{to take into account the}} effects of the main factors of digestive interactions (<b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake,</b> proportion of concentrate, rumen protein balance) on organic matter digestibility, energy losses in methane and in urine; (3) more accurate calculation of the energy available in the rumen and the efficiency of its use for the microbial protein synthesis. In this renewed model UF and PDI values of feedstuffs vary depending on diet composition, and intake level. Consequently, standard feed table values can be considered as being only indicative.

40|$|Purpose: Folate-related nutrient–nutrient and nutrient–gene {{interactions}} modify disease risk; {{we therefore}} examined synergistic relationships between dietary folic acid, vitamin C and variant folate genes {{with respect to}} red cell folate status. Methods: Two hundred and twelve subjects were examined using chemiluminescent immunoassay, PCR and food frequency questionnaire to determine red cell and serum folate, 14 folate gene polymorphisms, dietary folate (natural and synthetic) and vitamin C. Results: When examined independently, synthetic PteGlu correlates best with red cell folate at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> (p = 0. 0102), while natural 5 CH 3 -H 4 -PteGlun correlates best with red cell folate at lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> (p = 0. 0035). However, dietary vitamin C and 5 CH 3 -H 4 -PteGlun interact synergistically to correlate with red cell folate at higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> (p = 0. 0005). No interaction between dietary vitamin C and PteGlu was observed. This ‘natural’ nutrient–nutrient interaction may provide an alternative to synthetic PteGlu supplementation that is now linked to adverse phenomena/health outcomes. On its own, vitamin C also correlates with red cell folate (p = 0. 0150) and is strongly influenced by genetic variation in TS, MTHFR and MSR, genes critical for DNA and methionine biosynthesis that underpin erythropoiesis. Similarly, dietary vitamin C and 5 CH 3 -H 4 -PteGlun act synergistically to modify red cell folate status according to variation in folate genes: of note, heterozygosity for 2 R 3 R-TS (p = 0. 0181), SHMT (p = 0. 0046) and all three MTHFR SNPs (p = 0. 0023, 0. 0015 and 0. 0239 for G 1793 A, C 677 T and A 1298 C variants, respectively) promote a significant association with red cell folate. Again, all these genes are critical for nucleic acid biosynthesis. Folate variants with the strongest independent effect on folate status were C 677 T-MTHFR (p = 0. 0004) and G 1793 A-MTHFR (p = 0. 0173). Conclusions: 5 CH 3 -H 4 -PteGlun assimilation and variant folate gene expression products may be critically dependent on dietary vitamin C...|$|R
