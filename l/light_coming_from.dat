5|$|Another {{method is}} to use the {{aberration}} of light, discovered and explained by James Bradley in the 18th century. This effect results from the vector addition of the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5 arcseconds) it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8minutes 12seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E

50|$|In simple terms, {{the edge}} ray {{principle}} states {{that if the}} <b>light</b> rays <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> {{the edges of the}} source are redirected towards the edges of the receiver, this will ensure that all <b>light</b> rays <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the inner points in the source will end up on the receiver. There is no condition on image formation, the only goal is to transfer the light from the source to the target.|$|R
25|$|There is {{at least}} one vertebrate, the spookfish, whose eyes include {{reflective}} optics for focusing of light. Each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below; the <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> above is focused by a lens, while that coming from below, by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals.|$|E
25|$|STS-67 Endeavour (March 2–18, 1995) was {{the second}} flight of the ASTRO observatory, a unique {{complement}} of three telescopes.

25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, so narrow that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently.

His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Red giant branch {{stars have}} another issue for {{detecting}} planets around them: while planets around these stars {{are much more}} likely to transit due to the larger size, these transit signals are hard to separate from the main star's brightness light curve as red giants have frequent pulsations in brightness with a period of few hours to days. This is especially notable with subgiants. In addition, these stars are much more luminous and transiting planets block much smaller percentage of <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> these stars. In the contrary, planets can completely occult a neutron star or a white dwarf which would be easily detectable from Earth. However, due to their small sizes, chance of a planet aligning such a stellar remnant is extremely small.|$|E
25|$|Typenbsp&I Seyferts {{are very}} bright sources of {{ultraviolet}} light and X-rays {{in addition to}} the visible <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> their cores. They have two sets of emission lines on their spectra: narrow lines with widths (measured in velocity units) of several hundred km/s, and broad lines with widths up to 104 km/s. The broad lines originate above the accretion disc of the supermassive black hole thought to power the galaxy, while the narrow lines occur beyond the broad line region of the accretion disc. Both emissions are caused by heavily ionised gas. The broad line emission arises in a region 0.1-1 parsec across. The broad line emission region, RBLR, can be estimated from the time delay corresponding to the time taken by light to travel from the continuum source to the line-emitting gas.|$|E

25|$|Two Spanish friars, Brothers Gabriel de Fontaned and Guillermo de Rigosa {{traveled}} to Rome {{to meet the}} Pope for the approval of their order (The Order of Minims for the Service of the Sick or The Order of Saint Francis of Paola). As they were passing through the town of Traigueras (under the jurisdiction of Tortosa in the Principate of Catalonia), a furious storm descended upon them.

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} front, the forces divided in two parts. The {{infantry}} of the 71st rapidly took the monastery and then {{fought for the}} control of the town. On the other side, the Israeli artillery succeeded in neutralizing the fort's weapons. The volunteers crossed the defence fence and their flame-throwers took the defenders by surprise. Nevertheless, the <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the fire they created lost their cover and they became easy targets for the [...] mortars of the Jordanians. They were quickly knocked out and destroyed. The sappers succeeded nevertheless to make the door explode, but in the confusion were not followed by the infantrymen. Chaim Laskov, the chief of operations on that front, ordered company D of the 71st Battalion (that had been kept in reserve) to intervene, but one of the soldiers accidentally exploded a landmine, killing three men and injuring several others. They were then attacked by heavy fire from the Jordanian artillery and the men retreated towards the west in panic.|$|E
5000|$|Planets or {{stars in}} the night sky can often cause the {{illusion}} to occur. Often these bright stars or planets have been mistaken for landing lights of oncoming aircraft, satellites, or even UFOs. An example of a star that commonly causes this illusion is Sirius, which is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere and in winter appears over the entire continental United States at one to three fist-widths above the horizon. At dusk, the planet Venus can cause this illusion to occur and many pilots have mistaken it as <b>lights</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> other aircraft ...|$|R

500|$|As seen in Fig. 2a and 2b, the {{observer}} {{has a direct}} view of mirror M1 seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image M'2 of mirror M2. The fringes {{can be interpreted as}} the result of interference between <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the two virtual images S'1 and S'2 of the original source S. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend {{on the nature of the}} light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig.2a, the optical elements are oriented so that S'1 and S'2 are in line with {{the observer}}, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to M1 and M'2. If, as in Fig.2b, M1 and M'2 are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if M1 and M'2 overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced. [...] If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig.2a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of Fig.2b will be localized on the mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|The strong {{wavelength}} {{dependence of}} the scattering (~λ−4) means that shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths.

2500|$|Both Einstein's {{theory of}} special and general {{relativity}} state that light should pass freely through a vacuum without being altered, a principle known as Lorentz invariance.

Nearly all theories of quantum gravity predict that that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature. [...] It is predicted {{the speed at which}} light travels through the vacuum depends on its direction, polarization and the local strength of the magnetic field. There {{have been a number of}} inconclusive results which claim to show evidence of a Lorentz violation by finding a rotation of the polarization plane of <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> distant galaxies.

50|$|The {{direction}} of the lighting placed on a painting also seems {{to have an effect}} on aesthetic preference. The left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with <b>lighting</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place lighting on the upper left side of a piece of artwork.

2500|$|The first derivations of {{relativity}} of simultaneity by synchronization with light signals were also simplified. Daniel Frost Comstock (1910) placed an observer {{in the middle}} between two clocks A and B. From this observer a signal is sent to both clocks, and in the frame in which A and B are at rest, they synchronously start to run. But {{from the perspective of}} a system in which A and B are moving, clock B is first set in motion, and then comes clock A– so the clocks are not synchronized. Also Einstein (1917) created a model with an observer in the middle between A and B. However, in his description two signals are sent from A and B to the observer. From the perspective of the frame in which A and B are at rest, the signals are sent at the same time and the observer [...] "is hastening towards the beam of <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> B, whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of <b>light</b> <b>coming</b> <b>from</b> A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he will see that emitted from A. Observers who take the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place earlier than the lightning flash A." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Nikephoros Kallistos (writing in fourteenth century) {{the church}} {{by that time}} had a {{rectangular}} shape of basilica type, with a 4:3 proportion between the sides, and was partly subterranean.

Around the church there were three chapels, devoted respectively to Saint Eustratius, the Theotokos and Saint Anne.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{blurring}} is {{not caused}} by random processes, such as light scattering, but can be well defined by the optical properties of the image formation in the microscope imaging system.
