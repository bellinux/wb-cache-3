5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (<b>lobectomy)</b> is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full <b>lobectomy,</b> a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than <b>lobectomy.</b> Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS <b>lobectomy</b> use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS <b>lobectomy</b> is equally effective compared to conventional open <b>lobectomy,</b> with less postoperative illness.|$|E
5|$|While TBI may {{be managed}} without surgery, {{surgical}} repair of the tear is considered {{standard in the}} treatment of most TBI. It is required if a tear interferes with ventilation; if mediastinitis (inflammation of the tissues in the mid-chest) occurs; or if subcutaneous or mediastinal emphysema progresses rapidly; or if air leak or large pneumothorax is persistent despite chest tube placement. Other indications for surgery are a tear more than one third the circumference of the airway, tears with loss of tissue, and a need for positive pressure ventilation. Damaged tissue around a rupture (e.g. torn or scarred tissue) may be removed in order to obtain clean edges that can be surgically repaired. Debridement of damaged tissue can shorten the trachea by as much as 50%. Repair of extensive tears can include sewing a flap of tissue taken from the membranes surrounding the heart or lungs (the pericardium and pleura, respectively) over the sutures to protect them. When lung tissue is destroyed as a result of TBI complications, pneumonectomy or <b>lobectomy</b> (removal of a lung or of one lobe, respectively) may be required. Pneumonectomy is avoided whenever possible due to the high rate of death associated with the procedure. Surgery to repair a tear in the tracheobronchial tree can be successful even when it is performed months after the trauma, as can occur if the diagnosis of TBI is delayed. When airway stenosis results after delayed diagnosis, surgery is similar to that performed after early diagnosis: the stenotic section is removed and the cut airway is repaired.|$|E

As a result, Molaison had bilateral damage to both the hippocampal formation and the perirhinal cortex. Molaison had average intelligence and perceptual ability and a decent vocabulary. However, he could not learn new words or remember things that had happened {{more than a few}} minutes earlier. He could remember anything from his childhood. If the memory was created from before his <b>lobectomy,</b> he still had the ability to retrieve it and remember. However, he was able to learn some new skills.

25|$|Consistent with hemispheric lateralization, {{there is}} {{evidence}} to suggest that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are responsible for different components of musical memory. By studying the learning curves of patients who have had damage to either their left or right medial temporal lobes, Wilson & Saling (2008) found hemispheric differences in the contributions of the left and right medial temporal lobes in melodic memory. Ayotte, Peretz, Rousseau, Bard & Bojanowski (2000) found that those patients who had their left middle cerebral artery cut in response to an aneurysm suffered greater impairments when performing tasks of musical long term memory, than those patients who had their right middle cerebral artery cut. Thus, they concluded that the left hemisphere is mainly important for musical representation in long term memory, whereas the right is needed primarily to mediate access to this memory. Sampson and Zatorre (1991) studied patients with severe epilepsy who underwent surgery for relief as well as control subjects. They found deficits in memory recognition for text regardless of whether it was sung or spoken after a left, but not right temporal <b>lobectomy.</b> However, melody recognition when a tune was sung with new words (as compared to encoding) was impaired after either right or left temporal <b>lobectomy.</b> Finally, after a right but not left temporal <b>lobectomy,</b> impairments of melody recognition occurred in the absence of lyrics. This suggests dual memory codes for musical memory, with the verbal code utilizing the left temporal lobe structures and the melodic relying on the encoding involved.|$|E
25|$|Epileptic brain {{activity}} in musical hallucinations originates {{in the left}} or right temporal lobe. In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal <b>lobectomy</b> in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk factors that could have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and tinnitus.|$|E

He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with other}} chest {{injuries}} such as pulmonary contusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax, pulmonary laceration {{can often be}} treated with just supplemental oxygen, ventilation, and drainage of fluids from the chest cavity. A thoracostomy tube {{can be used to}} remove blood and air from the chest cavity. About 5% of cases require surgery, called thoracotomy. Thoracotomy is especially likely to be needed if a lung fails to re-expand; if pneumothorax, bleeding, or coughing up blood persist; or in order to remove clotted blood from a hemothorax. [...] Surgical treatment includes suturing, stapling, oversewing, and wedging out of the laceration.

2500|$|Henry Molaison, {{formerly}} known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident {{at the age of}} nine. [...] Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal <b>lobectomy.</b> His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously.|$|E

Brickner concluded from this evidence that [...] "the frontal lobes are not 'centers' for the intellect". These clinical results were replicated in a similar operation undertaken in 1934 by the neurosurgeon Roy Glenwood Spurling and reported on by the neuropsychiatrist Spafford Ackerly. By the mid-1930s, interest in the function of the frontal lobes reached a high-water mark. This was reflected in the 1935 neurological congress in London, which hosted as part of its deliberations, [...] "a remarkable symposium... on the functions of the frontal lobes." [...] The panel was chaired by Henri Claude, a French neuropsychiatrist, who commenced the session by reviewing the state of research on the frontal lobes, and concluded that, [...] "altering the frontal lobes profoundly modifies the personality of subjects". This parallel symposium contained numerous papers by neurologists, neurosurgeons and psychologists; amongst these was one by Brickner, which impressed Moniz greatly, that again detailed the case of [...] "Patient A". Fulton and Jacobsen's paper, presented in another session of the conference on experimental physiology, was notable in linking animal and human studies on the function of the frontal lobes. Thus, {{at the time of the}} 1935 Congress, Moniz had available to him an increasing body of research on the role of the frontal lobes that extended well beyond the observations of Fulton and Jacobsen.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether robot-assisted video-assisted thora-coscopic surgery (VATS) was more effective than conventional VATS. A total of 64 VATS <b>lobectomies</b> in Papworth Hospital (Cambridge, UK) were included in the study. In 34 cases the <b>lobectomies</b> were performed using conventional VATS (CV group), while in the remaining 30 cases the <b>lobectomies</b> were performed using robot-assisted VATS (Robotic group). In the robot-assisted VATS, FreeHand®, a thoracoscopic camera controller produced by Freehand 2010 Ltd. (Eastleigh, UK), was used. The duration of the thoracoscopic surgery in the Robotic group was 145. 50 ± 10. 43 min, whereas in the CV group the duration was 162. 79 ± 9. 40 min. The surgery duration in the Robotic group was 10. 62 % shorter than that in the CV group (P< 0. 05). The rates of bleeding, pulmonary infection, arrhythmia and prolonged air leak (≥ 5 days) in the Robotic group were 0, 3. 33, 26. 67 and 13. 33 %, respectively, while the corresponding rates in the CV group were 2. 94, 5. 88, 20. 59 and 17. 65 %, respectively. No significant differ-ences were identified in the postoperative complication rates between the two groups (P≥ 0. 05). There was no perioperative mortality in the study.
