5|$|Each team {{played the}} {{formation}} {{typical of the}} era: two full-backs, three half-backs and five forwards. With Tilson absent from the Manchester City line-up, Alec Herd moved across to Tilson's usual centre-forward position, and Bobby Marshall was selected at inside-right. For Everton, Albert Geldard who was injured for the semi-final was selected at outside right, and Ted Critchley who scored the winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final, was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side.|$|E
5|$|The 1911–12 season started {{strongly}} for Macartney. He scored 122 {{and took}} 5/81 as New South Wales defeated Queensland by an innings. However, the season went downhill from there; Macartney {{failed to pass}} 30 in the next ten innings and took only three wickets {{in the next six}} matches. As a result, he was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playing XI and made twelfth man for the first three Tests against the touring England team.|$|E

5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail {{to the post}} offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main route and put {{at the end of}} a branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E

From this, Destiny determines that Renz is actually a vampire and not the Restorer.|$|E

5|$|Cup success {{continued}} in 1969–70. The club reached {{and won the}} League Cup Final, though Young, who had played {{in all but one}} of the preceding rounds, was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team for the final. A second final followed a month later, this time in European competition in the form of the European Cup Winners' Cup. City faced Polish club Górnik Zabrze in the final, held at Prater Stadium in Vienna. Young scored the opening goal, from a rebound after a save by Hubert Kostka. Shortly before half-time Young was fouled in the penalty area by Kostka, and Francis Lee scored the resulting penalty. City won the match 2–1 to become the first English team to win a European and domestic trophy within the same season.|$|E
5|$|During the 1937 season, Verity {{played only}} one of the three Tests against the touring New Zealanders. He took two wickets, and {{although}} batsmen found it difficult to score from his bowling, he did not look dangerous and was <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining Tests in an attempt to strengthen the English bowling attack. He was not selected for the Players and his only other representative cricket was for the North against the South and for teams selected from those who had toured Australia during the English winter. Nevertheless, Verity took 202 wickets at 15.67 which placed him third in the bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Ebsary was {{retained}} for the Rose Bowl {{series against}} New Zealand and {{played in the}} first four ODIs in Australia in February 2010. She made 31 runs at 15.50 in the first two matches and, after Poulton had made a century in the fourth match, was dropped for the fifth and final match as the hosts took a clean sweep. The ODIs were followed by three T20 matches at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand. Ebsary played {{in the first four}} T20 games, scoring 39 runs at 9.75 before being <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final match as New Zealand took a clean sweep. She was overlooked for the three ODIs in New Zealand, which the tourists swept.|$|E

5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, he {{was chosen}} to play for England {{for the first time}} and rose to {{prominence}} during a tour to Australia in 1932–33. Afterwards, he played regularly for England and achieved the best performance of his career when he took 15wickets against Australia in a Test match at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1934. However, critics claimed he was ineffective on good batting pitches, and he was occasionally <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> England team over the following years. Even so, he had one of the best records of any bowler against Donald Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket. Verity continued to play for Yorkshire and England until 1939, when the outbreak of the Second World War ended his career.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain her {{position}} in the national squad, Kydd attended the extended squad's first training camp in September 2005, but {{was one of several}} players forced out after succumbing to a virus. She was subsequently <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team for a practice tour of Jamaica and New Zealand in the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but continued her efforts to make the team for the Games. Finally, on 10 December 2005, she voluntarily withdrew her name from selection, noting ongoing complications from the earlier concussion (team doctors stated that she had probably attempted to return too quickly) and low motivation.|$|E

5|$|In the 2013 Six Nations Championship, O'Gara {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on 10 February 2013, coming on as a replacement against England. He came off the bench against Scotland in Round 3, having lost out on the 10 jersey to Paddy Jackson after Jonathan Sexton's injury against England. O'Gara was dropped from the Ireland squad for the game against France, and was also <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squad for Ireland's final game against Italy, which Ireland lost 22-15, their first-ever defeat to Italy in the Six Nations.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{was called}} into the Test squad to tour New Zealand in late 2002 after Kumble withdrew, but in the warm-up match he bowled one only over, {{in which he was}} {{hammered}} for 23 runs. He then watched from the sidelines as India only fielded one spin bowler—Harbhajan—in the Tests, held on green, pace-friendly surfaces. Kartik returned to India and was ineffective in the zonal one-dayers, taking a total of 1/148 from 24 overs in three matches, conceding more than a run a ball. Combined with his results against the West Indies, the poor returns saw him <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, with Harbhajan and Kumble preferred.|$|E
5|$|Mills' signings for 2012–13 {{proved to}} be less {{influential}} than his signings the previous summer, {{a number of new}} players being <b>left</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team with little playing time. York were in midtable for most {{of the first half of}} the season, and his signings in the winter transfer window had little impact on the team. Having been 14th in the table on 1 January 2013, York went on a run of 11 matches without a win, and this left the team four points above the relegation zone in 18th place. Mills was dismissed by York on 2 March 2013, an hour after the last of these matches, a 2–0 defeat at home to Bradford City.|$|E
50|$|He {{joined the}} Italian {{national}} basketball team in 1997 {{and the following}} year participated in the World Championship; however, he had some arguments with coach Bogdan Tanjević who <b>left</b> him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talented roster at the EuroBasket 1999.|$|R
50|$|An injury <b>left</b> Veloso <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{team that}} reached the 1990 European Cup final, lost to A.C. Milan. He retired at 38 after 15 {{seasons with the}} same club and more than 500 overall appearances, {{subsequently}} becoming a coach.|$|R
