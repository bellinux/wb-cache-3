5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least.

While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which <b>letters</b> <b>were</b> least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E

Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible.

Mellitus also returned to England, but the prevailing pagan mood did not allow {{him to return to}} London; after Laurence's death, Mellitus became Archbishop of Canterbury. According to Bede, Justus received letters of encouragement from Pope Boniface V (619–625), as did Mellitus, although Bede does not record the actual letters. The historian J. M.
