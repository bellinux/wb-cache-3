5000|$|If the {{lubrication}} {{schedule was}} faithfully and conscientiously adhered to, the <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> {{could be very}} good. Large marine engines and stationary engines to power whole factories were likeliest to get such top-quality care. But locomotives, rail cars, agricultural implements, and automobiles were less certain of good care, and <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> without constant lubing tended to be intermittent, from mediocre to bad. Attempts to improve on the simple oil hole concept included putting a small reservoir of oil above the hole, which slowly dripped oil into it.

5000|$|Liqui Moly's {{main product}} is motor oil with MoS2 {{but there are}} also other {{lubricants}} with MoS2 and the additive MoS2 itself to be added by the end user during oil changes. Molybdenum disulfide enhances the <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> of the oil and offers emergency operating features under harsh conditions. It can be added to motor oils and to non-motor oils including gear oil, transmission oil or differentials oils. From this additive, an entire range was developed, with over 4000 products including engine and gear oils, additives and vehicle care products, workshop equipment and service products. In Germany, Liqui Moly {{is one of the leading}} producers of engine oils. Germany remains the main marketplace, but international demands are increasing.

40|$|Among the {{technologies}} {{incorporated into the}} later Mariner missions was a dry film lubricant which offered exceptional <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> for reduced friction and extended wear-life of mating parts in harsh interplanetary environments. Micro Surface Corporation acquired this technology, and currently market it as WS 2 modified tungsten disulfide coating. A pressurized refrigerated air application process impinges a dry metallic WS 2 coating without heat, curing, binders or adhesives. The coating binds instantly to metal or resin substrates with a 20 millionths of an inch thickness. Performance has been excellent {{in a variety of}} industries, particularly in plastics where in some operations, the coating increases production by reducing drag between tool steel and resin. Other advantages include product quality improvement, extension of equipment service life and maintenance elimination or reduction...|$|E

50|$|The {{lubrication}} system, as {{with all}} rotary engines, was a total-loss type in which castor oil was pumped into the fuel-air mix. Castor oil was used {{because it did not}} readily dissolve into the fuel, and because it offered <b>lubrication</b> <b>qualities</b> superior to other available oils. Over two gallons of castor oil were sprayed into the air during each hour of engine operation. This explains why most rotaries were fitted with cowls, with the lowermost quarter omitted to direct the spray of castor oil away from the pilot. Unburnt castor oil from the engine had a laxative effect on the pilot if ingested.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Piston ring-cylinder {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} friction pair of internal combustion engine ，the lubricating state between them has decided internal combustion engine <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality.</b> So the theoretical research to the lubricating characteristics of the piston-ring group, especially the calculation of the lubricating oil film thickness is very important. The oil film thickness between piston-ring and cylinder is studied by calculation method. The calculation program is developed with average Reynolds equation taken the surface topography, viscosity-temperature effect, viscosity-pressure effect, extrusion effect and other factors into account. The position of oil outlet point is preinstalled, the full lubrication is assumed, and the Reynolds equation is solved by full pivot element gausses elimination approach, so the iterative course and calculation workload are reduced, and a great lot of the calculating time is saved, the oil film thickness of full period can be more accurately predicted by the ordinary PC within 30 minutes, which can supply quick effective evidence for next calculation and analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Following {{the pioneer}} work of Ertel-Grubin and Dowson and Higgingson, {{the field of}} elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) has witnessed a remarkable increase in new devel-opments, notably the incorporation into the analysis of roughness and other surface features (micro-EHL). This article describes the application of new developments in micro-EHL in the deduction of simple analytical formulations that might describe, in a better way, the lubrication of rolling bearings and the effects on life ratings. In this context the <b>lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> factors κ (used in rolling bearing technology) and (generally applied in machine design) are critically compared and discussed. It is found that the commonly used average roughness, Rq, is not quite able to properly account for the surface topography effect when the detailed micro-EHL response of the surface has to be accounted for. To this effect, the whole surface micro-geometry needs to be retained in the evaluation. A calculation methodology suitable {{for this type of}} analysis is proposed and used in a parametric evaluation of standard bearing surfaces...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two {{relatively}} unexplored types of surface defects on silicon nitride balls – ‘star’ type defects and ‘missing material’. The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine failure modes and the critical or tolerable defect sizes for rolling bearing applications. This is achieved by means of both experimental and numerical techniques (for finding crack initiation location). A modified four-ball machine is used for the rolling contact fatigue experiments on star features and missing material defects (both during manufacturing process and artificially produced) on the surface of silicon nitride balls. Experiments are conducted at different loads (3. 8 - 4. 8 GPa), lubrication types, specific speed (7500 rpm) and temperature conditions (75 °C) to find rolling contact fatigue limitations in relation to these defects. Laser micromachining is used to produce precise holes and trenches to simulate missing material. Two different types of bearing grade silicon nitride are tested to determine tolerance and failure modes in rolling contact fatigue. Scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy and white light interferometry are used for surface analysis and topography. Post-experiment analysis in the star feature experiments has shown that star like radial cracks are prone to develop into missing material by internal fracture over the extent of the star in lubricated rolling contact. <b>Lubrication</b> <b>quality</b> or film thickness and orientation of the pre-existing cracks to the rolling direction influenced the damage process and severity. In the case of missing material experiments, samples with different diameters (50 - 100 μm), depths (5 - 50 μm) and shape (right cylindrical, conical and oblique cylindrical) were tested. It has been confirmed that, apart from the main experimental parameters like applied pressure, cavity diameter and depth, parameters such as cavity base profile, shape and cavity location and orientation on the contact track are important for rolling contact fatigue of silicon nitride material. Replica produced cavity base profiles to investigate failure reasons. Cross-sectioning also gave very good insight of surface and subsurface features both before and after testing (including un-failed specimens). Incipient spalls on tested samples provided the information to understand the failure mechanism (mainly spalling) in the material. FEM is used for finding stress fields at surface and sub-surface positions and ultimately predicting the location and position of crack initiation. 2 D (Axi-symmetric and plane strain) and 3 D models are developed to compare the results, whereas static versus quasi static analysis is presented to examine the effect of rolling. Models are verified using classical contact theory. Hydrostatic pressure effects are also successfully modeled using the finite element analysis approach. Fluid elements modeling on the solid interface of the cavity produced a different stress field and have indicated the location of crack initiation...|$|E
50|$|Oberursel {{produced}} the 110 hp model, supposedly without authorization in Germany. The Oberursel Ur.II was a straight {{copy of the}} Le Rhône, but the Le Rhône was preferred over the Oberursel due to the materials used in the French product. However, by July 1918 there was a shortage in Germany of castor oil, a plant-derived lubricant that the rotaries required as {{it could not be}} easily dissolved into the fuel, and because it possessed <b>lubrication</b> <b>qualities</b> superior to mineral oils of the day. A new Voltol-based lubricant, derived from mineral oil, was substituted and was blamed for engine failures on rotary-engined German fighters such as the Fokker E.V which used the Oberursel Ur.II. It has been suggested that without proper lubricants, the Le Rhône rotary would have been equally failure-prone.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} occurrence was the DLG-show 1949 in Frankfurt, {{where the}} first MWM diesel engine was bought. Before the tractors were fitted with MWM engines, Wesseler used Deutz engines, which had a bad durability due to bad <b>lubrication</b> oil <b>quality.</b> MWM engines could also use the bad lubrication oil, they became the standard diesel engines of Wesseler tractors; starting in 1953, Wesseler offered every tractor type with a water-cooled and an air-cooled MWM engine of the same power output. Prometheus gearboxes were used first, later, Wesseler switched to ZF gearboxes. Those used to be progressive in the 1950s {{as well as the}} direct injection MWM diesel engines.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{the results of}} recent tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and performed by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These tests address {{the effectiveness of the}} lubricant used on the threaded portion of the valve stem, where the stem nut turns on the stem. Recent testing indicates that an elevated temperature environment can lead to significant increases in the friction coefficient at the stem/stem-nut interface. Most valve actuator qualification tests are performed at room temperature. Similarly, in-service tests are run at ambient plant temperatures, usually 70 to 100 0;F. Since design conditions can lead to valve operating temperatures in the 200 to 300 0;F range, {{it is important to know}} whether a temperature-induced increase in friction at the stem/stem-nut interface will prevent the required operation of critical valves. Lubricant aging is another phenomenon that might have deleterious effects on the thrust output of a valve actuator. Laboratory experience and field experience both indicate that after long periods in elevated temperature environments, the lubricants may lose their <b>lubrication</b> <b>qualities.</b> The scope of the current test program includes testing of five different lubricants on four different valve stems. Pending completion of the testing, results of the tests conducted using two of the four stems are discussed. The test series included collection of baseline data at room temperature, single step temperature tests where the temperature of the test setup was elevated directly to 250 °F, and step testing where the temperature was elevated in steps to 130, 190, and 250 °F, then returned to 70 °F. All greases tested showed evidence of physical change after elevated temperature tests. Except for one particular lubricant, all of the greases tested showed increased coefficients of friction at elevated temperatures. Numerous other preliminary conclusions are presented. Recommendations for future research in the area of aged valve stem lubricant performance at elevated temperatures are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Collaboration and Innovation (C&I) are {{extremely}} popular terms in corporate jargon, and institutions with reputations for creativity often have clever and fun spaces {{set aside for}} hatching ideas and developing products or services. In and of themselves, {{a room full of}} "collaboration furniture" and electronics can't make C&I happen, any more than oil makes a gas or diesel engine run. As with the engine, though, <b>quality</b> <b>lubrication</b> is a huge factor in the smooth operation, power, and longevity of C&I activity. This paper describes spaces deliberately set up at numerous NASA field centers to support collaborative and creative thinking and processes. (Sometimes support {{is not so much a}} matter of doing things to spark discussion as it is removing constraints imposed by traditional settings and making information sharing as easy as possible.) Some spaces are rooms or suites dedicated to C&I, with significant electronic support and/or intentional lack thereof (to emphasize the human element). Others are small, comfortable "roosting places" that invite conversations of opportunity. Descriptions include the sponsoring organization, underlying goals and philosophies, lessons learned, and opportunities to excel.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Li 2 CO 3 on melting temperature, viscosity, fluidity, surface tension and Al 2 O 3 {{inclusion}} adsorption of mould flux for high speed continuous casting were studied. The {{results showed that}} {{with the increase of}} Li 2 CO 3 content, melting temperature, viscosity and viscous activation energy of mould flux decreased obviously, fluidity increased, surface tension changed little, and Al 2 O 3 inclusion adsorption of mould flux increased. In order to play an effective role, the Li 2 CO 3 content should be less than 4 per cent. The results will play a guiding role in designing of mould flux for high speed continuous casting. Because of widely application prospect, high speed continuous casting (CC) becomes an important part of technology revolution in iron and steel industry worldwide. The high speed continuous casting is very different from conventional CC[1 ~ 2]. High speed CC increases friction between mould wall and shell, increases specific lubricating surfaces, reduces amount of liquid steel in mould, shortens period of residence time that liquid steel stays in mould, induces fluctuation of liquid steel, and reduces consumption of mould powder sharply, thickness of mould flux film, shell thickness at outlet of mould, and accidents of breakout and surface defects such as longitudinal cracks[3 ~ 5]. Therefore, in order to improve <b>lubrication</b> and slab <b>quality,</b> mould flux with lo...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the use of the twin disc machine testing as an experimental method to simulate, identify and evaluate rolling contact fatigue in a short time for different combinations (ESR and standard) of cam ring steels with different case heat treatments (tempered at 180 ˚C and 240 ˚C). The ring samples were machined to achieve an elliptic contact in order to increase the contact pressure and achieve fast results. The contact pressure was calculated according to the Hertzian formula taking in account the shape parameters of the rings. The tests were performed with higher or lower amount of cycles depending on the previous results (cracks found or not) and for different contact pressures. The contact area was SEM inspected after each test. Friction and wear plots were used as fatigue criteria complementarily to the SEM analysis. The tests conditions (shape, roughness, friction coefficient) were studied and appeared to cause a scatter in the results because of their variation from one sample to another affecting the stress distribution, type of damage and the lubrication regime (film thickness). Therefore, the stress distribution was simulated under the elliptic contact surface taking in account, these parameters (shape parameters, roughness, friction coefficient). The tests showed that the twin disk testing method was useful for pitting detection in RCF under <b>lubrication.</b> Meanwhile, the <b>quality</b> of the samples was of extreme importance in order to keep constant conditions in different runs. The contact area SEM inspection after each test showed that high contact pressures induce adhesive damage in the samples that may accelerate RCF damage. The highest rolling contact fatigue limit was observed for the ESR steels. Validerat; 20110921 (anonymous...|$|R
