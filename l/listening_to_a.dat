Half the participants <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> script in which God was presented as female and half <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> script in which God was presented as male. Half of those in each group <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male narrator {{and the other half}} <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> female narrator. Before and after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the script, participants rated the attributes of God on a forced-choice questionnaire. Those to whom God was presented as female were more likely to emphasize God 2 ̆ 7 s mercy at posttest whereas those to whom God was presented as male were more likely to endorse God 2 ̆ 7 s power. Those hearing a male voice describe a female God and those hearing a female voice describe a male God reported enjoying the experiment and the audiotape more than those hearing a narrator describing a God of the same gender.

5|$|Spokane {{is known}} as the birthplace of the {{national}} movement started by Sonora Smart Dodd that led to the proposal and eventual establishment of Father's Day as a national holiday in the U.S. The first observation of Father's Day in Spokane was on June 19, 1910. Sonora conceived the idea in Spokane's Central Methodist Episcopal Church while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Mother's Day sermon.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of musical genres.|$|E

5|$|Frog Fractions {{begins with}} a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player {{controls}} the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including lock-on targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, they can buy a warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> narrated history {{of the creation of}} boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for president in a music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes. The game takes about one hour to complete.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and comes out on the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E

25|$|Some {{messages}} are {{presented to the}} listener backwards. While <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and {{a different set of}} words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.|$|E
