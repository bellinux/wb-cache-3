5|$|In late 1942, {{recruiting}} requirements {{were such}} that both enlisted and officer candidates {{had to be}} American citizens; have no children under 18 years of age; present three character references; pass a physical examination; and submit a record of occupation after leaving school. Enlisted applicants were also required to have completed at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> {{of high school and}} be between the ages of 20 and 36 years. Officer candidates were expected to be college graduates, or to have completed two years of college, and have at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of acceptable business or professional experience, and be between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Certain regulations with respect to marriage applied to both enlisted and officer candidates. Married women could enlist provided their husbands were not in the USCG. Unmarried women had to agree not to marry until they had finished their training period. After training, they could marry a civilian or service man who was not in the USCG.|$|E
5|$|A 1996, {{researchers}} {{showed that}} the black-throated blue warbler prefers to reside in hardwood forests with higher shrub densities where food is more abundant compared to lower shrub density plots.

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years. Offspring from a previous nesting season will usually remain with the family to assist in rearing new nestlings. American crows do not reach breeding age for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> Most do not leave the nest to breed for four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Because Koufax's {{signing bonus}} {{was greater than}} $4,000 ($ today), {{he was known as}} a bonus baby. This forced the Dodgers to keep him on the major league roster for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before he could be sent to the minors. To make room for him, the Dodgers optioned their future Hall of Fame manager, Tommy Lasorda, to the Montreal Royals of the International League. Lasorda would later joke that it took Koufax to keep him off the Dodger {{pitching}} staff.|$|E

5|$|Limited {{demobilisation}} began {{during the}} final years of the war. In order {{to meet the needs of}} the war economy 20,000 soldiers were released from the Australian Army in October 1943. Further reductions took place in August 1944 when another 30,000 soldiers and 15,000 personnel from the Royal Australian Air Force were discharged. In mid-1945 the Government implemented a policy in which service men and women who had completed five years of service, including at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> outside Australia, could volunteer for discharge.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} typhoid fever. Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was typhoid fever, but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|The song must {{be written}} and sung in the {{national}} language (or one of the national languages) of the country being represented. However, they can also have a few lines in a different language. The same rule was in the adults' contest from 1966 to 1972 and again from 1977 to 1998.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|Both second-round {{candidates}} and the incumbent president were initially {{arrested by the}} junta. Members of the Military Council, which ran the country until an interim National Transitional Council was established on 15 April, {{said that one of}} the reasons for the coup was the incumbent civilian administration's call for Angolan help to reform the military. Following international condemnation and sanctions against leaders of the junta, an agreement was signed that led to the third place candidate in the election, Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, being selected as interim president. The presidential election was aborted and postponed for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> into the future. An interim government is tasked with administering Guinea-Bissau in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Zoe {{severely}} impacted {{the islands}} of the Solomon island chain, particularly {{the islands of}} Tikopia and Anuta. In Anuta, agricultural activities were disrupted. Various fruit trees and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. In addition, communications with other islands were disrupted. The impact on Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Zoe's impact. Topsoil was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any immediate replacement of lost crops.|$|E

5|$|Maine {{continued}} to be difficult, with a rebellion by Hubert de Beaumont-au-Maine, probably in 1084. Hubert was besieged in his castle at Sainte-Suzanne by William's forces for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour. William's movements during 1084 and 1085 are unclear– he was in Normandy at Easter 1084 but {{may have been in}} England before then to collect the danegeld assessed that year for the defence of England against an invasion by King Cnut IV of Denmark. Although English and Norman forces remained on alert throughout 1085 and into 1086, the invasion threat was ended by Cnut's death in July 1086.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they are at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> old and join a male or female group.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him. A local chief, Chintanda, {{complained to the}} Company in 1899 that Clark had secured his concessions while passing himself off as a Company official and had been collecting hut tax for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> under this pretence. The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and {{a partner in the}} first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill {{for the rest of his}} life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
