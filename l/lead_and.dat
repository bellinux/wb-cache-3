5|$|Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738, Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Torbern Olof Bergman, the {{distinctness}} of <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> bismuth became clear, and Claude François Geoffroy {{demonstrated in}} 1753 that this metal {{is distinct from}} <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> tin.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|In the {{regional}} finals on March 31 against Florida, Michigan built a 13–0 <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> never led {{by less than}} 10 {{the rest of the}} game. Several players had career-highs in the game: Stauskas with 6 three-point shots, Burke 8 rebounds, McGary 5 steals and off the bench Albrecht 7 points and 3 steals. Eight of McGary's 11 points came as Michigan built the initial 13–0 <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> 5 of Stauskas' 6 three-pointers came as Michigan built a 41–17 <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> closed the half with a 47–30 lead. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. McGary and Stauskas joined Burke on the five-man South All-Regional team. Following {{the regional}} championship postgame prayer and with Mrs. Beilein's consent, McGary and Hardaway gave Beilein a Gatorade shower.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the mineral {{contents}} of various edible mushrooms found that C.micaceus contained the highest concentration of potassium in the 34species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom. Because the species can bioaccumulate detrimental heavy metals like <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> cadmium, it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.|$|E

5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined {{that it did not}} contain <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> thus was not galena.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth metal {{has been}} known since ancient times, {{although}} it was often confused with <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic bi ismid, meaning having the properties of antimony or the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to New Latin bisemutum.|$|E
50|$|If the arm {{electrodes}} are reversed, lead I changes polarity, causing <b>lead</b> II <b>and</b> <b>lead</b> III to switch. If {{the right}} arm electrode is reversed with the leg's electrode, lead II changes polarity, causing lead I to become <b>lead</b> III, <b>and</b> vice versa. Reversal {{of the left}} arm and leg causes a change in polarity of <b>lead</b> III <b>and</b> switching of <b>leads</b> I <b>and</b> II.|$|R

5|$|Book XVI covers {{metals and}} rocks, {{starting}} with dust and earth, {{and moving on}} to gemstones of different colours, glass and mines. Metals include gold, silver, copper, iron, <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> electrum. Weights and measures end the book. Games with boards and dice are described.|$|E
5|$|Book XXXIV {{covers the}} base metals, their uses and their extraction. Copper mining is mentioned, {{using a variety}} of ores {{including}} copper pyrites and marcasite, some of the mining being underground, some on the surface. Iron mining is covered, followed by <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> tin.|$|E
5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, {{the economy}} was stable and strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative <b>lead,</b> <b>and</b> local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away. The election saw Thatcher re-elected for a third successive term.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 5143. The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen, after leading by five at halftime, to advance to the {{regional}} finals. Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final. In the game, the Hoyas shot very well from the field, setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game, 77.4%, en route to the 69–45 victory. In the national semifinal against Louisville, both teams shot very poorly. The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half, but after three minutes into the second half, Georgetown gained the <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> never relinquished it. The Hoyas used defense to maintain their <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> set the pace of the game, which they won 5046.|$|E
5|$|In {{the solid}} state, flerovium is {{expected}} to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density variously predicted to be either 22g·cm−3 or 14g·cm−3. The electron of the hydrogen-like flerovium ion (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Fl113+) {{is expected to}} move so fast that it has a mass 1.79 times that of a stationary electron, due to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> tin are expected to be 1.25 and 1.073 respectively. Flerovium would form weaker metal–metal bonds than <b>lead</b> <b>and</b> would be adsorbed less on surfaces.|$|E
