5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station).

5|$|The Light Tank Mk VII (A17), {{also known}} as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank {{produced}} by Vickers-Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the Second World War. The Tetrarch was originally designed as the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIB Light Tank, by introducing the extra firepower of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors, and as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.|$|E

40|$|In {{herpes simplex}} virus 1 -infected cells, {{a high level of}} α gene {{expression}} requires the transactivation of the genes by a complex containing the viral α transinducing factor (αTIF) and two cellular proteins. The latter two, HCF- 1 and octamer binding protein Oct- 1, are transcriptional factors regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. αTIF is a protein made <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection but packaged with the virion to transactivate viral genes in newly infected cells. In light of the accumulation of large amounts of αTIF, the absence of α gene expression <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection suggested the possibility that one or more transcriptional factors required for α gene expression is modified <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection. Here we report that Oct- 1 is posttranscriptionally modified <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection, that the modification is mediated by the virus but does not involve viral protein kinases or cdc 2 kinase activated by the virus <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection, and that the modified Oct- 1 has a reduced affinity for its cognate DNA site. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that modification of Oct- 1 transcriptional factor could account at least in part for the shutoff of α gene expression <b>late</b> <b>in</b> infection...|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> {{a series of}} efforts by Nintendo {{to break into the}} North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's {{president}} at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing {{from a wide range of}} inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The season premiered at the Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017, {{ahead of}} its FX debut on February 8. It ran for eight episodes, until March 29.

Several critics did note that the latter aspects would not be for all viewers, and some criticized this as just the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> a trend of series with unreliable narratives.

Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992–93 in which more than 1,000people were killed. On 12 March 1993, a series of 13 co-ordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Bombay underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries. In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains. In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels. The blasts that occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar on 13 July 2011 were the <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai.|$|E

While searching the home of an earlier victim, the agents realize that both she and Newirth had recently traveled by train. Meanwhile, Banton sits in a train station, cautiously looking at the floor; because the room is lit by soft light, his shadow cannot be seen. After he leaves, Banton is confronted by two police officers patrolling the area. Despite Banton's warnings, the officers step into his shadow and disappear, leaving more burn marks.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story.

Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place Vagrant Story <b>latest</b> <b>in</b> the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story to be in the same world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E
