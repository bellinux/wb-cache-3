40|$|Cochlear implant {{listeners}} receive auditory stimulation through amplitude-modulated electric pulse trains. Auditory nerve {{studies in}} animals demonstrate qualitatively different patterns of firing elicited by low versus high pulse rates, suggesting that stimulus pulse rate might influence {{the transmission of}} temporal information through the auditory pathway. We tested in awake guinea pigs the temporal acuity of auditory cortical neurons for gaps in cochlear implant pulse trains. Consistent with results using anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity improved with increasing pulse rates. Unlike the anesthetized condition, however, cortical neurons responded in the awake state to multiple distinct features of the gap-containing pulse trains, with the dominant features varying with stimulus pulse rate. Responses to {{the onset of the}} trailing pulse train (Trail-ON) provided the most sensitive gap detection at 1, 017 and 4, 069  pulse-per-second (pps) rates, particularly for short (25  ms) <b>leading</b> <b>pulse</b> trains. In contrast, under conditions of 254  pps rate and long (200  ms) <b>leading</b> <b>pulse</b> trains, a sizeable fraction of units demonstrated greater temporal acuity in the form of robust responses to the offsets of the <b>leading</b> <b>pulse</b> train (Lead-OFF). Finally, TONIC responses exhibited decrements in firing rate during gaps, but were rarely the most sensitive feature. Unlike results from anesthetized conditions, temporal acuity of the most sensitive units was nearly as sharp for brief as for long leading bursts. The differences in stimulus coding across pulse rates likely originate from pulse rate-dependent variations in adaptation in the auditory nerve. Two marked differences from responses to acoustic stimulation were: first, Trail-ON responses to 4, 069  pps trains encoded substantially shorter gaps than have been observed with acoustic stimuli; and second, the Lead-OFF gap coding seen for < 15  ms gaps in 254  pps stimuli is not seen in responses to sounds. The current results may help to explain why moderate pulse rates around 1, 000  pps are favored by many cochlear implant listeners...|$|E

A series of identical chirped pulses, separated by a variable delay, is applied to an ultracold sample of 85 Rb, {{and the rate of}} inelastic trap-loss collisions is measured. For small detunings of the chirped light below the atomic resonance, we observe that the rate of collisions induced by a given pulse can be increased by the presence of an earlier pulse. We attribute this to the enhancement of short-range collisional flux by the long-range excitation of atom pairs to an attractive molecular potential. For larger detunings and short delays, we find that a <b>leading</b> <b>pulse</b> can suppress the rate of collisions caused by a following pulse. This is due to a depletion of short-range atom pairs by the earlier pulse. Comparison of our data to classical Monte-Carlo simulations of the collisions yields reasonable agreement.

Based on scaling of laser wakefield acceleration in the quasi-linear regime with the normalized vector potential a(0) = 1. 4 (1. 6), acceleration to 100 (130) GeV requires a 30 -m-long plasma waveguide operated at the plasma density n(e) approximate to 7 x 10 (15) cm(- 3) with a channel depth Delta n/n(e) = 20 %, while a nonlinear laser wakefield accelerator in the bubble regime with a(0) >= 2 can reach 100 GeV approximately in a 36 /a(0) -m-long plasma through self-guiding.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. We hypothesised that the loss of the peripheral processes and the partial demyelination of auditory nerve fibres (ANFs) following a sensorineural hearing loss would increase their refractory properties. Normal control, and long-term (2. 5 months) systemically deafened rats were anaesthetised (urethane, 1. 3 g/kg i. p.), a bipolar stimulating electrode was implanted into the scala tympani and glass microelectrodes (30 - 80 MΩ) used to record single ANF activity. Stimuli (pairs of 100 µs/phase charge balanced biphasic pulses with interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 0. 34 - 10 ms) were presented at 6 dB above threshold using a repetition interval of 250 ms. Absolute refractory period (ARP) was defined as the IPI at which the probability of eliciting a spike to the second stimulus was 0. 1. In the present results, based on recordings from 62 fibres, ANFs were distinguished from cochlear nucleus (CN) neurones by their significantly shorter median latencies (AN: 0. 575 ms vs CN: 1. 137 ms; Whitney-Mann Rank Sum, p< 0. 0001). There {{were no significant differences between}} minimum ANF latencies from normal and deafened animals.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Despite {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} rain-on-snow storms and their resulting peak flows, little is understood about the response of snowmelt to precipitation and the relative timing of the two at multiple temporal scales within such events. To address this issue, climate, snowmelt, and streamflow data were analyzed for 26 large storms in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascades of Oregon. Cumulative net snowmelt was plotted against precipitation for each storm to identify net snowmelt response categories, which were then used to summarize climatic and streamflow data, while the timing of precipitation and net snowmelt was assessed at multiple temporal scales and time ranges with wavelet coherence. Five precipitation-net snowmelt response categories were identified: flat; persistent melt; persistent accumulation; late melt; and late accumulation. Persistent melt events, which were characterized by concomitantly increasing cumulative net snowmelt and precipitation, had the highest mean peak flow and water available for runoff values of the response categories. Large, contiguous regions of significant wavelet coherence at multiple temporal scales were observed in both the persistent melt and persistent accumulation categories, but the phase difference distributions indicated differing snowpack dynamics with <b>pulses</b> of precipitation <b>leading</b> <b>pulses</b> of snowmelt in the former and precipitation being absorbed by the snowpack in the latter. High water available for runoff totals and peak flows were observed in each of the five response categories, but a dewpoint temperature consistently above 0. 5 °C, elevated wind speeds, and a high fraction of precipitation falling as rain in the persistent melt category facilitated rapid snowmelt rates which were often synchronized with precipitation. Wavelet coherence showed this synchronization to be significant across all temporal scales and time periods for the two largest peak flows in the study, indicating that tightly coupled rainfall-synchrony is essential in generating an extreme rain-on-snow flood.
