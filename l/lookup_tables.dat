Writing out all the centimetre figures of all the primary and secondary measures from EN 13402-2 can – in some cases – require up to 12 digits.

Since interpolation introduces an estimation uncertainty that increases with the sparseness of the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> there is a trade-off between <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> size and estimation precision. This work will present a theory for finding the minimum allowed size of a <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> that does not affect the overall precision, i. e. the overall precision is determined by the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> entries’ precision, not by the interpolation error...|$|R

Maxwell and Boltzmann had produced theories describing the inter-relational of temperature, pressure and volume of a gas on a microscopic scale but otherwise, in 1900, there was no understanding of the microscopic or quantum nature of temperature. [...] Within the metric system, temperature was expressed in degrees Centigrade with the definition that ice melted at 0°C and at standard atmospheric pressure, water boiled at 100°C.

The reduced <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> consists of syndrome patterns and corresponding error patterns which {{only have one}} and two errors occurred in the message block of the received codeword.

When the Hall voltage is measured for linear displacement, it is converted to angular displacement using arctangent function, which requires a large <b>lookup</b> <b>table.</b> In this paper, a <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> reduction technique is presented for angle measurement. When the input of the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> is small within a certain threshold, the change of the outputs {{with respect to the}} change of the inputs is relatively small. Thus, several inputs can share same output, which significantly reduce the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> size. Its error analysis was also performed, and the threshold was determined so as to maintain the error less than 1 °.

2500|$|Such {{compression}} is {{also used}} {{in the implementation of}} the various fast <b>lookup</b> <b>tables</b> for retrieving Unicode character properties. These could include case-mapping tables (e.g. for the Greek letter pi, from ∏ to π), or <b>lookup</b> <b>tables</b> normalizing the combination of base and combining characters (like the a-umlaut in German, ä, or the dalet-patah-dagesh-ole in Biblical Hebrew, [...] ). For such applications, the representation is similar to transforming a very large, unidimensional, sparse table (e.g. Unicode code points) into a multidimensional matrix of their combinations, and then using the coordinates in the hyper-matrix as the string key of an uncompressed trie to represent the resulting character. The compression will then consist of detecting and merging the common columns within the hyper-matrix to compress the last dimension in the key. For example, to avoid storing the full, multibyte Unicode code point of each element forming a matrix column, the groupings of similar code points can be exploited. Each dimension of the hyper-matrix stores the start position of the next dimension, so that only the offset (typically a single byte) need be stored. The resulting vector is itself compressible when it is also sparse, so each dimension (associated to a layer level in the trie) can be compressed separately.|$|E

40|$|Abstract tector and the <b>lookup</b> <b>table.</b> The VLC {{detector}} {{receives the}} input variable length codes and generates an address for the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> (LUT). To reduce additional circuit overhead, address generation is implemented by aligning the VLCs {{at a fixed}} position so that the <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> uses the VLC itself as the address. The <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> receives the address from the VLC detector and produces the corre-sponding output codeword and length. Both components of the variable length decoder must be optimized to achieve low power operation. A data driven variable length decoder chip is presented which exploits the signal statistics of variable length codes to reduce power. The approach uses fine grain <b>lookup</b> <b>table</b> partitioning to reduce switched capacitance based on code-word frequency. The variable length decoder for MPEG- 2 has been fabricated and consumes 530 pW at 1. 35 V for a video rate of 48 M DCT samples/sec using a 0. 6 pm CMOS technology.
