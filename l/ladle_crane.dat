40|$|Abstract — Steel {{industry}} uses <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> {{as a vital}} {{material handling}} equipment. Design and procurement of the <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> {{is not up to}} the mark. Type of load, height to hoist, angle of tilt, space etc ascertains the crane specification. Mathematical analysis, taking all these factors has become an important research area. Earlier researches on <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> dynamics are not with so details analysis and providing so many feasibilities. Simulation of <b>Ladle</b> <b>Crane</b> dynamics on ladle hoisting and ladle tilting has been discussed. A methodology to build a dynamic of <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> is exhibited. The methodology provided, may be used as an assistant tool is proposed so that it will help industrial designer to build or modify a <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> model of most technologically innovative and as per requirement and demand. Efficient and effective crane operation is the basic target of this study. A simulation study is made with different parameters to show how these influence the system’s performance. A comparative study of efficient drive systems performed and from these a mathematical model is build to analyze, simulate...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} a steel {{construction}} of crab frame of <b>ladle</b> <b>crane</b> with lifting capacity of 120 and 40 tons and maximum lifting height of 21 meters. The aim {{of the work is}} analysis and assessment of the support frame of crane with a load of fatigue according to ČSN 27 0103 / 89. For this analysis is used thin shell and beam model. The diploma thesis was developed in cooperation with the Královopolska a. s. company...|$|E

This would be poured into the furnaces from <b>ladles</b> carried by <b>cranes.</b> However, the converter slag is high in magnetite and some of this magnetite would precipitate from the converter slag (due to its higher melting point), forming an accretion on the hearth of the reverberatory furnace and necessitating shut downs of the furnace to remove the accretion. This accretion formation limits the quantity of converter slag that can be treated in a reverberatory furnace.|$|R

Hand-held ladles are typically known as handshank ladles and are fitted with a long handle to keep {{the heat of the}} metal away from the person holding it. Their capacity is limited to what a man can safely handle. Larger ladles are usually referred to as geared <b>crane</b> <b>ladles.</b> Their capacity is usually determined by the ladle function. Small hand-held ladles might also be crucibles that are fitted with carrying devices. However, in most foundries, the foundry ladle refers to a steel vessel that has a lifting bail fitted so that the vessel can be carried by an overhead crane or monorail system and is also fitted with a mechanical means for rotating the vessel, usually {{in the form of a}} gearbox. The gearbox can either be manually operated or powered operation. (See the paragraph below for further details).|$|R
