2500|$|In Vancouver and Victoria (as well as {{some other}} cities), {{opportunities}} for joggers and bicyclists have been developed. Cross-country bike touring has been popular since the ten-speed bike became available many years ago. Since {{the advent of the}} more robust mountain bike, trails in more rugged and wild places have been developed for them. A 2016 poll on global biking website [...] rated BC as the top destination mountain bikers would like to ride. Some of the province's retired rail beds have been converted and maintained for hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. <b>Longboarding</b> is also a popular activity because of the hilly geography of the region.|$|E

50|$|<b>Longboarding</b> is {{associated}} with a different pattern of injuries than is skateboarding. Many <b>longboarding</b> injuries are sustained while going downhill, while very few skateboarding accidents happen while going downhill. <b>Longboarding</b> injuries tend to involve head and neck areas more than skateboarding injuries, which are more likely to involve a skater's lower extremities. Helmets, padding, and possibly friendly or parental supervision are highly recommended or enforced by law.|$|E
5000|$|Road rash is a colloquial {{term for}} skin injury caused by {{abrasion}} with road surfaces, usually {{as a consequence}} of <b>longboarding,</b> cycling and motorcycling accidents. The term may be applied to both a fresh injury and the scar tissue left by an old one. The term is sometimes applied to <b>longboarding,</b> skateboarding, and roller skating abrasion accidents, especially those caused at high speeds (as in <b>longboarding).</b> Symptoms may include pain and heavy bleeding.|$|E
50|$|The modern <b>longboard</b> has {{undergone}} many changes since its earlier {{models in the}} past. Today's <b>longboard</b> is much lighter than its predecessors. Its polyurethane foam and fiberglass design allows less drag on waves. Today's <b>longboards</b> are typically 8 to 10 ft long, although some ride boards up to 12 ft in length. Additionally, there is a revival of stand-up paddle-based surfing with boards up to 14 ft in length (for stability). The classic single-fin <b>longboard</b> retains much of its classic design including a single fin, weight, and considerable buoyancy. A <b>longboard</b> with a single fin allows the board to pivot turn {{in order to remain}} in the curl of the wave. Due to recent advances in technology, the <b>longboard</b> has expanded its family into different variations of the classic <b>longboard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 2+1 <b>longboard</b> is {{the most}} {{versatile}} board of the <b>longboard</b> family, offering greater maneuverability. Sometimes referred as a [...] "single-fin with training wheels", the 2+1's fins actually takes {{the features of the}} classic <b>longboard</b> and the Tri-fin. The fins of the 2+1 takes the rigid stability of a classic <b>longboard,</b> and fuses with the strength and drive of a Tri-fin.|$|R
50|$|<b>Longboards</b> are skateboards {{in terms}} of parts and general construction. However, the parts {{generally}} have different dimensions and the wheels may be much softer, which makes <b>longboards</b> feel {{quite different from the}} ubiquitous skateboard. <b>Longboards</b> for sliding, however, have relatively hard wheels.|$|R

50|$|The mini tanker is {{basically}} a shortened <b>longboard</b> shape that utilizes the same <b>longboard</b> design elements and enhanced maneuverability due to the shorter shape.

[...] These pioneers saw <b>longboarding</b> as a form of self-expression, and were influenced by surfing. However, despite the advent of polyurethane wheels (referred to as [...] "thane" [...] by longboarders), <b>longboarding</b> did not reach a high degree of prevalence during the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Longboard</b> {{specific}} {{trucks are}} {{a more recent}} development.

Many <b>longboard</b> specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.|$|R

5000|$|Also, one {{may prefer}} a shorter board, around 24"-35" [...] for commuting, {{as well as}} {{medium-sized}} wheels (65mm-75mm) which help commuters maneuver bumps, cracks and other minor surface obstacles. For longer distances, a heavier (or longer) board and larger wheels will maintain the momentum from a push longer, making them ideal in that sense. One problem with this way of travel is that in some places it can be illegal. There have been cases when a longboarder has received a ticket for <b>longboarding</b> in certain areas, because some consider <b>longboarding</b> skateboarding.|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== The life of <b>longboarding</b> {{started in}} {{approximately}} the 1965s. The idea of <b>longboarding</b> originated from surfers in Hawaii {{that wanted to}} take their surfing hobby to land when the waves were too small to surf. Surfers then {{figured out a way}} of achieving their goal of bringing surfing to land by customizing their skateboards. They would grab a piece of thick plywood and shape it into a smaller version of a surfboard, then screw the trucks and wheels to the decks and head out to small hills to imitate the same moves they would do if they were out surfing.|$|E

5000|$|It was {{not until}} the late 1950s and early 1960s when the {{surfboard}} design had closely evolved into today's modern <b>longboard.</b> The introduction of polyurethane foam and fiberglass became the technological leap in design. In the 1960s, the <b>longboard</b> continued to remain popular as its material changed from balsa wood to fiberglass and polyurethane foam. In the 1960s, the introduction of the shortboard, averaging 6 ft, allowed surfers to make tighter turns, quicker maneuvers, and achieve faster speeds, thus radically changing the way people surfed. This [...] "shortboard revolution" [...] nearly made <b>longboards</b> obsolete for all practical purposes. But in the early 1990s, the <b>longboard</b> returned, integrating a number of the design features invented during the shortboard revolution. Surfers rediscovered the grace and poise - the [...] "glide" [...] - of the <b>longboard,</b> and the fun of classic maneuvers that are not possible on a shortboard. In some circles the battle between <b>longboards</b> and shortboards continues. But many surfers live by a philosophy of finding the joy of surfing a mix of boards and surfing styles to suit the waves of the day.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>longboard</b> is {{primarily}} a single-finned surfboard with large rounded nose and length of 9 to 12 ft. Noseriders are a class of <b>longboards</b> which enable the rider {{to walk to the}} tip and nose ride. These are also called [...] "Mals", a shortened form of [...] "Malibu boards". They range from 9 to 14 ft long, or 3 ft taller than the rider in overall length. The advantage of a <b>longboard</b> is its substantial buoyancy and planing surface enable surfers to ride waves generally deemed too small to propel a shortboard. <b>Longboards</b> are more suitable for beginners because of the board's size and ease of catching waves. In the proper conditions, a skilled surfer can ride a wave standing on the nose of a <b>longboard</b> with their toes over the nose's edge: in this way, with the [...] "toes on the nose", the surfer can [...] "hang ten". Compared to the shortboards, <b>longboards</b> are considerably easier to learn on as they are capable of achieving stability, thus making the transition quite difficult.|$|R
