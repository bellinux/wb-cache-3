40|$|The view of {{a butcher}} 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shop</b> {{provides}} picturesque theorist Uvedale Price with a crucial example in his consideration {{of the role of}} disgust in aesthetics. This paper analyses Price 2 ̆ 7 s theory in light of Derrida 2 ̆ 7 s essay on disgust in Kant 2 ̆ 7 s aesthetic. Price 2 ̆ 7 s ideas are explosively reversible and provide a definite historical instance of the collapse of 2 ̆ 7 economimesis 2 ̆ 7 onto the socio-political economy which Derrida claims is implicit in Kant. The theme of an aesthetic disgust can be found more generally in aesthetics and in critiques of the aesthetic attitude and this is one reason for the historical success of the picturesque. Price 2 ̆ 7 s theory is intended to be applicable to landscape architecture and rural buildings, and it is argued that the butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shop</b> in Price is a deferral of the larger question of the relation of architecture to the informe (un-formedness) of vernacular buildings. Cottage hovels and villages are in Price 2 ̆ 7 s time so much viscera. Doubly disgusting they are the waste cut from the countryside in the production of idealized landscapes, while their stench of poverty and treason arises from the shortage of food. Certain 19 th century architects, reading Price over-literally, indulge the unlikely fantasy of a landlord constructing ornamental butcher 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shops</b> for the labourers who could not afford bread. Today the picturesque in architecture disgusts somewhat. It is identified with the sensual pleasing of escape into images, with a lack of the smell and squeals of real urban and contemporary materials. Yet this is an anachronism, a distortion by Nikolaus Pevsner and Gordon Cullen of the historical picturesque which always had a taste for piquancy. If we wish to understand the fascination of modern architects with banality, ugliness, and brutality, and if we thought it useful to distinguish this from Renaissance grotesques and neo-Classical sublimity, then the picturesque will supply us with a cleaver and a knife...|$|R

40|$|Mobile {{devices are}} now {{powerful}} systems {{and are the}} main vehicles for m- commerce. Market research predicts enormous potential for m-commerce applications and services [9], [10], [11], [12]. Unique features such as portability, location-awareness and personalization make mobile devices effective tools for targeted advertising. Several mobile marketing frameworks have been designed that deliver promotions based on location information and user preferences [3], [4], [5]. These frameworks have several drawbacks {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be effective. The aim of this thesis is to research a simple and efficient framework for targeted and personalized advertising. This work presents SMMART, a context-aware, adaptive and personalized m- commerce application designed to deliver targeted promotions to the users of mobile devices. SMMART delivers personalized promotional information based on context and the preferences of the user by matching the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shopping</b> interests to current promotions available at a retail store. SMMART analyzes the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shopping</b> habits and dynamically adapts to the changing interests of its user. SMMART does not reveal any private information about the user to the stores and does not require additional devices such as a GPS Receiver or a Bluetooth Sensor in order to work effectively. SMMART uses XML web services for client/server communication over a Wi-Fi wireless network. This work includes a brief study of several mobile marketing frameworks and a description of the SMMART framework architecture. We then describe a fully functional prototype of SMMART built for Pocket PCs running Windows CE with. NET Compact in Framework that uses XML Web Services for communication with a SMMART Server. We also present a simulation model to justify the economic feasibility of SMMART [1]. The purpose of this thesis is to research and develop a novel and efficient approach to mobile marketing and to illustrate our work through a fully functional prototype and a justification of the economic feasibility of the framework. This thesis also provides possible directions for future research...|$|R

Superimposed on the satire on society is a whole-hearted humor prompted by the ignorance and credulity of the central figure, Jourdain, a tradesman who wishes to become a gentleman.
