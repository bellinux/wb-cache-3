25|$|While filming <b>Quiet</b> <b>Days</b> in Hollywood, Swank met actor Chad Lowe. They {{married on}} September 28, 1997. They {{announced}} {{their intention to}} divorce on January 9, 2006, which was finalized on November 1, 2007.

25|$|The {{publication}} of Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the United States in 1961 by Grove Press {{led to a}} series of obscenity trials that tested American laws on pornography. The U.S. Supreme Court, in Grove Press, Inc., v. Gerstein, citing Jacobellis v. Ohio (which was decided the same day in 1964), overruled the state court findings of obscenity and declared the book a work of literature; {{it was one of the}} notable events in what has come to be known as the sexual revolution. Elmer Gertz, the lawyer who successfully argued the initial case for the novel's publication in Illinois, became a lifelong friend of Miller's; a volume of their correspondence has been published. Following the trial, in 1964–65, other books of Miller's which had also been banned in the US were published by Grove Press: Black Spring, Tropic of Capricorn, <b>Quiet</b> <b>Days</b> in Clichy, Sexus, Plexus and Nexus. Excerpts from some of these banned books, including Tropic of Cancer, Black Spring and Sexus, were first published in the US by New Directions in The Henry Miller Reader in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that year}} she {{began work on}} Léos Carax's Les Amants du Pont-Neuf. The film was beset by {{problems}} and took three years to complete, requiring investment from three producers and funds from the French government. When finally released in 1991, Les Amants du Pont-Neuf was a critical success. Binoche won a European Film Award as well as securing her third César nomination for her performance. In the film Binoche portrays an artist who lives rough on the famous Parisian bridge where she meets another young vagrant (Denis Lavant). This iconic {{part of the city}} becomes the backdrop for a wildly passionate love story and some of the most visually arresting images of the city ever created. The paintings featured in the film were Binoche's own work. She also designed the French poster for the film which features an ink drawing of the eponymous lovers locked in embrace. During a break in filming in 1990, Binoche spent five days shooting Mara for Mike Figgis, based on Henry Miller's <b>Quiet</b> <b>Days</b> in Clichy. This 30 minute film was part of HBO's anthology series Women & Men 2. The film became somewhat contentious when, according to Mike Figgis, HBO altered it once he had completed it. The film premiered on HBO in the U.S. on 18 August 1991.|$|E

[...] The original Gnome was also discovered, though the restored aircraft used a slightly newer (1916) Gnome.

2500|$|A vast {{increase}} in British war production had been achieved in 1916 but {{the flow of}} equipment and ammunition caused transport problems in France, particularly on the Chemins de Fer du Nord (Nord) railways, which had become overloaded by the {{increase in}} the size of the BEF, the large number ammunition trains from the Channel ports to the Somme front and the need to move unprecedented numbers of casualties after 1 July. Congestion of the railways began to affect operations in July and rainy periods made delivery of ammunition from railheads to gun-positions much harder, when [...] were being delivered even on <b>quiet</b> <b>days.</b> Shortages of heavy howitzer ammunition in mid-July were made worse in areas under German observation and harassing-fire, as more German artillery arrived on the Somme front.|$|E

2500|$|The strain was {{reflected}} in a 4th Army order of General Sixt von Armin on 11 October, acknowledging that although fresh ground holding divisions had defeated attacks, some British troops had advanced a considerable distance, {{with the result that}} ground was lost, despite the intervention of Eingreifdivisionen. Armin noted that more German troops were trickling to the rear, even on <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> and ordered that [...] "the sternest measures" [...] should be taken against them and be made public. Despite the difficulties and the cost, the German defenders had obtained a considerable defensive success but with the attack on 12 October (the First Battle of Passchendaele), the Battle of Poelcappelle caused a [...] "crisis in command". German losses had risen [...] which jeopardised the front and [...] "mentally shocked" [...] the survivors.

2500|$|Swank {{made her}} film {{debut in the}} 1992 comedy horror Buffy the Vampire Slayer, playing a small role, after which she acted in the direct-to-video drama <b>Quiet</b> <b>Days</b> in Hollywood, where she co-starred with Chad Lowe, who would become her husband for a time. Her first leading film role was in the fourth {{installment}} of the Karate Kid series, The Next Karate Kid (1994), which utilized her gymnastics background and paired her with Pat Morita. In 1995, she appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in Kounterfeit. In 1994, she also starred in the drama [...] as the abused step-daughter who was protected by Donna (Jaclyn Smith). In September 1997, Swank played single mother Carly Reynolds in Beverly Hills, 90210 and was initially promised {{it would be a}} two-year role, but saw her character written out after 16 episodes in January 1998.
