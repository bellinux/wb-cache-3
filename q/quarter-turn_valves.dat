5000|$|A {{butterfly}} valve {{is from a}} family of valves called <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves.</b> In operation, the valve is fully open or closed when the disc is rotated a quarter turn. The [...] "butterfly" [...] is a metal disc mounted on a rod. When the valve is closed, the disc is turned so that it completely blocks off the passageway. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows an almost unrestricted passage of the fluid. The valve may also be opened incrementally to throttle flow.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic {{actuators}} convert {{fluid pressure}} into motion. Similar to pneumatic actuators, {{they are used}} on linear or <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves.</b> Fluid pressure acting on a piston provides linear thrust for gate or globe valves. A quarter-turn actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. Most types of hydraulic actuators can be supplied with fail-safe features to close or open a valve under emergency circumstances. Hydraulic pressure can be supplied by a self-contained hydraulic pressure pump. In some applications, such as water pumping stations, the process fluid can provide hydraulic pressure, although the actuators must use materials compatible with the fluid.|$|E
25|$|A {{main supply}} valve with {{non-return}} valve, which supplies gas {{to the main}} gas supply hose of the umbilical. This is usually a <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valve,</b> as it must be quick to operate and obvious whether it is open or closed.|$|R
50|$|A {{ball valve}} {{is a form}} of <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valve</b> which uses a hollow, {{perforated}} and pivoting ball to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90-degrees by the valve handle. The handle lies flat in alignment with the flow when open, and is perpendicular to it when closed, making for easy visual confirmation of the valve's status.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common general type of plug valve is a 2-port valve with two positions: open to allow flow, and shut (closed) to stop flow. Ports are {{openings in the}} valve body through which fluid can enter or leave. The plug {{in this kind of}} valve has one passageway going through it. The ports are typically at opposite ends of the body; therefore, the plug is rotated a fourth of a full turn to change from open to shut positions. This makes this kind of plug <b>valve</b> a <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valve.</b> There is often a mechanism limiting motion of the handle to a quarter turn, but not in glass stopcocks.|$|R
5000|$|Air (or other gas) {{pressure}} {{is the power}} source for pneumatic valve actuators. They are used on linear or <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves.</b> Air pressure acts on a piston or bellows diaphragm creating linear force on a valve stem. Alternatively, a quarter-turn vane-type actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. A pneumatic actuator may be arranged to be spring-closed or spring-opened, with air pressure overcoming the spring to provide movement. A [...] "double acting" [...] actuator use air applied to different inlets to move the valve in the opening or closing direction. A central compressed air system can provide the clean, dry, compressed air needed for pneumatic actuators. In some types, for example, regulators for compressed gas, the supply {{pressure is}} provided from the process gas stream and waste gas either vented to air or dumped into lower-pressure process piping.|$|E
50|$|Many valves are {{controlled}} manually with a handle {{attached to the}} stem. If the handle is turned ninety degrees between operating positions, the valve is called a quarter-turn valve. Butterfly, ball valves, and plug valves are often <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves.</b> If the handle is circular with the stem as the axis of rotation {{in the center of}} the circle, then the handle is called a handwheel. Valves can also be controlled by actuators attached to the stem. They can be electromechanical actuators such as an electric motor or solenoid, pneumatic actuators which {{are controlled}} by air pressure, or hydraulic actuators which are controlled by the pressure of a liquid such as oil or water. Actuators can be used for the purposes of automatic control such as in washing machine cycles, remote control such as the use of a centralised control room, or because manual control is too difficult such as when the valve is very large. Pneumatic actuators and hydraulic actuators need pressurised air or liquid lines to supply the actuator: an inlet line and an outlet line. Pilot valves are valves which are used to control other valves. Pilot valves in the actuator lines control the supply of air or liquid going to the actuators.|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an update on}} the valve research being sponsored by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and conducted at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The research addresses the need to provide assurance that motor-operated valves can perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. This report describes several important developments: Two methods for estimating or bounding the design basis stem factor (in rising-stem valves), using data from tests less severe than design basis tests; a new correlation for evaluating the opening responses of gate valves and for predicting opening requirements; an extrapolation method that uses the results of a best effort flow test to estimate the design basis closing requirements of a gate valve that exhibits atypical responses (peak force occurs before flow isolation); and the extension of the original INEL closing correlation to include low- flow and low-pressure loads. The report also includes a general approach, presented in step-by-step format, for determining operating margins for rising-stem valves (gate valves and globe valves) as well as <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves</b> (ball valves and butterfly valves) ...|$|E
40|$|A non-collinear valve {{actuator}} includes a primary actuating {{system and a}} return spring system with each applying forces to a linkage system in order to regulate the flow of a <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valve.</b> The primary actuating system and return spring system are positioned non-collinearly, which simply means the primary actuating system and return spring system are not in line with each other. By positioning the primary actuating system and return spring system in this manner, the primary actuating system can undergo a larger stroke while the return spring system experiences significantly less displacement. This allows {{the length of the}} return spring to be reduced due to the minimization of displacement thereby reducing the weight of the return spring system. By allowing the primary actuating system to undergo longer strokes, the weight of the primary actuating system may also be reduced. Accordingly, the weight of the non-collinear {{valve actuator}} is reduced...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” In {{the field}} of competition, all {{companies}} should supply their goods and services with high quality, in shortest period with lower prices than its competitors {{in order to survive}} the competitive environment. A ball valve is a form of <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valve</b> which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball (called a "floating ball") to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90 -degrees by the valve handle. Reduced flow and excessive pressure drop are some of the common problems in ball valve. Angle backlash in the ball position is one of the causes for reduced flow and excessive pressure drop. This paper discusses on creating various alternatives for eliminating the angle backlash in the ball position, evaluating them and choosing the best alternative followed by CFD analysis of the ball valve before and after adjusting the backlash is made in ANSYS FLUENT and the results are compared. Key words: CFD, ANSYS FLUENT I...|$|R
40|$|NASA Glenn Research Center s Capillary Flow Experiments (CFE) {{program is}} {{developing}} experiment payloads to explore fluid interfaces in microgravity on the International Space Station. The {{information to be}} gained from the CFE is relevant to the design of fluid-bearing systems in which capillary forces predominate, for example in the passive positioning of liquids in spacecraft fuel tanks. To achieve the science goals of CFE, Glenn researchers constructed several types of experiment vessels. One type of vessel, known as the interior corner flow (ICF), will be used to determine important transients for low-gravity liquid management in a two-phase system. Each vessel has a cylindrical fluid reservoir connected to each end of the test chamber by internal transport tubes, each with a <b>quarter-turn</b> shutoff <b>valve</b> (see the following photograph). These multipiece vessels are made from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) because of its excellent optical properties (i. e., the fluids can be observed easily in the vessel). Because of the complexity of certain vessels, the test chamber had to be manufactured in pieces and welded chemically. Some past experience with adhesive bonded plastic showed that the experiment fluid degraded the adhesive to the point of failure. Therefore, it was necessary to see if the fluid also degraded the chemically welded PMMA joints...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{deployment of}} the World Wide Web {{over the past few}} decades has connected people globally. The next logical step in this evolution was to connect people to their environment. As public interest in the aging infrastructure grew, so did the desire to make this infrastructure safer and more environmentally friendly. This required the development of low-power wireless sensor networks to monitor and control this infrastructure, the so-called Internet of Things. With the introduction of low-power communication standards rooted in the Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mechanism, the ability to have sensors communicate robustly (99. 999 %) over long periods of time (10 years) using battery power, appears to have been largely achieved. This thesis is concerned with exploring three significant applications of these new communication networks. It also introduces two modeling tools useful in designing new applications for this space. A process automation solution centered around rotary valve position monitoring is presented first. The "peel-and-stick" MEMS device shows an accuracy of plus-or-minus 5 degrees for <b>quarter-turn</b> <b>valves,</b> and an accuracy of plus-or-minus 10 % of a turn was obtained with the multi-turn valves. This cost-effective solution is designed to be densely deployed on most of the plant's rotary valves. Next, the design and implementation of fence line perimeter security application is developed and verified. Combining a MEMS accelerometer with a hypothesis testing algorithm, all 91 known intrusions were detected with no false alarms over a period of approximately two months. Finally, a wireless gas leak detection and localization is evaluated from a sensory swarm perspective. This application highlights the detection challenges when working with noisy sensors. A gas plume detection rate higher than 90 % is demonstrated, with 7 false alarms over a period of three days and an average detection delay of 108 s. In terms of localization, the system estimated the leak locations to within three meters of the actual leak source. The design of the new system tools is controlled by the energy trade-off between transmitting and locally processing captured data. This has direct implications on the Quality of Service (robustness, delay, lifetime, etc.). An adaptable energy consumption model for TSCH networks is presented and then generalized to an application energy consumption model. These design-time tools allow developers to understand the feasibility of the new application and to refine its hardware and software design in order to meet predefined specifications. The application energy model is presented by taking a motor vibration application as an example, while combining the sensing and communication hardware with energy scavenging. The work done in this thesis is experimental in nature and care is taken to bring the proposed ideas as close to real implementations as possible: the hardware is built using commercial off-the-shelf components, the networks are configured for the application at hand, and algorithms are devised and validated in each setting...|$|E
