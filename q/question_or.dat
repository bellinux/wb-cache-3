5|$|Character {{creation}} is done through a tutorial prologue that encompasses the different {{ages of the}} player's characters, which also covers tutorials on movement, the HUD, combat, interactions with the game world, {{and the use of}} the Pip-Boy 3000. The character's {{creation is}} done in steps, with the player first setting up their appearance along with what race and gender their character is, and the name they have. Next, they customize their character's primary attributes via the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system – Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck – which is retained in Fallout 3, and determines the base level of the Skills the game uses. What three skills their character focuses on can either be left to the choices they make with a series of <b>question,</b> <b>or</b> by choosing manually what they desire. Character creation is not finalized until the player finally leaves Vault 101 and enters the Capital Wastelands, allowing players the option to modify their character's appearance, primary attributes and Skill choices if they are not satisfied with their choices.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the <b>question</b> <b>or</b> walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of}} the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without <b>question</b> <b>or</b> hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
5|$|Not every <b>question</b> <b>or</b> every {{criminal}} case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the question of whether a demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{authority}} {{to the effect that}} a court will not generally grant a declaration if it considers the issue at hand to be an academic <b>question</b> <b>or</b> one that is entirely hypothetical. For instance, in Vince v. Chief Constable of Dorset Police (1992), proceedings against the Chief Constable of Dorset Police were brought by the plaintiffs on behalf of members of the Police Federation of England and Wales to, among other things, enable chief constables throughout the country to know where they stood on a question of law with respect to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely, whether it was unlawful to appoint an acting sergeant as a custody officer under section 36(3) of the Act. Affirming the decision of the judge below, a majority of the Court of Appeal declined to make a declaration on the matter. It took the view that since {{there was no evidence that}} any chief constable had ever appointed an acting sergeant as a custody officer, the issue was academic or hypothetical.|$|E
