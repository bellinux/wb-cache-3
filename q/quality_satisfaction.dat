50|$|Some {{instances}} of incongruence in relationships are inevitable. Sudden or unanticipated changes of status or role of one person, {{or even the}} introduction of a novel person into a group, may produce discrepancies between people's self-views and the expectancies of others. In work settings, promotions can foment expectancy violations (cf, Burgoon, 1978) if some members of the organization refuse to update their appraisals of the recently promoted person. When incongruence occurs, it will disturb the normal flow of social interaction. Instead of going about their routine tasks, interaction partners will be compelled to shift their conscious attention to the task of accommodating the identity change that {{is the source of the}} disruption. Frequent or difficult-to-resolve disruptions could be damaging to the quality of social interactions and ultimately interfere with relationship <b>quality,</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and productivity.|$|E

A correlation analysis was undertaken on sample data from 48 regions on the quality institution and quality performance, and their relation was clarified. Four groups of relations are validated in this section, encompassing the correlation between any two aspects: <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> product safety, government regulations on quality, and Chinese citizens' concept of quality. The effect of government regulation on quality is measured by ‘good’ or ‘very good’ percentages. Citizens' concepts of quality are measured by ‘the percentage of those willing to report counterfeit products’. <b>Quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is measured by product <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and service <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> scores.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Current study {{investigates the}} impact of service quality (physical quality and staff behaviour) and brand equity (brand quality, brand {{awareness}} and brand image) on hotel restaurant food <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and brand loyalty among international and local travellers in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 354 valid questionnaires were collected to assess the measurement and structural model for reflective latent constructs using the two steps of covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM). Findings: The research findings suggest that while travellers’ nationality moderates the path between physical quality, staff behaviour and brand image on food <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> it does not moderate the relationship between brand quality and brand awareness on food <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> This finding further suggests that toward enhancing service quality and brand equity on food <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and brand loyalty, managers should understand the important distinctions between international and local travellers. Originality/value: Previous studies have mostly examined {{the impact of}} brand equity and service quality towards tourist satisfaction and very {{few studies have examined}} the impact of restaurant service quality and brand equity on consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty specifically among international and local travellers.

In this study, the roles of brand (destination) image and alternative attractiveness are also examined as ones of influencing factors of tourist behavioral intention besides service <b>quality,</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> and perceived value. The respondents of the survey consist of 391 foreign tourists who visited Bandung City between the month of January 2015 and July 2016.

We evaluated patients' motor functions by means of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and patients' quality of life by means of the PD Questionnaire. Patients were significantly less satisfied with the relationship than their partners as revealed by CSI (p = 0. 031) and they were more depressed (p = 0. 003) and anxious (p = 0. 015). A negative correlation between measures of relationship <b>quality</b> and <b>satisfaction</b> and alexithymia was found in the patients group.

40|$|Abstract—Layered {{streaming}} {{is being}} considered {{as the most}} promising approach to adapt to bandwidth variations and heterogeneous end users in streaming applications. The goal of a layered streaming protocol {{is not only to}} optimize the average playback skip rate as in single-layer streaming, but also to maximize possible quality level (<b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction)</b> based on the available bandwidth capacity at the end user. In unstructured layered peerto-peer streaming, however, achieving high <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is challenging due to content and bandwidth bottlenecks. With experiments, in this paper, we demonstrate the importance and identify unique challenges of neighbor selection to the system performance in terms of the average skip rate and <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Then, we propose a new neighbor selection technique that can offer good performance while keeping the scalability of the mesh overlay under network fluctuations. The core of the technique is a preemption rule that allows a higher capacity peer to replace a lower capacity peer to be a neighbor of another peer with a certain probability. This preemption rule gears high capacity peers to good locations in the overlay to maximize the use of their bandwidth capacity and available layers. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the method. I...|$|E

The "Service Quality Assessment Scale" developed by Lam and adapted to Turkish with a validity and reliability procedure was used as a data collection tool in the current study. The study was carried out with 527 people including 177 women and 350 men. In the analyses, descriptive statistics were used in the distribution of the demographic data and service <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> scores of the participants, and the independent t-test and one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) were utilized to determine if the demographic data led to any significant statistical difference in the service <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> scores. Significance level was taken as p< 0. 05 and confidence interval was accepted as 95 %. According to the findings of the study, the average difference values of the participants (service <b>quality</b> <b>satisfaction</b> scores) were determined to be in the negative direction in all the related dimensions (perceived service quality-expected service quality).

Service recovery most generally deals with complaint management. The study offers three contributions to the body of knowledge specific to the insurance industry. First, the results identify potential interactive and curvilinear influences that possess the ability to bias traditional regression results. Second, the results suggest that models of customer behaviors may vary across target markets and/or respondent pools, and even across organizations and their own agents. Finally, a research framework is presented and discussed that will assist insurance marketers in helping to overcome potential bias in regression coefficients used in competitive insurance settings. The research and managerial implications of the reported study are also presented and discussed.
