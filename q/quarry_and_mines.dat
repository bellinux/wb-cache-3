In 1936 the <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>mines</b> were bought by the Air Ministry and used as a storage area for RAF Chilmark, a munitions depot, until 1995.

At the independence elections, he was elected MP for the then Busia North Constituency. As a pre-independence trade unionist, Mr Oprong had founded the Kenya <b>Quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>Mines</b> Workers Union, hence Kenyatta appointed him assistant minister for Labour He later lost his parliamentary seat, only to recapture it in 1992.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{globally}} {{acknowledged that the}} important source of materials for the ever-active construction industry comes from quarry sites. Owing to this, the demand for building materials such as aggregates, cement and sand has increased to accommodate the building of houses, offices, industrial buildings, road systems and other infrastructures. Aggregates, {{as one of the}} basic building materials produced by the quarry industry is critically needed. The <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>mines</b> industry is one of the important contributors to the country's economy.

In June 2006 the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) of Egypt established a new department for conservation of ancient <b>quarries</b> <b>and</b> <b>mines</b> in Egypt. The new department was designed to work in close cooperation with the regional SCA offices, and special training programmes for Inspectors of Antiquities will be carried out to enable the regional authorities to tackle inventory, documentation, risk assessment and management of the ancient <b>quarries</b> <b>and</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Britain large {{deposits}} of Kaolinite (commonly known as [...] "china clay") {{were found in}} Cornwall. Many industrial railways, both narrow gauge and standard gauge, were built to serve the china clay <b>quarries</b> <b>and</b> <b>mines</b> of this area.|$|R
50|$|As well as this working quarry, {{there are}} many other disused <b>quarries</b> <b>and</b> <b>mine</b> {{buildings}} in the area due to the village's mining heritage. Unlike in the west of Cornwall, there are no plans to reopen the tin <b>and</b> copper <b>mines</b> in the area.|$|R

The goals of this research are to analyze ergonomics risk factor by associating the perception of employer and employees towards their workplace condition in <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>mining</b> industry. A Questionnaire on Ergonomics Risk Assessment was used to determine the comparison level awareness and perception analysis among <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>mining</b> industry in Malaysia. The findings of this research prove that the exposure of ergonomics risk factors towards the workers is commonly in moderate level 3. 59 in mean for the overall respondent review about the ergonomics risk among the workers at their workplace. Besides that, the most concern in ergonomics is about the awkward posture had 8. 8 % of them agreed and 6. 6 % of them totally agreed that they were in awkward posture while doing their work. As s conclusion, assessment of ergonomics in <b>quarry</b> <b>and</b> <b>mining</b> industries will be a platform to provide a safe and healthy working environment...|$|R
