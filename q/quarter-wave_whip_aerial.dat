5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antenna on an FM {{radio for}} 88-108 MHz ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{like other}} {{electrically}} short antennas the rubber ducky has poorer performance (less gain) than a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip,</b> it has somewhat better performance than an equal length base loaded antenna. This {{is because the}} inductance is distributed throughout the antenna and so allows somewhat greater current in the antenna.|$|R
50|$|A {{receiver}} for a {{navigation system}} of synchronised pulses transmitted from the UK - aircraft calculated their position {{from the time}} delay between pulses. The range of GEE was 3-400 mi (483-644 km). GEE used a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage ahead of the mid-upper turret.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the rubber}} ducky, antennas on {{portable}} radios usually consisted of <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antennas, rods whose length was {{one-quarter of the}} wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] In the VHF range where they were used, these antennas were 2 or 3 feet long, making them cumbersome. They were often made of telescoping tubes that could be retracted when not in use. To make the antenna more compact, electrically short antennas, shorter than one-quarter wavelength, began to be used. Electrically short antennas have considerable capacitive reactance, so to make them resonant at the operating frequency an inductor (loading coil) is added in series with the antenna. Antennas which have these inductors built into their bases are called base-loaded whips.|$|R
5000|$|The rubber ducky is an {{electrically}} short {{quarter-wave antenna}} {{in which the}} inductor, instead {{of being in the}} base, is built into the antenna itself. The antenna is made of a narrow helix of wire like a spring, which functions as the needed inductor. The springy wire is flexible, making it less prone to damage than a stiff antenna. The spring antenna is further enclosed in a plastic or rubber-like covering to prevent it from catching on things. The technical name for this type of antenna is a normal-mode helix. [...] Rubber ducky antennas are typically 4% to 15% of a wavelength long; that is, 16% to 60% of the length of a standard <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Whip antennas are {{normally}} designed as resonant antennas; the rod {{acts as a}} resonator for radio waves, with standing waves of voltage and current reflected {{back and forth from}} its ends. Therefore, the length of the antenna rod is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. The most common length is approximately one-quarter of the wavelength, called a [...] "quarter-wave whip" [...] (although often shortened by the use of a loading coil; see Electrically short whips below). For example, the common <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antennas used on FM radios in the USA are approximately 75 cm long, which is roughly one-quarter the length of radio waves in the FM radio band, which are 2.78 to 3.41 meters long. Half-wave antennas are also common.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground plane}} {{used with a}} {{monopole}} may be the actual earth; {{in this case the}} antenna is mounted on the ground and one side of the feedline is connected to an earth ground {{at the base of the}} antenna. This design is used for the mast radiator antennas employed in radio broadcasting at low frequencies, as well as other low frequency antennas such as the T-antenna and umbrella antenna. At VHF and UHF frequencies the size of the ground plane needed is smaller, so artificial ground planes are used to allow the antenna to be mounted above the ground. A common type of monopole antenna at these frequencies consists of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antenna with a ground plane consisting of several wires or rods radiating horizontally or diagonally from its base; this is called a ground-plane antenna. At gigahertz frequencies the metal surface of a car roof or airplane body makes a good ground plane, so car cell phone antennas consist of short whips mounted on the roof, and aircraft communication antennas frequently consist of a short conductor in an aerodynamic fairing projecting from the fuselage; this is called a blade antenna. [...] The most common antenna used in mobile phones is the inverted-F antenna, which is a variant of the inverted-L monopole. Bending over the antenna saves space and keeps the it within the bounds of the mobile's case but the antenna then has a very low impedance. To improve the match the antenna is not fed from the end, rather some intermediate point, and the end is grounded instead. The <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> and rubber ducky antennas used with handheld radios such as walkie-talkies and cell phones are also monopole antennas. These don't use a ground plane, and the ground side of the transmitter is just connected to the ground connection on its circuit board. The hand and body of the person holding them may function as a rudimentary ground plane.|$|R
5000|$|If mounted above {{a perfect}} ground plane, a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> has a gain twice (3 dB greater than) {{that of a}} half wave dipole, or 5.19 dBi, and a {{radiation}} resistance half that of a dipole, or 36.8 ohms. However without a ground plane the gain is reduced and the radiation resistance increased. Whips mounted on vehicles use the metal skin of the vehicle as a ground plane. In hand-held devices usually no explicit ground plane is provided, and the ground side of the antenna's feed line is just connected to the ground on the device's circuit board. [...] Therefore, the radio itself, and possibly the user's hand, serves as a rudimentary ground plane. Since these are no larger than {{the size of the}} antenna itself, the combination of whip and radio often functions more as an asymmetrical dipole antenna than as a monopole antenna.|$|R
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} length of a whip antenna to make it less cumbersome, an {{inductor}} (loading coil) is often added in series with it. This allows the antenna to be made much shorter than the normal length of a quarter-wavelength, and still be resonant, by cancelling out the capacitive reactance of the short antenna. The coil is added {{at the base of the}} whip (called a base-loaded whip) or occasionally in the middle (center-loaded whip). In the most widely used form, the rubber ducky antenna, the loading coil is integrated with the antenna itself by making the whip out of a narrow helix of springy wire. The helix distributes the inductance along the antenna's length, improving the radiation pattern, and also makes it more flexible. Another alternative occasionally used to shorten the antenna is to add a [...] "capacity hat", a metal screen or radiating wires, at the end. However all these electrically short whips have lower gain than a full length <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between 1958 and 1960 Alliance was {{extensively}} modernised {{by having}} the deck gun and external torpedo tubes removed, the hull streamlined and the fin replaced with a larger (26 feet 6 inch high), more streamlined one constructed of aluminium. The purpose of these modifications {{was to make the}} submarine quieter and faster underwater. Following the modifications the wireless transmitting aerial was supported on a frame behind the fin; but was later replaced with a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> on the starboard side of the fin which could be rotated hydraulically to a horizontal position.|$|R
5000|$|To {{function}} as a ground plane, the conducting surface {{must be at least}} a quarter of the wavelength (λ/4) of the radio waves in size. In lower frequency antennas, such as the mast radiators used for broadcast antennas, the Earth itself (or a body of water such as a salt marsh or ocean) is used as a ground plane. For higher frequency antennas, in the VHF or UHF range, the ground plane can be smaller, and metal disks, screens and wires are used as ground planes. At upper VHF and UHF, the metal skin of a car or aircraft can serve as a ground plane for whip antennas projecting from it. In microstrip antennas and printed monopole antennas an area of copper foil {{on the opposite side of}} a printed circuit board serves as a ground plane. The ground plane doesn't have to be a continuous surface. In the ground plane antenna style whip antenna, the [...] "plane" [...] consists of several wires λ/4 long radiating from the base of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antenna.|$|R
5000|$|Base CB antennas may be {{vertical}} for omnidirectional coverage, or directional [...] "beam" [...] antennas {{may be used}} {{to direct}} communications to a particular region. Ground-plane kits exist as mounting bases for mobile whips, and have several wire terminals or hardwired ground radials attached. These kits are designed to have a mobile whip screwed on top (a full-length, <b>quarter-wave</b> steel <b>whip</b> is preferred) and mounted on a mast. The ground radials replace the vehicle body (which is the counterpoise for a mobile whip in a typical vehicle installation).|$|R
50|$|A {{whip antenna}} is an antenna {{consisting}} of a straight flexible wire or rod. The bottom end of the whip {{is connected to the}} radio receiver or transmitter. The antenna is designed to be flexible so that it does not break easily,and the name is derived from the whip-like motion that it exhibits when disturbed. Whip antennas for portable radios are often made of a series of interlocking telescoping metal tubes, so they can be retracted when not in use. Longer ones, made for mounting on vehicles and structures, are made of a flexible fiberglass rod around a wire core and can be up to 35 ft (10 m) long. The length of the whip antenna is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with. The most common type is the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip,</b> which is approximately one-quarter of a wavelength long. Whips are {{the most common type of}} monopole antenna, and are used in the HF, VHF and UHF radio bands. They are widely used as the antennas for hand-held radios, such as cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, FM radios, boom boxes, Wi-Fi enabled devices, and GPS receivers, and are attached to vehicles as the antennas for car radios and two-way radios for wheeled vehicles and for aircraft. Larger versions mounted on roofs and radio masts are used as base station antennas for police, fire, ambulance, taxi, and other vehicle dispatchers.|$|R

50|$|Although on-site data {{collection}} using electronic measuring equipment is common-place, many monitoring programmes also use remote surveillance and remote {{access to data}} in real time. This requires the on-site monitoring equipment {{to be connected to}} a base station via either a telemetry network, land-line, cell phone network or other telemetry system such as Meteor burst. The advantage of remote surveillance is that many data feeds can come into a single base station for storing and analysis. It also enable trigger levels or alert levels to be set for individual monitoring sites and/or parameters so that immediate action can be initiated if a trigger level is exceeded. The use of remote surveillance also allows for the installation of very discrete monitoring equipment which can often be buried, camouflaged or tethered at depth in a lake or river with only a short <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> protruding. Use of such equipment tends to reduce vandalism and theft when monitoring in locations easily accessible by the public.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 MHz is a {{relatively}} long wavelength for mobile communications, and the choice of antenna has a considerable impact {{on the performance of}} a CB radio. A common mobile antenna is a <b>quarter-wave</b> vertical <b>whip.</b> This is roughly nine feet (2.7 m) tall; it is mounted low on the vehicle body, and often has a spring-and-ball mount to enhance its flexibility when scraping or striking overhead objects. Where a nine-foot whip is undesirable, shorter antennas include loading coils to make the antenna impedance the same as a physically longer antenna. The loading coil may be on the bottom, middle, or top of the antenna, while some antennas are wound in a continuously-loaded helix.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, FFW {{configurations}} {{were produced}} for the Jeep, Austin Champ and Land Rover. In these smaller vehicles, {{it was necessary}} to construct racking to hold the sets and often to remove the rear seats. Owing to the small capacity of the Jeep and early Landrover charging systems, the 300W charging set was still required, although there was little space for it and was sometimes even mounted between the front seats. The Austin Champ. however, was built in a dedicated FFW version from 1954 and was provided with dedicated radio supply connections and a high-output generator for the role. Single-set installations were produced for the Jeep during World War II The introduction of the post-war and smaller C42 & C45 sets allowed a dual-set installation, even in these small 5cwt or ¼-ton vehicles. <b>Whip</b> <b>aerials</b> for the VHF set(s) were installed on the front wings of these vehicles, together with their base-mounted Aerial Tuning Units to obtain maximum separation from any HF antenna. This practice became a distinctive feature of British Army vehicles in later years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest of}} these World War II FFW {{vehicles}} were the 3-ton command vehicles on lorry chassis and the 6×6 AEC Armoured Command Vehicle. [...] These were {{built for the}} use of staff officers and carried map tables, several telephones and other equipment, with space for a senior officer and his staff in command. As well as No. 19 sets, they also carried the high power and long range transmitter Wireless Sender BC-610. In this case they still carried the small 300 W charging set, but also a 3 kW generator set, usually an American-made Onan. Most radio use would be made when established as a temporary headquarters with long-wire aerials rigged, in which case the generator set would be used dismounted. When on the move, or {{during the course of a}} battle, the low-power radios could still be used from batteries, with vertical <b>whip</b> <b>aerials.</b> The small charging set could be used to recharge these, with less effort and also less noise to give away a position.|$|R
50|$|Since UoSAT-2 (a.k.a. UO-11 or UoSAT-Oscar-11) is a {{sun-synchronous}} polar {{orbiting satellite}} {{in a low}} earth orbit, it passes over the poles every 98 minutes and a small handheld receiver with a simple <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> is sufficient {{to get a few}} minutes of excellent reception on each pass. By the end of 1987, while preparations were under way in the USSR, it was decided that the expedition would not take place at the South Pole, but instead at the North Pole; and the team would consist not only of Soviets, but a few experienced Canadian skiers as well. This time they would not only ski to the pole but continue their trek to Canada. The objective thus became to ski across the Arctic Ocean from the Siberian coast, via the North Pole, to the Canadian coast. The expedition started on March 3, 1988, and finished on June 1, when the skiers reached the small Ward Hunt Island just off Cape Columbia at Ellesmere Island, Northern Canada. The expedition was privately organized by 'Komsomolskaya Pravda', (the Soviet Youth Newspaper). Sponsors were the Soviet Youth Travel Agency 'Sputnik', and McDonald's restaurants of Canada. Canadian Project Manager was the Polar Bridge Company, a group organized by the Canadian skiers.|$|R
2500|$|The Typhoon {{was first}} {{produced}} with forward-opening [...] "car door" [...] style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent [...] "roof" [...] hinged to {{open to the}} left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed [...] "The Coffin Hood"), the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later [...] "car-door" [...] canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending {{the introduction of the}} new [...] "bubble" [...] canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a <b>whip</b> <b>aerial</b> further back on the rear fuselage.|$|R
40|$|Microstrip-patch-style antennas that {{generate}} monopole radiation patterns {{similar to those}} of <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> antennas can be designed to have dimensions smaller than those needed heretofore for this purpose, by taking advantage of a feed configuration different from the conventional one. The large sizes necessitated by the conventional feed configuration have, until now, made such antennas impractical for frequencies below about 800 MHz: for example, at 200 MHz, the conventional feed configuration necessitates a patch diameter of about 8 ft (. 2. 4 m). too large, for example, for mounting on the roof of an automobile or on a small or medium-size aircraft. By making it possible to reduce diameters to between a tenth and a third of that necessitated by the conventional feed configuration, the modified configuration makes it possible to install such antennas in places where they could not previously be installed and thereby helps to realize the potential advantages (concealment and/or reduction of aerodynamic drag) of microstrip versus whip antennas. In both the conventional approach and the innovative approach, a microstrip-patch (or microstrip-patch-style) antenna for generating a monopole radiation pattern includes an electrically conductive patch or plate separated from an electrically conductive ground plane by a layer of electrically insulating material. In the conventional approach, the electrically insulating layer is typically a printed-circuit board about 1 / 16 in. (. 1. 6 mm) thick. Ordinarily, a coaxial cable from a transmitter, receiver, or transceiver is attached at the center on the ground-plane side, the shield of the cable being electrically connected to the ground plane. In the conventional approach, the coaxial cable is mated with a connector mounted on the ground plane. The center pin of this connector connects {{to the center of the}} coaxial cable and passes through a hole in the ground plane and a small hole in the insulating layer and then connects with the patch above one-third of the radial distance from the center. The modified feed configuration of the innovative approach is an inductive-short-circuit configuration that provides impedance matching and that has been used for many years on other antennas but not on microstrip-style monopole antennas. In this configuration, the pin is connected to both the conductive patch and the ground plane. As before, the shield of the coaxial cable is connected to the ground plane, but now the central conductor is connected to a point on the pin between the ground plane and the conductive plate (see figure). The location of the connection point on the pin is chosen so that together, the inductive short circuit and the conductive plate or patch act as components of a lumped-element resonant circuit that radiates efficiently at the resonance frequency and, at the resonance frequency, has an impedance that matches that of the coaxial cable. It should be noted that the innovative design entails two significant disadvantages. One disadvantage is that the frequency bandwidth for efficient operation is only about 1 / 20 to 1 / 15 that of a whip antenna designed for the same nominal frequency. The other disadvantage is that the estimated gain is between 3 - 1 / 2 and 4 - 1 / 2 dB below that of the whip antenna. However, if an affected radio-communication system used only a few adjacent frequency channels and the design of the components of the system other than the antenna provided adequate power or gain margin, then these disadvantages could be overcome...|$|R
5000|$|Rides and attractions in the {{densely packed}} Electric Park include {{a roller coaster}} (one was called the Derby Racer; another {{featured}} {{a sign that said}} [...] "Trip Thru the Clouds - Detroit's Greatest Ride"; others that appeared in the park were the Big Dipper, the Bobs, and the Dare Devil), Ferris wheel, an interactive simulation of the Johnstown Flood, a Shoot-the-Chutes around which the rest of the park is configured, a <b>Whip</b> ride, <b>aerial</b> swings, various other mechanical rides, live entertainment (including acrobats and aerialists) performing in front of a bank of bleacher seats that dominated one side of the park), a riverfront pier, a coliseum, picnic facilities, and the Palais de Danse ballroom built (in 1912) {{over the edge of the}} water of the Detroit River. Another dance hall, Palace Gardens, was destroyed in a May 1911 blaze; the Coliseum and the pier and boardwalk (site of the park's concession stands) burned down ten years later. Before the fire, the Pier Ballroom and the Ramona were popular places for dancing; afterwards, the nearby Merry Gardens Ballroom kept drawing crowds even after the demise of the park.|$|R
500|$|Visual {{effects for}} Doctor Strange were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Method Studios, Framestore, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise FX, Crafty Apes, and SPOV, contributing to 1450 effects shots. Previsualization was handled by The Third Floor. All vendors worked on the common magical elements (mandalas, magical runes shields, <b>whips,</b> stalks and <b>aerial</b> 'lily pads', and portals). Visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, who also worked on Guardians of the Galaxy, explained {{the similarities and differences}} between the two films, saying, [...] "there's some resemblance in {{some of the things that}} we've done. In the same way, it's a totally different world. In , it's more sci-fi oriented and crazy colors. More of a comedy kind of take on things as well. This one is a little bit more serious. It's also a little bit more trippy. We use very different techniques, actually. Guardians was also for us a huge animation film. This one was less of it. This one was more about the environments and effects".|$|R
