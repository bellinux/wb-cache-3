40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to search for a {{possibility}} of an econometric analysis of <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> The <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> were conducted as an international cooperative study on the perceptions toward trade liberalization by SME managers. Subjectivity is inevitable on the interpretation of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> Particularly，the possibility increases as many researchers are involved in the international cooperative study. The application of the qualitative response model technique such as the Probit analysis has a possibility of increasing consistency and objectivity. This paper confirmed that SME managers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions toward trade liberalization can be estimated，for instance，managers of exporting firms of both countries tend to welcome trade liberalization and the parameters express their probabilities.

2500|$|Born in Râmnicu Sărat, {{the future}} {{economist}} {{was the son}} of a Romanian Land Forces officer, Ion C. Murgescu. Young Murgescu was originally interested in jurisprudence, and entered the law faculty of the University of Bucharest. His beginnings were as a literary critic, with an essay on the literary and artistic life of Balcic. It was picked up by the review Familia, and deemed [...] "interesting, but insufficient" [...] by chroniclers at Revista Fundațiilor Regale. Aged nineteen, Murgescu wrote a historical work, about the trial of the Transylvanian Memorandum signatories. Around that time, he was also a staff writer for the Oradea literary newspaper, Noua Gazetă de Vest, where he conducted a <b>questionnaire</b> <b>survey</b> on the state of cultural life in the provinces of Greater Romania.|$|E

40|$|To {{identify}} {{factors that}} contribute to the high variability of the rates of use of placebo interventions reported in <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys,</b> the author investigated the effect of the explicit use of the word "placebo" in <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> on placebo use in clinical practice on the results obtained. 190 primary care physicians in Poland were divided randomly into two groups. The groups received a questionnaire in which either the word placebo or the term "nonspecific methods of treatment" was used. The respondents who were asked explicitly about the use of placebo interventions declared that they never used placebo interventions significantly more often than participants asked about the use of nonspecific treatment methods. Moreover, the former reported significantly rarer use of placebo interventions than the latter. The study demonstrates that differences in the wording of questions in <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> on placebo use can create statistically significant differences in results...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the psychological fatigue and analyze muscle activity of production workers who are performing processes jobs while standing for prolonged time periods. Methods: The psychological fatigue experienced by the workers was obtained through <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> Meanwhile, muscle activity has been analyzed using surface electromyography (sEMG) measurement. Lower extremities muscles include: erector spi-nae, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius were concurrently measured for more than five hours of standing. Twenty male produc-tion workers in a metal stamping company participated as subjects in this study. The subjects were required to undergo question-naire surveys and sEMG measurement. Results: Results of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> found that all subjects experienced psychological fatigue due to prolonged standing jobs. Similarly, muscle fatigue has been identified through sEMG measurement. Based on the non-parametric statistical test using the Spearman’s rank order correlation, the left erector spinae obtained a moderate positive correlation and statistically significant (rs = 0. 552, p < 0. 05) between the results of <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> and sEMG measurement. Conclusion: Based on this study, the authors concluded that prolonged standing was contributed to psychological fatigue and to muscle fatigue among the production workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on an {{analysis}} of the situation in which information is obtained from respondents in <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys.</b> From the perspective of the cognitive aspects of survey methodology the article takes a complex view of this situation and applies theoretical concepts and empirical evidence in order to explain the close connection between the interview situation {{and the quality of the}} information obtained. The interview situation is portrayed in its twofold form: personal aspects (the mental operations of respondents) and social aspects (the interaction and communication between the interviewer and the respondent). The analysis of the interactive aspects of the interview situation draws attention to the rules of standard communication, which interfere with the ordinary concept of the standardised interview and the course of mental processes. The cognitive aspect of responding to questions is analysed from the perspective of the wider understanding of context effects, the author refers to the most important theoretical concepts relating to individual effects and empirical evidence of some effects that infl uence the response process. The article takes a somewhat untypical approach to some aspects of data collection in <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys</b> and into the Czech context introduces the cognitive aspects of the methodology of <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surveys...</b>|$|R
