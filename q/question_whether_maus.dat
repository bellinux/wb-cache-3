40|$|Most {{people who}} have {{discussed}} the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> attributions of intentional attitudes or contents are normative have assumed that this question boils down to the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> such judgements have normative force "by themselves", or as it is often put, to the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> they are "intrinsically " or "non-hypothetically " normative. I take issue with this and argue that a judgement can be normative, {{in the sense of}} essentially involving a normative concept, even if its normative force is "extrinsic", and even if it lacks normative force altogether. The result is that most attempts to show that attributions of attitudes or contents lack normative force, even if successful, could not count as refutations of intentional normativism...|$|R
