40|$|It {{should be}} been within the {{interest}} of any university to know and ensure quality in the teaching and assessment of its students. The services offered by universities include; teaching of students, undertaking research and offering community service. These to be attained effectively, universities should institute <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> {{in order to ensure}} that they offer quality services to their stakeholders. This paper highlights, the implementation of internal <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> in universities in Uganda, and the region as a means of improving the teaching and learning of the students. It has been observed that many universities in Uganda and in the region have not enhanced their <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> and thus offering pitiable services to their stakeholders. Research has shown that putting in place functional internal <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> is the only way universities can advance and also enhance quality in the services they offer. Some universities in Uganda and in the region have been found to lack the will of advancing and enhancing functional <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> despite having the means. On the other hand, though some universities have the zeal to implement and operationalize <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> they lack adequate resources while <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> is attached to a price. It is recommended that universities in Uganda and in the region should ensure that <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> are in place and also, allocate adequate resources to <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities within their universities...|$|R

A complicating factor is that delivered quality can only be affected stochastically by producers and imperfectly observed by consumers.
