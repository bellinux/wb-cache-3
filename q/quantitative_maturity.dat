40|$|Estimation {{of forest}} carbon storage {{can be of}} great {{significance}} to the research on the productivity of terrestrial ecosystem, carbon cycle, and global warming. China has more than 54 million hm 2 barren hills and waste land suitable for forestation, which provides a great potential for developing carbon sink forestry by means of forestation. This research analyzed the volume increments, volume densities, and carbon contents of 15 analytical samples of five main plantation tree species in North China, including Pinus tabulaeformis (A), Robinia pseudoacacia (B), Populus euramericana (C), Larix olgenisis (D), and Larix kaempferi (E). Results showed that carbon storage dynamic process can be expressed as follows: the ages of <b>quantitative</b> <b>maturity</b> of each tree species are 67 a, 40 a, 30 a, 48 a, 49 a, respectively; the average wood densities of each tree species at different age classes are 550. 93 [*]kg/m 3, 629. 25 [*]kg/m 3, 404. 56 [*]kg/m 3, 592. 33 [*]kg/m 3, and 544. 11 [*]kg/m 3,t. The average carbon contents of each tree species at different age classes are 51. 48 %, 46. 88 %, 47. 81 %, 46. 76 %, and 47. 24 %. It showed {{a significant difference between}} the above tree species through variance test. The maximum values of average carbon storage are 70 a, 40 a, 30 a, 48. 7 a, and 49. 2 a, respectively. The corresponding average carbon storages are A 2. 527 [*]kg, B 3, 794 [*]kg, C 2. 781 [*]kg, D 2. 996 [*]kg, and E 3, 322 [*]kg, in a descending order of C>E>D>B>A. This research, through experiment on four tree species with clear growth rings and one tree species with unclear growth rings, verified the scientific character and the scope of application of the carbon storage dynamic analysis method, providing a new method for the measurement and analysis of forest carbon storage...|$|E

40|$|AbstractInformation {{technology}} (IT) governance is {{an important}} organizational ability to promote IT-business strategic alignment and IT value delivery to businesses. To implement IT governance, businesses can utilize a set of practices associated with decision-making structures, processes, and relational mechanisms; however, the specific contributions of these different practices remain poorly understood. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study that sought to (1) develop a measurement instrument for IT governance practices, and based on this instrument, (2) identify different organizational profiles in terms of IT governance practices, business results, and <b>maturity.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> data were collected from a sample 652 Brazilian companies. Factorial and clusters analyses were applied to develop a measurement instrument and identify the companies’ profiles, respectively. IT governance maturity and the achievement of business and IT outcomes were compared. Based on this analysis, this study indicates how businesses can be successful in terms of IT governance practices, and it presents potential deficiencies based on organizations with lower IT and business results...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at analyzing, in a {{retrospective}} way, {{the performance of}} a cohort of 13, 452 students, who, in the academic year 2008 - 09, were enrolled for a one year more than the scheduled years to take their degree, to examine their university behavior depending on the events happened from the beginning of their university career (the main career events may be: transfer to another university, abandon, change of course, to take a degree). Through the use of segmentation trees, we would like to verify the influence of some explanatory variables (sex, type of faculty and course of study, type of previous diploma) on students’ behavior, in order to track some student profiles, based on different events. Some indicators will be calculated (eg. drop-out rate, graduation rate, etc.) and they will be put in relation with some <b>quantitative</b> explanatory variables (<b>maturity</b> grade, average exams grade) in order to verify whether the performances during the university period and, before, at the college, influence the student behavior, so they can be taken as a predictor...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many {{corporations}} have applied CMM, SPICE or other software process maturity models to developing software products. These models are recommended {{to change from}} qualitative process management to quantitative management as they reach {{a certain level of}} <b>maturity.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> process management is possible only when reliable data exist. If quantitative process management are conducted when data’s reliability are not ensured, adverse effects can be caused by the false management activities. That is why so many methods have been studied to analyze reliability of collected data. Most of them, however, are analysis methods for already collected data. Therefore, if the analysis finds that the existing data are not reliable, the data should be abandoned and new data be collected again, causing need to consume much time and effort. Therefore, as a way to secure reliability of data to be used for quantitative process management when they are input in the first place, this paper suggests a method applying the second level meta game of non-cooperative, bimatrix games to collecting data for quantitative measurement...|$|R
40|$|Countries need to {{be aware}} of the stage of their current e-Commerce {{maturity}} for choosing the right strategy to move forward. For this purpose, we develop a country-level decision support framework to determine maturation stage of e-Commerce in a country. At first, e-Commerce maturity scores of local e-Markets in each regional e-Market are calcu lated using a fuzzy bi-level Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Then, e-Commerce maturity scores of regional e-Markets in the country are determined based on a fuzzy bi-level fishbone diagram. After that, national e-Commerce maturity level is assessed using a three-level decision making model. The contribution of the proposed decision support framework is four fold s : 1) it develops a fishbone diagram to a fuzzy bi-level environment; 2) it presents a country-level decision making model with three levels of local, regional, interna tional e-Markets to assess country’s e-Commerce maturity level; 3) it considers interdependencies between local, re gional and international e-Markets; and 4) it synthesizes qualitative judgments and <b>quantitative</b> data of <b>maturity</b> criteria and sub-criteria. The results of this self-assessment can be used to analyze national e-Commerce strengths, weaknesses in e-Commerce development and move to the next level of e-Commerce maturity. Furthermore, it can be used as a de vice to transfer knowledge to developing countries. We present a case study to determine US e-Commerce maturity level. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite being a C 4 crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)) {{has a wide}} {{geographical}} distribution with adaptation to extreme climates such that its accessions are genetically diverse. Furthermore, the cereal has typically evolved in areas of limited water resources and thus alleles conferring growth under water limitation, such as alleles associated with greater photosynthetic capacity and/or efficiency may have been favourable and selected for. We used ca. 1000 exotic sorghum lines that have been introgressed with height and <b>maturity</b> <b>quantitative</b> trait loci (QTL) from a common parent (so-called sorghum conversion lines) to make the material easier to work with – and a nested association mapping population with around 1500 entries to mine this diversity for variation in alleles conferring photosynthetic capacity. In this paper, we report the use of near and remote-sensing technology, such as red (670 nm), red- edge (720 nm) and near infra-red (830 nm) cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and hyperspectral sensors on a mobile phenotyping platform (GECKO) {{to be able to}} efficiently and effectively phenotype these populations for traits associated with photosynthetic capacity in replicated trials with thousands of field plots. To derive algorithms for the outputs from Lidar, sonar, thermal and hyperspectral sensors, we have collected “ground” data, such as chlorophyll content using handheld devices such as a SPAD chlorophyll and a fluorometer, measured plant height and leaf angle, as well as destructively measured leaf area index and biomass.

40|$|Ultrasound is a {{non-invasive}} {{diagnostic tool}} {{that could provide}} important information about pulmonary <b>maturity.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> ultrasound techniques that relate lung tissue acoustic properties, i. e. acoustic velocity, attenuation, and scattering, to its physical properties, such as, elastic and structural properties, have been reviewed. B-mode techniques were equipment dependent and produced conflicting results. A-mode techniques are less dependent on the measuring equipment and could provide more accurate information about lung development. A-node techniques were applied {{to the study of}} regional differences within the fetal lung. The accuracy of these techniques could be instrumental to the eventual determination of lung maturation. To pursue this possibility, the alveolar regions across the upper, middle, and lower lobes of physiologically mature normal preterm lamb lungs were scanned to determine their acoustic properties within the frequency range of 1 - 15 MHz. Average speed of sound, attenuation and size of backscatterers were found to be independent of lung regions. Comparison between the lung mean size of backscatterers and mean alveolar sac diameter, histologically measured from the whole lung, showed that these data were not statistically different. This suggested that the collagen rich alveolar sac septal walls were the principal sources of scattering. Histological measurements on the size of alveolar sacs across different regions of the lung were also independent of the lung regions. The results of this study on the fetal lamb lungs suggested that A-mode ultrasound is sensitive to lung developmental changes. The ability of A-mode ultrasound to determine lung maturity appears promising. Further experiments on regional lung development and lung maturation at the pre and post-surfactant synthesis stages of the gestational life may establish the basis for an accurate and risk-free ultrasound assessment of lung maturation that is reliable in a clinical settin...|$|R
40|$|We tested whether fishers’ local {{ecological}} knowledge (LEK) of two fish life-history parameters, size-at-maturity (SAM) {{at maximum}} body size (MS), was comparable to scientific estimates (SEK) {{of the same}} parameters, and whether LEK influenced fishers’ perceptions of sustainability. Local ecological knowledge was documented for 82 fishers from a small-scale fishery in Samaná Bay, Dominican Republic, whereas SEK was compiled from the scientific literature. Size-at-maturity estimates derived from LEK and SEK overlapped {{for most of the}} 15 commonly harvested species (10 of 15). In contrast, fishers’ maximum size estimates were usually lower than (8 species), or overlapped with (5 species) scientific estimates. Fishers’ size-based estimates of catch composition indicate greater potential for overfishing than estimates based on SEK. Fishers’ estimates of size-at-capture relative to size-at-maturity suggest routine inclusion of juveniles in the catch (9 of 15 species), and fishers’ estimates suggest that harvested fish are substantially smaller than maximum body size for most species (11 of 15 species). Scientific estimates also suggest that harvested fish are generally smaller than maximum body size (13 of 15), but suggest that the catch is dominated by adults for most species (9 of 15 species), and that juveniles are present in the catch for fewer species (6 of 15). Most Samaná fishers characterized the current state of their fishery as poor (73 %) and as having changed for the worse over the past 20 years (60 %). Fishers stated that concern about overfishing, catching small fish, and catching immature fish contributed to these perceptions, indicating a possible influence of catch size-composition on their perceptions. Future work should test this link more explicitly because we found no evidence that the minority of fishers with more positive perceptions of their fishery reported systematically different estimates of catch-size composition than those with the more negative majority view. Although fishers’ and scientific estimates of size-at-maturity and maximum size parameters sometimes differed, the fact that fishers make routine <b>quantitative</b> assessments of <b>maturity</b> and body size suggests potential for future collaborative monitoring efforts to generate estimates usable by scientists and meaningful to fishers...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focused on}} the {{identification}} and characterization of the genetic basis of important agronomic traits in the potato with main interest centered on resistance to the potato cyst nematode, Globodera pallida. A high level of genetic resistance to nematodes is an important aspect in breeding new potato varieties. The first step towards that is the localization of genetic factors controlling resistance on the potato map. We made use of information obtained from experimental diploid mapping populations to evaluate tetraploid breeding material for the applied research. We explored the genetic resistances present in the crop, which show a continuous variation and {{are assumed to be}} controlled by several loci which act collectively on the expression of resistance. These loci are referred to as quantitative trait loci (QTL) (Meyer et al. 1998). The number of QTL for resistance was determined through an association mapping approach. Two tetraploid populations were genotyped with several markers either within or physically linked to candidate genes. Phenotypic data was supplied by the two breeding companies, Saka-Ragis and Böhm-Nordkartoffel. Significant associations with quantitative resistance were found for all marker types. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to be the most efficient marker type to detect significant associations between markers and the resistance phenotype. Two of them served as basis for developing a PCR-based marker highly diagnostic for potato varieties with high resistance to Globodera pallida (Sattarzadeh et al. 2006). Based on an InDel in the sequence we designed an allele-specific CAPS marker for the <b>quantitative</b> detection of <b>maturity</b> corrected resistance to the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Using this marker we provide solutions for the selection of superior potato genotypes through the development of easy-to-use DNA based molecular markers. Fine mapping of a QTL for resistance to the nematode located on chromosome V was done by a combination of association tests and physical mapping to gain more insight in the genomic organisation of a QTL. We were able to delimit the size to a genetic region of 2 cM. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied to obtain valuable complementary information regarding size and chromosomal position of this QTL. The region was estimated to span less than 1 Mb and is located in the euchromatic region of the long arm of chromosome V. These findings will assist future map based cloning efforts in this region. The detection of numerous loci in tetraploid breeding material associated with important agronomic traits provides valuable data which can be used to design additional markers not just for resistance against G. pallida but also for other traits, such as resistance to Phytophthora infestans, maturity, yield, and starch content...|$|R
