50|$|A nuc {{may or may}} not {{be given}} a queen at the time it is created.If the nuc does not contain a queen or queen-cell, but does contain eggs, the workers will create a new queen from one of the eggs.If the nuc is to be given a new queen, the queen will be {{introduced}} to the colony in her queen cage either at the time the nuc is split from the main colony, or after a period of <b>queenlessness</b> that increases the likelihood that the new queen will be accepted.Nucs are often used to prevent swarming in a larger colony, by removing frames with queen-cells from a larger colony and using them to provide the basis for a new colony. The removal of queen cells and reduction in population in the donor colony diminish the urge to swarm. This procedure may also be called a walk-away split.|$|E
40|$|In six {{colonies of}} Apis cerana the queen was removed and {{occurrence}} of egg-laying by workers was studied. Three colonies had brood of all stages and were thus allowed to build emergency queen cells and to rear queens. In three other colonies no young brood to build emergency queen cells was left (hopelessly queenless), but older brood was present. Workers started laying within {{two to three}} days after removal of the queen, both in the colonies rearing queens and in the hopelessly queenless colonies. Four to five days after removal of the queen mass egg-laying by workers occurred in five of the six colonies. These eggs partly developed into capped drone brood. Thus, A. cerana workers may produce a substantial number of drones during short periods of <b>queenlessness,</b> even when new queens are reared simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that a non-volati le pheromone inhibiting worker egg-laying and queen development produced by Bombus terrestris queens has effects transferable (a) from workers to other workers or larvae, or (b) on wax. We subdivided small, Young colonies {{with a single}} mesh screen (Experiment 1) and larger, older colonies with a double mesh screen (Experiment 2). One treatment (in both experiments) involved the transfer of workers, and one treatment (in Experiment 2 only) involved the transfer of wax, from the queenright to the queenless compartments. <b>Queenlessness</b> induced significantly earlier onset of worker aggression (followed by egg-laying) in all treatments in both experiments, and significantly earlier queen production in all treatments in Experiment 2 (small colony sizes probably hindered queen production in Experiment 1). These findings suggested that. the effects of B. terrestris queen pheromone are not transferable via workers or wax...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{bees are}} very {{delicate}} organisms existing within the strong and resistant body of their colony, inside its carefully protected cavity. Honeybees have been surviving this way since long before man first stepped on earth (Free et a/., 1 982 }. An individual bee will {{freeze to death}} within minutes in the climate of Sweden where I have been keeping bees for 28 years. Colonies of bees have survived my mismanagement, infestation with wax moth, <b>queenlessness,</b> wet insulation, or even being tipped over during a cold winter storm. Some of my colonies always survived and managed to multiply when the spring sun shone and brought flowers and nutritious food back into the life cycle again. Winter losses never ever exceeded 15 %- until last year. Unwelcome experience Winter 2002 - 2003 was a totally new experience for me and fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} shrimp genus Synalpheus includes the only eusocial marine animals. In {{much of the}} Caribbean, eusocial species have dominated the diverse fauna of sponge-dwelling shrimp in coral rubble {{for at least the}} past two decades. Here we document a recent, dramatic decline and apparent local extinction of eusocial shrimp species on the Belize Barrier Reef. Our collections from shallow reefs in central Belize in 2012 failed to locate three of the four eusocial species formerly abundant in the area, and showed steep declines in colony size and increases in frequency of queenless colonies prior to their disappearance. Concordant with these declines, several nonsocial, pair-forming Synalpheus species increased in frequency. The decline in eusocial shrimp is explained in part by disappearance of two sponge species on which they specialize. Eusocial shrimp collections from Jamaica in 2012 showed similar patterns of decline in colony size and increased <b>queenlessness</b> compared with prior Jamaican collections. The decline and local extinction of eusocial shrimp happened against a backdrop of changes in coral assemblages during recent decades, and may reflect changes in abundance and quality of dead coral substratum and succession of the diverse cryptic organisms living within it. These changes documen...|$|E
40|$|All ants are {{generally}} classified as highly eusocial, However, {{there are some}} 100 species of ants belonging to the morphologically primitive subfamily Ponerinae, which lack a morphologically differentiated qu~n. One or {{a small number of}} mated workers (gamergates) function as queens, i. e. they produce male as well as female offspring. Such ant species are of great interest as they provide unique opportunities to understand the causes and consequences of <b>queenlessness.</b> This is the first report ofa long-term field study we have initiated on a large population of the queenless ponerine ant, Diacamma ceylonense Emery, {{on the campus of the}} Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Data are provided on the numbers of colonies present during a 213 -week period, from which the probable time of colonisation of the site by D. ceylonense is suggested. Twenty-six entire colonies were excavated to study the adult and brood composition. While some colonies did not appear to have a gamergate at the time of excavation, others had only one gamergate per colony. Only the gamergate was mated and had well developed ovaries, while all the workers were unmated and had undeveloped ovaries. Excavated colonies had an average of 230 adult females, 2 males and 80 items of brood. The gamergates were indistinguishable from their workers in body size but there was significant variation in the size of workers between colonies. On an average, colonies employe...|$|E
40|$|In cooperatively-breeding or eusocial societies, {{opportunities}} {{may arise}} for helper individuals to gain direct fitness by reproducing. However, {{the extent to}} which helpers respond differentially, in terms of their reproductive behaviour, to the probability that reproductive opportunities will arise is not fully known. In many eusocial Hymenoptera, workers lay eggs only in queenless conditions following the death of the queen or queens. Relative to polygyny (multiple queens per colony), monogyny (single queen per colony) increases the probability that queenless conditions arise. We therefore tested the hypothesis that ant workers respond differentially to queenless conditions {{as a function of the}} probability of <b>queenlessness.</b> We compared worker behaviour and reproduction before and after removal of queens from monogynous and polygynous colonies of the ant Leptothorax acervorum. We found that, in queenless conditions, workers from monogynous colonies were significantly more likely to lay eggs, showed a significantly reduced latency to egg-laying, and laid eggs at a significantly higher rate per capita, than workers from polygynous colonies. In addition, before queen removal, workers that laid eggs in queenless conditions across both monogynous and polygynous colonies performed a range of behaviours associated with reproduction at significantly higher rates compared to non-reproductive, control workers. These 'future reproductive' workers also significantly reduced their rates of brood care following queen removal. These findings show that workers under monogyny reproduce more readily in queenless conditions than workers under polygyny, and that would-be reproductive workers alter their behaviour before they experience the opportunity for future reproduction. They therefore suggest that workers adaptively modulate their reproductive behaviour as a function of the likelihood of opportunities for direct reproduction arising, and that workers' behaviour is affected by the ability to gain direct fitness even when reproduction is currently not occurring...|$|E
