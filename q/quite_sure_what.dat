500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated.

500|$|Michael's first centric {{episode in}} season two was less well received. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said [...] "it wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily {{integrated}} flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned. He did not like Michael's on-Island storyline either, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to make of these scenes". Three episodes later, Jensen thought Michael's [...] "whiny dad act" [...] became [...] "increasingly tedious". When Michael murdered Ana Lucia and Libby in [...] "Two for the Road", Slocum called it the [...] "single biggest shocker in Lost history". C. K. Sample of AOL's TV Squad wrote that although he suspected that Ana Lucia and Libby were going to die, he thought what [...] "was amazing was who shot them". Zap2it's Amy Amatangelo described the double murder as [...] "a brilliant move", because [...] "one of their own [...] one of them". She added it was [...] "one of [...] season's most jaw-dropping moments". According to Perrineau, it made fans [...] "pissed off" [...] with Michael. Jensen praised Perrineau's acting, saying [...] "Michael's bloody betrayal is hard to swallow, but Harold Perrineau sells it". Many reviewers joked about how frequently Michael shouts [...] "Walt!", such as Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad, and Joshua Rich of Entertainment Weekly. Perrineau co-won the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award for [...] "Best Ensemble - Drama Series.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} negative. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said the {{flashback}} storyline [...] "wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned, and also disliked Michael's on-Island storyline, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to make of these scenes". Jensen however complimented the Hatch scenes, considering that Terry O'Quinn's performance and his interaction with Henry Ian Cusick were [...] "salvaging the first mediocre episode of the season". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it thought that revealing the Hatch events through different perspectives a [...] "fresh narrative approach", but complained about the lack of plot advancement, and considered the raft storyline [...] "three times as long as needed, with a really fake shark attack to boot". IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, praising Perrineau's performance and the flashback, but the website later ranked [...] "Adrift" [...] 80th out of the 115 Lost episodes, jokingly saying that the shark should have eaten Michael [...] "and save us a lot of 'Waaaaaalt!' and 'They took him. From my hands!' shout fests". A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the fourth worst of the series, describing it as [...] "boring". New York magazine listed [...] "Adrift" [...] in its [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost", complaining about [...] "grinding the story to a halt" [...] and the [...] "plodding" [...] flashback, and saying that the episode would have been improved if Sawyer and Michael reached land faster.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2012, Gaga {{considered}} Artpop [...] "a {{bit more}} modern" [...] and mentioned {{the possibility of}} splitting the project into a two-volume record; the first would contain the [...] "commercial songs", while the second would feature the [...] "experimental material".

The following month, she mentioned an [...] "Act 2" [...] again, commenting {{that it might be}} released before her tour as [...] "it'll be nice to play both acts on the tour", and dismissed her previous ideas of splitting Artpop into two halves because [...] "this was during the inception of the record and I wasn't even <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> Artpop meant yet". In her keynote interview at SXSW, Gaga confirmed that Artpop could potentially have more than two acts, further stating that the second act of Artpop was complete but not ready for release.

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>what</b> to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
