40|$|A {{generalized}} modulation scheme, {{which includes}} {{minimum shift keying}} (MSK) and staggered <b>quadriphase</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (SQPSK) as special cases, is analyzed. The general modulator is realized as a one-input, two-output sequence transducer whose outputs select the carrier signal for each band. This form of the modulator has the practical advantage of not requiring any RF filtering {{since there is no}} actual mixing of the carriers with the modulating signals. It is shown that the optimum demodulator (whether hard-decision or soft-decision) always can make its decisions from the received waveform over two bands when the interference is additive white Gaussian noise, thus generalizing a well-known result for hard decision demodulation of MSK and SQPSK signals. The power spectra of MSK and SQPSK signals are derived to isolate the role played by coherency between the modulating signals and the carriers...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, various chaos based {{modulation}} schemes were evolved, {{of which}} the CS-DCSK modulation technique provides a better BER performance and bandwidth efficiency, due to its code domain approach[10]. The QCSK modulation technique provides double benefit, namely: higher data rate with similar BER performance and same bandwidth occupation as DCSK. By combining the advantage of code shifted differential chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (CS-DCSK) and Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QCSK) scheme, a novel CS-QCSK modulation scheme called code shifted Quadrature chaos <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> is proposed.

This flight design consists of a high-bandwidth, <b>Quadriphase</b> <b>Shift</b> <b>Keying</b> (QPSK) vector modulator with radiation-hardened, high-rate driver circuitry that receives I and Q channel data. The radiationhard design enables SDO fs Ka-band communications downlink system to transmit 130 Mbps (300 Msps after data encoding) of science instrument data to the ground system continuously throughout the mission fs minimum life of five years. The low error vector magnitude (EVM) of the modulator lowers the implementation loss of the transmitter in which it is used, thereby increasing the overall communication system link margin.
