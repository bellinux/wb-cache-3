Unless the imposition of a great van laden with from ten to twenty people on a single horse be a moderate tasking of the poor creature, then the temperate use of horses was immoderate and cruel. From the smallest and lightest horse to the largest and heaviest, there were many instances in which the beast of burden was so shamefully overladen, that the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have frequently interposed in less gross cases.|$|E
50|$|DNA {{microarray}} is {{a collection}} of spots attached to a solid support such as a microscope slide where each spot contains one or more single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide fragment. Arrays make it possible to put down large quantities of very small (100 micrometre diameter) spots on a single slide. Each spot has a DNA fragment molecule that is complementary to a single DNA sequence. A variation of this technique allows the gene expression of an organism at a particular stage in development to be <b>qualified</b> (<b>expression</b> profiling). In this technique the RNA in a tissue is isolated and converted to labeled cDNA. This cDNA is then hybridized to the fragments on the array and visualization of the hybridization can be done. Since multiple arrays can be made with exactly the same position of fragments they are particularly useful for comparing the gene expression of two different tissues, such as a healthy and cancerous tissue. Also, one can measure what genes are expressed and how that expression changes with time or with other factors. There are many different ways to fabricate microarrays; the most common are silicon chips, microscope slides with spots of ~100 micrometre diameter, custom arrays, and arrays with larger spots on porous membranes (macroarrays). There can be anywhere from 100 spots to more than 10,000 on a given array. Arrays can also be made with molecules other than DNA.|$|E

40|$|In two {{acoustic}} sentence recognition experiments {{the relative}} importance of recognition times (0 to 40 seconds) and relationships between the target sentence and test sentences were varied. Hungarian promised to be a good testing ground for traditional theories that claim that while form is readily forgotten, sentence meaning is preserved. In Hungarian, the informational structure of sentences allows for clear contrasts between neutral and meaning-related order variations. In the stimulus material, target sentences were compared in recognition scores with identical, neutral word order, paraphrased, and focused sentence pairs. The results partly support our starting hypotheses, but partly show that the intricacies of Hungarian sentential syntax call for a more reserved and more carefully <b>qualified</b> <b>expression</b> of the initial proposals of Sachs (1967) and Johnson-Laird and Stevenson (1970). Focused sentences are clearly contrasted with non-focused initial targets even after 40 seconds. It seems that the information structure of Hungarian sentences is somehow maintained in the long-term memory system. In accordance with the classical results, meaning-neutral word order variations are misrecognized in about 60 per cent after 16 seconds already. Contrary to our hypothesis, even after 40 seconds, paraphrases were correctly recognized more than 60 per cent of the time. Thus, to clarify memorial paraphrase equivalence to cross-linguistic validity, more types of sentential paraphrases should be compared. The study supports the main ideas underlying the experiments: the informational structure of the Hungarian sentence seems to be retained in long-term memory, unlike neutral word order variations. This finding calls for a more detailed study with more varied stimulus materials to clarify some further issues of what is ‘form’ and what is ‘meaning’ for the memory system. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the program transformation system Ultra. The intended use of Ultra is to assist programmers {{in the formal}} derivation of correct and efficient programs from high-level descriptive or operational specifications. Ultra supports equational reasoning about functional programs using defining equations, algebraic laws of underlying data structures, and transformation rules. The system does not only support modifying terms but is also useful for bookkeeping- and development-navigating tasks. The most salient features of Ultra are its sound theoretical foundation, its extendability, its flexible and convenient way to express transformation tasks, its comfortable user interface, and its lean and portable implementation. Ultra itself is written in the functional language Gofer. Program Transformation Writing correct and efficient programs in Ultra is divided in two phases. First an initial, maybe inefficient or even non-operational program is developed, of which correctness is easy to show. In the second phase, correctness preserving transformation rules are applied to transform the initial program into a semantically equivalent but more efficient version. In particular, Ultra {{can be used to}} develop operational algorithms from descriptive (non-operational) ones. The descriptive constructs that are supported are the <b>qualified</b> <b>expressions</b> forall, exists, some (select one element from many alternatives) and that (select a uniquely characterized element).

I {{speak of}} things that are to be: very assuredly they will be done, some day--not far off, by {{painters}} educated as gentlemen, in the strictest sense--working for love and truth, and not for lust and gold. Much has already been done by good and earnest draughtsmen, who yet had not received the higher painter's education, which would have enabled them to see the bird in the greater lights and laws of its form. It is only here and there, by Dürer, Holbein, Carpaccio, or other such men, that we get a living bird rightly drawn;[18] but we may be greatly thankful for the unspared labor, and attentive skill, with which many illustrations of ornithology have been produced within the last seventy or eighty years. Far beyond rivalship among them, stands Le Vaillant's monograph, or dualgraph, on the Birds of Paradise, and Jays: its plates, exquisitely engraved, and colored with unwearying care by hand, are insuperable in plume-texture, hue, and action,--spoiled in effect, unhappily, by the vulgar boughs for sustentation. Next, ranks the recently issued history of the birds of Lombardy; the lithographs by Herr Oscar Dressler, superb, but the coloring (chromo-lithotint) poor: and then, the self-taught, but in some qualities greatly to be respected, art of Mr. Gould. Of which, I would fain have spoken with gratitude and admiration in his lifetime; had not I known, that the <b>qualified</b> <b>expressions</b> necessary for true estimate of his published plates, would have caused him more pain, than any general praise could have counteracted or soothed.

Examining complex common names of different lexico-syntactic types(NN compounds, N+N syntagmas, NP/PP syntagmas, A+N syntagmas) and from different languages (particularly English, German and French) it can be shown that complex common names are subject to language- independent formal and semantic constraints.

6000|$|The two {{companies}} of players, {{after a long}} and expensive warfare, had now united their forces; on which occasion Dryden furnished them with a prologue, full of violent Tory principles. By this united company [...] "The Duke of Guise" [...] {{was performed on the}} 30th December 1682. It was printed with a dedication to Hyde, Earl of Rochester, subscribed by both authors, but evidently the work of Dryden. It is written in a tone of defiance to the Whig authors, who had assailed the dedicators, it alleges, [...] "like footpads in the dark," [...] though their blows had done little harm, and the objects of their malice yet lived to vindicate their loyalty in open day. The play itself has as determined a political character as the dedication. Besides the general parallel between the leaguers and the fanatical sectaries, and the more delicate, though not less striking, connection between the story of Guise and of Monmouth, there are other collateral allusions in the piece to the history of that unfortunate nobleman, and to the state of parties. The whole character of Marmoutiere, high-spirited, loyal, and exerting all her influence to deter Guise from the prosecution of his dangerous schemes, corresponds to that of Anne, Duchess of Monmouth.[35] The love too which the king professes to Marmoutiere, and which excites the jealousy of Guise, may bear a remote and delicate allusion to that partiality which the Duke of York is said to have entertained for the wife of his nephew.[36] The amiable colours in which Marmoutiere is painted, were due to the Duchess of Monmouth, Dryden's especial patroness. Another more obvious and more offensive parallel existed between the popular party in the city, with the Whig sheriffs at their head, and that of the Echevins, or sheriffs of Paris, violent demagogues and adherents to the League, and who, in the play, are treated with great contumely by Grillon and the royal guards. The tumults which had taken place at the election of these magistrates were warm in the recollection of the city; and the commitment of the ex-sheriffs, Shute and Pilkington, to the Tower, under pretext of a riot, was considered as the butt of the poet's satire. Under these impressions the Whigs made a violent opposition to the representation of the piece, even when the king gave it his personal countenance. And although, in despite of them, [...] "The Duke of Guise" [...] so far succeeded, as [...] "to be frequently acted, and never without a considerable attendance," [...] we may conclude from these <b>qualified</b> <b>expressions</b> of the author himself, that the play was never eminently popular.

40|$|The Phosphatase of Regenerating Liver (PRL) {{proteins}} promote {{cell signaling}} and are oncogenic when overexpressed. However, {{our understanding of}} PRL function came primarily from studies with cultured cell lines aberrantly or ectopically expressing PRLs. To define the physiological roles of the PRLs, we generated PRL 2 knock-out mice to {{study the effects of}} PRL deletion in a genetically controlled, organismal model. PRL 2 -deficient male mice exhibit testicular hypotrophy and impaired spermatogenesis, leading to decreased reproductive capacity. Mechanistically, PRL 2 deficiency results in elevated PTEN level in the testis, which attenuates the Kit-PI 3 K-Akt pathway, resulting in increased germ cell apoptosis. Conversely, increased PRL 2 expression in GC- 1 cells reduces PTEN level and promotes Akt activation. Our analyses of PRL 2 -deficient animals suggest that PRL 2 is required for spermatogenesis during testis development. The study also reveals that PRL 2 promotes Kit-mediated PI 3 K/Akt signaling by reducing the level of PTEN that normally antagonizes the pathway. Given the strong cancer susceptibility to subtle variations in PTEN level, the ability of PRL 2 to repress PTEN <b>expression</b> <b>qualifies</b> it as an oncogene and a novel target for developing anti-cancer agents...|$|R

40|$|Mouse {{embryonic}} stem cells (mESCs) can be maintained in a proliferative and undifferentiated state over many passages (self-renewal) while retaining the potential to give rise to every cell type of the organism (pluripotency).

Recent findings on serum-free culture conditions with specific inhibitors (known as 2 i) demonstrate that the inhibition of this pathway reduces transcription factor heterogeneity and is vital to maintain ground state pluripotency of mESCs. We suggest a novel mathematical model to explicitly integrate FGF 4 /Erk signalling into an interaction network of key pluripotency factors (namely Oct 4, Sox 2, Nanog and Rex 1). The envisaged model allows to explore whether and how proposed mechanisms and feedback regulations can account for different expression patterns in mESC cultures. We demonstrate that an FGF 4 /Erk-mediated negative feedback is sufficient to induce molecular heterogeneity with respect to Nanog and Rex 1 expression and thus critically regulates the propensity for differentiation and the loss of pluripotency. Furthermore, we compare simulation results on the transcription factor dynamics in different self-renewing states and during differentiation with experimental data on a Rex 1 GFPd 2 reporter cell line using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR measurements. Concluding from our results we argue that interaction between FGF 4 /Erk signalling and Nanog <b>expression</b> <b>qualifies</b> as a key mechanism to manipulate mESC pluripotency. In particular, we infer that ground state pluripotency under 2 i is achieved by shifting stable expressio...|$|R
40|$|Background/purposeGene {{expression}} profiles of liver regeneration are well explored in rat models. However, there are limited relative data in humans. This study aimed {{to show that}} mRNA {{expression profiles}} change immediately after right hepatectomy in living-related donors and correlate with mechanisms of liver regeneration reported in the literature. MethodsProspective study was conducted from March 2003 to August 2004. Living-related donors who donated right lobe of liver were included. Liver biopsies were performed at the beginning and, 5 hours later, {{at the end of}} liver resection. RNAs were isolated to synthesize cRNA. Oligo DNA microarray experiments were conducted and paired signal intensity ratios (Cy 3 /Cy 5) were normalized with rank-invariant global Lowess regression analysis by taking base two logarithms. Genes whose average residuals more than 2. 5 -fold increased or less than − 2. 5 -fold decreased were selected to get the most pronounced expression changes during this period. ResultsFive of 34 donors were included with <b>qualified</b> samples. The <b>expression</b> patterns of paired DNA microarray experiments were similar in five donors. A total of 28 upregulated and 14 downregulated genes were collected. Acute-phase proteins (serum amyloid A, complement-reactive protein, heme oxygenase- 1) were up-regulated. Genes related to growth signal transduction (G-protein coupled receptor- 30) were downregulated. ConclusionGene expression profiles immediately after partial hepatectomy were reported first in humans with the techniques of oligo DNA microarray, which were compatible with the initial gene expression patterns of liver regeneration in rats.
