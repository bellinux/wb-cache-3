25|$|Science and {{technology}} can totally liberate humanity {{not only from}} the problem of hunger in the world, but also from the obligation to work to live, since machines can <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> look after the daily chores by themselves thanks to automation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{generally}} legislation requiring {{that the odds}} in gaming devices are statistically random, to prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible. Since these high-payoffs have very low probability, a house bias can <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> be missed unless the odds are checked carefully.|$|E
25|$|Manganese dioxide can {{slightly}} stain {{human skin}} {{if it is}} damp or in a heterogeneous mixture, but the stains can be washed off <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> with some rubbing. When dry avoid breathing in fine particles by wearing a simple medical mask or such to avoid damage to lungs.|$|E

25|$|If {{the base}} b equals e, then the {{derivative}} is simply 1/x, and at x=1 this derivative equals 1. Another {{sense in which}} the base-e-logarithm is the most natural {{is that it can}} be defined <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> in terms of a simple integral or Taylor series and this is not true of other logarithms.|$|E
25|$|Prior to British colonisation, Taunggyi was a {{small village}} of a few huts. The area lay on a wide {{shoulder}} of the Sittaung Hills of the Shan Hills and was populated by the Shan people at the time. The signs of the original village of Taunggyi are long gone, but nearby villages can still be discerned <b>quite</b> <b>easily.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crusniks possess unique {{attributes}} that separate them from Methuselahs. For instance, both Abel and Cain sport angelic wings and can fly <b>quite</b> <b>easily.</b> Crusniks can transmute their blood into weapons and often possess psychokinetic powers. Abel can generate powerful bio-electric fields while Cain can use psychokinetic waves to pulverize objects and enemies and to generate barriers. Seth can reduce people and objects to dust using sound waves.|$|E
6000|$|... 25-36. We readily {{accept and}} {{understand}} the personification of Jest, Jollity, Sport, Laughter, and Liberty, but the plurals, Quips, Cranks, Wiles, Nods, Becks, Smiles, we do not manage <b>quite</b> so <b>easily,</b> especially {{in view of the}} couplet 29-30.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> done as that" [...] remarked Paul, with a laugh; [...] "but I {{happen to}} know {{something}} about skinning birds and beasts, Olly, so make your mind easy. I will show you how to do it." ...|$|R

25|$|Alpha can {{be stopped}} <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> {{by a few}} {{centimetres}} in air {{or a piece of}} paper and is equivalent to a helium nucleus. Beta can be cut off by an aluminium sheet just a few millimetres thick and are electrons. Gamma is the most penetrating of the three and is a massless chargeless high energy photon. Gamma radiation requires an appreciable amount of heavy metal radiation shielding (usually lead or barium-based) to reduce its intensity.|$|E
25|$|On November 17, the Senate {{approved}} the constitutional reform {{in its final}} instance; Northern League leader Umberto Bossi attended the discussion and the voting, returning to the Parliament, even if just as spectator, after his illness. During the vote, Domenico Fisichella announced {{his opposition to the}} reform, and his immediate resignation from the party, going against the party line about the issue. Italian MPs <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> change party and even coalition: in the legislature between 1996 and 2001 15% of MPs did so.|$|E
25|$|A general {{economic}} {{idea is that}} if {{sales taxes}} are high enough, people start engaging in widespread tax evading activity (like buying over the Internet, {{pretending to be a}} business, buying at wholesale, buying products through an employer etc.). On the other hand, total VAT rates can rise above 10% without widespread evasion because of the novel collection mechanism. However, because of its particular mechanism of collection, VAT becomes <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> the target of specific frauds like carousel fraud, which can be very expensive in terms of loss of tax incomes for states.|$|E
60|$|Watching {{for another}} {{lull in the}} blast, the hermit at last gave the order, and round they came as before, head to wind, but not <b>quite</b> so <b>easily,</b> and Nigel {{felt that they had}} {{narrowly}} escaped overturning in the operation.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{relative}} {{simplicity of the}} classifications above, {{in the real world}} languages do not fit <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> into such precise categories. Languages exhibit degrees of durational variability both in relation to other languages and to other standards of the same language.|$|R
6000|$|... "The letter shall {{certainly}} be burnt, {{if you believe}} it essential {{to the preservation of}} my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> changed as that implies." ...|$|R
25|$|The Crimean War began, and Sir Charles Napier {{demanded of}} the Admiralty 120 gunboats, each with engines of 60 horsepower, for the {{campaign}} of 1855 in the Baltic. There were just ninety days in which to meet this requisition, and, short as the time was, {{the building of the}} gunboats presented no difficulty. It was otherwise however with the engines, and the Admiralty were in despair. Suddenly, by a flash of the mechanical genius which was inherent in him, the late Mr John Penn solved the difficulty, and solved it <b>quite</b> <b>easily.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} war came to an end, it seemed highly likely that {{cooperation}} between the Western powers and the USSR would give way to intense rivalry or conflict. This was due primarily to the starkly contrasting economic ideologies of the two superpowers, now <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> the strongest in the world. Whereas the USA was a liberal, two-party democracy with an advanced capitalist economy, based on free enterprise and profit-making, the USSR was a one-party Marxist–Leninist State with a state-controlled economy where private wealth was all but outlawed.|$|E
25|$|Cassette {{playback}} {{suffered from}} some flaws frustrating to both professionals and home recording enthusiasts. Tape speed could vary between devices, resulting in pitch {{that was too}} low or too high. Speed often was calibrated at the factory, {{and could not be}} changed by users. The slow tape speed increased tape hiss and noise, and in practice delivered higher values of wow and flutter. Different tape formulation and noise reduction schemes artificially boosted or cut high frequencies and inadvertently elevated noise levels. Noise reduction also adds some artifacts to the sound, which a trained ear can hear sometimes <b>quite</b> <b>easily.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a bit, Burger," [...] said Kennedy, laying {{his hand}} upon the other's arm; [...] "I am very keen upon this catacomb business, and I can't {{let it drop}} <b>quite</b> so <b>easily.</b> Would you mind asking me {{something}} else in return--something not quite so eccentric this time?" ...|$|R
60|$|Vaguely {{he thought}} of flight, but Mme. de Pompadour would not let him off <b>quite</b> so <b>easily.</b> With her own jewelled hand she pushed aside the curtain which masked the doorway, and with a nod of her dainty head she hinted to Gaston {{to walk into the}} boudoir.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{have been}} {{disposed}} to underrate {{the force of}} sexual jealousy.... I thought it was something essentially contemptible, something that one dismissed and put behind oneself in the mere effort to be aristocratic, but I begin {{to realize that it}} is not <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> settled with....|$|R
25|$|One of his {{trademarks}} {{was the use}} of {{two different}} bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt to play this delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only to be surprised by the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many more struck painful blows, by Roberts using this ploy.|$|E
25|$|Males may <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> {{underestimate}} {{the size of}} their own penis relative to that of others, because of the foreshortening obtained from looking down, due to repeated observation of atypical penises in pornography, or because of the accumulation of fat {{at the base of the}} penis. A survey by sexologists showed that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises. Another study found sex education of standard penile measurements to be helpful and relieving for patients concerned about small penis size, most of whom had incorrect beliefs of what is considered medically normal. The perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem.|$|E
25|$|Quantification of {{sequence}} alignments may {{be performed}} at the gene, exon, or transcript level. Typical outputs include a table of reads counts for each feature supplied to the software, for example for genes in a general feature format file. Gene and exon read counts may be calculated <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> using HTSeq, for example. Quantitation at the transcript level is more complicated and requires probabilistic methods to estimate transcript isoform abundance from short read information, for example, using cufflinks software. Reads that align equally well to multiple locations must be identified and either removed, aligned {{to one of the}} possible locations, or aligned to the most probable location.|$|E
60|$|At {{first it}} seemed as if the {{stranger}} meant to beat a precipitate and none too dignified retreat now that the adoring eyes of Lady Sue were no longer upon him. But Mistress de Chavasse had no intention of allowing him to extricate himself <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> from an unpleasant position.|$|R
60|$|But why are deserts rocky and sandy? Why aren't they covered, {{like the}} rest of the world, with earth, soil, mould, or dust? One can see plainly enough why there should be little or no {{vegetation}} where no rain falls, but one can't see <b>quite</b> so <b>easily</b> why there should be only sand and rock instead of arid clay-field.|$|R
50|$|Serious {{side effects}} include rash, diarrhea, and arthritis. The side effects are more severe in women and young children. The overall effects are <b>quite</b> mild and <b>easily</b> reversed.|$|R
25|$|Income {{is one of}} a household's {{attributes}} {{most commonly}} used to determine its class status. Yet, income may not always accurately reflect a household's position within society or the economy. Unlike personal income, household income does not reflect occupational achievement as much as it measures the number of income earners. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert acknowledges that a working-class household with two income earners may out-earn a single-income upper-middle-class household, as the number of income earners has evolved {{into one of the most}} important variables in determining household income. For example, according to the US Department of Labor, two registered nurses could <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> command a household income of $126,000 in 2006, while the median income for a lawyer was $94,930.|$|E
25|$|In April, she competed at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix. Making it to {{the semifinals}} she faced Agnieszka Radwańska and won comfortably in {{straight}} sets. This win meant she had beaten Radwańska in all five matches against her this year. Azarenka would then face world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in the final where she fell in straight sets. Azarenka then competed at the 2012 Mutua Madrid Open. She made {{it to the}} finals but was beaten easily in by Serena Williams in straight sets. The result gave Azarenka only her 3rd defeat of the year. Azarenka's next tournament was the 2012 Internazionali BNL d'Italia, she advanced to the third round <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> but then withdrew from the tournament, due to a right shoulder strain, and avoided a third round clash with Dominika Cibulková.|$|E
25|$|The Championship season {{started again}} on 8 July, and Lancashire carried their winning ways from the Twenty20 Cup into this tournament, as they beat Durham by an innings and 228 runs to go {{second in the}} table, 11 points behind Durham. They {{followed}} that up with quarter-final wins in the Twenty20 Cup and C Trophy, before suffering their first loss of July with an eight-wicket League defeat to later champions Essex Eagles. The East Anglians stayed for a County Championship match, where 1100-odd runs were scored {{for the loss of}} eleven wickets in a draw. In the last week-end of July, Lancashire travelled to The Oval for the Twenty20 Cup finals day, where they beat Surrey <b>quite</b> <b>easily</b> in the semi-final but crashed to a seven-wicket defeat in the final at the hands of Somerset Sabres.|$|E
50|$|Intolerant to benomyl, L. hoffmannii {{is capable}} of {{proteolytic}} activity (hydrolysis, in particular), with proteolytic enzymes detected in cultures of L. hoffmannii with various media, including Loeffler blood serum, and skim milk and Litmus milk. Lecythophora hoffmannii is also <b>quite</b> thermotolerant, <b>easily</b> growing at 30 and 35 °C, with two out of four isolates (both environmental) growing at 40 °C.|$|R
