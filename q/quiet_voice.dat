5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a <b>quiet</b> <b>voice</b> but {{can develop}} a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure in Pink Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|Journalist author Bob Woodward in {{his book}} on the CIA reports his meeting with Helms in 1980. Apparently the edginess of Helms was not nervousness, but {{indicated}} an exquisite awareness of his surroundings, wrote the investigative reporter. In 1989 Woodward called Helms [...] "one of the enduring symbols, controversies and legends of the CIA". Kissinger observed that Helms [...] "was tempered by many battles" [...] and [...] "was strong as he was wary." [...] Urbane and tenacious, [...] "his smile did not always include his eyes." [...] Former CIA official Victor Marchetti admired Helms for his office foresight, noting [...] "that not {{a single piece of}} paper existed in the agency which linked Helms to... the Bay of Pigs." [...] Intelligence author Keith Melton describes Helms as a professional, always impeccably dressed, with a 'low tolerance for fools'; an elusive man, laconic and reserved. About Helms author Edward Jay Epstein writes, [...] "I found him to be an elegant man with a <b>quiet</b> <b>voice,</b> who could come right to the point." ...|$|E
