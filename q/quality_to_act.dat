40|$|Design {{optimisation}} of compressor {{systems is}} a computationally expensive problem {{due to the}} large number of variables, complicated design space and expense of the analysis tools. One approach to reduce the expense of the process and make it achievable in industrial timescales is to employ multi-fidelity techniques, which utilise more rapid tools in conjunction with the highest fidelity analyses. The complexity of the compressor design landscape is such that the starting point for these optimisations can influence the achievable results; these starting points are often existing (optimised) compressor designs, which form a limited set in terms of both quantity and diversity of the design. To facilitate the multi-fidelity optimisation procedure, a compressor synthesis code was developed which allowed the performance attributes (e. g. stage loadings, inlet conditions) to be stipulated, enabling the generation of a variety of compressors covering a range of both design topology and <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as seeding geometries for the optimisation procedures. Analysis of the performance of the multi-fidelity optimisation system when restricting its exploration space to topologically different areas of the design space indicated little advantage over allowing the system to search the design space itself. However, comparing results from optimisations started from seed designs with different aerodynamic qualites indicated an improved performance could be achieved by starting an optimisation from a higher quality point, and thus that the choice of starting point did affect the final outcome of the optimisations. Both investigations indicated that the performance gains through the optimisation were largely defined by the early exploration of the design space where the multi-fidelity speedup could be exploited, thus extending this region is likely to have the greatest effect on performance of the optimisation system...|$|E

I use data from the Rochester Youth Development Study and its intergenerational companion, the Rochester Intergenerational Study. Several findings emerged. First, there is evidence of intergeneration continuity, but this continuity is limited to child delinquency. In addition, when testing for the moderation of intergenerational continuity, none of the parent-partner relationship measures act as moderators.

40|$|This report {{considers}} the research, analysis {{and development of}} an alternative process for controlling end-user electrical power quality, as well as reflected load modulation and transients on the incoming electricity supply grid. In the past, power quality issues associated with the grid network, were usually generated by the connected loads, this has changed in today’s grid system with embedded intermittent renewable energy being included on the energy profile. The intermittency of the added input is being smoothed by the large scale generation on the network. A high level of renewable penetration {{is said to have}} been reached when additional effort is required to optimise PV integration. The analysis is built on the assumption that the electrical supply grid will continue to play a vital role in supplying electrical energy to industry and domestic customers for the foreseeable future. A report released in 2009 by the Australian Federal Government in Smart Grid Technologies recognised that through a communications network the consumer could play a vital role in maintaining power quality, offsetting peak loading and integrating embedded power generation. The concept of Switched Intelligent Grid Networking Systems (SIGNS) to control end-user electrical power <b>quality</b> is <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as an intelligent buffer between the electrical grid supply and the load to select the most appropriate energy source. In addition SIGNS could effectively absorb a proportion of any surges and transients, at the same time as offering a path for augmented alternative energy.

In this system energy, like water, is collected over a period of time, stored and then used as required, allowing the storage medium to absorb peaks and surges in power.

It {{has been said that}} she was pleasing to the eye, but her beauty was of a kind that depended more on expression, on a union of character with feminine grace, than on the vulgar lines of regularity and symmetry. While she had no feature that was defective, she had none that was absolutely faultless, though all were combined with so much harmony and the soft expression of the mild blue eye accorded so well with the gentle play of a sweet mouth, that the soul of their owner seemed ready at all times to appear through these ingenuous tell-tales of her thoughts. Still, maidenly reserve sate in constant watch over all, and it was when the spectator thought himself most in communion with her spirit, that he most felt its pure and correcting influence. Perhaps a cast of high intelligence, of a natural power to discriminate, which much surpassed the limited means accorded to females of that age, contributed their share to hold those near her in respect, and served in some degree as a mild and wise repellant, to counteract the attractions of her gentleness and candor. In short, one cast unexpectedly in her society would not have been slow to infer, and he would have decided correctly, that Adelheid de Willading was a girl of warm and tender affections, of a playful but regulated fancy, of a firm and lofty sense of all her duties, whether natural or merely the result of social obligations, of melting pity, and yet of a habit and <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> think and <b>act</b> for herself, in all those cases in which it was fitting for a maiden of her condition and years to assume such self-control.|$|R
