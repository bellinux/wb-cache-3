John Ford's The Fugitive (1947) and Fort Apache (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950); all four were co-productions between RKO and Argosy Pictures, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. Of the directors under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler's Children (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget placing it in the bottom <b>quartile</b> of Big Five studio productions, {{it was one of}} the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year.

25|$|Modern {{pharmaceutical}} {{therapy has}} resulted in an overall reduction in hypertension, particularly in countries with high GDP per capita. A review of blood pressure statistics before these pharmaceuticals were available shows a coherent correlation between {{high blood pressure and}} higher latitude. Seasons of the year also impact high blood pressure; BP is lower in the summer months in high latitudes {{than it is in the}} winter, when there is less sunlight. Individuals with more sun exposure synthesize more active vitamin D (1,25 di-hydroxy cholecalciferol) from diet or ultraviolet radiation exposure. A combination of lower ultraviolet radiation with insufficient vitamin D in a diet leads to vitamin D deficiency.

Others have shown that CRP can exacerbate ischemic necrosis in a complement-dependent fashion and that CRP inhibition can be a safe and effective therapy for myocardial and cerebral infarcts; so far, this has been demonstrated in animal models only.|$|E

The aim of this study was to {{determine}} the relationship between cord concentrations of vitamin A and neonatal anthropometry in 711 babies born at term in Brazil. Gestational age of the babies was evaluated by the Capurro method. Vitamin A was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of vitamin A in cord blood correlated significantly (p < 0. 001) with birthweight (r = 0. 24), length (r = 0. 20), chest circumference (r = 0. 24), mid-upper arm circumference (r = 0. 23), triceps skinfold thickness (r = 0. 26), and head circumference (r = 0. 12) of the babies. The anthropometric measurements of the babies were sorted by the vitamin A concentrations (means and standard deviations) and divided into <b>quartiles.</b> Differences between the <b>quartiles</b> were tested by analysis of variance. Babies in the bottom length, head circumference and triceps skinfold thickness <b>quartiles</b> had lower mean vitamin A concentrations than those of <b>quartiles</b> two, three and four.

25|$|While folate is most {{well known}} for {{preventing}} neural tube nonclosure (the basis for its addition to prenatal vitamins), folate and choline metabolism are interrelated. Both choline and folate (with the help of vitamin B12) can act as methyl donors to homocysteine to form methionine, which can {{then go on to}} form SAM (S-Adenosyl methionine) and act as a methyl donor for methylation of DNA. Dietary choline deficiency alone without concurrent folate deficiency can decrease SAM concentration, suggesting that both folate and choline are important sources of methyl groups for SAM production. Inhibition of choline absorption and use is associated with neural-tube defects in mice, and this may also occur in humans. A retrospective case control study (a study that collects data after the fact, from cases occurring without the investigator causing them to occur) of 400 cases and 400 controls indicated that women with the lowest daily choline intake had a four-fold greater risk of having a child with a neural-tube defect than women in the highest <b>quartile</b> of intake.|$|E

40|$|Background-The {{contribution}} of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) to {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) risk stratification over and above high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is unclear. We studied the associations between plasma levels of HDL-C and apoA-I, either alone or combined, with risk of CHD events and cardiovascular risk factors among apparently healthy men and women. Methods and Results-HDL-C and apoA-I levels were measured among 17 661 participants of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer) -Norfolk prospective population study. Hazard ratios for CHD events and distributions of risk factors were calculated by <b>quartiles</b> of HDL-C and apoA-I. Results were validated {{using data from the}} ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) and WHS (Women's Health Study) cohorts, comprising 15 494 and 27 552 individuals, respectively. In EPIC-Norfolk, both HDL-C and apoA-I <b>quartiles</b> were strongly and inversely associated with CHD risk. Within HDL-C <b>quartiles,</b> higher apoA-I levels were not associated with lower CHD risk; in fact, CHD risk was higher within some HDL-C <b>quartiles.</b> ApoA-I levels were associated with higher levels of CHD risk factors: higher body mass index, HbA 1 c, non-HDL-C, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, systolic blood pressure, and Creactive protein, within fixed HDL-C <b>quartiles.</b> In contrast, HDL-C levels were consistently inversely associated with overall CHD risk and CHD risk factors within apoA-I <b>quartiles</b> (P < 0. 001). These findings were validated in the ARIC and WHS cohorts. Conclusions-Our findings demonstrate that apoA-I levels do not offer predictive information over and above HDL-C. In fact, within some HDL-C <b>quartiles,</b> higher apoA-I levels were associated with higher risk of CHD events, possibly because of the unexpected higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in association with higher apoA-I level...|$|R
