25|$|In 1994, {{the mayor}} of Conteville in Normandy, André Dubreuil, noted that during land {{rehabilitation}} of the old quarry of Pierre de Caen, dinosaur bones had surfaced. He secured a partial skull and some ribs and notified the Paris Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle. However, professional excavations only started in 1998 when the rock of the collapsed <b>quarry</b> <b>face</b> had already been spread by a bulldozer over a considerable surface. It proved necessary to dig up and sieve many cubic metres of rubble over several years, ultimately salvaging about two thousand bone fragments, varying in size between one and ten centimetres. From these scraps a more complete skeleton had to be reassembled.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{within the}} grounds of Slane Castle (demesne) are the ruins of St. Erc's Hermitage. This {{consists}} of a late 15 to 16th century chapel, an earlier dwelling, a stone arched footbridge over a stream/tributary that feeds into the Boyne and the stone <b>quarry</b> <b>face</b> from where the materials for construction were taken. Local folklore has it that during the 19th century move of the apostle's stone, a stone carving of the crucifixion of Christ, which was taken from this chapel {{to be placed in}} the modern church in the village, the 200 kg stone carving was to mysteriously find its way back to the Hermitage in the still dead of night. A portion of a celtic cross carving, that was also initially part of St. Erc's Hermitage is now housed in an Iron frame beside the altar within St.Patrick's Church on chapel street. A catholic church built c.1805. [...] Not {{to be confused with the}} similarly named Saint Patrick's Church of Ireland, on main street, built 1797 [...] "M.DCC.XCVII." ...|$|E

2500|$|Near the Scar House dam site, {{a network}} of sidings were constructed, zig-zagging down to the Nidd, and back up {{the other side of}} the valley. A double track {{self-acting}} incline provided access to the Carle Fell Quarry, to the north of the reservoir, and as the quarry was worked, two further inclines were constructed. One was single track, with a winding engine at the top, and around 1930, an incline worked by locomotives was added. Above the later <b>quarry</b> <b>face,</b> a Simplex petrol locomotive worked on a [...] track, removing overburden. Hydro-electric power for the works was generated using water from Angram reservoir, which was discharged into Haden Carr reservoir. A [...] pipeline supplied the turbines. This was later supplemented by a steam generating station. Two locomotive sheds were built, one near the village and another on the north side of the River Nidd, with a further two at Carle Fell Quarry. All had two tracks. Twelve four-wheeled carriages were bought from the Maryport and Carlisle Railway, to provide transport for the workers and their families from Scar House to Lofthouse, and a two-track carriage shed was built to the east of the main complex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Stone {{quarrying}} activities always {{result in}} a severe damage to the environment, vegetation and landscape. Revegetation for quarries, especially for <b>quarried</b> <b>faces,</b> however, is always a very thorny thing, and even a world-class difficult problem, which is still resolved unsuccessfully so far. The main reasons resulting in extreme difficulty for revegetation of <b>quarried</b> <b>faces</b> are because: 1) the surface is very glossy, and {{there is almost no}} any soil or loose substrate on it; 2) they are all quite steep, usually up to 70 – 80 °, and even perpendicular to the ground; and 3) most of them are quite high, often up to dozens of meters and even up to over 100 m and therefore, are extremely difficult to carry out construction. Since 1999, the vetiver technique has been used to restore quarries in China. Through years of research and exploration, a complex yet innovative vetiver technique eventually emerged. Combining the traditional vetiver technique with special cement concrete troughs and construction methods, the new technique successfully solves the problem of <b>quarried</b> <b>face</b> revegetation. Like the traditional vetiver technique, the new one aims to establish a permanent, stable ecological system on the <b>quarried</b> <b>face</b> taking vetiver’s excellent slope stabilizing property and collaborating with the excellent ecological characteristics of other strongly adaptive species. Its core mechanisms are: 1) special troughs made from armored concrete and particular construction technique; 2) hedgerows formed mainly by vetiver and established on the troughs...|$|R

50|$|The William Ogburn House is a {{historic}} ruin located north of East Peru, Iowa, United States. This 1½-story limestone structure is an early example of a vernacular farm house, and the only known saltbox residence known to exist in Madison County. It is attributed to David Harris who used innovative design variations that were not used by other local masons. The stone of the main facade is composed of finished cut <b>quarry</b> <b>faced</b> stone laid two against one with broken bond within courses. The other elevations are composed of rubble limestone. It also features quoins and jambs of finished cut <b>quarry</b> <b>faced</b> stone. The house suffered a fire so only the stone walls remain.
