5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In , the Pentateuch {{says that the}} Jews demanded meat while {{traveling}} in the desert; God sent <b>quail</b> {{in response to the}} complaints, and people ate large quantities of <b>quail</b> meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming <b>quail</b> was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main <b>quail</b> genus). Migrating <b>quail</b> consume large amounts of hemlock, a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the <b>quail</b> egg industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to {{the complete loss of}} <b>quail</b> lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated <b>quail</b> were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese <b>quail</b> farming industries. Japanese <b>quail</b> are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies. These <b>quail</b> are closely related to the common <b>quail,</b> and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>quail</b> is a {{small to}} medium-sized, cryptically {{coloured}} bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the <b>quail</b> was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long {{before the arrival of}} chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common <b>quail</b> (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese <b>quail</b> (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.|$|E
40|$|TYR (Tyrosinase) and TYRP 1 (Tyrosinase-related protein 1) play crucial {{roles in}} {{determining}} the coat color of birds. In this paper, we aimed to characterize the relationship of TYR and TYRP 1 genes with plumage colors in Korean <b>quails.</b> The SNPs were searched by cDNA sequencing and PCR-SSCP in three plumage color Korean <b>quails</b> (maroon, white and black plumage).

40|$|Newcastle disease virus (NDV) {{caused an}} {{outbreak}} among commercial broiler chickens {{in the educational}} farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Assiut University-Egypt. Its velogenicty was characterized by Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) of 1. 65. The outbreak raised concerns regarding the role of <b>quails</b> as a neighboring bird to the broiler chickens in the affected farm in transmission of this virus to chickens. 35 days old <b>quails</b> were infected oculo-nasal with velogenic strain of Newcastle disease virus accompanied with chickens were in contact with these infected <b>quails</b> to determine the role of <b>quails</b> in the epidemiology of ND infection. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies were measured for assessment of antibody response as well as oro-pharynx swabs were used for detection of the virus shedding. The susceptibility of <b>quails</b> to NDV infection was more resistant than that were observed in chickens. 6. 6 - 13. 3 % of challenged non-vaccinated <b>quails</b> were died in contrast to 80 - 100 % mortality in experimentally infected chickens {{till the end of}} experiment 3 weeks after challenge. Up to 13. 3 % of infected <b>quails</b> exhibited general clinical signs in contrast to 100 % of non vaccinated chickens shown clinical signs were primarily respiratory. Infected <b>quails</b> could excrete infectious virus from the oro-pharynx for a shorter period than that observed with infected in-contact chickens in special to the vaccinated groups the shedding was reduced significantly either in <b>quails</b> and chickens. The results confirmed that some of the naturally occurring NDV virulent strains can cause the disease in <b>quails</b> but in a mild form, and that <b>quails</b> {{play an important role in}} the epidemiology of ND and its transmission to chickens causing heavy economic losses. These results under- score the need to develop new vaccine strategies for use in <b>quails</b> to protect birds from both disease and infection to reduce virus shedding and its spreading...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to evaluate certain egg quality characteristics of ISA Brown laying hens and Japanese <b>quails</b> (Coturnix coturnix japonica) {{in relation to their}} age. One hundred forty-four brown-egg ISA Brown laying hens and one hundred female <b>quails</b> were used in the study. A total of 1, 678 eggs of laying hens and 2, 060 eggs of Japanese <b>quails</b> were used during the experiment. The eggs for technological values were collected during two consecutive days in a 4 -week period when the laying hens were from 20 to 60 weeks of age and the <b>quails</b> were from nine to 49 weeks of age. The results show that egg weight was affected by the age of the hens and <b>quails</b> (overall means 61. 13 g and 12. 52 g, respectively). Despite frequens fluctuations, as the age of the laying hens and <b>quails</b> increased, the yolk index and yolk proportion increased as well, while the albumen index, eggshell strength and shell thickness decreased. The increasing age of the hens also led to a decrease in egg shape index and eggshell proportion, but these parameters increased in the <b>quails.</b> A significantly higher proportion of albumen was found in the hens than in the <b>quails,</b> but of worse quality than in the <b>quails</b> as expressed by Haugh units score. The egg from ISA Brown hens had a darker yolk color than those from Japanese <b>quails</b> (5. 90 vs. 4. 87 in the La Roche scale) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} carried out in Japanese <b>quails</b> Coturnix coturnix japonica and {{chickens}} (Rhode Island Red) for comparative haematological and biochemical changes occurring due to Ascaridia galli infection. <b>Quails</b> as well as chickens were divided into four small groups, each consisting six numbers of birds in each group and were marked as q 1, q 2, q 3, qC and p 1, p 2, p 3, pC, respectively. Haematological study showed that the total erythrocytic count (TEC), packed cell volume (PCV) and haemoglobin (Hb) percentage decreased significantly in infected groups of <b>quails</b> and chickens. The total leucocytic count (TLC) showed significant increase in infected groups of <b>quails</b> and chickens. Heterophils and eosinophils were increased significantly in all the infected groups of <b>quails</b> and chickens. Lymphocytes decreased significantly in all the infected groups. Biochemical study showed that total serum protein decreased significantly in the infected groups of <b>quails</b> and chickens.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the clinical signs, gross and histopathological findings of the <b>quails</b> experimentally inoculated with Avian Influenza A virus H 7 N 1 subtype. Two groups of 6 -day-old, ninety <b>quails</b> (45 <b>quails</b> were inoculated, 45 <b>quails</b> were kept as control) (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were used. Avian Influenza A virus H 7 N 1 subtype was inoculated intra nasally into the experimental group of the <b>quails.</b> Decrease in feed and water consumption, calmness, reluctance, and diarrhea were observed as clinical symptoms after the 15 days after of inoculation. Pathologically, mild inflammation with congestion and haemorrhage in the respiratory tract and intestines, degenerative and necrotic changes in the liver and heart, and non suppurative meningoencephalitis were observed. In conclusion, H 7 N 1 of AIV subtype caused a mild form of the disease in <b>quails.</b> The clinical signs and pathological findings were not specific for the diagnosis of the disease. The results of the present study suggest that the cases with the symptoms written above should be taken into consideration of possibility of AI in <b>quails...</b>|$|R

Wild turkeys and raptors such as Cooper's hawks, golden eagles, bald eagles, and prairie falcons are also common. A few species migrate to the peak in the winter, including ruby-crowned kinglets, yellow-rumped warblers, and golden-crowned sparrows. Mammals that inhabit the mountain include black-tailed deer, cougars, bobcats, skunks, raccoons, coyotes, bears, weasels, and squirrels. A large herd of Roosevelt elk frequent the peak's western foothills. The herd swelled to over 100 individuals in the mid-2000s, causing traffic problems and severe damage to local pear orchards, but shrank to about 40 members by 2009 after an Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife relocation effort.
