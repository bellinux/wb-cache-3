Cohen, a Greenwich hedge fund manager, then donated the work to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

A [...] "General Question Time" [...] takes place on a Thursday between 11:40a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to {{any member of the}} Scottish Government. At 2:30pm, a 40-minute-long themed [...] "Question Time" [...] takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a [...] "lead-in" [...] to the questioner, who then uses their supplementary <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the First Minister a question on any issue. The five general questions available to opposition leaders are: ...|$|E

Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. She laughs and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E
2500|$|So {{the natural}} <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about linear {{operators}} {{that are not}} everywhere-defined is whether they are closable. [...] The answer is, [...] "not necessarily"; indeed, every infinite-dimensional normed space admits linear operators that are not closable. As {{in the case of}} discontinuous operators considered above, the proof requires the axiom of choice and so is in general nonconstructive, though again, if X is not complete, there are constructible examples.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that the James–Stein estimator dominates the usual estimator for any ν. [...] A natural <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is whether the improvement over the usual estimator is independent of the choice of ν. [...] The answer is no. The improvement is small if [...] is large. [...] Thus to get a very great improvement some knowledge of the location of θ is necessary. [...] Of course this is the quantity we are trying to estimate so we don't have this knowledge a priori. [...] But we may have some guess as to what the mean vector is. [...] This can be considered a disadvantage of the estimator: the choice is not objective as it may depend on the beliefs of the researcher.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War Edwards kept up {{pressure}} on the Government to assist industry. In 1941 he proposed that all import duties be abolished, and in December the same year he made a speech deploring the low rate of production placing the blame on the Treasury's [...] "throttling hands". At the time when Sir Oswald Mosley was released from detention due to ill health, Edwards put down a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{how long it would}} take for him to get better before his return to prison. He called for the war-time coalition government to be broken up in January 1944, so that the country could benefit from [...] "organized opposition". The issue of housing rebuilding concerned him, and in September 1944 he announced a scheme for a garden city to be built on the outskirts of Guisborough.|$|E
2500|$|Few of {{the portraits}} {{attributed}} to Giorgione appear as straightforward {{records of the}} appearance of a commissioning individual, although it is entirely possible that many are. Many can be read as types designed to express a mood or atmosphere, and certainly many of the examples of the portrait tradition Giorgione initiated appear to have had this purpose, and not to have been sold to the sitter. The subjects of his non-religious figure paintings are equally hard to discern. Perhaps the first <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is whether there was intended to be a specific meaning to these paintings that ingenious research can hope to recover. Many art historians argue that there is not: [...] "The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione's pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innovations were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting {{in the first half of}} the 16th century is the lack of learned or literary content".|$|E

2500|$|Kenyo {{compiled}} a list of existing 104 Ekiti autonomous communities in the 1950s with names of their traditional (natural) rulers who came from Ile-Ife or Benin and other places to Ekitiland, [...] though some are now located outside Ekiti State. Despite the fact that numbers of autonomous communities in Ekitiland was 104 in 1955 (with some of these towns eventually transferred to neighbouring Ondo, Kogi and Kwara States), the number of autonomous local communities in present Ekiti State in 2014 has increased to 134 due to official interventions and government proclamations. The latent <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> here is whether the Ekiti Obas and their communities who later got local autonomy were initially affected by British Re-Organization of Ekiti Towns or they were subjugated under larger Kingdoms or communities {{for a long period of}} time before they successfully asserted their autonomy or whether other issues resulted to their differences, demand for separation and eventual break-up. Whichever way the answers goes, there is an alarming evidence of the increase of drift in inter-communal relations and differences and the sequence of internal separation and or migration aiding the demand for local autonomies from the time of British colonial rule till now.|$|E
2500|$|Given a presheaf, {{a natural}} <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is {{to what extent}} its {{sections}} over an open set U are specified by their restrictions to smaller open sets V'i of an open cover of U. A presheaf is separated if its sections are [...] "locally determined": whenever two sections over U coincide when restricted to each of V'i, the two sections are identical. All examples of presheaves discussed above are separated, since in each case the sections are specified by their values at the points of the underlying space. Finally, a separated presheaf is a sheaf if compatible sections can be glued together, i.e., [...] whenever there is {{a section of the}} presheaf over each of the covering sets V'i, chosen so that they match on the overlaps of the covering sets, these sections correspond to a (unique) section on U, of which they are restrictions. It is easy to verify that all examples above except the presheaf of bounded functions are in fact sheaves: in all cases the criterion of being a section of the presheaf is local in a sense that it is enough to verify it in an arbitrary neighbourhood of each point.|$|E
2500|$|In {{determining}} whether a defendant in a civil rights lawsuit should receive qualified immunity, the first <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> is whether the plaintiff has alleged a constitutional violation. [...] On the facts presented in this case, the Court concluded that Alabama's use of the hitching post violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. [...] The [...] "unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain constitutes cruel and unusual punishment," [...] and [...] "among unnecessary and wanton inflictions of pain {{are those that are}} totally without penological justification." [...] And the actions of prison officials lack penological justification if they act with deliberate indifference to the health or safety of an inmate. [...] Here it was [...] "obvious" [...] that the Alabama prison guards were deliberately indifferent to Hope's health or safety. [...] Once Hope had been transported back to the prison, concerns about safety had been addressed. [...] There was no emergency situation at hand, yet the prison guards [...] "knowingly subjected [...] to a substantial risk of physical harm, to unnecessary risk of physical pain caused by the handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a 7-hour period, to unnecessary exposure to the heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a deprivation of bathroom breaks that caused a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation." [...] This was a basic violation of the [...] "dignity of man," [...] which amounts to [...] "gratuitous infliction of wanton and unnecessary pain" [...] prohibited by the law.|$|E
