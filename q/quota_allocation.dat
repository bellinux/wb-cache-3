The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for <b>quota</b> <b>allocation</b> to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Catches {{of several}} {{potential}} choke {{species in the}} Pacific groundfish IFQ are highly uncertain and tend to be concentrated while quota is broadly distributed. An analysis prior to implementation of the IFQ suggested substantial risk of individual vessels accidentally exceeding <b>quota</b> <b>allocations</b> for several rockfish species and Pacific halibut. Many fishermen lacked confidence {{that they would be}} able to acquire quota on the market to cover incidental catch and consequently joined risk pools to mitigate this risk. I update the analysis of bycatch risk using tow level catch data since implementation of the IFQ. The analysis indicates that expected catch rates of most choke species have declined suggesting more effective bycatch avoidance behavior. However, there remains a significant risk that vessels’ catch of some choke species can be several times median <b>quota</b> <b>allocations,</b> in part because many vessels have increased catch and effort by leasing quota pounds, but quota share ownership has remained distributed. The results underscore the importance of an efficient quota market to redistribute quota to match realized catches, but a recent analysis suggests that the quota market is not distributing quota effectively and is subject to high transactions costs.  This provides and explanation for the persistence of risk pools despite the fact that aggregate catches of overfished rockfish species and Pacific halibut have remained well below total quotas. ...|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{mechanisms}} for EU ETS (European Union Emissions Trading Scheme) <b>quotas</b> <b>allocations</b> within the Romanian economy are evaluated using a {{general equilibrium model}} within a dynamic intertemporal framework. Several distribution rules are simulated based on: the historical emissions, the least-cost approach and the auctioning scheme with and without a preliminary selection of eligible sectors. (1) The resulting marginal abatement cost in ETS eligible sectors is only 5. 75 EUR/t CO 2 for reducing pollution by 20. 7 %. Such a low level is explained by low energy prices and by substitution possibilities with low carbon content resources (nuclear and hydroelectricity). (2) Including all sectors in the trade creates a more flexible market than in the ETS, since more reduction options are available. (3) The ETS has high feasibility for monitoring. All eligible sectors (except refineries and metallurgy) present the lowest abatement cost in the economy. (4) Auctioning introduces a strong carbon price-signal, which reduces emission intensity but creates distortions in terms of trade and worsens the country's energy dependency. (5) Environmental policy has modest macroeconomic results and tends to correct the resources allocation. (6) The strong double dividend obtained under certain circumstances indicates Romania's potential for improving its energy efficiency and carbon intensity. climate policies, EU ETS, National <b>Allocation</b> Plan, <b>quotas</b> <b>allocation,</b> Romania, dynamic GCE modeling. ...|$|R
