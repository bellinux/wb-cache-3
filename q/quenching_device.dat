40|$|Arctic steels, {{like the}} API X 70 steel {{explored}} in this master thesis, are developed to withstand very low temperatures, with a ductile/brittle transition temperature below &# 8722; 60 &# 9702;C. However, during welding, brittle phases like martensite-austenite (M-A) islands may {{form in the}} heat affected zone (HAZ). In this master thesis in situ heat treatment and quenching experiments have been combined with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) inside a field emission scanning electron microscope in order to simulate a second weld cycle simulation. In conjunction with this a <b>quenching</b> <b>device</b> has been designed with respect to an existing hot stage. Inside the SEM, it was found difficult to recreate the characteristic microstructure of API X 70 steel from a traditional second cycle thermal weld simulation. This was {{probably due to the}} slow heating rate and the excessive high temperature holding time. The developed <b>quenching</b> <b>device</b> was based on gas quenching and produced a steel sample cooling time from 600 &# 9702;C to 400 &# 9702;C, &# 8710;t 6 / 4, of approximately 6. 5 seconds in every experiment. As a result of the gas quenching substantial amounts of oxide contamination, covered the sample surface following the experiments. This contamination layer produced artifacts, such as unreasonable amounts of austenite in the EBSD phase maps. Despite the quenching, islands of austenite (FCC) observed at elevated temperatures transformed into a low strain BCC structure. Some austenite islands showed a memory- effect during phase transformation, while others adapted the orientation of the surround- ing structure. No retained austenite was observed in the API X 70 steel after the in situ gas quenching, probably due to insufficient cooling rates. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{integration}} problems associated with tin dioxide thin film to meet the requirement of silicon IC processing. Since aluminum is being used as interconnection metal lines in various IC devices, the post annealing of tin dioxide thin film cannot be performed at high temperatures. At higher annealing temperature, the aluminum diffuses into the silicon and forms a metal alloy, which reduces {{the performance of the}} device. To overcome this problem, we propose an annealing process for the tin dioxide thin film at 450 degrees C in oxygen ambience for shorter time (15 min) and then quenching at room temperature. The performance, such as sensitivity and response time of the <b>quenched</b> <b>device,</b> is better than that of the device cooled at 50 degrees C/h. Sensor measurements were performed at 150 - 300 degrees C at 400 - 1000 ppm CO gas concentration, and stability of the devices was measured up to 720 h. The device was stable during long operation hours. Hydrogen gas was used to investigate the selectivity of the device.

However, the formation of magmatic sulfide ore deposits occurs at crustal conditions and most likely at higher oxygen fugacities. We present a new experimental set of partition coefficients for Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Pt and Au obtained at crustal conditions relevant {{to the formation of}} Noril’sk ore deposits (Siberia). Experiments were performed in internally heated pressure vessels equipped with a rapid <b>quench</b> <b>device</b> at 1200 °C and 700 MPa, under variable fO 2 (between FMQ- 2 and FMQ+ 1). The specificity {{of this study is that}} (i) a natural, metal-undoped composition was used as starting material (a picrite from Noril’sk- 1 intrusion), and (ii) the sufide melt segregated directly from the silicate melt, due to S addition. Magmatic textures were generally well preserved owing to the rapid quench. The sulfide melt – silicate melt partitioning of metals can be expressed by an exchange equation of the form: MO + 0. 5 S 2 = MS + 0. 5 O 2. According to this equation, Dsul/sil must be correlated with log fS 21 / 2 - log fO 21 / 2, as generally shown in the litterature.

[1 – 3] However, {{for the moment}} {{the control of the}} product high quality and the processing costs are limiting their breakthrough. RF-thermal plasmas could respond to both criteria as it is a continuous process achieving high production volume while ensuring a good synthesis control from the gaseous phase. The absence of electrodes for igniting the plasma and the controlled process atmosphere of RF-plasmas are beneficial for producing high purity materials. Typically a supersaturated gaseous phase containing the precursor is condensed rapidly after nucleation took place. The nanoparticles grow then subsequently by coagulation and coalescence. [4] This rapid condensation is achieved either by natural thermal gradients in the plasma or by quenching using a cold source (gas or cold surface) or by using an expansion.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two areas in silicon photodetectors, the first being {{enhancing}} the sub-bandgap light absorption of IR wavelenghts in silicon, {{and the second}} being intrinsic signal amplification in silicon photodetectors. Both of these are achieved using heavily doped p-n junction devices which create localized states that relax the k-selection rule of indirect bandgap material. The probability of transitions between impurity band and the conduction/valence band {{would be much more}} efficient than the one between band-to-band transition. The waveguide-coupled epitaxial p-n photodetector was demonstrated for 1310 nm wavelength detection. Incorporated with the Franz-Keldysh effect and the quasi-confined epitaxial layer design, an absorption coefficient around 10 cm- 1 has been measured and internal quantum efficiency nearly 100 % at - 2. 5 V. The absorption coefficient is calculated from the wave function of the electron and hole in p-n diode. The heavily doped impurity wave function can be formulated as a delta function, and the quasi-confined conduction band energy states, and the wave function on each level can be obtained from the Silvaco software. The calculated theoretical absorption coefficient increases with the increasing applied bias and the doping concentration, which matches the experimental results. To solve the issues of large excess noise and high operation bias for avalanche photodiodes based on impact ionization, I presented a detector using the Cycling Excitation Process (CEP) for signal amplification. This can be realized in a heavily doped and highly compensated Si p-n junction, showing ultra high gain about 3000 at very low bias (< 4 V), and possessing an intrinsic, phonon-mediated regulation process to keep the device stable without any <b>quenching</b> <b>device</b> required in today’s Geiger-mode avalanche detectors.

H 2 O and CO 2 contents in experimental glasses {{were determined by}} bulk analytical methods and FTIR spectroscopy. For the quantification of volatile concentrations by IR spectroscopy we have calibrated the absorption coefficients of water-related and carbon-related bands for phono-tephritic compositions. The determined absorption coefficients are 0. 62 ± 0. 06 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for the band at ~ 4500 cm- 1 (OH groups) and 1. 02 ± 0. 03 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for the band at ~ 5200 cm- 1 (H 2 O molecules). The coefficient for the fundamental OH stretching vibration at 3550 cm- 1 is 63. 9 ± 5. 4 L mol- 1 cm- 1. CO 2 is bound in the phono-tephritic glass as CO 32 - exclusively; its concentration was quantified by the peak height of the doublet near the 1500 cm- 1 band with the calibrated absorption coefficient of 308 ± 110 L mol- 1 cm- 1. Quench crystals were observed in glasses with water contents exceeding 6 wt% even when using a rapid <b>quench</b> <b>device,</b> limiting the application of IR spectroscopy for water-rich glasses. H 2 O solubility in the ultrapotassic melts (7. 52 wt% K 2 O) {{as a function of}} pressure is similar to the solubility in basaltic melts up to 400 MPa (~ 8 wt%) but is higher at 500 MPa (up to 10. 71 wt%). At 500 MPa and 1200 °C, the CO 2 capacity of the phono-tephritic melt is about 0. 82 wt%. The high CO 2 capacity is probably related to the high K 2 O content of the melt. At both 200 and 500 MPa, the H 2 O solubility shows a non linear dependence on XfH 2 O in the whole XfH 2 O range. The variation of CO 2 solubility with XfCO 2 displays a pronounced convex shape in particular at 500 MPa, implying that dissolved H 2 O promotes the solubility of CO 2. Our experimental data on CO 2 solubility indicate that the interaction between phono-tephritic magma and carbonate rocks occurring in the Alban Hills magmatic system may result in partial dissolution of CO 2 from limestone into the magma. However, although the CO 2 solubility in phono-tephritic melts is relatively high compared to that in silicic to basaltic melts, the capacity for assimilation of limestone without degassing is nevertheless limited to < 1 wt% at the P-T conditions of the magma chamber below Alban Hills...|$|R

During membrane fusion (visible 30 ms after stimulation) specific intramembranous particles in the cell membrane at the attachment sites of secretory organelles ("fusion rosette") disappear, possibly by dissociation of formerly oligomeric proteins. This hitherto unknown type of rapid change in membrane architecture may reflect molecular changes in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, presumably crucial for membrane fusion. By a modification of the quenched flow procedure extracellular [Ca++] during stimulation was adjusted to {{less than or equal to}} 3 x 10 (- 8) M, i. e., below intracellular [Ca++]. Only extrusion of the secretory contents, but not membrane fusion, was inhibited. Thus it was possible to separate both secretory events (membrane fusion from contents extrusion) and to discriminate their Ca++ requirements. We conclude that no Ca++ influx is necessary for induction of membrane fusion...|$|R
30|$|At present, {{numerous}} {{functional layers}} {{are introduced to}} improve the carrier injection and balance the carrier transport in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). Although {{it may be a}} good way to enhance the efficiency of devices, the introduction of functional layers would also result in extra process and long manufacture period. Actually, with the enrichment of material system, many appropriate materials could be chosen to share two or even more functions in OLEDs. Here, via impedance spectroscopy and transient electroluminescence analysis, di-[4 -(N,N-ditolyl-amino)-phenyl] cyclohexane (TAPC) and 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (Bphen) are demonstrated to serve as carrier injection and transport layers simultaneously. As a result, efficient trilayer OLEDs are achieved with comparable performances to conventional multilayer devices. Further studies have also been carried out to analyze the recombination and <b>quenching</b> mechanisms in <b>devices.</b> TAPC can block electrons effectively, while Bphen avoids the accumulation of holes. It makes carriers in emitting layer become more balanced, resulting in the reduction of efficiency roll-off.|$|R
40|$|Charges in {{conjugated}} {{polymer materials}} {{have a strong}} impact on the photophysics and their interaction with the primary excited state species {{has to be taken}} into account in understanding device properties. Here, we employ single-molecule spectroscopy to unravel the influence of charges on several photoluminescence (PL) observables. The charges are injected either stochastically by a photochemical process, or deterministically in a hole-injection sandwich device configuration. We find that upon charge injection, besides a blue-shift of the PL emission and a shortening of the PL lifetime due to quenching and blocking of the lowest-energy chromophores, the non-classical photon arrival time distribution of the multichromophoric chain is modified towards a more classical distribution. Surprisingly, the fidelity of photon antibunching deteriorates upon charging, whereas one would actually expect the number of chromophores to be reduced. A qualitative model is presented to explain the observed PL changes. The results are of interest to developing a microscopic understanding of the intrinsic charge-exciton <b>quenching</b> interaction in <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of radicals in bovine cytochrome c oxidase (bCcO), during the O 2 redox chemistry and proton translocation, is an unresolved controversial issue. To determine if radicals are {{formed in the}} catalytic reaction of bCcO under single turnover conditions, the reaction of O 2 with the enzyme, reduced by either ascorbate or dithionite, was initiated in a custom-built rapid freeze <b>quenching</b> (RFQ) <b>device</b> and the products were trapped at 77 K at reaction times ranging from 50 μs to 6 ms. Additional samples were hand mixed to attain multiple turnover conditions and quenched with a reaction time of minutes. X-band (9 GHz) continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectra of the reaction products revealed the {{formation of}} a narrow radical with both reductants. D-band (130 GHz) pulsed EPR spectra allowed for the determination of the g-tensor principal values and revealed that when ascorbate was used as the reductant the dominant radical species was localized on the ascorbyl moiety, and when dithionite was used as the reductant the radical was the SO 2 − ion. When the contributions from the reductants are subtracted from the spectra, no evidence for a protein-based radical could be found in the reaction of O 2 with reduced bCcO. As a surrogate for radicals formed on reaction intermediates, the reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) with oxidized bCcO was studied at pH 6 and pH 8 by trapping the products at 50 μs with the RFQ device to determine the initial reaction events. For comparison, radicals formed after several minutes of incubation were also examined, and X-band and D-band analysis led to the identification of radicals on Tyr- 244 and Tyr- 129. In the RFQ measurements, a peroxyl (ROO) species was formed, presumably by the reaction between O 2 and an amino acid-based radical. It is postulated that Tyr- 129 may play a central role as a proton loading site during proton translocation by ejecting a proton upon formation of the radical species and then becoming reprotonated during its reduction via a chain of three water molecules originating from the region of the propionate groups of heme a 3.

40|$|Charge {{generation}} and recombination dynamics in organic photovoltaic bulk heterojunction films comprising the donor polymer, PDPP-TNT (poly{ 3, 6 -dithiophene- 2 -yl- 2, 5 -di(2 -octyldodecyl) -pyrrolo[3, 4 -c]pyrrole- 1, 4 -dione-alt-naphthalene}), blended with the fullerene acceptor, PC 71 BM ([6, 6]-phenyl C 71 -butyric acid methyl ester), have been studied. The charge-carrier generation process was studied using femtosecond transient absorption, {{and it was}} found that the efficiency of charge generation is not dominated by geminate recombination but rather is limited by exciton diffusion in the films. Highly sensitive nanosecond transient absorption (ns-TA) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) were used to study charge recombination. From ns-TA measurements, we obtained a recombination rate constant of 1 × 10 – 9 cm 3 s– 1 and found that charge recombination is limited by the diffusion of charge carriers (Langevin-type recombination). TRMC signals were comparable with ns-TA on shorter time scales. However, in contrast with ns-TA, the TRMC signal contained an additional long-lived component. The fast decay on shorter time scales is attributed to the recombination of the majority of the charge carriers. The long-lived component is assigned to a small population of charge carriers with high mobility, suggesting they are located in isolated, crystalline domains within the bulk heterojunction. These findings are discussed in relation to the morphology of the blend film, fluorescence <b>quenching</b> properties, and <b>device</b> performance including photoinduced charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (PhotoCELIV) measurements described in our previous publications...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the spin-dependent opto-electronic pathways of organic semiconductors using pulsed electrically and optically detected magnetic resonance. This work {{is motivated by}} the need to provide unambiguous and independent verification of the underlying spin-dependent processes in organic devices, and to quantify their microscopic properties. This work is advanced through a series of studies. Electrical and optical detection are sensitive to the spin-dependent recombination of polaron pairs that occurs within the singlet-triplet basis. The change in observable from conventional inductively-detected electron spin resonance introduces several new effects. We show that additional time constants and echoes can occur in multi-pulse sequences, such as the Hahn echo and inversion recovery. We demonstrate that phase cycling removes the spin beating component and allows the true spin relaxation times to be recovered. Several exciton-mediated processes are believed to contribute to organic magnetoresistance. We develop a time domain theory of triplet-exciton polaron <b>quenching</b> for organic <b>devices.</b> Magnetic resonance drives spins between the doublet and quartet manifolds, producing macroscopic changes in the sample conductivity. Using this formalism we are able to place bounds on the spin-spin interactions present in the exciton-polaron complexes present in poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 -ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) devices and to theoretically describe the transition between a weakly-coupled exciton-polaron complex and a strongly-bound trion state. Triplet-triplet annihilation allows two low energy photons to be upconverted into a single high energy photon, substantially increasing the efficiency of solar cells. We develop a theoretical description of triplet-triplet annihilation, and show that the signal is strongly dependent on both the spin-selection rules and the energetics of the system. Since the underlying Rabi frequencies are sensitive to the dipolar and exchange coupling between the two excitons, they can be used to accurately characterize the spin Hamiltonian...|$|R
40|$|Superconductors are {{a tempting}} {{alternative}} {{to be used}} in high-current applications due to their property of lossless current carrying ability. The high material costs and laborious fabrication processes, however, prevent the more common use in different suitable application areas. Presently, several research and development projects use superconductors. One of the applications is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle accelerator in the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). In LHC, superconductor based electromagnets for particle beam steering and focusing are utilized. Superconductors can carry direct current without heat losses only if the current, magnetic field and temperature are below certain boundary, the critical surface. Otherwise the superconductor becomes resistive and heat is generated. This can lead to uncontrollable temperature increasing, <b>quench,</b> in the <b>device</b> and actions are needed in order to prevent damages. One must be prepared for quench by designing an adequate protection system for the device. The design can be aided by simulating heat transfer in the <b>device</b> during <b>quench.</b> The simulations can be time consuming in case of large devices consisting of anisotropic materials, like the magnet's in LHC. However, adequate modelling decisions can significantly reduce the simulation time, while leading to results with sufficient accuracy. This involves identifying the essential interplaying physical phenomena and choosing an appropriate representation for the modelling domain. In this thesis, quench modelling of superconducting magnets is discussed. Moreover, a simulation tool was developed for quench simulations suitable for large superconducting devices. The tool utilizes a novel numerical approach to solve three-dimensional (3 -D) heat diffusion in one-dimensional (1 -D) modelling domain. To study the capability of the simulation tool, quench analysis was performed for an accelerator magnet prototype. The tool was able to solve the heat transfer during a quench in the magnet in couple of minutes while the same problem utilizing conventional 3 -D modelling domain would take several hours even. Furthermore, to study the prospects of utilizing this new approach in quench protection design, comparison with measurement data is needed...|$|R
