40|$|ABSTRACT This thesis {{deals with}} the {{possibilities}} of municipal waste separation {{and the importance of}} education and awareness at the primary school level. The review part is generally focused on municipal waste issues, basic terms, methods of separation and recycling. In the next part there are the possibilities of elementary schools to participate in programmess with environmental topics, especially with the eventuality of systematic separation of waste within the classroom. It assesses the potential to create internal programmes and involvement in external ones. In the practical part the method of questionnaire survey at a primary school in Chodov near Karlovy Vary is employed. The research was applied there and it aims to determine the influence of education on the attitude of respondents, elementary school pupils. The comparison of the situation before and after completing the educational program of the company EKOKOM Tonda package on the road was carried out. The benefit is the analysis of pupils' awareness accomplished by the comparison of both <b>questionnaires</b> <b>and</b> specific <b>verification</b> of positive impact on the pupils approach to waste separation thanks to the awareness.

The tree species, their uses and incentives {{to make them more}} abundantly available to combat carbon emission and land degradation through erosion; properties of soils on which trees grow were studied. <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>and</b> field <b>verification</b> exercise were tools used to elicit information. Soil samples were taken from two depths (0 - 30, 30 - 60 cm) for routine physical and chemical analyses. Survey results were analyzed using logit regression model. Results showed that farmers with on-farm trees are mostly old age farmers (78. 78 %) and are all men (100 %). The agroforestry trees have wide canopy diameter. The most important use of on-farm trees in the study area is for soup (100 %). Soil analyses showed that the soil texture were sandy loam with slight variations. The values of Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and Organic Carbon obtained were adequate for the crops produced which could be due to the accumulation and decomposition of leaf litters from hedge row/agroforestry plants.

Preconizou-se que o desjejum deveria suprir 25 % das necessidades diárias. Foi realizado questionário autoaplicado semiquantitativo e verificação de peso e estatura para cálculo do Índice de Massa Corporal (IMC) percentilar, com 214 adolescentes; 185 (86, 4 %) dos pesquisados eram eutróficos, 19 (8, 9 %) tinham sobrepeso e 10 (4, 7 %), apresentavam baixo peso, na faixa etária entre 15 e 19 anos, de ambos os sexos. Efetuou-se a análise descritiva das variáveis e os testes de Qui-Quadrado de Pearson, teste da Razão de Verossimilhança (Likehood Ratio Chi-Square), teste de Mantel Haenszel e o teste de tendência de Cochran-Armitage. Estabeleceu-se nível de confiança: p valor < 0, 05. Verificou-se que o desjejum foi consumido em casa, pela maioria dos estudantes pesquisados (77, 6 %), entre 6 e 7 horas, com freqüência diária. Relativo às calorias consumidas no desjejum, tanto as alunas quanto os alunos consomem até 25 %, a média por todos os estudantes foi de 16, 5 %. Para o sexo masculino foi de 16, 7 % e para o feminino 16, 4 % das calorias necessárias. O pão e o leite com achocolatados foram os alimentos mais consumidos e, entre os menos consumidos, ovos, presunto, iogurte, frutas e bolo. Conclui-se que esses resultados apontam a necessidade de intervenções nutricionais na categoria estudada, principalmente com relação à escolha de alimentos saudáveis. _________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTStudy {{carried through}} on the {{alimentary}} consumption in relation to breakfast of adolescents, that study in the morning period, of three private schools of the Ensino Médio of the Plano Piloto of Brasilia, DF.

40|$|A {{reliable}} assessment of smoking status has significant public health implications and {{is essential for}} research purposes. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine optimal saliva cotinine cut-off values for smoking during pregnancy. The analyses were based on data from 1771 women from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort. Saliva cotinine concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI + MS/MS). The saliva cotinine cut-off value for active smoking was established at 10 ng/mL (sensitivity 96 %, specificity 95 %) and for passive smoking at 1. 5 ng/mL (sensitivity 63 %, specificity 71 %). About 5 % of the self-reported non-smoking women were classified as smokers based on the cotinine cut-off value. Significantly more younger, single, and less educated self-reported non-smokers had a cotinine concentration higher than 10 ng/mL compared to those who were older, married, and who had a university degree. Close to 30 % of the non-smokers who indicated that smoking was not allowed in their home could be classified as exposed to passive smoking based on the cut-off value. The study suggests that self-reported smoking status is a valid measure of active smoking, whereas in the case of passive smoking, a combination of <b>questionnaire</b> data <b>and</b> biomarker <b>verification</b> may be required...|$|R

40|$|Smart environments (SmE) are richly {{integrated}} with multiple heterogeneous devices; they perform the operations in intelligent manner {{by considering the}} context and actions/behaviors of the users. Their major objective is to enable the environment to provide ease and comfort to the users. The reliance on these systems demands consistent behavior. The versatility of devices, user behavior and intricacy of communication complicate the modeling <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> of SmE's reliable behavior. Of the many available modeling <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> techniques, formal methods {{appear to be the}} most promising. Due to a large variety of implementation scenarios and support for conditional behavior/processing, the concept of SmE is applicable to diverse areas which calls for focused research. As a result, a number of modeling <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> techniques have been made available for designers. This paper explores and puts into perspective the modeling <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> techniques based on an extended literature survey.

40|$|Aims To {{assess the}} effect of various {{measures}} of adiposity and of metabolic risk factors, both separately and in combination, on the risk of future Type 2 diabetes in patients with manifest vascular diseases. Methods This was a prospective cohort study in 2924 patients (mean age 59 ± 12 years) with manifest atherosclerosis. Metabolic risk factors were defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program criteria for the metabolic syndrome. Incidence of Type 2 diabetes was assessed by <b>questionnaire</b> <b>and</b> subsequent <b>verification.</b> Results During a median follow-up of 4. 9 years (range 3. 0 – 7. 6 years) there were 178 cases (6. 1 %) of incident Type 2 diabetes. An increase with 1 sd waist circumference showed a strong association with incident Type 2 diabetes in both men (hazard ratio 2. 45, 95 % CI 1. 97 – 3. 04) and women (hazard ratio 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 38 – 2. 26). Compared with patients with normal (i. e. below the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria for abdominal adiposity) waist circumference and < 3 metabolic risk factors, both patients with normal waist circumference and = 3 metabolic risk factors and patients with high (i. e. above the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria for abdominal adiposity) waist circumference and < 3 metabolic risk factors had {{an increased risk of}} Type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 2. 44, 95 % CI 1. 37 – 4. 36 and hazard ratio 3. 61, 95 % CI 2. 23 – 5. 85, respectively). Patients with both high waist circumference and = 3 metabolic risk factors had the highest risk of developing Type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 10. 76, 95 % CI 6. 95 – 16. 64). Conclusions In patients with manifest atherosclerosis, both presence of = 3 metabolic risk factors and presence of a high waist circumference alone are associated with increased risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. The combined presence of = 3 metabolic risk factors and high waist circumference, which is present in 15 % of patients, is associated with a 10 -fold increased risk of future Type 2 diabetes.
