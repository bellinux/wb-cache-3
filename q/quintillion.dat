25|$|The {{true power}} of STR {{analysis}} {{is in its}} statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having {{a certain number of}} repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, we can say that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a <b>quintillion</b> (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.

Rarely, at a temperature of around , snowflakes can form in threefold symmetry — triangular snowflakes.

40|$|<b>Quintillions</b> of bytes of {{data are}} {{generated}} {{every day in}} this era of big data. Machine learning techniques are utilized to perform predictive analysis on these data, to reveal hidden relationships and dependencies and perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors. The obtained predictive models are used to interpret the existing data and predict new data information. Nowadays, most machine learning algorithms are realized by software programs running on general-purpose processors, which usually takes a huge amount of CPU time and introduces unbelievably high energy consumption. In comparison, a dedicated hardware design is usually much more efficient than software programs running on general-purpose processors in terms of runtime and energy consumption. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation is to develop efficient hardware architectures for mainstream machine learning algorithms, to provide a promising solution to addressing the runtime and energy bottlenecks of machine learning applications. However, it is a really challenging task to map complex machine learning algorithms to efficient hardware architectures. In fact, many important design decisions need to be made during the hardware development for efficient tradeoffs. In this dissertation, a parallel digital VLSI architecture for combined SVM training and classification is proposed. For the first time, cascade SVM, a powerful training algorithm, is leveraged to significantly improve the scalability of hardware-based SVM training and develop an efficient parallel VLSI architecture. The parallel SVM processors provide a significant training time speedup and energy reduction compared with the software SVM algorithm running on a general-purpose CPU. Furthermore, a liquid state machine based neuromorphic learning processor with integrated training and recognition is proposed. A novel theoretical measure of computational power is proposed to facilitate fast design space exploration of the recurrent reservoir. Three low-power techniques are proposed to improve the energy efficiency. Meanwhile, a 2 -layer spiking neural network with global inhibition is realized on Silicon. In addition, we also present architectural design exploration of a brain-inspired digital neuromorphic processor architecture with memristive synaptic crossbar array, and highlight several synaptic memory access styles. Various analog-to-digital converter schemes have been investigated to provide new insights into the tradeoff between the hardware cost and energy consumption...|$|R

40|$|Sampling from marine environments {{followed}} by en masse high-throughput {{nucleic acid sequencing}} (metagenomics) will transform our understanding of marine microbial communities and their impacts on Earth biogeochemistry. The interpretation of a marine metagenomic (MMG) data set within its environmental context, and extrapolation to planetary scale, require first that we answer simpler questions about a sample, "who is there?" and "what are they doing?" However, often the majority of sequenced genomic fragments (reads) that comprise a MMG data set cannot be assigned taxonomic or functional annotation by searches in reference sequence databases. This stems partly from the bias of reference databases to microbes amenable to study in the lab, the "culturable 1 %. " Also, the complexity of MMG samples—thousands of populations per sample, and quadrillions to <b>quintillions</b> of nucleotides—leads to extreme underrepresentation by the reads. Moreover, the shortness of reads makes annotation difficult. There are now {{tens of thousands of}} MMG data sets, each with many thousands to billions of mostly unannotated reads. Learning from this massive resource of raw data will require new bioinformatics approaches. This dissertation explores approaches that pool different MMG data sets to benefit annotation and the discovery of widespread marine microbes. First, we hypothesized that pooling MMG data sets, and assembling the reads into longer sequences (contigs), would increase species and functional annotation of the reads. This proved true for the forty-two real MMG data sets we investigated. For simulated MMG data sets, pooled contigs were found to rarely mix reads from different species. This supports that pooled contigs, though a consensus of reads from different populations, are biologically interpretable, and that annotation may be transferred to constituent reads. Second, given the high computational cost of assembly and the huge number of MMG data sets from which to select for pooling, we hypothesized that ranking data sets would make pooled assembly more efficient. This was correct. Ranking data sets by k-mer profile similarity resulted in pooled assembly rates on a par with ranking based on phylogenetic profile similarity. In practical terms, this means one can exploit pooled assembly to increase annotation without first having to annotate sets individually to create phylogenetic profiles. Third, we found that pooling of MMG data sets can enable the discovery of ubiquitous and abundant marine microbial species and partial characterization of their genomes, without need for culturing them. This was accomplished by "geographic profiling" of public, pooled-assembled MMG data. Three novel species were predicted in multiple MMG sets and substantiated with orthogonal lines of evidence. Experimental work corroborated predicted sequence fragments for each of the species, and analyses of these fragments supported that they likely represent abundant, ubiquitous novel species...|$|R
