Few small molecule compounds have been identified that are active in cell-based or animal models, potentially due to toxin enzyme plasticity. Here we screened commercially available quinolinols, as well as synthesized hydroxyquinolines. Seventy-two compounds had IC 50 values below 10 μM, with the best compound exhibiting submicromolar inhibition (IC 50 = 0. 8 μM). Structure−activity relationship trends showed that the enzyme tolerates various substitutions at R 1 but has a clear preference for bulky aryl amide groups at R 2, while methylation at R 3 increased inhibitor potency. Evaluation of the most potent compounds in an ADME panel showed that these compounds possess poor solubility at pH 6. 8, but display excellent solubility at low pH, suggesting that oral dosing may be possible.

40|$|Botulinum {{neurotoxins}} (BoNTs), etiological {{agents of}} the life threatening neuroparalytic disease botulism, are the most toxic substances currently known. The potential for the use as bioweapon makes the development of small-molecule inhibitor against these deadly toxins is a top priority. Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for BoNT intoxication. Although an effective vaccine/immunotherapy is available for immuno-prophylaxis but this cannot reverse the effects of toxin inside neurons. A small-molecule pharmacological intervention, especially one that would be effective against the light chain protease, would be highly desirable. Similarity search was carried out from ChemBridge and NSC libraries to the hit (7 -(phenyl(8 -quinolinylamino) methyl) - 8 -quinolinol; NSC 84096) to mine its analogs.

A total of 100 high-scoring compounds were evaluated in a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -based protease assay using recombinant full-length BoNT/A LC. Seven compounds that significantly inhibited the BoNT/A protease activity were selected. Database search queries of the best candidate hit [7 -((4 -nitro-anilino) (phenyl) methyl) - 8 -quinolinol (NSC 1010) ] were performed to mine its nontoxic analogs.

This compound exhibits dual luminescence in the near infrared (NIR; metal-centered) and in the visible (ligand-centered) spectral regions. Ligand emission is strongly influenced by π–π interactions in the crystal packing. Photophysical studies were applied to evaluate the quenching processes affecting the Yb 3 + NIR luminescence as well as to highlight the ligand-to-metal sensitization mechanism. The ligand-to-metal sensitization efficiency parameter was determined to be close to unity, thus showing that the quinolinolato ligand acts as a very efficient antenna funneling energy absorbed from UV and visible light toward Yb 3 +. Time-resolved photoluminescence studies and transient absorption experiments clearly demonstrate that the ligand-to-metal energy-transfer process occurs on an ultrafast timescale and involves the triplet states of the ligand. Very similar Yb 3 + emission lifetimes near 1  μm are observed for a solution in DMSO (7. 85  μs) and for solid-state crystals (7. 10  μs). The unusually short radiative lifetime of 690  μs, which was determined from spectroscopic data from a solution in DMSO, shows that the Yb ion in this complex has a remarkably high radiative strength. A low quantum yield of the NIR luminescence, Φtot= 1. 4 x 10 − 2, was found.

A liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry method for the separation and profiling of organic compounds in crude oil and lignin derived bio-oil mixtures has been developed. The analytical method was developed in a reverse phase chromatography with gradient elution program using water and acetonitrile plus 0. 1 % acetic acid. The method was developed using standard compounds which include, naphthoic acid, naphthol, methyl benzoic acid, guaiacol, guaiacol glyceryl ether, catecol, dihydroxybenzene, dihydroxybenzoic acid, methyl catecol, ethyl catecol, <b>quinolinol,</b> NH 2 -benzamide, and carbazole. The separation is reproducible over repeated injection of the standard compounds with an acceptable variation in the retention times. A solid phase extraction protocol using a normal phase cyano-bonded stationary phase was modified to fractionate the petroleum and bio-oils into polar and non-polar components. Hexane/dichloromethane was used to elute the non-polar and hydrocarbon components of the bio-oil and petroleum respectively, while acetonitrile and methanol was used to elute the polar fractions which were submitted to the reverse phase column for separation and profiling.

40|$|This work {{is mainly}} {{focused on the}} {{investigation}} and processing of luminescent molecular complexes of lanthanide ions (Ln), {{for the development of}} efficient near infrared (NIR) -emitting materials. In the light of a detailed understanding of the chemical/photophysical properties of the special class of lanthanide quinolinolato complexes, as prototype molecular materials for NIR applications, two main aspects have been taken into consideration for a progress in this field: i) (multi-) functional NIR-emissive heterolanthanide complexes and ii) lanthanide-doped sol-gel glasses as NIR-emissive optical materials. Heterometallic assemblies, containing two or more different lanthanide cations as carriers of distinctive functionalities, represent promising materials where different physical properties can coexist or be in interplay thanks to intermetallic communication. A thorough discussion on heterolanthanide assemblies, pointing out the general strategies to achieve the desired (multi-) functionalities in these systems, is provided herein. In this framework, heterolanthanide Er/Yb systems have attracted significant interest for Er 3 + sensitization through resonance energy transfer (RET) from Yb 3 + leading to enhancement of Er 3 + NIR emission at 1. 5 μm in glass host Yb-Er co-doped optical fiber amplifiers. A strategy to achieve composition control and homogeneity in such materials resorts to the encapsulation of Er and Yb in the same molecule to afford intermetallic communication between lanthanide ions sitting at short distance in a discrete polynuclear architecture. Fully efficient Yb-to-. Er RET at molecular level is firstly demonstrated in the mixed-lanthanide Yb 2 ErQ 9 complex (Q = <b>quinolinol</b> ligand), and, as an extension of these studies, the investigation of the full photocycle leading to narrow-band NIR emission in a series of heterolanthanide ErxYb 3 -x quinolinolato compounds, on variation of metal composition and molecular stoichiometry, has been performed. Moreover, the first example of a tri-lanthanide discrete polynuclear molecule containing three NIR-emissive lanthanide ions: Nd 3 +, Yb 3 + and Er 3 +, is presented. The NdYbErQ 9 complex was investigated as a potential broad-band NIR emitter where the intensities of the three different main emissions from each lanthanide ion can be finely tuned on varying metal composition. The investigation of the processing potential of luminescent lanthanide complexes through doping into inorganic or polymeric host matrixes is of crucial interest for the development of optical devices (amplifiers, optical waveguides, OLEDs, etc.). To this purpose, studies on the incorporation of an Yb quinolinolate complex into a silica sol-gel glass, with a thorough account of the photophysical properties of this hybrid material, have been performed.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this {{dissertation}} (Chapter 1) describes the improved synthesis of photochromic spirobenzopyrans with use of ultrasonic irradiation. The successful preparation granted access to photoswitches that were equipped with hydroxyl, iodo, ethynyl and azido groups. The functional groups were then devised and differentiated during further progress to serve for the construction of functional π-systems and conjugation to biopolymers. The reversibility of the photoswitching was demonstrated for representative compounds, the absorption spectra of the corresponding merocyanines formed by photo-induced ring opening was discussed with respect to different substituents at the benzopyran moiety, and the solvatochromism of a spirobenzopyran that was equipped with a strong electron-withdrawing group was studied. In the second part of this work (Chapter 2) the synthesis and optical properties of new photochromic dyads were described. The fluorescent building blocks (pyrene, perylene, nile red), bearing an alkyne-functionality, and a spirobenzopyran with an azido group were successfully prepared. CuAAC was used as a facile methodology for the assembly of the molecular dyads through 1, 4 -regioselective formation of 1, 2, 3 -triazoles. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that by UV irradiation the spirobenzopyran unit of the dyads switch into their corresponding merocyanine form with appearance of its characteristic absorption band in the visible range. The fluorescence quenching was modulated by the formation of the photo-induced merocyanine form and was observed for all three dyads, indicating an energy transfer process from the fluorophore unit to the merocyanine. The efficiency of energy transfer increased from pyrene over perylene to nile red due to the enhanced spectral overlap. Furthermore, the third part of this work (Chapter 3) reported on the synthesis and incorporation of a spirobenzopyran as an internal modification into oligonucleotides by two different strategies. A new spirobenzopyran building block for oligonucleotide synthesis has been effectually prepared. A useful synthetic prolongation and activation of the spirobenzopyran was introduced and conjugated with an acyclic linker system. The second strategy for incorporation of the spirobenzopyran modification was successfully performed with use of postsynthetic off-bead click ligation. Melting temperature measurements of the modified duplexes displayed significant destabilization compared to unmodified duplexes, albeit photoinduced switching of the chromophore was not observed. Further investigations by time-resolved spectroscopy could bring about clarification on the photoprocesses. The last part (Chapter 4) reported a novel and dexterous method for in situ azide formation and click conjugation of DNA with fluorescent labels. This approach completes the click repertoire by a complementary access and constitutes an alternative postsynthetic method for the covalent labeling of oligonucleotides on solid support. With use of CuAAC the ethynyl-modified chromophores (perylene, nile red) were conjugated with an azido group that was formed in situ by treatment of presynthesized oligonucleotides incorporating IdU with sodium azide on solid support. Methodically benefits are based on advantages of solid support synthesis and multifaceted implementations of functional π-systems. The characteristic properties of the nile red labeled DNA bearing a triazolyl bridge were studied and compared with a nile red labeled oligonucleotide with an ethynyl bridge. The results clearly display the great potential for the extensive use of this completive approach. Furthermore, in the last chapter the synthesis for new compositions of oligonucleotide building blocks was shown, specifically the synthesis and introduction of a <b>quinolinol</b> moiety into DNA for further purposeful metal-mediated applications as well as the synthesis and optical properties of a photoswitchable nucleoside. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} photophysical {{properties of}} the NIR-emissive lanthanide-based complexes attract much attention due to the potential applications in medical diagnostic and optoelectronics. On the other hand, luminescent helicates are in {{the focus of attention}} of supramolecular chemistry. In this thesis, the self-assembly principles are applied to prepare mono- and dinuclear lanthanide(III) -containing systems using 8 -hydroxyquinoline and its derivatives as building blocks. First, effective pathways for the synthesis of ligands possessing appropriate (bi-, tri-, tetradentate) chelating units were elaborated. Thus, 8 -hydroxyquinolines bearing a semicarbazone or SAMP hydrazone group perform in a tetradentate manner; moreover the former tend to agglomeration during complex isolation in the solid state. In contrary, the imine, carboxamide, carboxylate, and imidate donor functions implemented in the 2 -position of the quinoline core provide nine coordination at the metal center upon binding of three such strands in the complexation step. The Hiratani-double-Claisen rearrangement is proposed as a key synthetic transformation to extend the helicating motif over the longer ligand sequence. Moreover the applicability {{of a wide range of}} substrates to this protocol allows a combination of tridentate (for addressing f-elements) and bidentate (for the recognition of p-/d-block metals) binding compartments within a single segmental receptor. The coordination studies were performed towards the rare-earth(III) elements in order to establish the binding ability of novel quinolinate receptors. Monometallic model systems were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis in the solid phase and by NMR and ESI MS in solution. Tridentate units are found to be optimal providing tight ligand environment around the incorporated emitter which is especially valuable from the spectroscopic point of view. The photophysical {{properties of the}} monometallic compounds were determined in the solid state showing efficient sensitization of the NIR luminescence from Nd(III), Er(III), Yb(III) complexes of 2 -amidoquinolinate ligands. The effect of bromination on the spectroscopic parameters (quantum yield and lifetime) was observed upon successive introduction of the halogen substituents on the ligand scaffold. Next, the symmetric and unsymmetric ditopic receptors were involved in the coordination investigations. The selective recognition of p-, d-, and f-elements by discrete binding domains of a single strand furnished homo- and heterodinuclear helicate-type compounds in which intramolecular intermetallic communication is remarkably facilitated and enabled to control by tuning the metal-metal separation. The speciation in solution was monitored by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, ESI MS, and spectrophotometric titration. In parallel, the template effect was observed by means of X-ray diffraction analysis as the decisive factor governing self-organization processes which occur in solution. The homo- Yb/Yb and heterodinuclear Yb/Al helicates were employed to study energy transfer processes occurring between different complex fragments of one supramolecular edify connected by flexible isobutenylidene spacer. Thus, the intrinsic deactivation of the green emission of the chromophore of the Yb/Al probe followed by energy transfer to the emissive states of the lanthanide(III) compartment results in the significant improvement of the Yb-centered luminescence in the solid phase. Also the bis-amide bridged symmetrical ligands were involved in the coordination studies. In these systems the stereocontrol and rigidity are attained by altering the nature of the spacer between binding sites. In addition, low energy chromophores (N-containing heterocycles) were attached to the quinoline ligand in order to be further involved in the coordination of NIR emitting lanthanide(III) ions as suitable sensitizers of luminescence at longer wavelengths. The synthetic procedures for the preparation of tri- and tetratopic ligands predisposed for the insertion of several metal centers, particularly lanthanide(III) ions, in the elongated helicates were developed, thus offering excellent approach to the multifunctional luminescent probes. Finally, the applicability of the microwave technology to the construction of substituted <b>quinolinol</b> derivatives was demonstrated on the Combes, Conrad-Limpach, and Gould-Jacobs methods yielding 4 -quinolones in a two-step one-pot reaction...|$|E
