50|$|Although Hefei was a <b>quiet</b> <b>market</b> town of {{only about}} 30,000 in the mid-1930s, its {{population}} grew more than tenfold in the following 20 years. The city's administrative role was strengthened by {{the transfer of the}} provincial government from Anqing in 1949, but much of its new growth derived from its development as an industrial city. A cotton mill was opened in 1958, and a thermal generating plant, using coal from Huainan, was established in the early 1950s. It also became the seat of an industry producing industrial chemicals and chemical fertilizers. In the late 1950s an iron and steel complex was built. In addition to a machine-tool works and engineering and agricultural machinery factories, the city has developed an aluminum industry and a variety of light industries.

5000|$|The {{coaching}} trade came to {{an abrupt}} halt in September 1838 when the London and Birmingham Railway was opened, which bypassed Towcester and passed through Blisworth; four miles away but enough to result in Towcester quickly reverting to being a <b>quiet</b> <b>market</b> town. By 1866 however, Towcester was linked to the national rail network by the first of several routes which came together to form the Stratford and Midland Junction Railway, known as the [...] "SMJ". Eventually, from Towcester railway station it was possible to travel four different ways out of the town: to Blisworth (opened May 1866); to Banbury (opened June 1872); to Stratford-upon-Avon (opened July 1873); and finally Olney (for access to Bedford, opened December 1892). The latter line however was an early casualty, closing to passengers in March 1893 although it continued to be used by race specials up until the outbreak of the Second World War. The Banbury line closed to passengers in July 1951 and the rest in April 1952. Goods traffic lingered on until final axing in February 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts. The site of Towcester railway station is now a Tesco supermarket.|$|E
40|$|Markets {{can show}} {{different}} types of dynamics, from <b>quiet</b> <b>markets</b> dominated by one or few products, to markets with constant penetration of new and reintroduced products. This paper explores the dynamics of markets from a psychological perspective using a multi-agent simulation model. The behavioural rules of the artificial consumers, the consumats, {{are based on a}} conceptual meta-theory from psychology. The artificial consumers have to choose each period between similar products. Products remain in the market as long as they maintain a minimum level of market share, else they will be replaced by a new product. Assuming a population of consumats with different preferences, and social networks, the model simulates adoption of new products for alternative assumptions on behavioural rules. Furthermore, the consequences of changing preferences and the size of social networks are explored. Results show that the behavioural rules that dominate the artificial consumer's decision making determine the resulting market dynamics, such as fashions, lock-in and unstable renewal. Results also show the importance of psychological variables like social networks, preferences and the need for identity to explain the dynamics of markets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Financial market {{observers}} {{have noted that}} during periods of high market volatility, correlations between asset prices can differ substantially from those seen in <b>quieter</b> <b>markets.</b> For example, correlations among yield spreads were substantially higher during the fall of 1998 than in earlier or later periods. Such differences in correlations have been attributed either to structural breaks in the underlying distribution of returns or to "contagion" across markets that occurs only during periods of market turbulence. However, we argue that the differences may reflect nothing more than time-varying sampling volatility. As noted by Boyer, Gibson and Loretan (1999), increases in the volatility of returns are generally accompanied {{by an increase in}} sampling correlations even when the true correlations are constant. We show that this result is not just of theoretical interest: When we consider quarterly measures of volatility and correlation for three pairs of asset returns, we find that the theoretical relationship can explain much of the movement in correlations over time. We then examine the implications of this link between measures of volatility and correlation for risk management, bank supervision, and monetary policy making. Stock market; Risk management...|$|R

The previous article was based on Watts and Strogatz's approach, which describes the small-world and clustering characteristics in networks. More recent research demonstrated that many large networks display a scale-free power-law distribution for node connectivity. In terms of market dynamics this may imply that a small proportion of consumers may have an exceptional influence on the consumptive behavior of others (hubs, or early adapters). We show that market dynamics is a self-organized property depending on the interaction between the agents' decision-making process (heuristics), the product characteristics (degree of satisfaction Of unit of consumption, visibility), and the structure of interactions between agents (size of network and hubs in a social network) ...|$|R

Throughout the years, {{there has been a}} steady commitment to incrementally reinvest in the assets of Lowertown. Instead of demolishing and building new, Lowertown remained committed to a slow, deliberate and steady approach to redevelopment. This approach allowed Lowertown to remain a relatively quiet neighborhood on the edge of downtown. Such an approach was particularly supportive of the artist community, as it respected the financial and environmental needs of working artists.

40|$|Market and {{engineering}} studies were performed for the world's only commercially available 3 kW class gas turbine generator, the IHI Aerospace Dynajet. The {{objectives of the}} market study were to determine the competitive requirements for small generators in various U. S. applications, assess the unit's current suitability for these applications, and recommend ways to modify performance or marketing practices {{to make it more}} competitive. Engineering study goals included developing an accurate cycle model and assessing the potential for performance improvement. The market study found that the current high selling price precludes competitiveness in most segments of the U. S. civil market. One potential exception may be the marine market, where price sensitivity is less of an issue and a premium is paid for quiet operation, a distinct advantage of the Dynajet. A gas turbine generator solution has more potential in the military market, where the difference from incumbent prices is smaller than in the civil market. The Dynajet is also an appealing military solution because of its high reliability and <b>quiet</b> operation. The <b>market</b> study concluded that increasing power output and efficiency while reducing purchase price would be the most effective approach to improved competitiveness. Alternatively, the current strengths could be leveraged by adapting it for use with an absorption cooler and by emphasizing its superior emission characteristics to consumers and regulators. The engineering study discovered that cycle performance is degraded by secondary nonidealities including flow leakage, heat leakage, and thermal flow distortion. Although these nonidealities are present to some degree in all gas turbines, their impacts are larger in small-scale engines. (cont.) The net effect of all nonidealities is a 61 percent reduction in power and 12 point decrease in overall efficiency. Analysis concluded {{that the best way to}} enhance Dynajet competitiveness is to reduce or remove those nonidealities that are straightforward to fix while increasing power output to either 3 or 5 kW. Output of 5 kW is most promising in terms of cost and weight competitiveness; however, such an improvement may require turbomachinery redesign. A short-term increase of power output to 3 kW appears practical from an engineering standpoint. by Mark A. Monroe. Thesis (S. M.)
