50|$|In a superconductor, {{the basic}} charge {{carriers}} are pairs of electrons (known as Cooper pairs), {{rather than the}} single electrons in a normal conductor. The total spin of a Cooper pair is an integer number, thus the Cooper pairs are bosons (while the single electrons in the normal conductor are fermions). Cooled bosons, contrary to cooled fermions, are allowed to occupy a single <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level,</b> in an effect known as the Bose-Einstein condensate. In a classical interpretation it would correspond to multiple particles occupying the same position in space and having an equal momentum, effectively behaving as a single particle.|$|E
50|$|In {{exothermic}} chemical reactions, {{the heat}} that is released by the reaction {{takes the form of}} electromagnetic energy. The transition of electrons from one <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> to another causes light to be released. This light is equivalent in energy to the stabilization energy of the energy for the chemical reaction, i.e. the bond energy. This light that is released can be absorbed by other molecules in solution to give rise to molecular vibrations or rotations, which gives rise to the classical understanding of heat. In contrast, when endothermic reactions occur, energy is absorbed to place an electron in a higher energy state, such that the electron can associate with another atom to form a chemical complex. Net energy is absorbed by an endothermic reaction. In an exothermic reaction, the energy needed to start the reaction is less than the energy that is subsequently released, so there is a net release of energy. This is the physical understanding of exothermic and endothermic reactions.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  4 a, the clear blueshift of the Raman {{spectrum}} was observed by external stress. With the stress increased from 0 to 5.13 × 10 − 3, the Raman peak was shifted from 267.32 to 268.08 cm− 1, {{which means that}} a stress of 438.2 MPa was generated on the RTD.

The smaller the distance between atoms, the larger the discrete energy level by the <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> theory [17], which means that the bandgap becomes wider with the stress and the PL peak becomes small.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} behaviour {{of simple}} harmonic motion {{can be found in}} numerous natural phenomena. Within the quantum realm of atomic, molecular and optical systems, two main features are associated with harmonic oscillations: a finite ground-state energy and equally spaced <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>levels.</b> Here it is shown that there is in fact a one-to-one mapping between the provision of equally spaced <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> and {{simple harmonic motion}}.

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} {{industry is}} a hot research field, massive attempts are going on {{all over the world}} to increase its productivity in different ways. One of the challenges for solar cells is the light spectrum mismatch losses, which referred to the part of solar spectrum that cannot be utilized to electricity by the conventional cells. Two ways have been suggested to overcome solar spectrum mismatch losses, the first is multi layered cells (tandem cells) with a different light behavior for each layer, and the second is spectrum conversion which is this researches subject. Spectral modification or conversion in solar cells industry has been studied and different lab scale models have been introduced. According to nanoscale journal, such technology may be the base of the next generation solar cells, mentioning specifically the use of luminescence down conversion and up conversion techniques to control the light spectrum on the solar cell, these endeavors targets to produce solar cells that is not subjugated to Shockley-Queisser maximum efficiency limit of 31 %. This research aims to draw a map of various ideas introduced to incorporate similar technologies in solar cell products, beside further suggestion to enhance its technical behavior and to push the commercialization of the technology forward. This is expected to reveal clear image about technology’s future development map for the upcoming studies, and to create a motivation for further studies towards a commercial production scale. The proposed commercialized model will result in enhancing the maximum theoretical efficiency limit to 48 % if all spectral mismatch loses have been eliminated. <b>Quantum</b> <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> diagrams have been illustrated to describe each model’s performance under a theoretical light spectrum...|$|E
