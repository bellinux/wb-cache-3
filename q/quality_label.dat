The following year, the Rolling Stones' Live'r Than You'll Ever Be, an audience recording of a late 1969 show, received a positive review in Rolling Stone.

The study was aimed at analysing the consumers’ awareness and perceived credibility of food <b>quality</b> <b>labels,</b> at revealing their willingness to pay a higher price for certified products, and at determining whether significant differences do exist in the way consumers perceive the food <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> based on their socio-demographic characteristics. The findings revealed a low awareness of food <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> A higher level of recognition as well as perceived credibility was proven for national <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> As the main problem were identified a poor information about <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> and lack of confidence that certified products have declared characteristics. Consumers show an interest in getting information about the topic, they also express a willingness to pay a slightly higher price for certified products if they trust them. Our findings confirmed that significant differences do exist between socio-demographic characteristics of respondents (gender, age, education, and responsibility for food purchases) and their attitudes toward the labels; no significant difference was found based on income...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTerritorial {{labelling}} {{of mountain}} food products {{serves as a}} marker of both product quality traits and cultural heritage. In mountain regions, the use of territorial labelling relates to competitiveness of farming enterprises and to the renewed attractiveness and identity of the territorial domain. A wide range of farming practices across European mountains, with a wealth of tradition and know-how, generates a variety of mountain products appreciated by consumers (EuroMARC, 2009; European Commission, 2011). However, farmers face difficulties in valorising this potential marketing advantage and in getting a fair price for their products (European Commission, 2009). The use of <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> has been proposed as a strategy to resolve this. To help promote their products, mountain actors across Europe {{use a variety of}} <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> linked to mountain territories. Territorial labels have the potential to structure and govern food chains and are conceptualised as processes of respatialization/relocalization of food systems studied in the literature on origin-based quality in the food sector. This literature contextualises the shift from production to quality-driven system in the specific histories and networks of territories (Allaire & Sylvander, 1997; Allaire, 2002, 2010); it is particularly interested in understanding how the regulatory frames underlying <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> are shaped by local organisational actors and generate collaborative structures (Allaire, 2002) ...|$|R
