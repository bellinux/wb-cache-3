B, Goedbals Pulse code modulation systems are increasingly important in speech communication. In such systems it may be expected that <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion</b> will be the predominant cause of signal impairment. The design of equipment to test and measure <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion</b> has, until now, been based on a- ' accumulation of successive ad hoc improvements. In the vork reported here, it has been sought to establish a formal and explicit structure of the requirements for meaningful atid precise <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion</b> measurement. the class of test systems in which signal and noise are separated in the time domain 1 has been analysed.

40|$|In digital systems, the {{amplitude}} {{of a time}} series is quantised with finite resolution. This is a nonlinear process which introduces distortion. We develop a Bayesian, model-based approach to reducing the <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion</b> when moving a time series, such as an audio signal, to a higher resolution medium. The signal is modelled as a discrete-time, continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) process of unknown order. The model parameters and reconstructed signal are estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. This requires samples {{to be drawn from}} a truncated multivariate Gaussian distribution, for which a Metropolis-Hastings approach is developed. 1. <b>QUANTISATION</b> <b>DISTORTION</b> For digital processing, transmission, or storage, a signal is represented as discrete in both time (due to sampling) and value (due to quantisation). The quantisation process introduces an error component, often referred to as ‘quantisation noise’. Since this quantisation error is signal-dependent, it is perhaps better described as <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion.</b> The distortion consists of a series of added harmonics, together with aliased images of them. For complicated signals, this can be quite innocuous, behaving very much like white noise. When the signal is simple, however, the structure becomes clear. Furthermore, the relative levels of the added harmonics (and their inharmonic aliases) vary significantly with small changes in the level of the input signal. This behaviour can be disturbing in music signals, especially with those instruments, such as pianos, whose note waveforms become more sinusoidal as they decay. This effect produces what is known as ‘granulation noise ’ [1]. Quantisation occurs both during analogue-to-digital conversion and during any subsequent manipulation of the digital signal that increases the word length, such as multiplication...|$|E

In this technique, an input signal is decomposed into a set of frequency bands by their proper analysis filter banks.

40|$|A bit-grouped digital {{transducer}} array loudspeaker with different numbers of nominally identical transducers for each bit has been developed. The direct digital-to-acoustic conversion process produces a sound field whose quality {{is shown to}} be spatially dependent and highly influenced by real effects including non-uniform transducer frequency responses, transducer mismatching, baffle size and room acoustics. Spatial sound pressure maps show that reducing the array size leads to improved reconstruction due to reduced phase distortion. For a given sampling rate and signal frequency, total harmonic distortion decreases as the listening distance is increased. A new criterion for the sweet-spot location in digital arrays is proposed based on {{the difference between the}} distortion introduced by path-length differences and the inherent <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion...</b>|$|E
40|$|A binary wavelet {{transform}} (BWT) has several distinct advantages over a real {{wavelet transform}} {{when applied to}} binary data. No <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion</b> is introduced and the transform is completely invertible. Since all the operations involved are modulo- 2 arithmetic, it is extremely fast. The outstanding qualities of the BWT make it suitable for binary image-processing applications. The BWT, originally designed for binary images, is extended to the lossless compression of grey-level images. An in-place implementation structure of the BWT is explored. Then, a simple embedded lossless BWT-based image-coding algorithm called progressive partitioning binary wavelet-tree coder (PPBWC) is proposed. The proposed algorithm is simple in concept and implementation, but achieves promising lossless compression efficiency {{as compared with the}} conventional bitplane scanning methods. Small alphabets in the arithmetic coding, non-causal adaptive context modelling and source division are the major factors that contribute to the gain of compression efficiency of the PPBWC. Experimental results show that the PPBWC outperforms most of other embedded coders in terms of coding efficiency. Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the transmission of}} video over third generation radio access networks. The {{first part of the}} thesis investigates the capabilities of Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (UTRAN) in terms of the provision of multimedia communications. The error performance and traffic requirements of real-time video transmission over circuit switched and packet switched connections are examined. The effect of network parameter settings upon video performances is evaluated, and optimum radio bearer configurations for the transmission of video are derived. A method of estimating received video quality after transmission over error prone environments is developed. The quality estimation is based on a distortion model, which accurately models the overall distortion seen in decoder frame reconstruction. This includes <b>quantisation</b> <b>distortion,</b> concealment distortion, and error propagation. Based on the developed performance model, optimum MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) size for efficient wireless video communications over a packet switched access network is derived. The second part of the thesis investigates quality enhancement techniques for multimedia traffic transmitted over wireless channels. Quality enhancement is achieved at three levels of the transmission process: link level, application level and system level. Link level quality enhancement techniques are designed to optimise the allocation of link level parameter values according to the media characteristics. A novel Unequal Error Protection scheme and a novel Unequal Power Allocation scheme are designed to exploit the inherent diversity in the subjective importance of different sections of compressed media. The algorithms are developed and analysed for transmission of video over 3 G wireless systems. The effectiveness of these algorithms is demonstrated through the results of simulated transmission over a UMTS channel. Application level quality enhancement techniques are designed to explore the time-varying nature of the wireless channel. A number of link adaptation schemes are proposed for real time video communication and real-time video streaming over 3 G wireless systems. These algorithms are designed to enhance the perceptual video quality, and the system utilisation. This is achieved by adapting the allocated radio network parameters and the source parameters, according to a feedback channel condition. Simulation results show a significant performance improvement compared to non-adaptive schemes. Finally, system level adaptation techniques are designed for efficient radio resource allocation in multi-user scenarios. Two adaptive resource allocation schemes are proposed and analysed for real-time video communications in a UMTS system. The proposed algorithms are shown to provide improved performances in terms of average received video quality and user satisfaction. Key words: Wireless Communication, Multimedia communication.
