40|$|This thesis makes {{contributions}} to a fundamental set of high dimensional {{problems in the}} following areas: (1) performance bounds for high dimensional estimation of structured Kronecker product covariance matrices, (2) optimal <b>query</b> <b>design</b> for a centralized collaborative controlled sensing system used for target localization, and (3) global convergence theory for decentralized controlled sensing systems. Separable approximations are effective dimensionality reduction techniques for high dimensional problems. In multiple modality and spatio-temporal signal processing, separable models for the underlying covariance are exploited for improved estimation accuracy and reduced computational complexity. In query- based controlled sensing, estimation performance is greatly optimized {{at the expense of}} <b>query</b> <b>design.</b> Multi-agent controlled sensing systems for target localization consist of a set of agents that collaborate to estimate the location of an unknown target. In the centralized setting, for a large number of agents and/or high- dimensional targets, separable representations of the fusion center’s query policies are exploited to maintain tractability. For large-scale sensor networks, decentralized estimation methods are of primary interest, under which agents obtain new noisy information as a function of their current belief and exchange local beliefs with their neighbors. Here, separable representations of the temporally evolving information state are exploited to improve robustness and scalability. The results improve upon the current state-of-the-art...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to review methods of <b>designing</b> <b>screening</b> experiments, ranging from designs {{originally}} developed for physical experiments to those especially tailored to experiments on numerical models. The strengths and weaknesses of the various <b>designs</b> for <b>screening</b> variables in numerical models are discussed. First, classes of factorial designs for experiments to estimate main effects and interactions through a linear statistical model are described, specifically regular and nonregular fractional factorial designs, supersaturated designs and systematic fractional replicate designs. Generic issues of aliasing, bias and cancellation of factorial effects are discussed. Second, group screening experiments are considered including factorial group screening and sequential bifurcation. Third, random sampling plans are discussed including Latin hypercube sampling and sampling plans to estimate elementary effects. Fourth, a variety of modelling methods commonly employed with <b>screening</b> <b>designs</b> are briefly described. Finally, a novel study demonstrates six screening methods on two frequently-used exemplars, and their performances are compared...|$|R

Specifically, we consider this as a framework for data management and include data functions as a means to support data analysis. We emphasise the interaction mechanisms that support both data management and analysis. In particular, we distinguish three types of interaction: the selection of an entity of primary interest, the selection of an extent of interest, and the insertion of data functions as a means for data analysis...|$|R

Our model is able to refine and update a given query while separately accumulating evidence for predicting the answer. Its architecture reflects this separation with dedicated embedding matrices and loosely connected information pathways (modules) for updating the query and accumulating evidence. This separation of responsibilities effectively decouples the search for query related support and the prediction of the answer. On recent benchmark datasets for reading comprehension, our model achieves state-of-the-art results. A qualitative analysis reveals that the model effectively accumulates weighted evidence from the query and over multiple support retrieval cycles which results in a robust answer prediction...|$|R
