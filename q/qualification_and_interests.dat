40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of grade 8 rotary mathematics on grade 9 achievement in mathematics. The study focussed on two main styles of mathematics instruction used in Ontario. One was the home room instruction of students, the other is rotary instruction. A newly developed questionnaire was completed by grade 8 mathematics teachers. Important information such as type of instruction, <b>qualifications,</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> was measured. Final marks in mathematics of students who had grade 8 teachers {{participating in the study}} were recorded. These same students, along with others, completed a mathematics entrance test for grade 9 students during the third or fourth week of the second semester of the 1998 / 1999 school year. No statistically significant differences were found in the achievement levels between the two groups.

Although each market is unique, comparative analyses of certification services across markets can yield useful insights into the value and consequences of mandatory audit of financial reports. Using a framework for analysis of certification services, we report: (1) descriptive data about certification activity for a range of private sector goods; (2) <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of experts who provide online certification or opinion for a fee; and (3) analysis of an online market for {{certification of}} baseball card. We find that (1) markets for certification services are ubiquitous in the economy, many with potential for conflicts of interest; (2) the grading scales vary from pass/fail to 100 points with greater use of the former by government agencies; (3) the unregulated market for baseball card certification is dominated by firms who also sell other services; (4) buyers of certification services are willing to pay more for stricter grading; and (5) the net returns to the purchase o...|$|R

30|$|However, {{there are}} two themes that only partly overlap. While a focus on {{practice}} does foreground a bias on doing, academics’ views are often framed or supported by educational theories and they express a shared passion for the scholarship {{of teaching and learning}} - themes also addressed under ‘reflection’. This is not surprising, as many of them have pedagogical degrees or training beyond their disciplinary <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> emphasise their <b>interest</b> in pedagogy. Educational theory consequently features in their interviews in that they see ‘teaching as a discipline’, seemingly contradicting the d.mindset, that argues that design thinkers prioritise practice over theory. As a young institution, the scholarship of teaching and learning has also been identified as one of the prime research areas supported by institutional funding mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper examines {{the status of}} entrepreneurship education in selected South African secondary schools to determine the impact thereof on young learners’ attitude towards entrepreneurship and their future plans. It highlights some challenges facing youth entrepreneurship development in Sedibeng secondary schools. The study {{is based on the}} attitude approach to entrepreneurship research and discusses the results of an empirical study involving 1 748 grade 10 learners. South African youth appear to have a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship and the existence of opportunities for new venture creation, but seem to have inflated expectations with respect to their future academic <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> less <b>interest</b> than would be expected in starting their own businesses. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that entrepreneurship education in the sample schools was largely infrequent and without depth or focus. The results indicated that catalytic factors, such as exposure to entrepreneurship at school and having self-employed parents, have not had any effect on learners in the sample, thus re-emphasising the urgent need for entrepreneurship training programmes of value. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research on entrepreneurship education in South African secondary schools...|$|R

40|$|A ZBTE journal article. The study {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} role of the Zimbabwe Teachers’ Association in the professional and academic development of teachers. The aim of the study is to increase the reader’s knowledge and understanding of the association and to explore its changing role. Having been {{an active member of the}} Southern Rhodesia African Teachers’ Association (S. R. A. T. A.) from 1961 to 1964, the author also attempts to assess the progress that has been made over the past thirty years and to describe the possibilities and problems of the association. Information was obtained through a study of the association’s published documents, literature searches on professional education and organizations, personal contacts and interviews with some members of the association and the National Executive in Harare. The study revealed that whereas teachers were trying to assume control of their own professional development, they were, to a large extent, unable to influence their conditions of service, partly because ZIMTA is an association as opposed to a union and partly because of Zimbabwe’s desire to make education one of the basic rights in the country. This has entailed the recruitment of everyone who is willing and able to teach and with the minimum academic <b>and</b> professional <b>qualifications.</b> Entry into <b>and</b> exit from the profession has thus become difficult to control. The study further revealed that the association has not yet gained a strong and relevant role in the vetting of unsuitable and under-qualified members. It was also noted that the existence of the Zimbabwe Teachers’ Union (ZITU) prevented the articulation of a unified position on a number of important issues. The problems that militate against professionalism were identified as many and varied. They include hot seating, the low status enjoyed by the teaching profession because of uncompetitive salaries, the fragmentation of the teaching force as evidenced by membership either to ZIMTA or ZITU, inadequate support in the classroom, inadequate parental support and ill-conceived teacher development and inservice programmes. The author argues that in order for ZIMTA to be regarded as representative of the majority of teachers, it will have to embark on a vigorous and sustained membership drive, draft a constitution which articulates the aspirations of a wide spectrum of teachers with varying <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests,</b> achieve a standardisation of entry qualifications for all teacher preparation programmes, continue to provide opportunities for its members to acquire concepts, attitudes, skills, knowledge and dispositions necessary for effective teaching, lobby parliamentarians for the enactment of education legislation in which teaching will be recognised as a genuine profession. Above all, it will have to work more zealously for the professional, social and material welfare of its members. Failure to maintain the delicate balance between its professional and trade union roles would result in depressed morale and act as a disincentive to professional development...|$|R

For example, going back to our scenario, students could list their medical career interests. Learners also complete a Career Readiness survey in order to measure their Career Dispositions. These are the generic skills that engenders the professional and deontological behaviors. In a previous work, we addressed this stage of career-readiness through the provision of an online instrument for collecting self-assessment data to produce willing, confident and creative lifelong learners (Atif et al. 2014). The provided instrument presents a storehouse view of career dispositionsthrough an integrated portal which captures self-stated learning experiences and converts them into analytical results. The outcome of this stage roots out deficiencies in dispositions for the targeted practice and prescribe improvement recommendations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Practitioner Research and Collaboration Initiative (PRACI) is an innovative, multi-modality practice-based {{research}} network (PBRN) {{that represents}} fourteen complementary medicine (CM) professions across Australia. It {{is the largest}} known PBRN for complementary healthcare {{in the world and}} was launched in 2015. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an update on the progress of the PRACI project, including a description of the characteristics of PRACI members in order to facilitate further sub-studies through the PRACI PBRN. Methods A CM workforce survey was distributed electronically to CM practitioners across fourteen disciplines, throughout Australia. Practitioners electing to become a member of PRACI were registered on the PBRN database. The database was interrogated and the data analysed to described sociodemographic characteristics, practice characteristics, professional <b>qualification</b> <b>and</b> practice <b>interest</b> of PRACI members. Results Foundational members of PRACI were found to be predominately female (76. 2 %) and middle-aged (82. 5 %). Members were primarily located in urban settings (82. 5 %) across the Eastern seaboard of Australia (82. 5 %), with few working remotely. The main modalities represented include massage therapists (58. 5 %), naturopaths (26. 4 %) and nutritionists (14. 4 %). The primary area of clinical interest for PRACI members were general health and well-being (75. 4 %), musculoskeletal complaints (72 %) and pain management (62. 6 %). Conclusions PRACI provides an important infrastructure for complementary healthcare research in Australia and its success relies on CM practitioners being involved in the research being conducted through the PBRN. The aim of this database is to ensure that the research conducted through PRACI is rigorous, robust, clinically relevant and reflects the diversity of clinical practice amongst CM practitioners in Australia...|$|R
