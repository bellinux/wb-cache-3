5000|$|Poc: A <b>Quaker</b> <b>parakeet,</b> and Zou's {{constant}} companion. It {{is unclear}} whether he is considered a pet or a [...] "person", since several signs of anthropomorphism are shown in his character, and yet he cannot talk. Also, {{it seems like the}} show's conception of [...] "humans" [...] is reserved to zebras only. He lives inside what looks like a cuckoo clock in Zou's bedroom.|$|E
5000|$|Conures and {{all other}} New World parrots are often placed in a {{subfamily}} or tribe Arinae. Internal relationships of conures are poorly understood though it seems evident that, to make them a natural grouping, the <b>quaker</b> <b>parakeet,</b> the thick-billed parrot, and Brotogeris should be included, and often are. Neotropical parrots, macaws, and other are also candidates potential for inclusion. In this scheme, [...] "conure" [...] comprises members of the genera: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{gardens are}} {{also home to}} a small {{collection}} of exotic birds {{from around the world}} including the white-cheeked turaco, Himalayan monals, azure-winged magpies and <b>quaker</b> <b>parakeets.</b> Most birds are located in the white-domed lawn aviary building that provides a focal point on the main lawn. There is also a wetlands enclosure that contains ornamental waterfowl including different species of ducks. Some of the birds have been at the gardens a very long time including a sulphur-crested cockatoo called Jenny that has been entertaining visitors with her chatter for over 30 years. There is always at least one peacock roaming wild in the grounds. There is also a seasonal butterfly house.|$|R
40|$|Captive animals lead {{lives that}} are {{extremely}} limited in activity compared to conspecifics in the wild. To {{compensate for the}} lack of stimulation compared to the wild, enrichment supplementation is standard practice at the Schubot Center at Texas A&M University. Enhancing animal enrichment is becoming an increasingly important topic among many in the zoological and veterinary communities as an escalating amount of animals are kept in captivity. Static toys are often used in enrichment, but often become monotonous, are destroyed, or do not provide adequate stimulation for the animal to thrive. In order to provide a more sustainable form of animal enrichment, a digital enrichment device was developed and tested using two <b>Quaker</b> <b>Parakeets,</b> Myiopsitta monachus. This digital enrichment, or digital toy, was utilized {{as a part of the}} birds? normal care to offer a game that could not be destroyed by the animal, while also providing fluctuating mental stimulation. This enrichment consisted of a game that automatically recorded information about the bird?s interactions via a tablet and provided insight into each birds? learning rate. The individuals were compared using chi square analysis, comparison of means, and linear regression to detect the variability of response to enrichment. Both birds interacted with the device and were successful in playing the game on the computer screen, but during different times in the trials. The male was more active (measured as vocalizations per second) overall, but took more sessions to be at peak activity, while the female started at a slightly higher interaction rate but slightly decreased over time. The male also began having high accuracy (measured as hits/ total responses), but declined over trials, while the female increased her accuracy. Though there must be further studies conducted on this technology to provide a stronger base, this design shows feasibility of digital toys for sustainable enrichment for animals in captivity, and using digital enrichment toys as a method for data collection within animal research. ...|$|R
50|$|The austral parakeet, austral conure, or emerald parakeet (Enicognathus ferrugineus) is {{a parrot}} found from the {{southern}} tip of South America - further south than any other parrot - to as far north as Temuco. It is a fairly large conure, 35 cm (2 cm more than a monk or <b>quaker</b> <b>parakeet).</b> It is primarily green, lightly barred, with some dull red on the forehead and lores, belly, and upper tail, with {{the northern part of the}} range displaying less red.|$|E
