Cassiterite from Sn–W <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> is richer in Ti and poorer in Nb and Nb + Ta than cassiterite from granitic pegmatite. Wolframite from Sn–W <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> is enriched in ferberite component. The Sn–W <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> contain pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, stannite, matildite and schapbachite and the Ba–Pb–Zn <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> have cobaltite, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, galena and barite, which {{were analyzed by}} electron microprobe. The presently abandoned mining area was exploited for Sn, W, Ba and Pb until 1953. Stream sediments and soils have higher concentrations of metals than parent granites and schists. Sn, W, B, As and Cu anomalies found in stream sediments and soils are associated with Sn–W <b>quartz</b> <b>veins,</b> while Ba, Pb and Zn anomalies in stream sediments and soils are related to Ba–Pb–Zn <b>quartz</b> <b>veins.</b> Sn, W, B, As, Cu, Ba, Pb and Zn anomalies in stream sediments and soils are also related to the respective old mining activities, which increased the mobility of trace metals from mineralized veins to soils, stream sediments and waters. Stream sediments and soils are sinks of trace elements, which depend on their contents in mineralized veins and weathering processes, but Sn, Wand B depend mainly on a mechanic process. Soils {{must not be used}} for agriculture and human residence due to their Sn, B, As and Ba contents.

It is situated in a vertical dipping <b>quartz</b> <b>vein</b> network that is [...] long and has a maximum width of [...] Two types of mineralization exist, one type being auriferous quartz-carbonate veins with combinations of pyrite, galena, sphalerite and chalcopyrite present. The other is a simpler <b>quartz</b> <b>vein</b> {{with a combination of}} chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and pyrite mineralization. The auriferous pyrite-sulfide quartz veins are the most important mineral structures and most of the underground development work was performed on them, including the Beanland Vein. These quartz veins are on the southeastern margin of the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone, which is known for a high frequency of gold occurrences.|$|E
2500|$|Along {{the southeastern}} {{margin of the}} Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone lies the {{abandoned}} Beanland Mine property.

2500|$|Gold {{and copper}} values occupy a northeast-trending iron {{formation}} within the Net Lake-Vermilion Lake Deformation Zone. This mineralization is only known to exist southeast of Cooke Lake and immediately south of Net Lake. A unit of chert, magnetite and pyrrhotite outcrops along the southwest shore of Net Lake at Temagami North. Pyrrhotite, {{the most common}} sulfide mineral, occurs as small veins and disseminations. Small amounts of pyrite, sphalerite and exsolved pentlandite and chalcopyrite are present with the pyrrhotite. The main exposure lies immediately south of the Kanichee Mine Road, which branches off Highway 11. Minor gold and copper values constitute this zone. This sulfide-bearing unit is located within felsic volcanic rocks of the Older Volcanic Complex and is capped by large, dark green, iron-rich tholeiitic basalts of the Arsenic Lake Formation. It has been interpreted that the sulfide zone represents a volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit based {{on the structure of}} the sulfide zone and the associated rock types. These ore deposits are created by volcanic-associated hydrothermal events in submarine environments. However, there is evidence that the sulfide mineralization does not have a volcanogenic origin. An unusual feature of this sulfide deposit is the large degree of magnetite at the actual showing. Studies have shown that the chert-magnetite iron formations in the West and North Pits of Sherman Mine extend under and along a series of small lakes from Vermillion Lake to Net Lake. These iron formations are located at roughly the same stratigraphic position as the magnetite-bearing iron formation on the southwestern shore of Net Lake. A northwest-trending cross fault is accompanied by drag folding of a chert-magnetite iron formation unit southeast of Cooke Lake. Also exposed in this area is a dark yellow [...] wide <b>quartz</b> <b>vein</b> composed of pyrite that cross cuts the iron formation at the northeastern end.

This also indicates that all of the fluid inclusions in the samples are contemporaneous. Four different phases of fluid inclusions were found.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand skarn-porphyry transitions in order to use exposed skarns to look for associated and potentially larger porphyries. For such purposes, a good start is to understand the transition between porphyry and skarn in known deposits. In this contribution, we report the transition at Antamina, Peru, where skarns occur in and around a Miocene complex comprised of more than seven porphyritic intrusions. There are three types of skarn-porphyry relationships. The earliest intrusive phase, PlA, contains both endoskarn and porphyry-style <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> with secondary biotite halos. The porphyry <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> and endoskarns formed at the same time. Locally, the intrusion contains only endoskarn without porphyry <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> and is surrounded by exoskarns in carbonate wall rocks. In the third scenario, later porphyry (P 2) intruding into PlA porphyry and skarns related to PlA contains abundant granular <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> and secondary biotite alteration but does not have significant endoskarn. The granular <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> also extend into earlier P 1 A skarns. The scarcity of endoskarn associated with P 2 is related to the supply of Ca. The earliest PIA intrusion intruded into carbonates that supplied abundant Ca, therefore both endoskarns and exoskarns formed. In contrast, where the wall rocks of the later P 2 intrusion are PlA or skarn related to PlA, there was little free Ca, therefore only porphyry-style <b>quartz</b> <b>veins</b> formed...|$|R

I do {{not know}} whether any of you were {{interested}} enough in the little note in my catalogue on this view near Blair Athol, to look for the scene itself during your summer rambles. If any did, and found it, I am nearly certain their impression would be only that of an extreme wonder how Turner could have made so little of so beautiful a spot. The projecting rock, when I saw it last in 1857, and I am certain, when Turner saw it, was covered with lichens having as many colors as a painted window. The stream--or rather powerful and deep Highland river, the Tilt--foamed and eddied magnificently through the narrowed channel; and the wild vegetation in the rock crannies was a finished arabesque of living sculpture, of which this study of mine, made on another stream, in Glenfinlas, only a few miles away, will give you a fair idea. Turner has absolutely stripped the rock of its beautiful lichens to bare slate, with one <b>quartz</b> <b>vein</b> running up through it; he has quieted the river into a commonplace stream; he has given, of all the rich vegetation, only one cluster of quite uninteresting leaves and a clump of birches with ragged trunks.
