5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} <b>quiescence</b> {{followed}} after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This <b>quiescence</b> {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of <b>quiescence,</b> whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell <b>quiescence</b> in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an analogous RMS in humans {{has been difficult to}} identify, possibly because the olfactory bulb is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study, and much of the previous scientific work has been called into question concerning the RMS in humans. In the developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants, chains of immature neurons typical of the RMS were observed. However, there was little evidence for the existence of a migrating chain along the SVZ or olfactory peduncle to the bulb in the adult human brain, even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in the SVZ. These researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during surgery or during autopsies. They discovered that cells that expressed DCX (doublecortin) and PSA-NCAM are present in the brain sections taken from infants, but have disappeared by 18 months. Yet further studies indicated the {{presence of}} a small population of migrating immature neurons, which originate solely from the SVZ. These neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains, in contrast to the elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in the rodent RMS. This suggests that the RMS is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood, but is not absent. However, a direct correlation between stem cell <b>quiescence</b> and age has not yet been defined due to a high level of variability between individuals. Thus an RMS analogous structure in the adult human brain remains highly controversial.|$|E

25|$|Numerous Sufi traditions place {{emphasis}} upon a meditative procedure {{which comes from}} the cognitive aspect {{to one of the}} two principal approaches {{to be found in the}} Buddhist traditions: that of the concentration technique, involving high-intensity and sharply focused introspection. In the Oveyssi-Shahmaghsoudi Sufi order, for example, this is particularly evident, where muraqaba takes the form of tamarkoz, the latter being a Persian term that means concentration. Meditative <b>quiescence</b> is said to have a quality of healing, and—in contemporary terminology—enhancing creativity.|$|E
25|$|Under Crusader rule, Jews {{were not}} allowed to hold land and {{involved}} themselves in commerce in the coastal towns during times of <b>quiescence.</b> Most of them were artisans: glassblowers in Sidon, furriers and dyers in Jerusalem. At this time there were Jewish communities scattered all over the country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. In line with trail of bloodshed the Crusaders left in Europe on their way to liberate the Holyland, in Palestine, both Muslims and Jews were indiscriminately massacred or sold into slavery.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish Netherlands {{would later}} become the main theatre of the war, but during the conflict’s early stages in 1689, it was {{considered}} only a secondary front. This <b>quiescence</b> was because the main protagonists were busy elsewhere: King William was occupied with political matters in England and a Jacobite rebellion in Scotland, whilst King Louis was busy along the Rhine where the powerful German princes were preparing their forces to push the French army back towards the Rhine, and reverse all their earlier setbacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{consists}} of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided, and cytokinesis, in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase {{is dependent on the}} proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of <b>quiescence</b> called G0 phase.|$|E

On 17 December, after weeks of <b>quiescence,</b> the Luftwaffe made a major effort to support its surprise attack in the Ardennes (the Battle of the Bulge). In 21st Army Group's sector the Maas and Waal bridges were attacked by waves of Bf 109 and Fw 190 fighter-bombers operating at low level (below radar and HAA), {{which had to be}} engaged by LAA guns. Further low-level sweeps followed on 24 December.|$|E
25|$|The island {{developed}} initially from {{a submarine}} volcano from the Pleistocene epoch that constructed small calderas and numerous pyroclastic cones. Following {{a long period}} of <b>quiescence</b> beginning about 200,000 years ago, several young phreatomagmatic craters and associated lava flows erupted during the Holocene epoch, including two about 3000 years ago. The Funda de Lajes tuff ring formed about 3150 years ago, accompanied by a lava flow that traveled toward the southeast reach the area of Lajes. The Caldeira Comprida tuff ring in Caldeira Seca (west-central Flores) later, at about 2900 years ago, producing a lava flow that traveled towards the region of Fajã Grande.|$|E

In Haifa, the Jews almost single-handedly defended the town against the Crusaders, holding out for a month, (June–July 1099). At this time there were Jewish communities scattered all over the country, including Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. As Jews were not allowed to hold land during the Crusader period, they worked at trades and commerce in the coastal towns during times of <b>quiescence.</b> Most were artisans: glassblowers in Sidon, furriers and dyers in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{peculiar}} systems in Lyra is MV Lyrae, a nova-like star consisting of a red dwarf and a white dwarf. Originally classified as a VY Sculptoris star due to spending most time at maximum brightness, since around 1979 the system has been dominantly at minimum brightness, with periodic outbursts. Its nature is still not fully understood. Another outbursting star is AY Lyrae, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova that has undergone several superoutbursts. Of the same type is V344 Lyrae, notable for an extremely short period between superoutbursts coupled {{with one of the}} highest amplitudes for such a period. The true nova HR Lyrae flared in 1919 to a maximum magnitude of 6.5, over 9.5 magnitudes higher than in <b>quiescence.</b> Some of its characteristics {{are similar to those of}} recurring novae.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of April, the German Higher Command expected a French offensive from the Ailette to Reims but the <b>quiescence</b> of the French artillery east of Reims, led to no serious operation against Nogent l'Abbesse or Moronvilliers being anticipated. During Easter, General Chales de Beaulieu, the XIV Corps commander and the general commanding the 214th Division at Moronvilliers, briefed his subordinates that only artillery demonstrations were likely, between Reims and Aubérive. General von Gersdorf, the 58th Division commander, disagreed with the corps commander, which led to his resignation. The German defences were held by the 30th, 58th, 214th and 29th divisions from east to west. The 29th and 58th divisions {{were considered to be}} of high quality but the 214th Division was new division and its troops had had little opportunity for training; the 30th Division was considered to have one good and two indifferent regiments.|$|E
25|$|An early {{example of}} the {{doctrine}} of spiritual evolution is found in Samkhya, one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, that goes back more than two and a half thousand years (although its present form dates to around the 4th or 5th century c.e.). Unlike most types of classic Hinduism, the traditional Samkhyan philosophy is atheistic and dualistic. Pure spirit (called purusha) comes into proximity with prakriti (psychophysical nature), disturbing its equilibrium. As a result, the original root-prakriti (mulaprakriti) undergoes a series of progressive transformations or unfoldings, in the form of successive essences called tattvas. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. The goal of evolution however is, paradoxically, the release of purusha and the return to the unmanifest condition. Hence everything is tending towards a goal of spiritual <b>quiescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seed {{dormancy}} has {{two main}} functions: {{the first is}} synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, herbivory) does not result {{in the death of}} all offspring of a plant (bet-hedging). Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment. Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed <b>quiescence</b> occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} the Times Literary Supplement dated 4 September 1941 stated {{that there was a}} [...] "note of <b>quiescence,</b> even of bleak resignation" [...] in the poem and that it [...] "lost that spice of wit which was woven into the logic of the earlier poems". Later, Bernard Bergonzi claimed that [...] "The Dry Salvages is the least {{satisfactory}} of the sequence, though {{at the same time it}} contains some of its best lines. The opening lines are poor, in a weakly sub-Whitmanesque fashion. Yet the writing suddenly picks up at the words, 'The river is within us,' and from there to the end of the section we have a magnificently sustained sequence". F. B. Pinion believed that [...] "'The Dry Salvages' is a complicated, uneven, and rather prosy poem, in which Eliot continues to say the same thing, with some progression, mainly in maritime imagery".|$|E
500|$|Senescence, an {{irreversible}} {{process in which}} the cell no longer divides, is a protective response to the shortening of the chromosome ends. The telomeres are long regions of repetitive noncoding DNA that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division (see Hayflick limit). In contrast, <b>quiescence</b> is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage (see cell cycle). Senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism, which serves as a [...] "last resort" [...] mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro-growth cellular signaling. Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor (see cancer), which is potentially lethal to an organism. Therefore, the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered {{to be part of a}} strategy of protection against cancer.|$|E
500|$|RZ Gruis is {{a binary}} system of {{apparent}} magnitude 12.3 with occasional dimming to 13.4, whose components—a white dwarf and main sequence star—are thought to orbit each other roughly every 8.5 to 10 [...] hours. It {{belongs to the}} UX Ursae Majoris subgroup of cataclysmic variable star systems, where material from the donor star is drawn to the white dwarf where it forms an accretion disc that remains bright and outshines the two component stars. The system is poorly understood, though the donor star has been calculated to be of spectral type F5V. These stars have spectra very similar to novae that have returned to <b>quiescence</b> after outbursts, yet {{they have not been}} observed to have erupted themselves. The American Association of Variable Star Observers recommends watching them for future events. CE Gruis (also known as Grus V-1) is a faint (magnitude 18–21) star system also composed of a white dwarf and donor star; in this case the two are so close they are tidally locked. Known as polars, material from the donor star does not form an accretion disc around the white dwarf, but rather streams directly onto it.|$|E
500|$|The most {{influential}} {{of the contemporary}} reports came from Citizen Boullemer, and was published in over 1000 pamphlets later in the year. Boullemer claimed {{to be among the}} few surviving eyewitnesses: [...] "there arrived from all exits of the city, five to six thousand peasants, women and children, armed [...] guns, scythes, knives, shovels and pikes. [...] They shouted, running the streets: peace! [...] peace!" [...] Boullemer's account continues: they descended on Machecoul, confronted a detachment of the National guard that had come to enforce the levy. One hundred National Guardsmen and police defended the town against them. Louis-Charles-César Maupassant, a farmer, merchant and a deputy to the Convention, tried to harangue the attackers into <b>quiescence,</b> but could not be heard above the din. [...] Most of the Republican troops and officials scattered [...] before the threatening crowd. [...] According to Louis Mortimer-Ternaux, another eye-witness, only three officers and five or six gendarmes remained at their posts. [...] At that time, according to him, some national guardsmen who had tried to escape through an alley were ambushed by peasants, pursued, and finally brought down by the crowd {{at the feet of the}} deputy, Maupassant. [...] The crowd then pulled him off his horse and killed him with a stroke of a shovel.|$|E

2500|$|In {{some species}} of spiders, such as Agelenopsis aperta, the male induces a passive {{state in the}} female prior to {{copulation}} It has been hypothesized {{that the cause of}} this [...] "quiescent" [...] state is the male's massaging of the female's abdomen, following male vibratory signals on the web. The female enters a passive state, and the male's risk of facing cannibalism is reduced. This state is most likely induced {{as a result of a}} male volatile pheromone. The chemical structure of the pheromone utilized by the male A. aperta is currently unknown; however, physical contact is not necessary for the induced passive state. Eunuch males, or males with partially or fully removed palps, are unable to induce the passive state on females from a distance, but [...] can induce <b>quiescence</b> upon physical contact with the female; this suggests that the pheromone produced is potentially related to sperm production, since the male inserts sperm from his pedipalps, structures which are removed in eunuchs.

Liberalism has oriented social democratic goals to security, as where Tage Erlander, prime minister from 1946 to 1969, described security as [...] "too big {{a problem for}} the individual to solve with only his own power". Up to the 1980s, when neoliberalism began to provide an alternative, aggressively pro-capitalist model for ensuring social <b>quiescence,</b> the SAP was able to secure capital's co-operation by convincing capital that it shared the goals of increasing economic growth and reducing social friction. For many social democrats, Marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future. In 1889, Hjalmar Branting, leader of the SAP from its founding to his death in 1925, asserted, [...] "I believe … that one benefits the workers...so much more by forcing through reforms which alleviate and strengthen their position, than by saying that only a revolution can help them." [...] Some observers have argued that this liberal aspect has hardened into increasingly neoliberal ideology and policies, gradually maximizing the latitude of powerful market actors. Certainly, neoclassical economists have been firmly nudging the Social Democratic Party into capitulating to most of capital's traditional preferences and prerogatives, which they term [...] "modern industrial relations". Both socialist and liberal aspects of the party were influenced by the dual sympathies of early leader Hjalmar Branting, and manifest in the party's first actions: reducing the work day to eight hours and establishing the franchise for working-class people.|$|E
