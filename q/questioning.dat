5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{relationship}} between a tutor’s advice and a student’s <b>questionings,</b> and the way in which it develops a student’s self-regulation skill. Firstly we offer that a tutor’s advice is one component that trains a student’s self-regulation skill. Through analysis of interactive learning opportunities between academic departments, we discovered that a tutor’s advice transformed a student’s <b>questionings.</b> This transformation indicates an appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill. We propose a model for further development of a student’s self-regulation skill, which is based on the appropriation by the student of the tutor’s self-regulation skill...|$|R

5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka <b>questioning</b> the {{accuracy}} of the Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E
