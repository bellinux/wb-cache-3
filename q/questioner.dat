5|$|The {{debate among}} monks unfolds in the {{presence}} of their teachers, with a very well set rules of procedure for the defender and the questioners. The tradition of such debates is traced to the ancient ‘Hindu Orthodoxy’ in India and this practice permeated into Buddhist orthodoxy in Tibet in the eighth century. Such debates usually take place within the monastery’s precincts. The defender has the onus to prove his point of view on the subject proposed for debate. The debate opens with an invocation to Manjushri recited in a loud and high pitched tone. The roles of the debater and the <b>questioner</b> are well defined; the <b>questioner</b> has to succinctly present his case (all on Buddhism related topics) and the defender has to answer within a fixed time frame. The finality of the debate is with specific answers like: “I accept (do), the reason is not established (ta madrup) or there is no pervasion (Kyappa majung)”. Many a time, the questions mooted are meant to mislead the defender. If the defender does not reply within a time frame, an expression of derision is witnessed. In the Tibetan debating sessions, there is no role for a witness and there is normally no adjudicator. This leads to “conflicting opinions of participants and listeners.” When there is direct contradiction on the defenders part, the outcome is, however, formally decided.|$|E
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new question is asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a question is answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the <b>questioner</b> by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for the question to be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead <b>questioner</b> has two more questions permitted, referred to as supplementary questions. These questions may be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|E
25|$|Lee next {{answered}} {{a question about}} homosexuality at a Young PAP meeting in 2007. The <b>questioner</b> was Loretta Chen, an openly lesbian young PAP member and a bilingual theatre director in Singapore. She asked if the current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed {{in the next two}} decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors about homosexuality and had been told that it was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E
25|$|Conservative MP Colonel Howard Vincent {{questioned}} Gladstone in the Commons on {{what his}} government would do about unemployment on 1 September 1893. Gladstone replied: I cannot help regretting that the honourable and gallant Gentleman has felt it {{his duty to}} put the question. It is put under circumstances that naturally belong {{to one of those}} fluctuations in the condition of trade which, however unfortunate and lamentable they may be, recur from time to time. Undoubtedly I think that questions of this kind, whatever be the intention of the <b>questioner,</b> have a tendency to produce in the minds of people, or to suggest to the people, that these fluctuations can be corrected by the action of the Executive Government. Anything that contributes to such an impression inflicts an injury upon the labouring population.|$|E

500|$|Balked again, Butler {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} campaign personal, calling Tillman a liar and trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a <b>questioner</b> who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, [...] "Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why I took them , and I'll meet you wherever you want to. I took them because I, as governor of the State, {{could not afford to}} create a row at a public meeting and have our people murder each other like dogs." ...|$|E
500|$|At the October 21 Florida GOP Debate, after expressing that <b>questioner</b> Carl Cameron {{was trying}} to divide the Republican Party, Hunter raised an issue he thought might bring the {{participants}} together. He reminisced of the time, he felt the [...] "Democrat Party [...] lost its identity". He compared the Kennedy administration's failed Bay of Pigs Invasion with President Ronald Reagan's actions in El Salvador. He described Reagan's El Salvador policy as successful in advancing freedom, and noted that as he spoke, the military of El Salvador was [...] "fighting {{side by side with}} our guys (The United States military) in Iraq." [...] He then referred to the Republican Party as [...] "the Party of Freedom." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the <b>questioner</b> settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E

500|$|In 1950, Tawfik Toubi, an Arab {{member of}} the Knesset, {{raised the issue of}} the {{internally}} displaced refugees of al-Birwa in the Knesset, demanding that they be allowed to return to their homes. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion replied in the negative, stating, [...] "The <b>questioner</b> presented the facts inaccurately. Birwa is an abandoned village which was destroyed in the fighting. Its inhabitants cooperated with Kaukji's gangs. The Israel Defense Forces and the government did not treat them as they deserved, but permitted them to remain in villages near Birwa, and to become residents of Israel. The government of Israel treats them as it does the other residents of Israel and those lacking means of subsistence. A special body was established to deal with these refugees, to resettle and rehabilitate them, not necessarily in their former villages, and the resettlement of the refugees in Nazareth has already begun." [...] In December 1951, the village site was declared a closed military zone.|$|E
500|$|The first {{legislation}} {{recommended by}} the Social Credit Board included the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act, which provided for provincial licensing and supervision of banks, the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act, which prohibited unlicensed banks and their employees from instigating legal proceedings, and the Judicature Act, which prohibited challenges to the constitutionality of Alberta legislation. [...] Hugill {{did not believe that}} the acts were within the province's legislative competence, but avoided saying so publicly. [...] In response to a question posed in the legislature on the province's authority over banking, he said that he could not conclusively answer such an academic question, but referred the <b>questioner</b> to the British North America Act, 1867. [...] In a caucus meeting, in response to a request from Aberhart that he [...] " [...] us that he feels in a position on every count to recommend that the Lieutenant-Governor gives his assent to every Social Credit Measure", Hugill was more open in his beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Once the {{practice}} of giving kvitelach was established in Hasidic courts, it was treated very seriously. There were cases where Hasidic Jews hired a non-Jew to ride or travel to the Rebbe on Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath) to deliver a kvitel for a Jew who was ill, a clear violation of the Shabbat laws. Rabbi Sholom Mordechai Schwadron (1835–1911) once responded to a <b>questioner</b> who asked whether a Jew could send a telegram {{on behalf of a}} sick person on Shabbat: [...] "In my hometown of Zlatshev, there was a desperately sick person. When the Belzer Rebbe (the Rebbe of the Belz Hasidic dynasty, Rabbi Sholom Rokeach) was in Brod for Shabbat, the local rabbi allowed the Jews to have a gentile write the name of the sick person and his mother's name and send this kvitel to Brod." [...] This action was vehemently protested by Rabbi Shlomo Kluger {{as well as by the}} Belzer Rebbe, and the rabbi was removed from his post.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You may, sir,' replied Mr Crummles, looking {{steadily}} in his <b>questioner's</b> face, as some men {{do when they}} have doubts about being implicitly believed in {{what they are going}} to say. 'She is ten years of age, sir.' ...|$|R
500|$|Parliamentary time is {{also set}} aside for {{question}} periods in the debating chamber. A [...] "General Question Time" [...] takes place on a Thursday between 11:40a.m. and noon where members can direct questions to {{any member of the}} Scottish Government. At 2:30pm, a 40-minute-long themed [...] "Question Time" [...] takes place, where members can ask questions of ministers in departments that are selected for questioning that sitting day, such as health and justice or education and transport. Between noon and 12:30p.m. on Thursdays, when Parliament is sitting, First Minister's Question Time takes place. This gives members an opportunity to question the First Minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction. Opposition leaders ask a general question of the First Minister and then supplementary questions. Such a practice enables a [...] "lead-in" [...] to the <b>questioner,</b> who then uses their supplementary question to ask the First Minister a question on any issue. The five general questions available to opposition leaders are: ...|$|E
500|$|At BlizzCon 2015, one <b>questioner</b> asked Metzen {{about the}} {{presence}} of gay heroes in the Overwatch universe; he confirmed that there were such characters, but elaborated, [...] "we want it to play out organically, we don't want it to be a data point or feel contrived in any way". In December 2016, Tracer became the first Overwatch hero to be canonically revealed as LGBT in Reflections, an issue of the Overwatch digital comic; she specifically identifies as a lesbian. In the comic, she is seen in a romantic relationship with Emily, a woman who {{is not part of the}} Overwatch team. Of this reveal, Blizzard stated, [...] "as in real life, having variety in our characters and their identities and backgrounds helps create a richer and deeper overall fictional universe". About Tracer's development specifically, Blizzard stated, [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just felt right to make this an aspect of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|St. Laurent and the Liberals {{suffered}} {{other problems}} during the campaign. According to Newman, St. Laurent sometimes seemed {{unaware of what}} was happening around him, and at one campaign stop, shook hands with the reporters who were following him, under the apparent impression they were local voters. On the evening of Diefenbaker's Vancouver speech, St. Laurent drew 400voters to a rally in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where he had once lived. C.D. Howe, under heavy pressure from the campaign of CCF candidate Doug Fisher in his Ontario riding, intimated that Fisher had communist links. At a rally in Manitoba, Howe offended a voter who told him the farmers were starving to death, poking the voter in the stomach and saying [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government." [...] At another rally, Howe dismissed a persistent Liberal <b>questioner,</b> saying [...] "Look here, my good man, when the election comes, why don't you just go away and vote for the party you support? In fact, why don't you just go away?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Clean Language {{questions}} are cleansed {{as far as}} possible of anything that comes from the <b>questioner's</b> [...] "maps" [...] — metaphors, assumptions, paradigms or sensations — that could direct the questionee's attention away from increased awareness {{of his or her own}} metaphorical representation of experience.|$|R
500|$|Hunter {{participated in}} the November 28, 2007 CNN/YouTube GOP Debate, and notably, {{received}} {{a question about the}} military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy. The <b>questioner,</b> former Brig. Gen. Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American {{men and women in uniform}} are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1819, Nathaniel {{moved the}} family to Montville, a hamlet of Moravia. Appreciating his son's talents, Nathaniel Fillmore persuaded Judge Walter Wood, the Fillmores' {{landlord}} and the wealthiest person in the area, to allow Millard to be his law clerk for a trial period. Wood agreed to employ young Fillmore, and to supervise him as he read law. Fillmore taught school for three months to earn money to buy out his apprenticeship at the mill. Fillmore left Wood after 18 months; the judge paid him almost nothing, and the two quarreled when Fillmore earned a small sum by advising a farmer in a minor lawsuit. Refusing to pledge {{not to do it}} again, Fillmore left, abandoning his clerkship. Nathaniel Fillmore again moved the family, and Fillmore accompanied his father west to East Aurora, in Erie County, near Buffalo. [...] This move proved successful, and the farm Nathaniel Fillmore purchased there became prosperous. Nathaniel Fillmore would be the first father of a president to visit his son at the White House, and alluded to his family's onetime poverty when he told a <b>questioner</b> how to raise a son to be president: [...] "Cradle him in a sap trough".|$|E
500|$|Televised {{presidential debates}} were reintroduced {{for the first}} time since the 1960 election. As such, Ford became the first {{incumbent}} president to participate in one. Carter later attributed his victory in the election to the debates, saying they [...] "gave the viewers reason to think that Jimmy Carter had something to offer". The turning point came in the second debate when Ford blundered by stating, [...] "There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe and there never will be under a Ford Administration." [...] Ford also said that he did not [...] "believe that the Poles consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union". In an interview years later, Ford said he had intended to imply that the Soviets would never crush the spirits of eastern Europeans seeking independence. However, the phrasing was so awkward that <b>questioner</b> Max Frankel was visibly incredulous at the response. As a result of this blunder, and Carter's promise of a full presidential pardon for political refugees from the Vietnam era during the presidential debates, Ford's surge stalled and Carter was able to maintain a slight lead in the polls.|$|E
6000|$|It seemed {{strange to}} her to have a mere {{acquaintance}} spoken of as [...] "her countryman"--not the first time nor the last time in her career. As there appeared no trace or sign of jealousy in her <b>questioner's</b> manner, she answered briefly but vaguely: ...|$|R
