5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy crosswise beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E

The sometimes-seen grouping of the large-headed carps (Hypophthalmichthyinae) with Xenocypris, though, seems <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> error. More likely, the latter {{are part of the}} Cultrinae.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} games against Yorkshire, the main {{opponents of the}} Norwich/Norfolk team were Bury/Suffolk and MCC. These games however were not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> the class of the Yorkshire matches. Norfolk played Cambridge Town Club (a.k.a. Cambridgeshire) in the 1840s but Norfolk {{generally}} fared very poorly and by 1852 the team had lost important status. After the present Norfolk County Cricket Club was founded in 1876, the county did not regain important status and it joined the Minor Counties Championship when it was formed in 1895.|$|E

25|$|Werner Heisenberg {{considered}} the question further. He saw the duality as present for all quantic entities, but not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> the usual quantum mechanical account considered by Bohr. He {{saw it in}} what is called second quantization, which generates an entirely new concept of fields which exist in ordinary space-time, causality still being visualizable. Classical field values (e.g. the electric and magnetic field strengths of Maxwell) are replaced by an entirely new kind of field value, as considered in quantum field theory. Turning the reasoning around, ordinary quantum mechanics can be deduced as a specialized consequence of quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and the {{demobilisation}} of the Bevin Boys, came new trainees, {{this time}} men from our allies in Europe wanting to make their home in England, particularly a large contingent from Poland. Even after the last trainee moved on the end was not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> site, a new borehole topped with a pumping house was constructed on the site to help solve the water table problems at Brookhouse. This operated until the closure of Brookhouse Colliery in 1986 when it was finally switched off – the end for Birley had arrived.|$|E
25|$|Barking {{is highly}} ethnically diverse, <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> stark {{contrast}} to Dagenham. In the 2011 census, the largest ethnic group in Abbey ward (which covers Barking town centre) was Pakistani at 17%, followed by 16% White British, 15% Black African, 13% Indian and 11% Other White. The town centre's proximity to both East Ham and Ilford may explain its high diversity among different ethnic communities. Gascoigne ward (southern Barking) was 26% White British, 26% Black African and 13% Other White. Longbridge ward (eastern Barking) was 35% White British, 18% Bangladeshi and 11% Pakistani. The wards of Dagenham meanwhile are all White British-majority, and Black Africans are the only significant minorities there, whereas the Asian community is small by contrast to Barking.|$|E

500|$|In 1505, [...] the ark of San Tiziano, {{designed}} by Sanmicheli, {{had been put}} in place in the Church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano in Brescia. This had had a resonance in the artistic world at the time, and led to the revival of a workshop that was no longer <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> vogue. Cairano committed deeply into the ark of Sant'Appollonio, which counts among his major works and effectively supplants Sanmicheli's ark for monumentality and refined ornamentation. In the new work, Cairano provides further proof of his abilities, excelling forcefully in a scenario where he is peerless, and responding to Sanmicheli with a production of the highest quality.|$|E
500|$|These claims, {{especially}} the first two, spread quickly through society. [...] Ideas began to circulate of replacing the king; Toledo's leaders floated {{the possibility of}} turning the cities of Castile into independent free cities, similar to Genoa and other Italian republics. [...] Competing proposals suggested keeping the monarchy, but dethroning Charles. [...] They proposed that he be replaced by either his mother Queen Joanna or his Castilian-born brother Ferdinand. [...] With these ideas, the revolt shifted from a simple protest against taxes to a broader revolution. [...] Many cities, while not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> outright revolt, stopped sending taxes to the Royal Council and began to self-govern.|$|E
500|$|Holst {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} The Planets in 1913, {{partly as a result}} of his interest in astrology, and also from his determination, despite the failure of Phantastes, to produce a large-scale orchestral work. The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's Fünf Orchesterstücke, and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of Debussy's Nocturnes or La mer. Holst began composing The Planets in 1914; the movements appeared not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> their final sequence; [...] "Mars" [...] was the first to be written, followed by [...] "Venus" [...] and [...] "Jupiter". [...] "Saturn", [...] "Uranus" [...] and [...] "Neptune" [...] were all composed during 1915, and [...] "Mercury" [...] was completed in 1916.|$|E

500|$|The film, {{directed}} by Alexander Feinzimmer, {{was made at}} the Belgoskino studios where the music was recorded {{under the direction of}} Isaak Dunayevsky. The Moscow premiere was held on 7 March 1934, after which the film was released in London as The Tsar Wants to Sleep and in Paris as Le Lieutenant Nantes. Prokofiev did not rate the film highly, although he was pleased with his music. After the New York release in December 1934, the critic for The New York Times described the film as [...] "calculated to entertain lovers of detail and genuine atmosphere in semi-historical films. Even the introduction of a little slapstick comedy seems <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the Russian tradition." [...] Prokofiev's contribution to the film is not acknowledged in this review.|$|E
500|$|The {{nobility of}} Jerusalem welcomed {{the arrival of}} troops from Europe, and it was {{announced}} that a council should meet to decide on the best target for the crusaders. This took place on 24 June 1148, when the Haute Cour of Jerusalem met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near Acre, a major city of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence. [...] "it seems well worth while and <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity." [...] He lists these and numerous others; [...] "to name each one individually would take far too long." ...|$|E
500|$|The song enjoyed long-standing popularity. Wyndham writes, [...] "Little maid of Arcadee" [...] was [...] "popular for {{a quarter}} of a century". Sullivan's first biographer {{suggested}} that [...] "Thespis will be best remembered by the exquisite musical setting to the simple little Gilbertian ballad". Several later commentators write favourably of the song. Walbrook finds it [...] "one of the neatest of Gilbert's ditties, packed with cynicism and slyness, expressed in terms of sentimental tenderness." [...] Goldberg says that it is [...] "dainty, simple and <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> the vein of Gilbert's words, to which, as in almost every later instance, Sullivan's setting provides an original rhythmic piquancy." [...] Fitz-Gerald considers it [...] "quite a forerunner of Gilbert at his easiest", while Dark and Gray call it [...] "a typically dainty Gilbertian love-song worthy to be compared to the best that he ever wrote." [...] Jacobs dissents: [...] "As music it is as trivial as Sullivan ever wrote." ...|$|E

500|$|The four verses each {{consist of}} two {{questions}} asked by [...] "Files" [...] and answered by the Sergeant- a call-and-response form – {{and then another}} four lines of the Sergeant explaining, as above. In some interpretations, the second four lines are taken to be spoken by a third voice, another [...] "file-on-parade". Both the poem's rhythm and its rhyme scheme reinforce the idea of drilling infantry by giving the effect of feet marching generally but not perfectly in unison: [...] Although the poem's overall meter is iambic, each line in the verses and, to the slightly lesser extent, the chorus features syllables with additional grammatical and phonetic emphasis that fit {{the rhythm of the}} [...] "left, left, left right left" [...] marching cadence. [...] The first four lines always end with the same word, and the last four feature an aaab rhyme scheme with slightly lighter syllables that force the pace into a brisk march despite its somber mood (cf. the text of the poem's final chorus). Eliot noted the imperfect rhyme scheme – parade and said do not quite rhyme – as strongly contributing to this effect, with the slight interruption supporting the feel {{of a large number of}} men marching together, not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> harmony.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{had called}} the baby Allegra [...] "the little Commodore" [...] because of her sturdy body and alert, {{intelligent}} look. Byron was also pleased with Allegra's resemblances to himself in appearance and temperament. When she was eighteen months old, {{he wrote in a}} letter to a friend: [...] "My bastard came three days ago—very like—healthy—noisy & capricious." [...] In an 1818 letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote that [...] "She is very pretty—remarkably intelligent ... She has very blue eyes—that singular forehead—fair curly hair—and a devil of a spirit—but that is Papa's." [...] In 1819, in another letter to Leigh, Byron described two and a half-year-old Allegra as [...] "very droll" [...] and again commented on her resemblance to himself in physical appearance, temperament and interests: [...] "(She) has a very good deal of the Byron. Can't articulate the letter 'r' at all—frowns and pouts <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> our way—blue eyes—light hair growing darker daily—and a dimple in the chin—a scowl on the brow—white skin—sweet voice—and a particular liking of Music—and of her own way in every thing—is that not B. all over?" [...] The child had forgotten any English she had learned and now spoke only Venetian Italian. In March 1820, he complained in a letter that three-year-old Allegra was vain and [...] "obstinate as a mule". Her behaviour was sometimes unmanageable, probably as a result of her unstable living arrangements and frequent changes in caregivers. [...] At age four, the naughty child terrorised Byron's servants with her temper tantrums and other misbehavior and told frequent lies.|$|E
500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They are bound to be American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates the ways they have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not <b>quite</b> <b>in</b> body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but now looking at things from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E
