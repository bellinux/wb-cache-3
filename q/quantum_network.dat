Although quantum repeater protocol enables long distance entanglement distribution, it has been restricted to one-dimensional linear network. Here we develop a general framework that allows application of quantum repeater protocol to arbitrary <b>quantum</b> repeater <b>networks</b> with fractal structure. Entanglement distribution across such networks is mapped to renormalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that logarithmical times of recursive such renormalization transformations can trigger fractal to small-world transition, where a scalable <b>quantum</b> small-world <b>network</b> is achieved.

40|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>networks</b> {{promise to}} revolutionise computing, simulation, and communication. Light {{is the ideal}} {{information}} carrier for <b>quantum</b> <b>networks,</b> as its properties are not degraded by noise in ambient conditions, and it can support large bandwidths enabling fast operations and a large information capacity.

However, any noise introduced by the memory can render the device classical by destroying the quantum character of the light. Here we introduce an intrinsically noise-free memory protocol based on two-photon off-resonant cascaded absorption (ORCA). We consequently demonstrate for the first time successful storage of GHz-bandwidth heralded single photons in a warm atomic vapour with no added noise; confirmed by the unaltered photon statistics upon recall. Our ORCA memory platform meets the stringent noise-requirements for quantum memories whilst offering technical simplicity and high-speed operation, and therefore is immediately applicable to low-latency <b>quantum</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{memory is}} one of key {{ingredients}} consisting of <b>quantum</b> <b>networks,</b> therefore storing light at single photon level {{is an important step}} for realizing <b>quantum</b> <b>networks.</b> A photon, encoded in a high-dimensional state, can significantly increase the information capacity that a photon can carry. Furthermore, quantum memories with the ability to store multiple optical modes offer advantages in speed and robustness over single mode memories in quantum communication and computation. So far, there is no any report about the storage and retrieval of multiple mode images at single photon level. Here, we give a first experimental demonstration to our best knowledge, that two spatial probe fields at single photon level, each imprinted a real image, can be stored and retrieved with a considerable visibility and similarity through electromagnetically induced transparency in cold atomic ensemble. The accomplishment of multiple modes quantum image memory would move closer towards high dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

Here, we report the first implementation of such conditional control of two atomic memories, located in distinct apparatuses, which results in a 28 -fold increase of the probability of simultaneously obtaining a pair of single photons, relative to the case without conditional control. As a first application, we demonstrate a high degree of indistinguishability for remotely generated single photons by the observation of destructive interference of their wave packets.

50|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{implementations}} for quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum computation, optical quantum systems are prominent candidates, since they link quantum computation and quantum communication in the same framework. In optical systems for quantum information processing, the unit of light in a given mode—or photon—is used to represent a qubit. Superpositions of quantum states can be easily represented, encrypted, transmitted and detected using photons. Besides, linear optical elements of optical systems may be the simplest building blocks to realize quantum operations and quantum gates. Each linear optical element equivalently applies a unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. The system of finite linear optical elements constructs a network of linear optics, which can realize any quantum circuit diagram or <b>quantum</b> <b>network</b> based on the quantum circuit model.
