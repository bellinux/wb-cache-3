5|$|Letters {{written by}} Bahá'u'lláh to various individuals, {{including}} some heads of state, {{have been collected}} and canonized into a body of Bahá'í scripture that includes works by his son `Abdu'l-Bahá, and also the Báb, who is regarded as Bahá'u'lláh's forerunner. Prominent among Bahá'í literature are the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, Kitáb-i-Íqán, Some Answered <b>Questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Dawn-Breakers.|$|E
5|$|Air force experts raised <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian {{opposition}} leveled criticisms {{about the}} state of Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{proceedings}} of the Parliament of Australia, Parliament of Canada, Parliament of the United Kingdom (usually Prime Minister's <b>Questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> State Opening of Parliament) and other governments are shown on C-SPAN when they discuss matters of importance to viewers in the U.S. Similarly, the networks will sometimes broadcast news reports {{from around the world}} when major events occur – for instance, C-SPAN broadcast CBC Television coverage of the September 11 attacks. C-SPAN also covers lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda and funerals of former presidents and other notable individuals. In 2005, C-SPAN covered Hurricane Katrina through NBC affiliate WDSU in New Orleans, as well as coverage of Hurricane Ike via CBS affiliate KHOU in Houston. C-SPAN also carries CBC coverage during events that affect Canadians, such as the Canadian federal elections, the death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau, and the 2003 North America blackout. During early 2011, C-SPAN carried broadcasts by Al Jazeera to cover the events in Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab nations. Additionally, C-SPAN simulcasts NASA Space Shuttle mission launches and landings live, using video footage and audio sourced from NASA TV.|$|E

5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} {{can result in}} severe motor speech disorders; {{dysarthria}} {{is the most common}} such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases. Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition. Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E

25|$|The opaque {{nature of}} the AdSteam Group caused rising concern {{in a variety of}} circles. Although {{shareholders}} continued to enjoy bonus shares, rights issues, and significant dividends, the share price plateaued. Financial journalists started asking <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> share price faltered. After the 1990 Annual General Meeting and the announcement of the 25c dividend (per share) against a diminished share price, investor confidence deserted the company and the share price crashed from over $5 to under $1 in one day.|$|E
25|$|Despite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's {{support for}} a {{campaign}} seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer diammonium phosphate and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa, despite lingering <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> absence of long-term studies.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{from other}} {{countries}} have produced similar findings. In Poland, for example, it was found in an experiment that self-reporting same-sex attraction was twice as common using an online questionnaire as in a paper questionnaire, {{despite the fact that}} the group that answered the online <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> one that filled out the paper form were similar on all demographic variables and on all other aspects of their sexuality. In the 90s, an experiment was made in the US where it was found that teen males were several times more likely to acknowledge same-sex experiences using a computer methodology compared to paper questionnaires.|$|E

500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, The Sufferer & the Witness. The band members were {{dissatisfied}} with Richardson's contributions to Siren Song of the Counter Culture, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, whom they felt had accurately captured the punk sound they were going for on Revolutions per Minute. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture, the band had a much more enjoyable time with The Suffer & the Witness, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: [...] "It went great, the songs just flowed out of us. There were really few <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> song lyrics would just come out of us, it went really well and everyone really liked them." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to answer some of these <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Charlotte's flight and return was soon {{the talk of}} the town; Henry Brougham, a former MP and future Whig Lord Chancellor, {{reported}} [...] "All are against the Prince", and the Opposition press made much of the tale of the runaway Princess. [...] Despite an emotional reconciliation with his daughter, the Prince Regent soon had her conveyed to Cranbourne Lodge, where her attendants were under orders never to let her out of their sight. [...] She was able to smuggle a note out to her favourite uncle, Prince Augustus, Duke of Sussex. [...] The Duke responded by questioning the Tory Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, in the House of Lords. He asked whether Charlotte was free to come and go, whether she was allowed to go to the seaside as doctors had recommended for her in the past, and now that she was eighteen, whether the government planned to give her a separate establishment. [...] Liverpool evaded the <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Duke was summoned to Carlton House and castigated by the Prince Regent, who never spoke with his brother again.|$|E
500|$|On May 7, 2013, Lambesis {{was arrested}} in Oceanside, California, US after {{allegedly}} hiring an undercover detective to kill his estranged wife. The report {{was made by the}} San Diego County Sheriff's Department, leaving the future of the band uncertain. On the following day, the band released a statement in which they said: [...] "The legal process is taking its course and we have no more information than you do. There are many unanswered <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can." [...] They also stated that their thoughts were [...] "with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation." [...] Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that [...] "we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted". During the month of his initial arrest, Lambesis pleaded [...] "not guilty" [...] and his lawyer stated: [...] "His thought processes were devastatingly affected by his steroid use." [...] On February 25, 2014 Lambesis changed his plea from [...] "not guilty" [...] to [...] "guilty" [...] and consequently faced a potential sentence of nine years in prison.|$|E
