30|$|Following {{the growing}} {{evidence}} that structured reports {{would have a}} beneficial impact on the communication between radiologists and referring physicians, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) presented its Reporting Initiative aimed at developing and providing vendor-neutral <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> [19, 20]. This was later picked up by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) {{and led to the}} publication of the Management of Radiology <b>Report</b> <b>Templates</b> (MRRT) profile [21]. This profile extensively describes the concepts and technical details for interoperable, standardised, structured, <b>report</b> <b>templates.</b> <b>Report</b> <b>templates</b> are developed and provided using a subset of standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and allow for the integration of RadLex terms. This offers the possibility of further standardising <b>report</b> <b>template</b> content as synonyms and even content in different languages could be mapped to the same RadLex code [22].|$|R
30|$|Protocols to {{communicate}} <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> and <b>reports.</b>|$|R
30|$|The IHE MRRT {{integration}} profile specifies {{the roles}} of the different actors involved in creation of imaging <b>report</b> <b>templates,</b> namely <b>Report</b> <b>Template</b> Creator, <b>Report</b> <b>Template</b> Manager and <b>Report</b> Creator, bearing {{the roles of}} creating the templates, of managing them and using them to create actual imaging reports, respectively. Communications between these actors rely on the HTTP protocol. As for DICOM structured reports, they can be exchanged with both traditional DICOM messaging (Storage and Query/Retrieve) and the DICOMweb set of RESTful services over HTTP, more adapted to the access to images and reports from web browsers.|$|R
30|$|Major {{radiological}} societies already offer {{collections of}} such MRRT-compliant <b>report</b> <b>templates.</b> For example, the RSNA Reporting Initiative {{offers more than}} 250 <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> on its radreport.org website. There {{has also been a}} memorandum of understanding signed between the European Society of Radiology and the RSNA, leading a joint Template Library Advisory Board and an open platform where European users can upload and discuss their <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> (open.radreport.org) [23]. Other societies have also published various consensus statements providing disease-specific <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> which have been shown to provide the most benefit to referring physicians in most cases [24]. For example, the American Society of Abdominal Radiology published a consensus statement regarding reports for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the Korean Society of Abdominal Radiology published a similar paper with regards to rectal cancer MRI [25, 26].|$|R

30|$|The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) {{initiative}} defined an integration profile {{dedicated to}} the provision of <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> called Management of Radiology <b>Report</b> <b>Templates</b> (MRRT). In MRRT <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> are provided in HTML 5, a syntax that enables direct management by web browsers. The data structure is flexible. It allows both management and free text and coded entries, e.g. using RadLex. Basic metadata use terms from the Dublin Core metadata element set, a standard terminology for document metadata [20]. This choice strikes a balance between expression of coded content and description of a user interface and the related data capture methods [21, 22].|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{integration}} of structured radiology reporting is still scarce in clinical routine. Some vendors (e.g., Nuance, Burlington, MA, USA) provide {{the possibility of}} integrating such <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> into their speech-recognition solution. However, even in these cases reports are composed using <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> but then stored as plain text in the hospital or radiology information system. Although this surely allows for more easy text mining due to more standardised reports, storing the respective parts of information from the <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> in a dedicated database as discrete bits of information would allow for even easier access to these data.|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Reporting</b> <b>templates</b> are {{increasingly}} common in all fields of pathology. In this paper, we present {{an assessment of}} the impact of a thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) template on diagnostic classification and cytohistologic concordance. Materials and Methods: A thyroid FNAC <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> was developed and introduced at a university teaching hospital. We examined FNAC reports for a five-month period before introduction of the template and compared these to the five month period after the template introduction. We recorded diagnostic categorization as well as cytohistologic correlation. Results: A total of 168 cases were identified in the five month period prior to the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> and 172 cases in the five month period after the introduction of the <b>reporting</b> <b>template.</b> The template appeared to improve the diagnostic precision of benign conditions without altering the proportion of cases classified as unsatisfactory, benign or abnormal. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of cytohistologic concordance before and after the template introduction. Conclusions: The introduction of a <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> for thyroid FNAC improved diagnostic precision of benign conditions and did not alter the general diagnostic classification or cytohistologic concordance...|$|R

40|$|A frame/object {{hierarchy}} of document templates and documents A document template is a frame with a slot for {{each part of}} the document (a part can be a single line or part of a line). Many slots have a procedure attached; the procedure obtains the information from a database, if it is available, or displays a menu of possible values, or asks the user a question.

40|$|Abstract—Outcome after {{cardiac arrest}} and {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation {{is dependent on}} critical interventions, particularly early defibrillation, effective chest compressions, and advanced life support. Utstein-style definitions and <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> have been used extensively in published studies of cardiac arrest, {{which has led to}} greater understanding of the elements of resuscitation practice and progress toward international consensus on science and resuscitation guidelines. Despite the development of Utstein templates to standardize research reports of cardiac arrest, international registries have yet to be developed. In April 2002, a task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) met in Melbourne, Australia, to review worldwide experience with the Utstein definitions and <b>reporting</b> <b>templates.</b> The task force revised the core <b>reporting</b> <b>template</b> and definitions by consensus.

30|$|As for the {{necessary}} adoption of common <b>reporting</b> <b>templates,</b> the current RSNA {{and the joint}} ESR-RSNA efforts are a first step. A next step should try to rationalise the organisation of SR templates through a logical organisation based on the ontology-based classification of clinical situations and imaging procedures. The adoption of multilingual templates should be systematically preferred to avoid the quantitative explosion {{of the number of}} templates. These technical aspects are complex and should be addressed in collaboration with organisations developing standard terminologies/ontologies. In particular, <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> should increasingly include quantitative measurements (imaging biomarkers), especially when formalised clinical decision models exist, which are based on these measurements.|$|R
