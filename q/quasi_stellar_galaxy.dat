40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the hypothesis that}} BL Lacertae objects (BLLs) are the beamed remnants of <b>Quasi</b> <b>Stellar</b> Objects. The hypothesis explains why BLLs do not undergo the strong evolution seen in other active galactic nuclei since it naturally predicts that the space density of BLLs should increase with cosmic time, as shown by recent observations. Numerical models reproduce, with reasonable parameters, the known redshift and magnitude counts of BL Lac objects. It is assumed that radio-quiet as well as radio-loud quasars are capable of generating jets but that jets are snuffed in young radio-quiet objects and only emerge in aged ones.

The quality of presently available data and the expected accuracy of the extragalactic link are discussed. It is concluded that at least 150 QSO's must be observed by GAIA in order to guarantee an accuracy of better than 1 microarcsec/year for the link. New observations will be needed before the GAIA launch in order to reduce uncertainties in the positions, magnitudes and redshifts for some known quasars. The variability of QSO's with magnitudes near the GAIA observation limit can raise a potential problem. The motions of nearby QSO's are expected to be much smaller than 2 microarcsec/year, and therefore, will not affect the accuracy of the link in the proposed GAIA mission...|$|R

Accordingly, by 2020, two extragalactic celestial reference frames will coexist: the VLBI frame (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) {{in the radio}} domain, currently adopted by the IAU as the fundamental one, and the Gaia frame determined from direct optical observations of quasars by the satellite. For consistency between optical and radio positions of any celestial targets, it will be fundamental to align the Gaia and VLBI frames with the highest accuracy.

40|$|The optical {{interstellar}} {{absorption lines}} of Ti II, Ca II, Na I, and the 21 cm emission line of H I were observed at high resolution and high detection sensitivity toward none pairs of nearly aligned distant halo stars and foreground disk stars with well determined distances. Analysis {{of the column}} densities, velocities, and the directly determined variation of the titanium abundances with z-distance leads to a general picture of the neutral interstellar material in the lower galactic halo. Two types of gas with distinct distribution, kinematics, and abundances are found, a thick, low velocity disk (type I) extending from the plane to well beyond the thin disk of OB stars, and a high velocity, much less strongly depleted gas (type II) observed only at high z-distances, which constitutes at least 24 percent {{of the mass of}} the halo gas.

40|$|The {{frequency}} shift of spectral lines {{is most often}} explained by the Doppler Effect in terms of relative motion, whereas the Doppler broadening of a particular line mainly depends on the absolute temperature. The Wolf effect {{on the other hand}} deals with the correlation induced spectral change and explains both the broadening and shift of the spectral lines. In this framework a relation between the width of the spectral line is related to the redshift z for the line and hence with the distance. For smaller values of z a relation similar to the Tully-Fisher relation can be obtained and for larger values of z a more general relation can be constructed. The derivation of this kind of relation based on dynamic multiple scattering theory may {{play a significant role in}} explaining the overall spectra of <b>quasi</b> <b>stellar</b> objects.

40|$|The {{radial density}} {{profiles}} of <b>stellar</b> <b>galaxy</b> discs can be well approximated as an exponential. Compared to this canonical form, however, the profiles {{in the majority}} of disc galaxies show downward or upward breaks at large radii. Currently, there is no coherent explanation in a galaxy formation context of the radial profile per se, along with the two types of profile breaks. Using a set of controlled hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxy formation, we find a correlation between the host halo's initial angular momentum and the resulting radial profile of the <b>stellar</b> disc: <b>galaxies</b> that live in haloes with a low spin parameter λ < 0. 03 show an up-bending break in their disc density profiles, while galaxies in haloes of higher angular momentum show a down-bending break. We find that the case of pure exponential profiles (λ 0. 035) coincides with the peak of the spin parameter distribution from cosmological simulations. Our simulations not only imply an explanation of the observed behaviours, but also suggest that the physical origin of this effect is related to the amount of radial redistribution of stellar mass, which is anti-correlated with λ.

40|$|Interactions between cosmic ray {{protons and}} the photons {{of the cosmic}} {{microwave}} background radiation, as well as the expansion of the universe, cause cosmic rays to lose energy in a way that depends on the distance from the cosmic nray source to the earth. Because of this, there is a correlation between cosmic ray energies and the average redshift of their origin. This correlation may be exploited to measure the evolution of the sources of cosmic rays. Sky surveys of <b>Quasi</b> <b>Stellar</b> Objects (QSO’s) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN’s), made at optical and x-ray wavelengths, are consistent in showing that the evolution of such objects exhibits a break at a redshift, z, of about 1. 6. At smaller redshifts, the luminosity density of QSO’s and AGN’s follows a (1 + z) m distribution, with m ∼ 2. 6, and exhibit a much flatter distribution above the break. Measurements of the star formation rate are also consistent with this picture. If QSO’s and AGN’s are sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays the break in their evolution should appear in the cosmic ray spectrum at an energy of about 10 17. 6 eV.

In parallel, the radio frame obtained with the VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) technique has been the IAU (International Astronomical Union) fundamental celestial reference frame for several decades.

40|$|In {{the unusual}} {{intrinsic}} QSO redshift models, QSOs are ejected by active galaxies with periodic non-cosmological reshifts, thus QSOs are generally associated with active galaxies, and certain structures will be {{revealed in the}} QSO redshift distribution. As the largest homogeneous sample of QSOs and galaxies, SDSS data provide the best opportunity to examine this issue. We review the debates on this issue, focused on those based on SDSS and 2 dF data, and conclude {{that there is no}} strong connection between foreground active galaxies and high-redshift QSOs. The existence of two dips in the SDSS QSO redshift distribution at z= 2. 7 and 3. 5 has recently re-ignited those controversial debates on the origin of QSO redshift. It also turned out that both dips are totally caused by selection effects and after selection effects have been corrected, the two dips disappear and no structure in the redshift distribution of SDSS DR 5 sample. These results support that the reshifts of QSOs are cosmological. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures. Invited review to appear as a chapter in "Redshifts of <b>Quasi</b> <b>Stellar</b> Objects", ed. D.

40|$|I {{study the}} weak {{nonlinear}} regime of structure formation using high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) samples of <b>Quasi</b> <b>Stellar</b> Objects' (QSOs) Lyα transmission spectra. Using a space-scale decomposition, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), I {{show that the}} field traced by Lyα transmission flux is intermittent on scales less than 2000 km/s. The distribution of the local power of fluctuations is spiky with almost no power between the spikes. This spike-gap-spike feature gets more pronounced on smaller scales (128 - 16 km/s). This feature contradicts the predictions of the correlation hierarchy model on small scales (< 64 km/s). Intermittency renders lower order statistics, like the power spectrum of fluctuations, ineffective in describing an intermittent field and discriminating between various structure formation models. I show that the structure functions and the intermittent exponent are not only able to quantitatively differentiate between different dark matter models but also qualitatively describe the nature of non-Gaussianity. The structure functions and the intermittent exponent are powerful tools for describing an intermittent field. Intermittency opens a new window {{in the study of}} the nonlinear evolution of structure in the universe...|$|R

We find that the SSFR decreases as <b>galaxy</b> <b>stellar</b> mass increases, suggesting that star formation contributes more to the growth of low-mass galaxies than high-mass galaxies at all redshifts in this study. We also find a ridge in the SSFR that runs parallel to lines of constant SFR and decreases by a factor of 10 from z= 1 to today, matching the results of the evolution in SFR density seen in the ``Lilly-Madau'' diagram. The ridge evolves independently of <b>galaxy</b> <b>stellar</b> mass to a particular turnover mass at the high mass end.

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of a highly uniform X-ray background (XRB) in the 2 to 10 keV range, its nature is not yet fully explained. It appears clear from the results of Einstein medium and deep surveys that at least 50 % of the XRB is due to individual extragalactic sources when their contribution is integrated to Z = 3. This includes contribution from <b>Quasi</b> <b>Stellar</b> Objects (QSOs), Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. The average spectrum of each of the individual contributing sources is softer than that of the observed XRB. Therefore, the remaining contribution must have a rather hard spectrum of alpha nearly equal to 0. 0 to 0. 2. It is unlikely that this spectrum can be produced by diffuse processes. Therefore, the remainder of the XRB must be due to individual sources with the appropriate spectrum. This requires either that the spectrum of the already identified sources changes at early epochs or a new class of objects.
