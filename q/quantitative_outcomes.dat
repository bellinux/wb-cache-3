40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite the {{literature}} supporting {{the efficacy of}} vertebroplasty for treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, few reports exist documenting its use {{in the treatment of}} compression fractures in multiple myeloma patients. Accordingly, we sought to characterize the imaging characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes in myeloma patients treated with vertebroplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of clinical outcome data from 67 multiple myeloma patients treated with vertebroplasty since October 2000. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>outcome</b> data including the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and Visual Analog Scales for pain and qualitative outcome data (self-reported pain, mobility, and narcotic use) were collected preoperatively, immediately after vertebroplasty, and at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after treatment. RESULTS: Significant improvements in all of the outcome measures were observed postoperatively and throughout the duration of follow-up. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>outcome</b> measures (RDQ, analog pain scale 0 – 10, with rest and activity) improved by 11. 0 (48 %; P. 0001), 2. 7 (25 %; P. 001), and 5. 3 (48 %; P. 0001) points, respectively, with persistent improvement at 1 year (P. 01; P. 03; P. 001).

30|$|Other {{researchers}} have previously explored {{the combination of}} self-rated scale data with sensor data [37, 38, 42 – 45]. The result demonstrates that the combination could provide {{new insights into the}} pervasive and objective depression evaluation processes in daily life. Based on the FPC curve and the features extracted from forehead EEG data, we adopted RF regression algorithm to construct a quantitative model for objectively rating the depressive mood status (independent variable: the EEG features and dependent variable: the FPC curve). The FPC curve is used as a reference standard to evaluate the quantitative model. The LOPOCV method is used to split the dataset into training and testing datasets. For every LOPOCV, the model evaluation is finished by the correlation analysis which is utilized to quantify the correlation of the <b>quantitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> and the FPC curve of the rest subject. The result demonstrates that the <b>quantitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> for objectively rating the major depressive mood status have a moderate uphill relationship with FPC values, which provides a promising evidence to illustrate the built quantitative model that is feasible to objectively rate the major depressive mood status.|$|E

40|$|Background: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME (CFS/ME) is characterised by {{debilitating}} fatigue {{with many}} bedbound patients. The study aims were: {{to determine whether}} a new intervention could be successfully delivered; to collect <b>quantitative</b> <b>outcome</b> data to guide the design of future studies; to explore qualitatively the experience of patients, carers and clinicians. Methods: Mixed-methods feasibility study with qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Participants: 12 UK patients who were housebound with severe CFS/ME. Intervention: Based on recovery skills identified through a 2. 5 year Patient and Public Involvement development process involving individuals with first-hand experience of recovery from CFS/ME, as well as current patients and clinicians. The resulting one year intervention, delivered by a multi-disciplinary team, included domiciliary therapy visits and optional peer support group. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>outcome</b> measures: Patient-reported and therapist-reported outcome measures (including fatigue, physical function, anxiety, depression and other variables) and electronic activity measurement. Results: The study recruited and engaged twelve participants with no serious adverse events or dropouts. At end of intervention, 5 / 12 participants had improved in fatigue, physical function. Group mean scores improved overall for fatigue (Chalder fatigue scale), physical function (activity and physical function scale) and anxiety. Qualitative interviews suggested that the intervention was acceptable to patients, whilst also highlighting suggestions for improvement. Participants will be followed up for a further year to find out if improvements are sustained. Conclusion: This is the largest study ever conducted in severe CFS/ME and shows significant recovery suggesting further studies are indicated.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundDuring {{a proper}} {{execution}} of dMLC plans, there occurs an undesired but frequent {{effect of the}} dose locally accumulated by tissue being significantly different than expected. The conventional dosimetric QA procedures give only a partial picture {{of the quality of}} IMRT treatment, because their solely <b>quantitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> usually correspond more to the total area of the detector than the actually irradiated volume. AimThe aim of this investigation was to develop a procedure of dynamic plans verification which would be able to visualize the potential anomalies of dose distribution and specify which tissue they exactly refer to. Materials & methodsThe paper presents a method discovered and clinically examined in our department. It is based on a Gamma Evaluation concept and allows accurate localization of deviations between predicted and acquired dose distributions, which were registered by portal as well as film dosimetry. All the calculations were performed on the self-made software GammaEval, the γ-images (2 -dimensional distribution of γ-values) and γ-histograms were created as <b>quantitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> of verification. ResultsOver 150 maps of dose distribution have been analyzed and the cross-examination of the gamma images with DRRs was performed.
