The software of tester quenchants enable determine a cooling rate for given quenching fluid in laboratory conditions according to ISO 9950 and in production <b>quenching</b> <b>tank.</b> This cooling rate {{is determined by}} Grossmann Number (H [1 /in]) which is characteristic for given quenching fluid in the real production tank. A Grossmann Number generated by tester software is it used in discussed program. This situation entitle to assertion that calculated hardness distribution is very near a hardness which will be obtained in real quench tank. It is assumption that such a computer program will be useful in selection of quenchants for given items...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technique is employed to predict the flow of quenchant in a large <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> The characteristics of flow field in the existing <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> are investigated, and the major deficiency occurred in the tank structure design is analyzed. Two different schemes for improving the tank structure design are brought forward, and further numerical simulations are carried out. Results show that the non-uniform flow field is generated throughout the quenching zone in the existing large <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> There is clear difference in flow rate in the regions near the inner surface of workpiece and the outer, which may cause the workpiece distortion and even cracking. Reduction in ring pipe intermediate diameter can not obviously enhance the uniformity of flow field in the <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> By adding an inner core in the center zone of the tank, the flow rate in the region near the inner surface of workpiece can be increased effectively, and the flow rate difference found in the quenching zone reduced significantly, which are beneficial to guarantee the quenching quality of workpiece...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the flow rate distribution and improve the flow rate uniformity of the quenchant in a <b>quench</b> <b>tank,</b> the ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter (UDV) {{was used to measure}} the flow rate of quenchant with agitation, and then a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was carried out to simulate the flow rate distribution without / with flow baffles. According to the CFD simulation results, the structures and positions of flow baffles in the draft-tube were optimized to obtain the uniform flow rate distribution in the quench zone, which were verified by experiments as well. The simulation and experimental results show that the UDV is suitable for measuring the flow rate of a large-size <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> This research provided a solid foundation for optimizing the structure design of flow baffles in production <b>quench</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Turbulent, {{isothermal}} flow {{of water}} in a <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> was modelled with a com-mercial CFD code. The goals of the project were first to {{develop an understanding of}} the flow field inside the existing tank, and second to provide a screening of radi-cally different design concepts for a next generation <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> A large number of CFD models were developed. Performance of the competing tank designs was assessed with partial factorial experiment techniques, also known as Taguchi tech-nique. The results of the existing <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> study show that the casting spacing, the agitator flow rate, and the presence of the center baffle are the dominant configu-ration parameters affecting the total flow and the uniformity though the load. The best new conceptual design uses ducting to contain the quenchant as it recirculates in the tank. The important advantages of this new design can be obtained by a retrofit of the existing tank. The results of this research also provide a foundation for a more complete simulation of the quench process...|$|R

5000|$|Three Mile Island Unit 2 {{was unable}} to contain about 480 PBq of {{radioactive}} noble gases from release into the environment and around 120 kL of radioactive contaminated cooling water from release beyond the containment into a neighbouring building. The pilot-operated relief valve at TMI-2 was designed to shut automatically after relieving excessive pressure inside the reactor into a <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> However the valve mechanically failed causing the PORV <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> to fill, and the relief diaphragm to eventually rupture into the containment building. [...] The containment building sump pumps automatically pumped the contaminated water outside the containment building. Both a working PORV with <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> and separately the containment building with sump provided two layers of passive safety. An unreliable PORV negated its designed passive safety. The plant design featured only a single open/close indicator based {{on the status of}} its solenoid actuator, instead of a separate indicator of the PORV's actual position. [...] This rendered the mechanical reliability of the PORV indeterminate directly, and therefore its passive safety status indeterminate. The automatic sump pumps and/or insufficient containment sump capacity negated the containment building designed passive safety.|$|R

This paper will address three areas where technical advancements have been, or may be, made. These include discussion of: 1) the application fundamental fluid dynamics to characterize quenching uniformity due to agitation; 2) the use of "waves" to provide uniform agitation during the quenching process; and 3) the use of pressure as a variable to mediate heat transfer throughout the quenching process...|$|R

Overpressure {{protection}} for the reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB), during power operation of the reactor, is ensured by application of relief and safety valves and the reactor protection system. For boiling water reactors (BWRs), the area of review includes relief and safety valves on the main steam lines and piping from these valves to the suppression pool. For pressurized water reactors (PWRs), the area of review includes pres-surizer relief and safety valves and the piping from these valves to the <b>quench</b> <b>tank,</b> on the primary and steam generator relief and safety valves on the secondary.

40|$|In {{moving towards}} ITER operation, the {{detailed}} analysis of fault conditions for the magnets becomes of increasing importance, to verify that the magnet protection system can safely manage them without any damage to the magnets. A "protected" Loss of Flow Accident in the ITER Toroidal Field (TF) coils, de-tected by the coil flow meters and managed by the Central Inter-lock System, is investigated here using the validated thermal-hydraulic code 4 C. We simulate the entire sequence of events that is foreseen to protect the magnet, aiming at verifying {{the impact on the}} magnet. The LOFA consequences are investigated in terms of both the temperature margin in the winding pack and of the needed re-cooling time, which will affect the availability of the machine. It turns out that, for an "accelerated" discharge (i. e., a linear ramp-down) of the magnet current lasting less than 30 min, no quench should occur, while the corresponding re-cooling time should not exceed 1 h. During the transient, ~ 10 % of the He mass in the coil is vented to the <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> due to the opening of the safety valves, and requires re-cooling...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} understanding the relationship between fluid flow and heat transfer in industrial quenching systems. It also presents an efficient analysis to design or optimize long standing <b>quenching</b> <b>tanks</b> to increase productivity. The study case is automotive leaf springs quenched in an oil-tank agitated with submerged jets. This analysis combined an efficient numerical prediction of the detailed isothermal flow field in the whole tank with the thermal characterization of steel probes in plant and laboratory during quenching. These measurements {{were used to determine}} the heat flow by solving the inverse heat conduction problem. Differences between laboratory and plant heat flux results were attributed to the difference in surface area size between samples. A proposed correlation between isothermal wall shear stress and heat flux at the surface of the steel component, based on the Reynolds-Colburn analogy, provided the connection between thermal characterization and computed isothermal fluid flow. The present approach allowed the identification of the potential benefits of changes in the tank design and the evaluation of operating conditions while using a much shorter computing time and storage memory than full-domain fluid flow calculations...|$|R
40|$|In the {{numerical}} simulation of the quenching of steel parts, {{it is desirable}} to limit the thermal problem to one of conduction in the solid part, with Newtonian cooling on the surface. This avoids the solution of highly transient, non-Boussinesq conjugate heat transfer problems which often involve mixed convection. Of course, the heat transfer coefficient h{sub 1 } is in general a function of local surface temperature, and may depend strongly on the part geometry and other parameters. In order to obtain appropriate heat transfer coefficients for quenching thick rings in salt, we solve the conjugate heat transfer problem for representative geometries and determine the heat transfer coefficient from the calculated heat flux at the solid-fluid interface. This is done in a two-stage approach. First, we examine fully coupled solutions obtained from first principles without adjustable empirical parameters using an adaptive finite difference code applicable to simple shapes. The purpose {{of this part of}} the procedure is to gain insight into the physics of immersion, free convection and forced convection and to determine the most appropriate forms of the physical properties in the salt. Validation for simple shapes is accomplished by comparison with experimental data reported in the literature. Second, empirical modifications to physical properties and simplified governing equations are used to account for conduction-dominated heat transfer on initial contact and subsequent forced convection during immersion, based on results of the first calculations, so that a commercial finite-volume CFD code can be used to model complex shapes and flow in a <b>quench</b> <b>tank.</b> These results are compared with experimental data for thick rings quenched in salt, and used to calculate surface heat transfer coefficients as functions of temperature and location from the resulting heat flux at the part surface...|$|R
40|$|The International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF), {{presently}} in its Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activities (EVEDA) phase {{under the}} frame of the Broader Approach Agreement between Europe and Japan, accomplished in summer 2013, on schedule, its EDA phase with the release of the engineering design report of the IFMIF plant, which is here described. Many improvements of the design from former phases are implemented, particularly a reduction of beam losses and operational costs thanks to the superconducting accelerator concept, the re-location of the <b>quench</b> <b>tank</b> outside the test cell (TC) with a reduction of tritium inventory and a simplification on its replacement in case of failure, the separation of the irradiation modules from the shielding block gaining irradiation flexibility and enhancement of the remote handling equipment reliability and cost reduction, and the water cooling of the liner and biological shielding of the TC, enhancing the efficiency and economy of the related sub-systems. In addition, the maintenance strategy has been modified to allow a shorter yearly stop of the irradiation operations and a more careful management of the irradiated samples. The design of the IFMIF plant is intimately linked with the EVA phase carried out since the entry into force of IFMIF/EVEDA in June 2007. These last activities and their on-going accomplishment have been thoroughly described elsewhere (Knaster J et al [19]), which, combined with the present paper, allows a clear understanding of the maturity of the European–Japanese international efforts. This released IFMIF Intermediate Engineering Design Report (IIEDR), which could be complemented if required concurrently with the outcome of the on-going EVA, will allow decision making on its construction and/or {{serve as the basis for}} the definition of the next step, aligned with the evolving needs of our fusion community.

The Phase 1 study on remote systems concepts identification and extent of capacity increase was completed. The study concluded that the HWVP capacity could be increased to four times the current capacity with minor design adjustments to the fixed facility design, and the required design changes would not impact the current footprint of the vitrification building. A further increase in production capacity may be achievable but would require some technology development, verification testing, and a more systematic and extensive engineering evaluation.

40|$|The {{escalating}} {{issues on}} sustainable environment {{such as the}} necessity to reduce CO 2 emission and fuel consumption including new regulations to improve the safety of passengers car had brought up the application of new innovative materials and manufacturing process in the automotive industry called hot press forming operation. By using this new technique, the manufacturers can produce more lightweight and high strength car parts such as the B-pillars with tensile strength ranging from 1200 MPa to 1600 MPa. Hot press forming is done by rapidly heating up Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) made of boron steel material in a furnace to austenization temperature of about 950 °C for 5 minutes, then transferred it quickly to the hot press die where rapid quenching occurred during the die closed {{with the aid of}} cooling channel. This experiment investigates the effects of varying combination of hot press forming parameters to final tensile strength of boron steel and had been carried out without use of cooling channel. The studied parameters are the air cooling time, cooling rate, cooling time in die and stamping pressure. The type of boron steel material with trade name of Usibor® 1500 was used as the test specimens while for punch and die material, High Thermal Conductivity Tool Steel (HTCS- 150) made by Rovalma was used. Both are common materials used in the automotive industry for hot press forming operation. A preliminary experiment had been conducted where ten flat tensile strength specimens of Usibor 1500 were heated to the austenization temperature of 950 °C and immediately <b>quenched</b> in a <b>tank</b> of water to confirm the material ability to achieve the minimum tensile strength of 1500 Mpa. All specimens achieved average tensile strength of 1550 Mpa in this most ideal cooling rate condition. In the experimental hot press forming operation, result shows that the flat blank specimens of Usibor 1500 able to obtain ultimate tensile strength of 1400 Mpa after quenching in die without use of cooling channels when suitable process parameters were used during. Overall,faster air cooling time, higher stamping pressure applied to the blank, and longer cooling time in die improve the cooling rate. Highest tensile strength of 1400 Mpa was achieved in the experiment when cooling rate was 95 °C/s, air cooling time of 3. 83 s, stamping pressure of 50 bar and cooling time in die of 30 s...|$|R
