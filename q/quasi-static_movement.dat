40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for the motion {{planning}} problem of rigid object dexterous manipulation with a robotic multi-fingered hand, under <b>quasi-static</b> <b>movement</b> assumption. This method computes both object and finger trajectories {{as well as}} the finger relocation sequence. Its specificity is to use a special structuring of the research space that allows to search for paths directly in the particular subspace GSn which is the subspace of all the grasps that can be achieved with n grasping fingers. The solving of the dexterous manipulation planning problem is based upon the exploration of this subspace. The proposed approach captures the connectivity of GSn in a graph structure. The answer of the manipulation planning query is then given by searching a path in the computed graph. Simulation experiments were conducted for different dexterous manipulation task examples to validate the proposed method. A. Dexterous Manipulation I...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the dexterous manipulation planning problem, {{which deals with}} motion planning for a multi-fingered hand manipulating objects among static obstacles, under <b>quasi-static</b> <b>movement</b> assumption. We propose a general manipulation approach able to compute object and finger trajectories, {{as well as the}} finger relocation sequence, in order to link any two given configurations of the composite system hand + object. It relies on a topological property that characterizes the existence of solutions in the subspace of configurations where the object is grasped by the n fingers. This property helps reduce the problem by structuring the search space. The developed planner captures in a probabilistic roadmap the connectivity of submanifolds of the composite configuration space. The answer to the manipulation planning query is then given by searching a path in the computed graph. Simulation experiments are reported for different multi-fingered manipulation task examples showing the efficiency of the proposed method...|$|E
30|$|Next to tonic voltage oscillations, also {{irregular}} bursting of {{hair cells}} has experimentally been observed [16]. Within {{the framework of}} the employed model, these qualitatively different dynamics can faithfully be reproduced, suggesting a parameter variability among saccular hair cells. Our results show that these different dynamical regimes are associated with quite distinct response properties with respect to mechanical stimulation. Important stimuli for the sacculus of the bullfrog are seismic waves with spectral power mainly at higher frequencies and <b>quasi-static</b> head <b>movements</b> predominantly at low frequencies [53]. Our results suggest that the observed variability in hair cell voltage dynamics could have functional significance, reflecting a differentiation of hair cells into distinct groups specialized to sensory input of disparate frequency content.|$|R
40|$|The work {{carried out}} during this {{research}} {{project has been}} concerned {{with the performance of}} large structures and in the introduction to this thesis a justification for full-scale testing is presented. Full-scale testing techniques relating to both dynamic and <b>quasi-static</b> <b>movements</b> occurring in large civil engineering structures such as multi-storey buildings and bridges have been studied. Dynamic characteristics of buildings were obtained during full-scale testing with the use of seismometers and servo-drive accelerometers. Oscillations produced from both by wind and by forced vibration have been studied and the methods and results obtained are compared. The slow movement of structures, occurring at a frequency less than approximately 1 Hz, has been studied {{with the use of a}} specially developed laser based system. The system consists of a laser located at a stationary reference position while an X-Y plotter is positioned on the moving structure. Linked with four photo-cells and associated electronics, the system proved capable of monitoring the most significant movements occurring in civil engineering structures. A Theoretical control system analysis and frequency response of the device was performed. Extensive trials with the equipment and monitoring of the atmospheric temperature effects on the laser beam were undertaken and are described. Deflection data obtained on a multi-storey building and the Tamar suspension bridge and discussions on the problems encountered are presented. A small scale dynamic survey on the Tamar suspension bridge and results from an analytical model are described in Chapter Seven. Simple structural analysis models of multi-storey buildings have been used to yield values of natural frequencies. A finite element package has also been used to develop an accurate analytical model of a building to which different wind loading profiles were applied and deflections obtained...|$|R
40|$|In {{the medical}} field {{triaxial}} accelerometers {{are used for}} the monitoring of movements. Unfortunately, the long-term use of accelerometers is limited by drift of the sensitivities and the offsets. Therefore, a calibration procedure is designed which allows in-use calibration of a triaxial accelerometer. This procedure uses {{the fact that the}} modulus of the acceleration vector measured with a triaxial accelerometer equals 1 g under quasi-static conditions. The calibration procedure requires no explicit knowledge of the actual orientation of the triaxial accelerometer with respect to gravity and requires only <b>quasi-static</b> random <b>movements.</b> The procedure can be performed within several minutes. Considering practical applications, it is found possible to obtain an average error smaller than 3 % (of 1 [g]) with the calibration procedure for inputs caused by ‘standing straight and moving slightly’ when the offsets only are estimated. For the input caused by the sequence that occurs when going to bed, it is found possible to obtain errors smaller than 3 % for estimating all parameters...|$|R
40|$|Wheelchair-dependent {{subjects}} often adopt {{a passive}} sitting posture and suffer from sitting acquired pressure ulcers (PU) that mainly occur when high buttock pressures sustain {{for a longer}} period of time. Body posture directly influences seating load and proper postural change is therefore essential. Many subjects cannot reposition themselves and seating systems that adjust sitting posture can regulate seating load and potentially diminish the risk to develop PU. We describe a mechanism for postural adjustments and investigated the influence of seat inclination (1), pelvis rotation (2) and chair recline (3) on buttock load. We developed an experimental simulator chair containing the concept to adjust body posture in the sagittal plane. Measurements involved <b>quasi-static</b> actuated chair <b>movements</b> in which chair configuration, buttock interface pressure and seating forces were simultaneously measured. Significant effects with high coefficients of determination (r 2 > 0. 8) were found for seating force, centre of pressure and sacral load. We conclude that a combination of independent pelvis rotation and seat inclination is effective to regulate the net buttock shear force and the sacral interface pressure in healthy subjects. Whether both techniques are also applicable in subjects without postural stability is still to be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|When {{using the}} SPM as a {{metrological}} instrument, {{it is essential}} to compensate for the hysteresis between the piezo's movement and the applied control voltage. We disabled the build-in on-line correction of our SPM and scanned samples quasi-static with 0. 1 Hz in various scan ranges from 5 V to 440 V peak-to-peak. One sample consisted of lines spaced by 3. 0 #mu#m, the other was a two-dimensional grid with 200 nm pitch. The typical error in length measurement even after on-line correction remains at 1 - 2 %. In order to improve the error to less than 0. 2 % which represents one pixel in the scanned image, a mathematical model for the rate-independent hysteresis is set up. Instead of regarding each scan line individually as a closed hysteresis loop, we treat the scan lines in the experimentally obtaind images as a sequence of connected hysteresis loops. Each loop consists of the trace and retrace scan line. The five parameters of the model are then fitted to our observed data in order to compensate for the image distortions. A standard deviation of 0. 2 % is reached. Furthermore, the properties of the model reveal what happens when a sudden change in scan range or scan offset is applied: the connected hysteresis loops reveal a rate-independent convergence which can be mistaken as the commonly known creep. This, however, is a time-dependent relaxation phenomenon which is not significant in our experiments. Thus our model predicts the <b>quasi-static</b> piezo <b>movement</b> within the required 0. 2 % error limit even for arbitrary scan movements. The model can also be applied to the critical piezo movement in the z direction. The model will be used online to determine the optimal shape of the control voltage so that the piezo moves linearly during the whole scan process. (orig.)

40|$|Wheelchair-users who cannot {{reposition}} themselves often {{suffer from}} pressure ulcers which are places of tissue {{breakdown in the}} buttock region under the sacrum and ischial tuberosities. Periodic pressure relief is needed to recover the buttock tissue from continuous deformation and impairment of tissue perfusion. Because pelvis alignment directly affects body posture and buttock load, a passive motion technique was developed that adjusts pelvis orientation independent from the trunk and seat support. This study investigates {{the effects of the}} so-called decoupled pelvis rotation (DPR) on the loads at the buttock–seat interface and evaluates whether this technique is applicable to regulate buttock load in sitting. Eighteen healthy male subjects participated in this study. Experiments were performed with a computer-aided adjustable simulator chair, instrumented with a concept of DPR. Measurements involved <b>quasi-static</b> actuated pelvis <b>movements</b> in the sagittal and frontal plane. Pelvis orientation, buttock interface pressures, seat reaction forces and centre of pressure were simultaneously measured. As a result of the induced passive pelvis movements, the pelvis rotated 19 ± 2 ° and 9 ± 2 ° in the sagittal and frontal plane, respectively. Significant relations were found between pelvis rotation and most quantities of buttock load. Findings suggest that DPR is an effective technique to regulate buttock load in able-bodied individuals. For clinical application, this technique is still to be evaluated on individuals who cannot functionally reposition themselves. Impairments to the neuromuscular function influence postural response from chair adjustments which makes clinical investigation necessary...|$|R
40|$|Modern civil {{structures}} {{as well as}} loads on {{them are}} still too complex to be accurately modeled or simulated. Therefore, structural failures and structural defects are NOT uncommon! More and more full-scale structural monitoring systems have been deployed in order to monitor how structures behave under various loading conditions. This research focuses on how to maximise benefits from such full-scale measurements by employing advanced digital signal processing techniques. This study is based on accelerometer and GPS data collected on three very different structures, namely, the steel tower in Tokyo, the long and slender suspension bridge in Hong Kong, and the tall office tower in Sydney, under a range of loading conditions, i. e., typhoon, earthquake, heavy traffic, and small scale wind. Systematic analysis of accelerometer and GPS data has demonstrated that the two sensors complement each other in monitoring the static, <b>quasi-static</b> and dynamic <b>movements</b> of the structures. It has also been confirmed that the Finite Element Model could under-estimate the natural frequencies of structures by more than 40 % in some case. The effectiveness of using wavelet to de-noise GPS measurement has been demonstrated. The weakness and strengths of accelerometer and GPS have been identified and framework has been developed on how to integrate the two {{as well as how}} to optimize the integration. The three-dimensional spectral analysis framework has been developed which can track the temporal evolution of all the frequency components and effectively represents the result in the 3 D spectrogram of frequency, time and magnitude. The dominant frequency can also be tracked on the 3 D mesh to vividly illustrate the damping signature of the structure. The frequency domain coherent analysis based on this 3 D analysis framework can further enhance the detection of common signals between sensors. The developed framework can significantly improve the visualized performance of the integrated system without increasing hardware costs. Indoor experiments have shown the excellent characteristics of the optical fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) for deformation monitoring. Innovative and low-cost approach has been developed to measure the shift of FBG&# 146;s central wavelength. Furthermore, a schematic design has been completed to multiplex FBGs in order to enable distributed monitoring. In collaboration with the University of Sydney, the first Australian full-scale structural monitoring system of GPS and accelerometer has been deployed on the Latitude Tower in Sydney to support current and future research...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to changes}} in ambient {{pressure}} and to the gas-exchange processes in the middle ear (ME) cavity, the ear is subject to ultra-low-frequency pressure variations, which are many orders of magnitude larger than the loudest acoustic pressures. Little quantitative data exist on how ME mechanics deals with these large quasi-static pressure changes {{and because of this}} lack of data, only few efforts could be made to incorporate quasi-static behavior into computer models. When designing and modeling ossicle prostheses and implantable ME hearing aids, the effects of large ossicle <b>movements</b> caused by <b>quasi-static</b> pressures should be taken into account. We investigated the response of the ME to slowly varying pressures by measuring the displacement of the umbo and the stapes in rabbit with a heterodyne interferometer with position decoder. Displacement versus pressure curves were obtained at linear pressure change rates between 200  Pa/s and 1. 5  kPa/s, with amplitude ± 2. 5  kPa. The change in stapes position associated with a pressure change is independent of pressure change rate (34  μm peak-to-peak at ± 2. 5  kPa). The stapes displacement versus pressure curves are highly nonlinear and level off for pressures beyond ± 1  kPa. Stapes motion shows no measurable hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, which demonstrates that the annular ligament has little viscoelasticity. Hysteresis increases strongly at the lowest pressure change rates. The stapes moves in phase with the umbo and with pressure, but the sense of rotation of the hysteresis loop of stapes is phase inversed. Stapes motion is not a simple lever ratio mimic of umbo motion, but is the consequence of complex changes in ossicle joints and ossicle position. The change in umbo position produced by a ± 2. 5  kPa pressure change decreases with increasing rate from 165  μm at 200  Pa/s to 118  μm at 1. 5  kPa/s. Umbo motion already shows significant hysteresis at 1. 5  kPa/s, but hysteresis increases further as pressure change rate decreases. We conclude that in the <b>quasi-static</b> regime, ossicle <b>movement</b> is not only governed by viscoelasticity, but that other effects become dominant as pressure change rate decreases below 1  kPa/s. The increasing hysteresis can be caused by increasing friction as speed of movement decreases, and incorporating speed-dependent friction coefficients will be essential to generate realistic models of ossicle movements at slow pressure change rates...|$|R
