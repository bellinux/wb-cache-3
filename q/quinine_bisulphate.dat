40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. Benzaldehydes and substituted benzaldehydes react with primary amines readily to give Schiff bases whose fluorescence properties have been examined. Only salicylaldehyde shows any potential as a fluorigenic reagent. Some derivatives of this aldehyde have been prepared and their relative fluorescence compared with <b>quinine</b> <b>bisulphate.</b> [Continues. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} dose oral activated charcoal on quinine elimination {{has been studied}} following a therapeutic (600 mg) dose of <b>quinine</b> <b>bisulphate</b> to seven normal volunteers. Activated charcoal lowered quinine half-life from 8. 23 +/- 0. 57 s. d. h to 4. 55 +/- 0. 15 s. d. h (P less than 0. 001) and increased its oral clearance by 56 %. Activated charcoal may {{have a role in}} the management of quinine poisoning...|$|E
40|$|A double-blind, placebo-controlled, {{cross-over}} {{trial of}} quinine in leg cramps occurring at rest {{was conducted in}} 22 elderly cramp sufferers. Despite demonstration of impaired quinine elimination in the elderly, prescription of the traditional dose of 300 mg <b>quinine</b> <b>bisulphate</b> at night failed to produce a significant (P = 0. 1) {{reduction in the number}} or severity of cramps. There was a significant relationship between serum quinine concentration and attenuation of cramps. However, the simple expedient of increasing the nightly dose of quinine may carry the concomitant risk of cinchonism...|$|E
