40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{estimates}} {{of the effect of}} household financial and real wealth on consumption. The analysis refers to eleven OECD countries and takes into account the years from 1997 to 2008. Unlike most of the previous literature, we exploit European quarterly harmonized data on household financial assets and liabilities, which have been taken from the flow of funds. We measure not only the effect of total financial wealth on consumption, but we also consider the impact of a subset of those financial assets (i. e., <b>quoted</b> <b>shares,</b> mutual funds, insurance technical reserves) that are more linked to the Stock Exchange. Furthermore, we implement a recent econometric approach that allows for more flexible assumptions in the non-stationary panel framework under consideration. Our main results show that both net financial and real wealth {{have a positive effect on}} consumption. Overall, the influence of net financial assets is stronger than that of real assets. Using <b>quoted</b> <b>shares,</b> mutual funds and insurance technical reserves as a measure of financial wealth, we obtain a lower estimate of the marginal propensity to consume, possibly due to the strong concentration of equity instruments in the richest households.

40|$|We take {{a closer}} look at the links between {{corporate}} capital structure and productivity, profitability and access to finance based on Danish industry-level and firm-level accounting data from the period 2000 - 2011. Our results indicate that the capital structure has no significant impact on the firms' profitability or productivity. However, the capital structure is important in relation to the range of financing options available to the firm and its funding and refinancing risks. Our analysis shows that small and medium-sized enterprises with high solvency ratios tend to have a higher acceptance rate when they apply for bank loans than corresponding firms with low solvency ratios. We also find that firms issuing exchange-traded stocks have higher solvency ratios than unquoted public firms. Finally we compare the corporate capital structure in Denmark with other EU countries based on aggregated financial accounts statistics. The overall funding pattern of Danish firms is quite similar to the one found in the other European countries. However, the Danish firms tend to a somewhat lesser extent to use market based funding such as <b>quoted</b> <b>shares</b> and corporate bonds which might reflect a large and well-functioning Danish market for mortgage bonds and the prevalence of industry foundations in Denmark...|$|E

40|$|As {{early as}} 1976, {{management}} guru Peter Drucker declared the US {{to be the}} first real socialist eco n-omy. Since the early 1950 s when General Motors set up a corporate pension fund, the share of private pension savings in the total amount of accumulated capital has increased steadily, reaching almost one third in the year Drucker’s book was published. Drucker predicted that pension funds would possess more than 70 per cent of the publicly <b>quoted</b> <b>shares</b> and over 40 per cent of the bonds in the early 1990 s. Drucker’s predictions proved wrong. Nevertheless he did get one thing right: the presence of public and private pension funds in worldwide share and bond markets has become overwhelming, as has their role, so I will argue, in the worldwide tendency to model corporate governance systems on the US benchmark. Hence, the decision to shift the burden of pension provision from public to private pension plans and from a pay-as-you-go to a funded system is sure to set in motion far reaching chances in nonliberal institutional environments. Recently it has dawned among students of comparative political economy that pension systems are a crucial ‘nexus ’ between welfare regimes and the production system. However, the exact logic underlying this nexus has been left largely unexplored. Using recent insights from financial geography, I argue that the need to maximize returns, minimize risks...|$|E
40|$|Share {{issues are}} a {{significant}} source of finance for non-financial corporations in Belgium. Between 1995 and 2005, they represented around 32 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations. Share issues are therefore the second most important source of finance, the first being non-bank credit, which accounts for 51 p. c. of the total. Share issues are a much more important source of funding than bank credit and issues of fixed-income securities. Unquoted shares represent the major part of this, namely 27 p. c., mainly because of the high level of foreign direct investment. <b>Quoted</b> <b>shares</b> represented only 5 p. c. of the cumulative new liabilities of non-financial corporations during the period 1995 - 2005. An empirical analysis of the determinants of the capital structure highlights the fact that quoted companies having more intangible fixed assets are more inclined to opt for equity financing. Conversely, other factors, such as the company’s debt level, size and internal resources have a negative influence on equity financing. The timing of the use of this type of financing depends partly on macroeconomic factors such as real and financial investments of the corporations. The cost of capital may also be regarded as a key determinant of the use of equity financing over time. Substantial issues were recorded during the period 1999 - 2001 and from mid 2005 onwards. These developments coincided with either a cost of capital well below its long-run average or a movement in the cost of capital which was more favourable than the price of alternative sources of finance. The recent government measure aimed at allowing the deduction of notional interest charges could also give a substantial boost to new share issues. capital structure, corporate finance, equities...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} previously unexplored {{model to the}} valuation of a corporation using financial reporting and accounting numbers. In our view, this model promotes dissemination and exchange of ideas about the new perspectives of the value analysis and it claims that traditional valuation models does recognised the investors behaviour in satisfactory approach {{at the same time}} of the corporate value. This research has been validating on a panel data of listed firms on the Euronext Lisbon as the Portuguese stock market. The population identifies 291 firms with officially <b>quoted</b> <b>shares</b> in the stock market, but after a process of depuration, the sample is 1. 079 observations related with 114 firms, from December 31, 1991 until December 31, 2001. Further, by being able to identify corporate value, our model provides opportunities {{to gain a better understanding}} of the link between quality of the information produced and corporate strategies. Also, the quality of the economic decisions can also be inferred from publicly available data, our model generates new opportunities for empirical research. The first answer to the question of this research argues that econophysics literature examine the robustness of the relation between accounting (valuation) and physics (thermal comfort). In this perspective, the objective of valuation is to provide information about the firm and the objective of thermal comfort is to provide information about the person. The research promotes, more and more, that nature began to be governed by physical laws and we started to wonder whether such laws are able to apply to Human or firms sphere was well. Also prone to this problem, is valuation governed by accounting principles. The second answer to the question of this research explains Fanger's model as an application of the firm value. In other words, by testing the firm value with different variables, we can move towards understanding not only of the emergent behavioural rules for firms and investors, but also to learn from these rules. This illustrates the innovation that it develops the widely-used International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 7730 : 2005 (E) and it permits to incorporate the company-specific valuation approach which use computing results obtained from large simulation. In addition, this standard is precisely, unequivocally defines and contributes to the literature by analyzing the standard implementation to which the valuation model is applied. The third answer to the question of this research shows the development of a theoretical model of the corporate value that links characteristics from the financial reporting such as operational, investment, financial, dividends, tax and market derived from corporate strategies adopted of the firm that provides a case study that it has been validated and understandable...|$|E

30|$|There {{are other}} reasons as well. The SEC adopted decimalized prices in 2000. This {{decision}} directed stock exchanges to <b>quote</b> <b>share</b> prices in decimal form instead of using the traditional fractions, which supported wider spreads (Securities and Exchange Commission 2012). This made traditional market-making less profitable, reduced the size of securities trades, and enhanced the demand for more sophisticated computerized trading. After 1998, when more ECNs were registered and set up by brokerage firms, the number of trading venues that supported algorithmic trading further increased. Then, during the {{years leading up to}} the mid- 2000 s, the SEC sought to ensure that all of the existing domestic exchanges were linked together, so their prices would be more easily accessed to support more efficient market trading. This resulted in the SEC’s 2005 promulgation of the Regulation National Market System (NMS) (Bunge 2014, Securities and Exchange Commission 2005), which enabled the current trading mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first broadly {{representative}} study for any early twentieth-century {{economy of the}} extent to which quoted company ownership was already divorced from managerial control. In the 337 largest, independent, UK companies in the Investor's year book (those with £ 1 million or more <b>quoted</b> <b>share</b> capital in 1911), the generality of public shareholders were a narrower group than today, but directors personally owned only 3. 4 per cent of the shares. This indicates a lower level of personal ownership (and board voting control) in the largest securities market of the early twentieth century than in any of the world's major securities markets toward the end of that century. Berle, Means, Gordon, and others subsequently quantified the US's later and (on this dimension) less advanced managerial ‘revolution’.

More precisely, we concentrate on the effects of cross-listing of a foreign company on a CEE Stock Exchange. Our results indicate that the respective home markets react slightly negatively to such a cross-listing with trading volumes increasing considerably and prices tumbling. By contrast, interest in the newly listed stock is strong on the new markets {{on the first day of}} trading only; thereafter turnover drops sharply and recovers slowly. Consequently, this study cannot support the assumption of perfect market integration, but rather highlights the existence of a segmented international stock exchange market. cross-listings; event study; CEE; stock market integration; Central and Eastern Europe; stock exchange. ...|$|R

The Latin omits 1:3-6 and 2:1, and these sections have no parallel in Epistle of Barnabas; therefore, they may be a later addition, suggesting Hermas and the present text of the Didache may have used a common source, or one may have relied on the other. Chapter 2 contains the commandments against murder, adultery, corrupting boys, sexual promiscuity, theft, magic, sorcery, abortion, infanticide, coveting, perjury, false testimony, speaking evil, holding grudges, being double-minded, not acting as you speak, greed, avarice, hypocrisy, maliciousness, arrogance, plotting evil against neighbors, hate, narcissism and expansions on these generally, with references to the words of Jesus.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} to implementing Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), called Quoted DSLs (QDSLs), that is inspired by two old ideas: quasi-quotation, from McCarthy’s Lisp of 1960, and the subformula principle of normal proofs, from Gentzen’s natural deduction of 1935. QDSLs reuse facilities provided for the host language, since host and <b>quoted</b> terms <b>share</b> the same syntax, type system, and normalisation rules. QDSL terms are normalised to a canonical form, inspired by the subformula principle, which guarantees that one can use higher-order types in the source while guaranteeing first-order types in the target, and enables using types to guide fusion.
