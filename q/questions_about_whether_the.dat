5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, there were <b>{{questions}}</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> victory would be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding {{and a lack of}} care shown towards breeding stock selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in Saint-Maixent and La Roche-sur-Yon, created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook.|$|E

He took an active interest in the education of officers as superintendent of the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction by increasing and modernizing the curriculum. The period after World War I when he served as Commandant was one of manpower shortages and personnel problems as well as <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Treasury Department or the Navy Department should control the Coast Guard. Reynolds was able to guide the service through the difficulties of control and actually increased the number of vessels and men serving under him.|$|E

Frank manipulates Walker into {{volunteering}} his travel records, which reveal his visits to a marriage counselor and raise <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> donations were discussed. Wishing to avoid public disclosure {{of his personal}} issues, Walker has the White House Counsel coach the counselor, which the special prosecutor interprets as witness tampering. As the House Judiciary Committee begins drafting articles of impeachment, both Walker and Frank offer Tusk a presidential pardon in exchange for implicating each other. Tusk sides with Walker at first, leaving Frank no other option than to regain the president's trust as a friend. Walker then calls off his deal with Tusk, who testifies against him. With Walker forced to resign, Frank is sworn in as president.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers held a 91–36 record through August 25. However, a late season slump, {{in which}} the team lost 20 of 25 games (highlighted by 11 {{straight}} losses), led to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers would succeed in the postseason. Despite the slump, the team recovered to win eight of its final ten regular season games, securing their fifth consecutive National League West title and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the postseason, the Dodgers swept the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Division Series and defeated the defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs in the previous year's rematch of the National League Championship Series in five games. This was the first appearance in the Fall Classic for the Dodgers since 1988, the tenth since the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958, and the 19th overall.|$|E

"I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E

500|$|The case {{fractured}} the court; {{the nine}} justices issued {{a total of}} six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell's opinion. [...] Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. [...] Nevertheless, UC Davis's program went too far for a majority of justices, and it was struck down and Bakke admitted. [...] The practical effect of Bakke was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. <b>Questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Bakke case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were answered in 2003 when the court upheld Powell's position in a majority opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger.|$|E
500|$|On 30 April 2009, Beatrix {{and other}} members of the royal family were at the town of Apeldoorn when a 38-year-old man, Karst Tates, drove his Suzuki Swift {{automobile}} into the crowd, narrowly missing the open-top bus the royal family members were riding on. Seven people were killed and further celebrations were cancelled. Tates died of injuries sustained in the attack soon afterwards and his exact motives remain unclear, though it appears his target was the royal family. The incident provoked <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> royal family should continue to participate in the celebrations. [...] However, Beatrix indicated that the tragedy would not stop her from meeting her people. In 2010, Beatrix and her family visited [...] Wemeldinge and Middelburg, in Zeeland province. [...] There were no incidents, and afterwards, the Queen thanked Zeeland for giving Koninginnedag back to her family, and to her country.|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} {{of the woman in}} the bed is not known, but the archaeologists who excavated the site have suggested that she was [...] "a female member of the local aristocracy, probably a princess and an outsider, whose personal status was strong enough to act as a catalyst for the site" [...] and that her companions were similarly [...] "a group of people of high status from outside the region." [...] Average life expectancy at the time was short– only 32years for men and 28years for women– so {{it is possible that the}} cemetery was used exclusively by members of the [...] "princess's" [...] community and ceased to be used when the last member died. This would fit with its short period of usage, perhaps only 30years or so, judging from the age of the artefacts found during the excavations. Steve Sherlock, the site's discoverer, believes that she was buried first and that the other graves were dug around hers afterward. Next to her grave is a probable male grave, to which it may be linked. The close proximity of the graves and their offset from the rest of the graves in the cemetery raises <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> occupants were related.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{questions}} over whether Eleanor Cook {{is the true}} identity of Little Miss 1565 still unanswered {{in the eyes of}} many, the body was exhumed after the release of A Matter of Degree and buried in Southampton, Massachusetts, next to the body of Edward Cook, the brother of Eleanor Cook and a victim of the circus fire himself. In 1992, her death certificate was officially changed from the previous identification of [...] "1565". Since then, the Cook family has raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> body is indeed that of Eleanor Cook, and some investigators have come to believe Eleanor's body may have been another of the unclaimed bodies from the fire and not Little Miss 1565.|$|E
2500|$|Boorda, a Vietnam War veteran, died in May 1996, {{at the age}} of 56, when he {{committed}} suicide by shooting himself in the chest. The reason for his suicide was reportedly that he was upset about a media investigation into the legitimacy of his having worn on his uniform two service ribbons with bronze [...] "V" [...] (valor) devices which were generally perceived to indicate heroism in combat. Boorda had earned the two medals during the war represented by the ribbons, but there were <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> two devices on the decorations were authorized. Although Boorda participated in combat situations off the coast of Vietnam and had been given permission to wear the devices, it was determined before and after he died, that he did not meet the Navy's combat requirements to wear the devices. Boorda had removed the two ribbon devices on his uniform almost a year before he died and was generally perceived as having made a good faith error in believing he was authorized to wear the devices, as opposed to an intentional effort to be deceptive.|$|E

2500|$|Result: Platinum {{created a}} cycling-based brand called Cyc, while Odyssey had a dance themed brand called Release. There was much tension from {{early in the}} task, as Maria and Ashleigh {{made it clear that}} they {{considered}} themselves the ones really in charge of their respective teams, leading to Patrick and Lucy taking lesser roles. Lucy responded by focusing on the parts of the task which Ashleigh was uninterested in, but Patrick effectively fought back against Maria by making unilateral decisions without consulting her. In particular he had a choir perform a rendition of [...] "Poker Face" [...] at the Trafford Centre for their viral video, which did prove somewhat attention grabbing, but was criticised for having no relevance to the campaign. Their overall campaign did get praise for tapping into what was considered the fastest-growing sport in the UK. Odyssey's video was considered much better, and their campaign was praised for having a long-term plan involving using the brand to fund youth projects, though the plan itself was considered unrealistically expensive, and there were <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> market would be too crowded. Ultimately though, Odyssey's campaign was deemed to be better than Platinum's in almost every major aspect, resulting in them winning the task.|$|E
2500|$|NATO {{published}} {{a statement on}} the war in Donbass and the Crimean Crisis in August 2014. It attempted to debunk the Russian government's accusations against the Ukrainian government, and also other statements made by Russia to justify its presence in Ukraine. According to the statement, Russia attempted to [...] "divert attention away from its actions" [...] and [...] "levelled a series of accusations against NATO which are based on misrepresentations of the facts". It also said that Russia [...] "made baseless attacks on the legitimacy of the Ukrainian authorities and has used force to seize part of Ukraine's territory". In response to the unauthorised entry of the Russian humanitarian convoy on 22 August, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen stated that this incident could [...] "only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel. The disregard of international humanitarian principles raises further <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> true purpose of the aid convoy is to support civilians or to resupply armed separatists". Late in August, NATO generals met and revised their assessment of the military situation in Donbass. They said that, from the Ukrainian government's point of view, the war is already lost. It was anticipated that the late-August offensive in southern Donetsk Oblast could be used to create a Russian land corridor to Crimea, consolidating the illegal annexation of the peninsula. NATO general Philip Breedlove said on 20 September that the ceasefire implemented as part of the Minsk Protocol was [...] "a ceasefire in name only", and criticised Russia for allowing men and equipment to flow freely across its border into Donbass.|$|E
