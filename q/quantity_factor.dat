The problem of combinatorial explosion in system development inevitably arises when dealing with cyberworlds. To solve the problem, we have developed a data processing system called the Cellular Data System (CDS), based on the Incrementally Modular Abstraction Hierarchy (IMAH) in the cellular model, which offers powerful mathematical reason. In this paper, we design and implement a continuous <b>quantity</b> <b>factor</b> to deal with objects that express continuous quantity and integrate it into the condition formula search, which is the effective data search function of CDS, used to analyze data in cyberworlds without limitation by defining schema. If you take advantage of continuous quantity factors with the condition formula search in business application development, application logic development is made much simpler. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of a continuous <b>quantity</b> <b>factor</b> by taking up examples of core logic development of business applications...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} main factors {{that contributed to}} the {{increase}} in medicine expenditure of the National Health Insurance Fund in Sudan in the period 2006 – 2010. A time-series decomposition analysis was adopted for pharmaceutical expenditure increases characterized by trends and seasonality (time-series data per quarter). The change in real spending is decomposed into three components: price, quantity and residual. The contributions of these components towards pharmaceutical expenditure were then determined by means of chained price and quantity indexes. The consumer price index rose by about 195. 56 % over the period of the study. The real spending index shows that real medicine expenditures increased by 66. 30 % during the period 2006 – 2010. Relative prices increased by 6. 73 %; Quantity increased by 91. 04 %, and the residual contribution decreased by 18. 44 %.

In this paper, we further extend the current literatures {{to look into}} joint inventory, pricing, and advertising decisions considering loss aversion effects under the newsvendor setting. The purpose is to explore how the loss aversions affect the optimal policy of order quantity, price, and advertising effort level. We present an integrated utility model to measure both economic payoff and loss aversion utility of the newsvendor, where surplus loss aversion and stockout loss aversion are first separately defined and quantified. Then, we analyze the optimal solution conditions of the integrated model under exogenous and endogenous price cases, respectively. Under exogenous price case, {{we find that the}} uniquely optimal policy exists and is presented in the closed form. Under endogenous price case, the optimal policy is determined under mild conditions; we also provide the solutions when order <b>quantity</b> <b>factor</b> or advertising effort level is fixed in this case.

However, it is difficult to measure accurately the SNR in clinical parallel MR images. This study is to develop a SNR measurement method using a modified identical region of interest (ROI) technique in clinical parallel MR images. Phantom experiments were performed on a 1. 5 and 3. 0 Tesla MRI machine to compare three different methods of SNR measurements. We also performed SNR measurements in clinical cases. The method is consisted of the following four steps: 1) Calculation of standard deviation (SD) map 2) Edge detection and removal on SD map 3) Interpolation of the removed edge region 4) Calculation of SNR map using the interpolated SD map. Our developed method were approximately consistent with those of other SNR measurement methods in both phantom and clinical images.

40|$|Soil {{phosphorus}} (P) quantity-intensity (q-i) relationships, {{based on}} common extraction methods, may potentially {{be used to}} estimate the risk of P loss in overland flow and subsurface drainage water. Some workers have used nonlinear q-i relationships to derive thresholds in soil test P (STP; a <b>quantity</b> <b>factor)</b> above which the risk of P loss increases, while others find linear relationships and no threshold. We present here a simple modelling exercise (based on Langmuir adsorption theory) along with data from literature to explain the behaviour of q-i relationships, and to give an explanation for this apparent discrepancy. The data indicate that q-i relationships are dependent upon the soil to solution ratio of the P intensity parameter, adsorption capacity (Qmax) and strength (K) of the soil, and the total range in STP. In turn, this affects the calculation of a threshold in STP. The q-i relationship tends towards linearity under conditions of a narrow total range of STP and/or when using a wide soil to solution ratio for estimating the P intensity parameter. Under such conditions, a threshold is difficult to detect, and uncertain. We conclude that the sensitivity of thresholds to experimental conditions and soils needs to be considered if thresholds are {{to be successful in}} environmental management to decrease P loss to surface waters...|$|E
40|$|Low {{phosphorus}} (P) in acid sandy soils of the West African Sudano-Sahelian zone {{is a major}} limitation to crop growth. To compare treatment {{effects on}} total dry matter (TDM) of crops and plant available P (P-Bray and isotopically exchangeable P), field experiments were carried out for 2 years at four sites where annual rainfall ranged from 560 to 850 mm and topsoil pH varied between 4. 2 and 5. 6. Main treatments were: (i) crop residue (CR) mulch at 500 and 2000 kg ha− 1, (ii) eight different rates and sources of P and (iii) cereal/legume rotations including millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp.) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.). For the two Sahelian sites with large CR-induced differences in TDM, mulching did not modify significantly the soils ’ buffering capacity for phosphate ions but led to large increases in the intensity factor (CP) and quantity of directly available soil P (E 1 min). In the wetter Sudanian zone lacking effects of CR mulching on TDM mirrored a decline of E 1 min with CR. Broadcast application of soluble single superphosphate (SSP) at 13 kg P ha− 1 led to large increases in CP and quantity of E 1 min at all sites which translated in respective TDM increases.
