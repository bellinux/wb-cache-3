40|$|Learning with {{recurrent}} {{neural networks}} (RNNs) on long sequences is a notoriously difficult task. There are three major challenges: 1) complex dependencies, 2) vanishing and exploding gradients, and 3) efficient parallelization. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective RNN connection structure, the DilatedRNN, which simultaneously tackles all <b>of</b> these challenges. <b>The</b> proposed architecture {{is characterized by}} multi-resolution dilated recurrent skip connections and can be combined flexibly with diverse RNN cells. Moreover, the DilatedRNN reduces <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> parameters needed and enhances training efficiency significantly, while matching state-of-the-art performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term dependencies. To provide a theory-based <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> architecture's <b>advantages,</b> we introduce a memory capacity measure, the mean recurrent length, which is more suitable for RNNs with long skip connections than existing measures. We rigorously prove <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DilatedRNN over other recurrent neural architectures.

40|$|Although histopathological dermal elastosis is {{the current}} gold {{standard}} for <b>the</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> photoageing, noninvasive methods for quantifying <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> photodamage to skin are clearly preferable. This study {{is the first to}} survey five noninvasive methods of assessing photoageing (clinical examination, spectrophotometry, skin surface topography, reflectance confocal microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy) in the same individual. Measurements for each noninvasive method were compared across nine individuals from three participant groups (younger 2 ̆ 7, older 2 ̆ 7 and photodamaged 2 ̆ 7) in UV-protected volar and UV-exposed dorsal forearm skin.

40|$|Nucleoside analogs (NAs) {{are used}} to treat {{numerous}} viral infections and cancer. They compete with endogenous nucleotides (dNTP/NTP) for incorporation into nascent DNA/RNA and inhibit replication by preventing subsequent primer extension. To date, an integrated mathematical model that could allow <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> their mechanism <b>of</b> action, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various resistance mechanisms, and their effect on viral fitness is still lacking. We present the first mechanistic mathematical model of polymerase inhibition by NAs {{that takes into account}} <b>the</b> reversibility <b>of</b> polymerase inhibition. Analytical solutions for the model point out the cellular- and kinetic aspects of inhibition. Our model correctly predicts for HIV- 1 that resistance against nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can be conferred by decreasing their incorporation rate, increasing their excision rate, or decreasing their affinity for the polymerase enzyme. For all analyzed NRTIs and their combinations, model-predicted macroscopic parameters (efficacy, fitness and toxicity) were consistent with observations. NRTI efficacy was found to greatly vary between distinct target cells. Surprisingly, target cells with low dNTP/NTP levels may not confer hyper-susceptibility to inhibition, whereas cells with high dNTP/NTP contents are likely to confer natural resistance. Our model also allows <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selective <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> mutations by integrating their effects on viral fitness and drug susceptibility.

40|$|Several {{academic}} and commercial organizations {{around the world}} are developing the Fluoride salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor (FHR) technology, due to its safety features and potential to generate high temperature energy for electricity and process heat applications. The Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) being considered in this study is a FHR design developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and based on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> graphite as moderator, TRISO particles as fuel and FLiBe as coolant. The AHTR reference design is based on a traditional batch refueling approach, which requires to shut down the reactor and replace/reshuffle a certain amount of fuel assemblies in the core at a specific frequency. Several options have been evaluated in the design process, in order to maximize <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> a single batch and optimize <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> fuel. However, <b>the</b> relatively short cycle and poor fuel utilization are intrinsic features of this family of reactors, due to the low heavy metal loading in the core and insufficient moderation, which are competing aspects in terms of core volume fraction. Since the fuel is expected to be more expensive than <b>the</b> fuel <b>of</b> light water reactors (LWR), this issue might challenge <b>the</b> economic viability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AHTR. In order to eliminate or ameliorate this issue, a novel approach to refueling has been developed, consisting in continuous on-power refueling, or on-line refueling, in which the refueling procedure is performed at full power or partially reduced power (the reactor is not shut down) and a single assembly is removed per each refueling operation. A systematic neutronic and thermal-hydraulic analysis approach has been developed and performed to assess the viability and safety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> refueling operations, followed by <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> core design requirements and a <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economic <b>advantages</b> deriving from <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> this procedure.

We assert that this success {{is due to the}} ease in which uncertainty can be explicitly incorporated in inference and decision making. To appreciate the profound conceptual change implied by the switch from frequentist to Bayesian views, it is necessary to understand probability as a wider, more powerful concept: <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> inductive logic. <b>The</b> <b>advantages</b> resulting for fisheries sciences are examined and illustrated with examples. Some alleged weaknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bayesian approach are questioned. The important ability and still under-explored potential of Bayesian decision analysis to keep facts and values apart, is also highlighted.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> urbanisation {{has grown}} alarmingly, particularly the last 50 years. <b>The</b> main characteristics <b>of</b> this trend are large population agglomerations and <b>the</b> concentration <b>of</b> a considerable portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{commercial and industrial}} activity of a country in the limited urban space. Currently modern urban areas are characterized by intense environmental problems, <b>the</b> deterioration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> life and <b>the</b> stifling lack <b>of</b> vital space. In this context, urban underground development appears as an important auxiliary alternative approach, in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> sustainable urban growth, answering in critical issues, as <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> vital space, <b>the</b> improvement <b>of</b> environmental conditions and <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> life. Among other, <b>the</b> wide application <b>of</b> urban underground development has to face two important problems: a) <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> methods <b>of</b> valuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underground space, b) decision-making processes have not yet incorporated <b>the</b> environmental <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> utilisation <b>of</b> underground space. <b>The</b> present doctoral thesis answers <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underground space and appraises its environmental advantages. An original methodology was developed, which incorporates elements from <b>the</b> methods <b>of</b> real estate appraisal and adopts tools of Environmental Economy (Benefit Transfer) for <b>the</b> <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environmental <b>advantages</b> in monetary terms. The methodology was applied in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> underground storage facilities in Attica, Greece. It is a typical case, where underground development can offer effective, environmental friendly and long-term solutions. The results prove that, in Attica, <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> an underground storage facility is several times {{higher than that of}} an equivalent surface one. The environmental consequences in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> underground storage facilities are considerably smaller. With <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> underground space as a starting point, <b>the</b> repercussions <b>of</b> this fact were investigated. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> “land rent” was developed for <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> underground space and the basic parameters that affect it were analysed. For first time, the underground space was approached in terms of a deposit and new definitions for <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> deposit and cut-off grade are proposed. Furthermore, the consequences from <b>the</b> incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> underground space in <b>the</b> economic results <b>of</b> mining investment schemes were also examined. Finally, the underground space was examined as a non-renewable resource and an essential differentiation in <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> its price was found through <b>the</b> economic theory <b>of</b> non-renewable resources. ...|$|R
