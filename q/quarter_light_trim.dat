50|$|In cultivation, {{they are}} best grown in light well-drained soil with {{adequate}} moisture, positioning in full sun. <b>Light</b> <b>trimming</b> will retain the compact form after flowering. Most species are easily propagated from seed or small half-hardened tip cuttings.|$|R
25|$|Side {{corridor}} stock {{such as the}} J6 thirds and F2 composites had {{doors with}} adjacent <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors. G1 tea cars had a small dining saloon and kitchen set into {{one end of a}} composite coach. Although there were no external doors to the dining saloon, the windows retained the droplight and <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> arrangement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} very well, Mulford. But it's nearly high water, and the brig's in <b>light</b> <b>trim,</b> {{and we may}} rub and go. By making a short cut here, we shall gain a full mile on the steamer; that mile may save us." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1993 the <b>light</b> <b>quarters</b> and <b>light</b> were {{completely}} renovated.|$|R
50|$|Thunbergia alata seed {{is easy to}} {{germinate}} in humus-rich {{soil with}} some sand. Soaking the seeds in a dish of warm water over night will help improve seed germination when planted. It is a fast grower, blooming quickly, with <b>light</b> <b>trimming</b> encouraging more blossoms.|$|R
5000|$|... 1977: The R5 GTL got opening rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and the R5 L got the new 845 cc engine.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the {{underground}} station underwent complete renovation. The supports and the ceiling were {{fitted with a}} <b>lighter</b> <b>trim</b> along with granite tiles for the floor. The architect Rainer G. Ruemmler originally designed the station, however during the renovation many of the station's original features were removed.|$|R
50|$|Recessed {{lighting}} styles {{have evolved}} with more manufacturers creating quality trims {{for a variety}} of applications. Recessed <b>lighting</b> <b>trim</b> usually comes in the standard baffle in black or white, which is the most popular. They are made to absorb extra light and create a crisp architectural appearance.|$|R
50|$|Built on {{the site}} of an earlier {{courthouse}} made of wood, the two-story building is made of locally quarried dark blue basalt and <b>lighter</b> <b>trim</b> stone from quarries near Elgin and Baker. Features include a hip roof, a central entrance pavilion, and a domed cupola with clock faces on three sides.|$|R

The entrance features a paneled double door surmounted by a large, stained glass, Gothic arched transom <b>light</b> <b>trimmed</b> with splayed brick lintels.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{increased}} {{until it}} was blowing a gale; but the cutter was a good sea boat, and being in <b>light</b> <b>trim</b> made good weather of it. However, even Jack was pleased when he felt a sudden change in {{the motion of the}} vessel, and knew that she was running into Dover harbor.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Elias Laventhal, pictured in bust, [s. d. ]. He is shown from the chest up, looking just left of center.

50|$|Most Old Garden Roses {{of strict}} European {{heritage}} (albas, damasks, gallicas, etc.) are shrubs that bloom once yearly, {{in late spring}} or early summer, on two-year-old (or older) canes. Their pruning requirements are quite minimal because removal of branches will remove next year's flower buds. Hence pruning is usually restricted to just removing weak and spent branches, plus <b>light</b> <b>trimming</b> (if necessary) to reduce overall size.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century, A. Hays Town, an architect, {{redesigned}} {{the original}} French <b>Quarter</b> <b>light</b> {{from the early}} 17th century's European architecture. Andrew John Bevolo was commissioned to build the light. It officially became a company in 1945.|$|R
50|$|The 1954 Morris Cowley was a four-cylinder midsize car {{produced}} from 1954 to 1959. It {{was essentially a}} budget version of the Morris Oxford series III with less chrome, no heater, fixed front <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a simplified dashboard.|$|R
5000|$|September 1974: R5 LS renamed R5 TS. The TS had all {{features}} of the previous LS, plus new front seats with integrated head restraints, black bumpers, illuminated heater panel, front spoiler, clock, opening rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and reversing lights.|$|R
6000|$|What {{makes your}} heart so beat? [...] Some one should stay at her side. [...] When beauty is {{complete}} [...] Her own thought will have died [...] And danger not be diminished; [...] Dimmed at three <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> [...] When moon's round is finished [...] The stars {{are out of}} sight.|$|R
50|$|Rapid Cabriolet (1984 - 1990) - Developed {{from the}} Rapid Coupe at Ludgate Design Developments in Kent {{initially}} in Standard form only, {{which included a}} removable full-sized hood and a central rollover T-bar. The rarer Lux model available from 1987 had wind down rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> At least 334 cabriolets were sold in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|An {{additional}} 4 {{inches of}} wheelbase provided greater rear legroom, equaling {{that of the}} long wheelbase model Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud also introduced that year. [...] Removable rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> allowed an unobstructed view in and out from the front vent window on back, much valued in the model's popular role as a [...] "parade car".|$|R
50|$|The 3000 sports {{convertible}} Mark II {{was launched}} {{at the end}} of August 1962. It was a true convertible with almost saloon car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swivelling <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a quick-action folding roof. Twin SU HS6 carburettors replaced the triple SUs. Austin-Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons {{between the}} Victor and the broadly similar RÃ¼sselsheim built Opel Rekord Series D were inevitable. An {{important}} {{difference from the}} back seat involved the rear doors. The Opel's door incorporated rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and windows that wound fully down into the door whereas Vauxhall's designers preferred the [...] "cleaner uncluttered look" [...] arising from their elimination of rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> The fact that back seat passengers could only open their windows down to approximately a third of their depth before further opening was blocked by the presence of the wheel arches was held out as a safety feature to complement the fitting of child-proof locks, given that back-seat passengers would no doubt include small children. Despite the absence of shared body panels anywhere that they could be seen, detailed investigation disclosed that minor assemblies such as the door locks and the wiper mechanisms were shared with the Opel Rekord D.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{unidentified}} home in Pasadena {{with a large}} front yard, ca. 1900. The three-story house {{can be seen in}} the background at center. It has light-colored wooden walls with <b>lighter</b> <b>trim.</b> Four cylindrical columns support an overhand over the front porch. The yard in the foreground is a wide grassy area lined with large pepper trees at left and bushes at right. A palm tree {{can be seen in the}} middle of the grass at center. A sidewalk runs across the image in the foreground, past a pepper tree at right...|$|R
5000|$|Mountain and moorland ponies {{are shown}} in their [...] "native" [...] state, and are not trimmed or plaited (braided). In reality a little <b>light</b> <b>{{trimming}}</b> is commonplace, for example {{to show off the}} fine head of the Connemara, and Welsh ponies often have their manes pulled to a length of about six inches. In some cases, trimming is necessary - if a small breeds pony's tail was left to grow unchecked it would become matted with mud and the pony could stand on it, potentially causing injury to itself or its rider.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a {{modified}} 203 which now featured hinged <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows [...] {{on the front}} ends of the front doors and an enlarged rear window on the saloon versions. [...] This upgrade also saw {{the removal of the}} speedometer from the centre of the dashboard to a position directly ahead of the driver.|$|R
50|$|The {{limited edition}} 2014 Chrysler 200 Super S was a Mopar {{modified}} version and included two stages. Stage One enhancements up front include a chin spoiler, mesh {{upper and lower}} grilles with the upper grille finished in gloss black, and satin chrome grille and fog <b>light</b> <b>trim.</b> Side sills and gray or hyper black 18-inch wheels give a firmly planted look, while black chrome badges and satin chrome side molding further differentiate the Super S. In back, more satin chrome finishes the light bar, and a new trunk lid spoiler and a matte black diffuser with integrated exhaust complete the package.|$|R
2500|$|Top {{speed was}} [...] From a {{mechanical}} standpoint the Junior {{differed from the}} 1750 only in engine displacement and output, while inside it lacked some features of the pricier model: namely opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights,</b> centre console, and the three-spoke wood rimmed steering wheel, replaced by a two-spoke plastic rimmed one. From outside the Junior version could be recognised by its black-coloured lower front bumper and absence of plastic headlamp fairings.|$|R
50|$|The Series III was {{produced}} in open and removable hardtop versions. On the hardtop version the top could be removed and the soft-top was stored behind the small rear seat; also the 1592 cc engine was less powerful. To provide more room in the boot, twin fuel tanks in the rear wings were fitted. <b>Quarter</b> <b>lights</b> were fitted to the windows. Between 1963 and 1964, 5863 were made.|$|R
5000|$|Quarter {{glass or}} <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> on {{automobiles}} and closed carriages {{may be a}} side window {{in the front door}} or located {{on each side of the}} car just forward of the rear window of the vehicle. Only some cars have them. In some cases the fixed quarter glass may set in the corner or [...] "C-pillar" [...] of the vehicle. Quarter glass is also sometimes called a valence window.|$|R
50|$|As Fiat and SEAT's {{licensing}} agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing {{with the old}} pushrod Fiat-based engines, <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.|$|R
50|$|With large {{panoramic}} {{windows and}} <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> in the roof, {{the area of}} glass per AK car is 52 m2. To one side of each seat is a jack for headphones for the on-board commentary, {{and in front of}} each seat is a flip-down tray table. Seats facing each other in groups of four are positioned around a fixed table. Power points are provided at each seat area. Carry-on baggage can be stored overhead.|$|R
60|$|Here Bes took {{dust and}} threw it into the air that we might learn from which <b>quarter</b> the <b>light</b> wind blew.|$|R
2500|$|Billed {{extensively}} as the [...] "new-line" [...] Minicar, {{the final}} {{evolution of the}} Bond Minicar was still based {{to a large extent}} on the bodyshell of the Mark F. Nevertheless, a revised shape fibreglass roof, new doors, new windscreen with opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and bigger wheels largely transformed the cars appearance. However, although the car was similar in layout to the Mark F, almost everything mechanically about the Mark G was different with very few components carried over.|$|R
50|$|The RHD Audi 200 5E and 5T were {{introduced}} into the UK in 1979, only 500 were imported. The 5T (170 PS) was a higher spec Turbo version of the 5E (136 PS injection) and came with many optional extras as standard. The UK version of the 5T had opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights,</b> electric door mirrors, a sunroof, cruise control and heated seats. All Type 43 200's came with automatic gearboxes, with a five-speed manual available by special order.|$|R
50|$|The four-door saloon {{body was}} made {{in-house}} by Morris {{and had the}} traditional MG grille flanked by two large chromium-plated headlights. Unlike the SA the front doors did not have separate <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows. The spare wheel was carried on the left front wing, with a second spare {{on the other side}} as an option. Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat at the rear, all with leather covering. A fitted radio was an option.|$|R
