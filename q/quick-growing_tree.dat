6000|$|One may {{be allowed}} to regret that the exuberant loyalty of the {{citizens}} of Port of Spain has somewhat defaced one end at least of their Savannah; for in expectation of a visit from the Duke of Edinburgh, they erected for his reception a pile of brick, of which the best that can be said is that it holds a really large and stately ballroom, and the best that can be hoped is that the authorities will hide it as quickly as possible with a ring of Palmistes, Casuarinas, Sandboxes, and every <b>quick-growing</b> <b>tree.</b> [...] Meanwhile, as His Royal Highness did not come the citizens wisely thought that they might as well enjoy their new building themselves. [...] So there, on set high days, the Governor and the Lady of the Governor hold their court. There, when the squadron comes in, officers in uniform dance at desperate sailors' pace with delicate Creoles; some of them, coloured as well as white, so beautiful in face and figure that one could almost pardon the jolly tars if they enacted a second Mutiny of the Bounty, and refused one and all to leave the island and the fair dames thereof. And all the while the warm night wind rushes in through the high open windows; and the fireflies flicker up and down, in and out, and you slip away on to the balcony to enjoy--for after all it is very hot--the purple star- spangled night; and see aloft the saw of the mountain ridges against the black-blue sky; and below--what a contrast!--the crowd of white eyeballs and white teeth--Negroes, Coolies, Chinese--all grinning and peeping upward against the railing, in the hope of seeing-- through the walls--the 'buccra quality' enjoy themselves.|$|E

50|$|On April 4, 1870, {{the state}} {{legislature}} passed “An Act {{to provide for the}} improvement of PublicParks in the City of San Francisco” Soon after, the newly formed park commission advertised bonds to fund park improvements. Enough bonds were sold to finance a topographical survey of Golden Gate Park and its approach. Surveyor and engineer William Hammond Hall won the contract to survey park land, completed his report on February 15, 1871, and in August that year was appointed as engineer of the park. Initial work completed in 1871 included grading, fencing, drainage and irrigation work, and development of a park nursery. The following year, 22,000 hardy and <b>quick-growing</b> <b>trees</b> were planted, park roads were built, and visitors began to arrive by the thousands.|$|R
60|$|He {{came out}} upon {{the shore of}} the reef-sheltered lagoon where ruined grass houses told him men had lived. The jungle ran riot through the place. Six-inch trees, throated with rotten {{remnants}} of thatched roofs through which they had aspired toward the sun, rose about him. <b>Quick-growing</b> <b>trees</b> had shadowed the kingposts so that the idols and totems, seated in carved shark jaws, grinned greenly and monstrously at the futility of man through a rime of moss and mottled fungus. A poor little sea-wall, never much at its best, sprawled in ruin from the coconut roots to the placid sea. Bananas, plantains, and breadfruit lay rotting on the ground. Bones lay about, human bones, and Jerry nosed them out, knowing them for what they were, emblems of the nothingness of life. Skulls he did not encounter, for the skulls that belonged to the scattered bones ornamented the devil devil houses in the upland bush villages.|$|R

Other types of tree that cause problems are <b>quick-growing,</b> pioneering <b>trees,</b> or those producing {{a substantial amount of}} leaves. Poplars are particularly troubling because they tend to shed limbs.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} make the {{boulevard}} presentable and useful as soon as possible, a <b>quick-growing</b> <b>tree</b> like the acacia might be planted, alternating with the trees of slower growth, and be replaced after the latter attain their growth. The boulevard's seaward side should be planted so as to interrupt occasionally the view of the sea and, by thus adding somewhat of mystery, enhance the value of the stretch of ocean and sky. The boulevard would be on reclaimed land to about as far south as the Old Fort San Antonio Abad in Malate, beyond which it strikes the beach and follows the shore line to Cavite. The possible extension of the ocean boulevard along the north shore would naturally depend upon the development of the town in that direction and upon the question of additional harbor works north of the Pasig River.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of a {{painting}} depicting eucalyptus blossoms and seedpods, ca. 1920 - 1925. About a dozen seedpods are shown blossoming, hanging in a branch down from the upper right corner. They are shown across a neutral background.; "This group consists of more than 400, quick-growing, tender, evergreen trees and some shrubs native to Tasmania and Australia. These unique trees can grow to gigantic proportions; some species can reach heights over 400 feet in their native habitats and up to 200 feet in California. Eucalyptus trees, also popularly known as Gum trees because some species exude a gum, are fragrant and normally pest-resistant. These trees have leathery, smooth, lance-shaped leaves, which have a more rounded shape when young. Their puffball-like flowers may be red or orange and are very attractive to bees. They have no petals, but instead, numerous stamens arising from a capsule-like calyx, which give them their fluffy appearance. The attractive, colorful bark of the stems and trunks of the Eucalyptus may be dappled in gray, green, russet, or cream and may peel in sheets. Besides the decorative qualities of the trees, Eucalyptus are valued for their timber, the important oils of the leaves and shoots, tannin, which is taken from the bark of some varieties, and a resinous substance known as kino. E. parvifolia is a beautiful, medium-sized species that has beautifully colored, peeling bark. At maturity, the leaves are small, slender, and blue-green. This species tolerates alkaline soil. E. citriodora (Lemon-scented gum) is a large, <b>quick-growing</b> <b>tree</b> with smooth, white bark and lemon-scented leaves. E. coccifera (Tasmanian snow gum) is a large tree with bloomy (bloom is a powdery, waxy substance sometimes covering plants) leaves and stems, not evident in young plants.

The largest fruit bodies were found on floodplains with halophilic (i.e., thriving in high-salt conditions) vegetation. In Belgium, specimens were found on sandy soil under dead elderflower bushes.|$|R
