5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A <b>Q</b> <b>value</b> {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 proton shell can be {{obtained}} from two sources: the variation in the partial spontaneous fission half-lives for isotones and the large gap in the alpha <b>Q</b> <b>value</b> for isotonic nuclei of hassium and darmstadtium. For spontaneous fission, it is necessary to measure the half-lives for the isotonic nuclei 268Sg, 270Hs and 272Ds. Since the isotopes 268Sg and 272Ds are not currently known, and fission of 270Hs has not been measured, this method cannot yet be used to confirm the stabilizing nature of the Z=108 shell. Good evidence for the magicity of the Z=108 shell can nevertheless be found from the large differences in the alpha decay energies measured for 270Hs, 271Ds and 273Ds. More conclusive evidence would come from the determination of the decay energy for the unknown nucleus 272Ds.|$|E

30|$|We {{estimate}} <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> (quality {{factor for}} S-wave) of the slab near the southern Kurile trench by using seismic data observed at ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) stations from selected local earthquakes. The seismic rays pass mainly through the slab and this {{enable us to}} directly estimate the slab <b>Qs</b> <b>values.</b> The spectral inversion and coda normalization method are applied to these data. The estimated <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> from the two methods are nearly the same and increase with frequencies. However, these <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> are not high enough to explain the abnormal distribution of ground motion that has been recognized as abnormal distribution of seismic intensities at the Japanese arc. Thus we propose a two-layer Qs structure of the slab to explain the both facts, our slab <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> and the abnormal distribution of ground motion. The two-layer Qs structure consists of the upper layer with not so high <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> (39 f 1.0) and lower layer with very high <b>Qs</b> <b>values</b> (500 f 1.0); the upper layer has a thickness of about 50 km. Seismic activity is restricted only within the upper layer of the two-layer Qs structure. This may mean that the two-layer Qs structure reflects the different material property between {{the upper and lower}} layer of the slab.|$|R

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} modal {{coupling}} is examined for torsional eigen-vibrations of an anelastic earth with oceanic and continental structure. While a coupling effect {{is hard to}} observe in the eigenspectrum, some eigenfunctions show significant coupled energy into a secondary neighbouring multiplet. The deeper the heterogeneity, the greater the coupling. Also, stronger coupl-ing is observed in an elastic earth model than in an anelastic model because the poles of the two modes in the complex s-plane are closer in the elastic case than in the anelastic case. The scatter of <b>Q</b> <b>values</b> in a multiplet is less than 5 per cent in our examples but, in extreme cases, strong coupling produces <b>Q</b> <b>values</b> that range between the two <b>Q</b> <b>values</b> for the average earth models. The result indicates that caution is needed in determining <b>Q</b> <b>values</b> for modes that interfere. The results strongly suggest that necessity of incorporating coupling effects {{in the formulation of}} inversion aimed at resolving heterogeneity in the Earth. ...|$|R
2500|$|In PiCCO, transpulmonary thermodilution, {{which uses}} the Stewart-Hamilton {{principle}} but measures temperatures changes from {{central venous line}} to a central arterial line, i.e., the femoral or axillary arterial line, is used as the calibrating technique. The <b>Q</b> <b>value</b> derived from cold-saline thermodilution is used to calibrate the arterial PP contour, which can then provide continuous Q monitoring. The PiCCO algorithm is dependent on blood pressure waveform morphology (mathematical analysis of the PP waveform), and it calculates continuous Q as described by Wesseling and colleagues. [...] Transpulmonary thermodilution spans right heart, pulmonary circulation and left heart, allowing further mathematical analysis of the thermodilution curve and giving measurements of cardiac filling volumes (GEDV), intrathoracic blood volume and extravascular lung water. Transpulmonary thermodilution allows for less invasive Q calibration but is less accurate than PA thermodilution and requires a central venous and arterial line with the accompanied infection risks.|$|E

40|$|Adsorption {{of sodium}} dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) on {{polystyrene}} (PS) particles {{is described by}} the Langmuir equation only superficially: on closer look there are small but systematic differences with the expts.

At low <b>q</b> <b>values,</b> GE changes in pos. direction with increasing q; at large <b>q</b> <b>values,</b> this trend levels off and may even be {{in the opposite direction}} (depending on the value assumed for total satn. of the surface with surfactants).
