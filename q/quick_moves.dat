2500|$|In Soulcalibur II, Taki {{was given}} more distance-closing moves to help {{compensate}} for her limited range. Nevertheless, the Soulcalibur II guide by GamePro verdicted Taki is an [...] "excellent short range fighter {{with plenty of}} height variation in attack," [...] yet still [...] "weak against good long range opponents" [...] and with [...] "poor offensive capabilities outside short range." [...] The game's review by Marlon Ramos of Philippine Daily Inquirer [...] "of course" [...] highly recommended Taki for the players who are [...] "after speed". In GameSpot's guide to Soulcalibur II, Stephen Kleckner wrote that Taki has [...] "a lot of options and variety which allow her to really mix up her attack heights" [...] and very <b>quick</b> <b>moves</b> making her highly capable at close range, but might [...] "essentially become a moving target" [...] if her player [...] "can't rush down someone who is really good at sustaining a range game, such as Kilik." [...] Andrew Alfonso wrote in GameSpy's guide that [...] "what makes Taki so fearsome is her speed. She's still the fastest character in the game, and despite this her damage potential is still very good at times. However, unlike the big power hitters like Cervantes and Astaroth, she needs to work for her wins." [...] Alfonso added that Taki can be [...] "somewhat hard to learn and execute with" [...] and the key strategy [...] "is to maintain her flow of attack." [...] Taki and Talim, who are both the most acrobatic and fastest characters in Soulcalibur II, were noted to be particularly dangerous in the original version of the HD Online edition due to the Internet multiplayer lag problems.|$|E

50|$|Vikings loved sports. Wrestling was {{the most}} {{widespread}} sport in the Viking Age, and there were several variants. Viking wrestling was divided into glima wrestling, Råbryting (Raw wrestling) and water wrestling. The unrestricted form of Råbryting was crude and wild and differed from glima wrestling because these contests were decided by opponents being pinned down. Water wrestling was a wrestling match in the water, and {{was the most}} popular form of swimming competition. The idea was to keep the opponents head under water until he gave up, and such matches could last for hours. The skilled variants of Glíma wrestling (Brokartök, Hryggspenna, and Lausatök) had complex rules and competitors brought each other down with lightning <b>quick</b> <b>moves</b> and tricks as much with the feet as with the hands. Glima wrestling was divided into several classes based on strength and skill, between two opponents or team competitions between different districts.|$|E
50|$|In the 1975 season opener, the Raiders beat Miami {{and ended}} their 31-game home winning streak. With an 11-3 record, they {{defeated}} Cincinnati 31-28 in the divisional playoff round. Again, the Raiders faced the Steelers {{in the conference}} championship, eager for revenge. According to Madden and Davis, the Raiders relied on quick movement by their wide receivers on the outside sidelines - the deep threat, or 'long ball' - {{more so than the}} Steelers of that year, whose offense was far more run-oriented than it would become later in the 1970s. Forced to adapt to the frozen field of Three Rivers Stadium, with receivers slipping and unable to make <b>quick</b> <b>moves</b> to beat coverage, the Raiders lost, 16-10. The rivalry had now grown to hatred, and became the stereotype of the 'grudge match.' Again, the Raiders came up short, as the Steelers won the AFC Championship and then went on to another Super Bowl title.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gameplay}} is a beat 'em {{up where}} the player can move in all eight directions in an arena fight and the player can kick, punch or do special moves.

It also contributes to the genre by adding a simple combo system, {{the first of its}} kind, in which players can make normal moves that become part of a string of attacks, much like in some beat 'em ups that predate it.|$|E
