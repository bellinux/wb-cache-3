40|$|Abstract: The first {{national}} survey of otter distribution in Slovakia {{was carried out in}} winter 2007 / 2008. The mapping was done using the modified standard IUCN/OSG methodology. Results were obtained from 275 "Databank of Slovak Fauna (DSF) " <b>quadrates</b> (64 % out of 429 DSF <b>quadrates).</b> The second mapping was carried out in winter 2008 / 2009 in 54 DSF <b>quadrates</b> (12. 6 % out of 429 <b>quadrates).</b> In total, this covered 292 <b>quadrates</b> (88. 7 % out of checked quadrates; 61 % out of all 429 <b>quadrates</b> in the Slovak Republic); in 36 <b>quadrates</b> (1 % and 8 %, respectively), no otters were recorded. The third one-off otter mapping on the whole Slovak territory (in all 429 <b>quadrates)</b> was carried out in summer 2010 with the “standard ” method: 349 <b>quadrates</b> (81. 4 %) were positive and 80 <b>quadrates</b> (18. 7 %) were negative. The otter occurs {{in most parts of the}} country with the exception of parts of the Western and South-Eastern lowlands of Slovakia. Otter signs were found in all types of water bodies and channels of all sizes and in different types of reservoirs (dams, ponds, fishponds) in various land cover classes...|$|R

5|$|Middle ear - In crown-group mammals, {{sound is}} carried from the eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes.

5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear.

Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|According to Novas (1993), Herrerasaurus can be {{distinguished}} based on the following features: {{the presence of a}} premaxilla-maxilla fenestra, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the jugal bone, and a deeply incised supratemporal fossa that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the quadratojugal bone overlaps the posterodorsal <b>quadrate</b> face; the pterygoid process of the <b>quadrate</b> has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal dentary process; the surangular bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the humerus' internal tuberosity is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% {{of the size of the}} humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the ilial peduncle forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the ischium.|$|E
5|$|All ankylosaurs that possess these {{characteristics}} - a narrow predentary; a nearly horizontal <b>quadrate</b> {{that is not}} fused and is oriented 30 degrees from the skull roof; the presence of mandibular condyles that are three times wider than long; premaxillary and dentary teeth that are near a symphysis with {{the front of the}} lower jaw (the predentary); a sacrum arched on top; an acromion process above the midpoint of the scapula to coracoid attachment; a straight ischium with a straight dorsal margin; relatively long, slender limbs; sacral shield armour; and the presence of erect pelvic osteoderms with flat bases - form a clade of basal nodosaurids, the Struthiosaurinae. That set of cranial and postcranial features are only present on genera considered to be in the clade. The features above distinguish Struthiosaurinae from other clades and genera found by other analysis'.|$|E
40|$|The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in Slovakia. The population {{of this species}} markedly decreased during the 20 th century. In {{the last two decades}} an increase and a colonizing tendency of the population species range have been registered. A similar trend took place in the Hron River catchment. The modified standard IUCN/OSG method for monitoring of the Eurasian Otter population was used in three field censuses of the otter distribution in the Hron River catchment. Results were obtained at two resolutions, an approximately 10 × 12 km grid from the "Databank of Slovak Fauna (DSF) ", corresponding to 48 <b>quadrates</b> and higher resolution resulting from the subdivision of the first grid corresponding to 152 quadrants of approximately 2. 5 × 3 km). During the first survey (in winter of 1995 / 1996) 35 <b>quadrates</b> (72. 9 %) and 73 quadrants (48. 0 %) were positive. During the second survey (in summer and autumn of 2010) 45 <b>quadrates</b> (93. 7 %), or 116 quadrantes (76. 3 %) were found positive. During the third mapping (in winter of 2011 / 2012) 45 <b>quadrates</b> and 120 (78. 9 %) <b>quadrates</b> were positive. Results of two recent regional surveys (2010, 2011 / 2012) documented an increase in percentage of positive sites for otter and an increase in the range occupied by otters in the Hron River catchment when compared to that in 1995 / 1996. The increase was most pronounced in {{the central part of the}} catchment and probably related with improvement of the surface water quality in 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R

The hair cells are unspecialized, innervated by both afferent and efferent nerve fibres, and respond only to low frequencies. Though the hearing organs are poorly developed and primitive with no visible external ears, they can still show a frequency response from 100 to 800Hz, with peak sensitivity of 40dB at 200Hz.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the <b>quadrate</b> being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a roughened surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the <b>quadrate</b> articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E

5|$|The {{adductor}} muscle of the jaw {{appears to have}} attached to the <b>quadrate</b> instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably {{would not have been able}} to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E
5|$|Variance in {{recovered}} phylogenetic {{positions for}} Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus (results reproduced below). Meanwhile, {{in accordance with}} the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-Márquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the <b>quadrate</b> (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus.|$|E
5|$|In Kirkland's initial {{description}} of Eolambia, he considered {{it to be}} a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the <b>quadrate</b> and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae – the two primary branches of hadrosaurids – and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biology, 2000 Natural {{riparian}} habitats {{are among}} the most diverse, productive, and structurally complex of terrestrial habitats. Although litter-decomposing fungi are integral components of riparian habitats, they are often omitted in studies of riparian ecology and biodiversity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether riparian and upland habitats in Sitka spruce forests differed in the diversity and composition of humicolous saprophytic fungi. Sixteen (4 x 8 m) <b>quadrates</b> were established in both habitats at two replicate study sites. Twelve of the 16 <b>quadrates</b> in each habitat per site were randomly selected each sampling time. Selected <b>quadrates</b> were scrutinized for sporocarps of saprophytic macrofungi and taxa were recorded as present or absent. Soil moisture and temperature were sampled three times during the study, and the slope, aspect, canopy cover, substrate and vegetation covers were measured once. Diversity indices (Dmg, H', E, and 1 /d), dominance-diversity curves, and the Sorensen similarity index were used to compare habitats and sites. Logistic regression was used to determine whether saprophyte taxa and environmental variables were associated with habitat or site. Results show that the riparian habitat contains greater diversity and frequency of saprophytic fungi. The habitats are most dissimilar during the dry season when the riparian soil moisture levels exceed those of the upland habitat. Clavaria rugosa, Fayodia gracilipes, Mycena tenax, and Naucoria escharoides are associated with riparian habitats and M. aurantiimarginata and M galopus are associated with the upland habitat...|$|R

5|$|Most aquatic stereospondyls have {{flattened}} heads. When feeding, {{they probably}} opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws. The jaw {{mechanics of the}} plagiosaurid Gerrothorax is well known, {{and is one of}} the most highly adapted. Gerrothorax is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50° above horizontal through the flexing of the atlanto-occipital joint between the occipital condyles of the skull and the atlas vertebra of the neck. As the skull is raised, the <b>quadrate</b> bone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw to protrude outward. Other stereospondyls probably also lifted their skulls, but they are not as well adapted for such movement. D.M.S. Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in temnospondyls. He envisioned that Mastodonsaurus, a much larger temnospondyl than Gerrothorax, was able to make the same movement. Paleontologist A.L. Panchen also supported the idea in 1959, suggesting that Batrachosuchus also fed in this way. At the time it was thought that these temnospondyls lifted their heads with strong jaw muscles, but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral girdle. Plagiosuchus, a close relative of Gerrothorax, also has a hyobranchial skeleton that muscles may have attached to. Plagiosuchus has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull, suggesting that it could suction feed by rapidly opening its mouth.|$|E

25|$|Of this material, {{only the}} <b>quadrate</b> and orbital roof, in {{addition}} to limited portions of the braincase are preserved with enough fidelity to permit any definitive interpretation. The quadrates of TTU P 9200 and TTU P 9201 are not particularly alike; a fact not easily explained away if the material is conspecific, as Chatterjee insists. There {{does not appear to}} be an orbital process present on either bone, and the modifications of the proximal condyle permitting wide range of motion against the squamosal, are not readily apparent. Furthermore, the quadratojugal and jugal appear far more robust in the Protoavis specimens themselves, than represented by Chatterjee. The size and development of the quadratojugal seems to contradict Chatterjee's assertion that this bone contacted the <b>quadrate</b> via a highly mobile pin joint. These data render the assertion of prokinesis in the skull of Protoavis questionable at best, and it seems most parsimonious to conclude that the specimen displays a conventional opisthostylic <b>quadrate.</b>|$|E
