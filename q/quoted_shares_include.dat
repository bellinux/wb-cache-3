40|$|In {{this paper}} we present new {{estimates}} {{of the effect of}} household financial and real wealth on consumption. The analysis refers to eleven OECD countries and takes into account the years from 1997 to 2008. Unlike most of the previous literature, we exploit European quarterly harmonized data on household financial assets and liabilities, which have been taken from the flow of funds. We measure not only the effect of total financial wealth on consumption, but we also consider the impact of a subset of those financial assets (i. e., <b>quoted</b> <b>shares,</b> mutual funds, insurance technical reserves) that are more linked to the Stock Exchange. Furthermore, we implement a recent econometric approach that allows for more flexible assumptions in the non-stationary panel framework under consideration. Our main results show that both net financial and real wealth {{have a positive effect on}} consumption. Overall, the influence of net financial assets is stronger than that of real assets. Using <b>quoted</b> <b>shares,</b> mutual funds and insurance technical reserves as a measure of financial wealth, we obtain a lower estimate of the marginal propensity to consume, possibly due to the strong concentration of equity instruments in the richest households.

On average, some 8 % (6. 8 million tonnes) of {{the total}} catch by weight of marine organisms caught by fishing boats worldwide are discarded every year, of which about 1. 3 million tonnes are discarded in the fisheries of the northeast Atlantic, mostly in European Union (EU) waters (Kelleher 2005).

5000|$|For {{the first}} time (but {{how long will it}} take us to {{acknowledge}} this?) in the history of ideas, a philosopher had dedicated a whole book to the question of atheism. He professed it, demonstrated it, arguing and <b>quoting,</b> <b>sharing</b> his reading and his reflections, and seeking confirmation from his own observations of the everyday world. His title sets it out clearly: Memoir of the Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier; and so does his subtitle: Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World. The book appeared in 1729, after his death. Meslier had spent the greater part of his life working on it. The history of true atheism had begun.|$|R
