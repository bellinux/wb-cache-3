40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the interplay between}} returns policy, pricing strategy, and <b>quality</b> <b>risk.</b> We define <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> as the possibility of product misfit, defect, or unconformity with the consumers perception. These notions of quality risks differ in return policy restriction, residual values, and whether {{it is possible to}} unambiguously reduce the probability of mismatch. Using a stylized two-segment market setting, we demonstrate that consumer returns are offered only when the high-segment consumers incur a higher hassle cost, and both the <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> and the valuation of the low segment are moderate. Moreover, it is possible to wisely design the returns policy that eliminates all inappropriate returns. Furthermore, the seller with a high-quality risk may offer a refund that exceeds the selling price, which provides a theoretical ground and specific operating regime for the satisfaction guaranteed policy used in some e-tailers. In contrast, when the <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> is relatively low, further improvement on mitigating the <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> may not necessarily benefit the seller. Finally, we observe that the restocking fee may be non-monotonic in product quality; thus, a more generous returns policy does not necessarily indicate a lower <b>quality</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractInformation {{technology}} has significant potential {{to enhance the}} engineering quality of the risk management of railway construction projects. The Shanghai Railway Bureau has promoted a risk management method based on the “A Figure and Four Tables” method (AFFTM) to assess the engineering quality; however, this method still suffers from several problems in railway construction project management. In this paper, we have combined the concepts and processes of the AFFTM with those of information technology and presented the implementation scheme of a new risk management system—the railway construction project <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> management information system (RCPQRMIS) —that {{can be used to}} design and develop workable information tools for <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> management. The paper analyzes the data standards of RCPQRMIS and creates a model for dynamically tracking the <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> (“quality risk dynamic tracking” model) for providing pre-warning information on <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> (“quality risk pre-warning” model) and for automatically generating publicity parameters for <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> (“automatically generated <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> publicity figure” model). The proposed system enables the visualization of the quality associated with the risk control, dynamic tracking, automatic pre-warning, and closed-loop management of railway construction projects. In addition, this paper presents the functional modules of the RCPQRMIS and its practical applications. Our application results show that the system successfully realized unified management of risk source information and multi-level sharing. In this manner, by using our system, we were able to significantly improve real-time tracking and pre-warning of the risk state, automatic generation of <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> publicity figures, efficiency, and risk management levels...|$|E
40|$|Supply {{chain is}} a dynamic system {{and there are a}} lot of {{uncertainties}} in supply chain operations. <b>Quality</b> <b>risk</b> transmits through the supply chain when quality issues are not managed and control appropriately. This may result in increasing Cost of Quality (COQ) and effecting customer satisfaction level. To reach a win-win situation, suppliers need to determine their <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> management level by considering not only their current COQ, but also the potential future recalls, which affect other partners' interest. Based on the current literature, quantitative models which can simulate the risk transmission along supply chain are seldom used. The contribution of this paper is to quantify the <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> and analyze risk transmission along supply chain. This paper provides mathematical models to simulate the risk transmission, thus helping suppliers to determine the optimal <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> management level.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the concept of}} <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> in outsourcing. Recent trends in outsourcing extend a contract manufacturer's (CM's) responsibility to several functional areas, such as {{research and development and}} design in addition to manufacturing. This trend enables an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to focus on sales and pricing of its product. However, increasing CM responsibilities also suggest that the OEM's product quality is mainly determined by its CM. We identify two factors that cause <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> in this Outsourcing relationship. First, the CM and the OEM {{may not be able to}} contract on quality; second, the OEM may not know the cost of quality to the CM. We characterize the effects of these two <b>quality</b> <b>risk</b> factors on the firms' profits and on the resulting product quality. We determine how the OEM's pricing strategy affects <b>quality</b> <b>risk.</b> We show, for example, that the effect of noncontractible quality is higher than the effect of private quality cost information when the OEM sets the sales price after observing the product's quality. We also show that committing to a sales price mitigates the adverse effect of <b>quality</b> <b>risk.</b> To obtain these results, we develop and analyze a three-stage decision model. This model is also used to understand the impact of recent information technologies on profits and product quality. For example, we provide a decision tree that an OEM can use in deciding whether to invest in an enterprise-wide quality management system that enables accounting of quality-related activities across the supply chain...|$|E

40|$|The present global {{economic}} crisis creates {{doubts about the}} good use of accumulated experience and knowledge in managing risk in financial services. Typically, risk management practice does not use knowledge management (KM) to improve and to develop new answers to the threats. A key reason {{is that it is}} not clear how to break down the “organizational silos” view of risk management (RM) that is commonly taken. As a result, there has been relatively little work on finding the relationships between RM and KM. We have been doing research for the last couple of years on the identification of relationships between these two disciplines. At ECKM 2007 we presented a general review of the literature(s) and some hypotheses for starting research on KM and its relationship to the perceived value of enterprise risk management. This article presents findings based on our preliminary analyses, concentrating on those factors affecting the perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> knowledge sharing. These come from a questionnaire survey of RM employees in organisations in the financial services sector, which yielded 121 responses. We have included five explanatory variables for the perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> knowledge sharing. These comprised two variables relating to people (organizational capacity for work coordination and perceived quality of communication among groups), one relating to process (perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> control) and two related to technology (web channel functionality and RM information system functionality). Our findings so far are that four of these five variables have a significant positive association with the perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> knowledge sharing: contrary to expectations, web channel functionality did not have a significant association. Indeed, in some of our exploratory regression studies its coefficient (although not significant) was negative. In stepwise regression, the variable organizational capacity for work coordination accounted for by far the largest part of the variation in the dependent variable perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> knowledge sharing. The “people” variables thus appear to have the greatest influence on the perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>risk</b> knowledge sharing, even in a sector that relies heavily on technology and on quantitative approaches to decision making.
