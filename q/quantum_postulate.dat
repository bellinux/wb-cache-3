40|$|We {{propose the}} {{conjecture}} {{according to which}} the fact that quantum mechanics does not admit sharp value attributions to both members of a complementary pair of observables can be understood {{in the light of}} the symplectic reduction of phase space in constrained Hamiltonian systems. In order to unpack this claim, we propose a quantum ontology based on two independent postulates, namely the phase postulate and the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate.</b> The phase postulate generalizes the gauge correspondence between first-class constraints and gauge transformations to the observables of unconstrained Hamiltonian systems. The <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> specifies the relationship between the numerical values of the observables that permit us to individualize a physical system and the symmetry transformations generated by the operators associated to these observables. We argue that the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> and the phase postulate are formally implemented by the two independent stages of the geometric quantization of a symplectic manifold, namely the prequantization formalism and the election of a polarization of pre-quantum states respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to contribute {{to our understanding of}} scientific theory pursuit by providing a detailed case study on the development of early quantum theory, from roughly 1900 to 1916. I first elaborate on why this case should be considered an instance of piecemeal pursuit by presenting the historical quantum conjectures that were being used in different contexts. These conjectures gave varied interpretations of quantization. By comparing these conjectures, I identify a general <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> that captures the underlying assumption common to all the cases. I argue {{that it is possible to}} consider a general postulate about quantization even when its proper application is ambiguous in a given context, and that the postulate can be separated from different elements of the framework being used to investigate it. I show that the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> can be deemed promising by analysing the support it gains using a Bayesian framework. I first defend the use of such a framework by considering the purported inconsistencies in Planck 2 ̆ 7 s introduction of his quantum conjecture and how we should handle these. I then explicate two cases of support for the postulate. First, I show how we can use a particular solution to the Bayesian problem of old evidence to interpret the support the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> received by accounting for phenomena that had no previous explanation. Finally, I show that the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> is also supported by a unification argument, where unification is interpreted as informational relevance between the different domains of inquiry...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} series of rhetorical analyses of the seminal papers of the quantum theory. Specifically, it discusses the central role that metaphors play in the invention of new scientific arguments that {{form the basis of}} schools of scientific thought. The theory of metaphor that is developed for analysis is situated into the tradition of the rhetoric of the 2 ̆ 2 older 2 ̆ 2 sophists of ancient Greece. Metaphor, or more accurately 2 ̆ 7 trope, 2 ̆ 7 was a constitutive feature of sophistic beliefs about language and rhetoric. Applied to scientific texts, the sophistic understanding of metaphor illustrates how scientific beliefs can be brought into contrast, leading to conceptual changes in scientific communities. The study applies metaphorical analysis to three different papers from quantum theory. First, it analyzes Max Planck 2 ̆ 7 s original 1900 quantum paper, 2 ̆ 2 On the Theory of the Energy Distribution Law of the Normal Spectrum, 2 ̆ 2 showing how his use of another metaphor leads to the unexpected emergence of the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> as a new metaphor. Second, it analyzes Albert Einstein 2 ̆ 7 s 1905 light quanta paper, 2 ̆ 2 Concerning a Heuristic Point of View about the Creation and Transformation of Light, 2 ̆ 2 showing how new scientific metaphors, like the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate,</b> urge other scientists to change their perspective and adopt a new understanding of reality. Finally, it analyzes Niels Bohr 2 ̆ 7 s 1927 Copenhagen interpretation paper, 2 ̆ 2 The <b>Quantum</b> <b>Postulate</b> and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory, 2 ̆ 2 showing how the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> leads to a new world view for modern physics...|$|E

40|$|The {{zero point}} field is an {{ordinary}} field existing in the dark, which cannot {{be separated from}} the total electromagnetic field in an excited mode. The total field is in equilibrium with matter that it polarizes temporarily and reversibly. This polarisation is exceptionally large enough to allow the energy of an atom reach and cross a pass between two minimums of potential, stimulating an emission or an absorption. A paradox of quantum electrodynamics is explained classically: The nearly plane wave generally used in stimulated emission experiments must be decomposed into an efficient spherical wave and a scattered wave, so that the plane wave is two times less efficient than the zero point component of the spherical mode. The classical electromagnetism does not need the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate</b> "reduction of the wave packet" and it has no paradox such as EPR. De Broglie's waves may be the linear part of solitons of a field which may be a high frequency electromagnetic field. These solitons may lead to a physical interpretation of the superstrings theory.

40|$|The {{question}} whether quantum discontinuity can or cannot provide {{an answer to}} Zeno’s Paradoxes is reopened. It is observed that what is usually understood by the term “discontinuity”, namely, Einstein’s conception of the photon as described by himself and all others, is unsuitable to the task because, essentially, it reduces to the trivial ‘discontinuity’ of objects scattered in space. By contrast, quantization of energy levels, which are not in space but can only alternate in time, provide the right sort of discontinuity required. Discrete quantized orbits, corresponding to eigen-frequencies, are irreducible, and nothing is allowed to stand in-between them in satisfaction of the <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate,</b> furnishing the requisite, and so far missing, immediate nextness of a point to a certain other. In this way, Zeno’s Runner need not postpone his first step indefinitely, always waiting upon an infinity of preceding steps, {{before it can be}} taken. There is now a point that is next to a point and so a step on that point, which is the first step. It follows that, if one kind of discontinuity, Einstein’s, is incapable of offerring an answer to Zeno, while another kind can, the two are discrepant. One of them, the former, is not a kind of discontinuity properly so called at all, though evidently the consequence of one. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{classical}} {{field theory}} is introduced that is defined on {{a tower of}} dimensionally in- creasing spaces and is argued to be equivalent to QED. The domain of dependence is discussed to show how an equal times picture of the many coordinate space gives QED results {{as part of a}} well posed initial value formalism. Identical particle symmetries are not, a priori, required but when introduced are clearly propagated. This construc- tion uses only classical fields to provide some explanation for why quantum fields and canonical commutation results have been successful. Some old and essential questions regarding causality of propagators are resolved. The problem of resummation, gener- ally forbidden for conditionally convergent series, is dis cussed from the standpoint of particular truncations of the infinite tower of functions an d a two step adiabatic turn on for scattering. As a result of this approach it is shown that the photon inherits its quantization ω from the free lagrangian of the Dirac electrons {{despite the fact that the}} free electromagnetic lagrangian has no in it. This provides a possible explanation for the canonical commutation relations for quantum operators, [ˆ P, ˆ Q] = i, without ever needing to invoke such a <b>quantum</b> <b>postulate.</b> The form of the equal times conservation laws in this many particle field theory suggests a simplification of the radiation reaction process for fields that allows QED to arise from a sum of path integrals in the various particle time coordinates.

The current QM {{to tell us that}} " [...] . the state of a system can be instantaneously changed by a distant measurement > [...] . " cannot be treated as a physical theory. Its key statements - that the EPR-Bell experiments to violate Bell's inequality verify nonlocality, and nonlocal correlations respect special relativity - are false. Both the EPR-Bell experiments and theorems to support the "non-signalling principle" are based on the implicit assumption that all <b>quantum</b> <b>postulates</b> and, in particular, Born's averaging rule are fully applicable to Cat states. However, this is not the case. Introducing observables (e. g., correlations) for Cat states violates the correspondence principle.
