During a few years after the incorporation to this block, the legal enterprising in Czechoslovakia had almost disappeared. <b>Private</b> <b>enterprise</b> was fi rstly restrained by prohibition, and consecutively by the laws that, in comparison to enterprise directed by the state, entailed a big handicap to private business.

30|$|On December 12, 2012, the {{district}} government issued the “Wenzhou Private Lending Service Center regulation measures (Trial),” which monitored services {{offered by the}} service center, intermediary agencies and other ancillary services, and so on. The methods show that although the government allowed a <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> to operate the service center, the government maintained close and careful control over the service center’s operation. For example, rules made by the <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> regarding {{the operation of the}} service center as well as the selection of intermediary agencies had to be approved by the government. In addition, the <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> had to report all transaction data and information about intermediary agencies to the government. Lastly, the government uses a dynamic monitoring system to assess the operation of the <b>private</b> <b>enterprise.</b> This indicates that the local government rather than the <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> holds the actual control rights of the service center.|$|R

Furthermore, the increase in the prevalence of family businesses can be seen as a result of family trust replacing government trust in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s economic activities...|$|R
