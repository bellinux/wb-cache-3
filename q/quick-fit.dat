5000|$|It {{is really}} a <b>quick-fit</b> limb. For example, a below-knee {{prosthesis}} {{can be made in}} three hours.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, for {{vehicles}} {{without an}} occupant protection system, Jankel developed its MAPIK product, a <b>quick-fit</b> lightweight modular armour system to provide zoned ballistic and fragmentation protection.|$|E
50|$|The ways {{extruders}} {{are mounted}} on the machine has also evolved over time into informal mounting standards. These informal standards include the Vertical X Axis Standard, the <b>Quick-fit</b> extruder mount, the OpenX mount, etc.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004 saw {{the launch}} of CLT Curved Lens Technology™, which claims to give 180 degree {{peripheral}} vision and therefore greater visibility whilst swimming. In 2005, Zoggs launched Predator Goggles with Wiro-frame Bio-Integral design technology. This delivered the versatility of a one piece goggle with a frame which offered individualised fit and comfort. 2005 also saw Zoggs {{become one of the}} first brands to introduce PVC safe inflatables as standard to their water confidence range. The following year, the Push-pad and Ratchet <b>Quick-fit</b> strap systems were launched. These have advanced strap mechanisms built into the frames claiming to make the goggle straps easier to adjust.|$|E
5000|$|The McGuire Rig was {{fashioned}} from a 2 in wide, 15 ft long A7A nylon cargo tie-down strap with a <b>quick-fit</b> buckle on one end. This was typically cut {{down to an}} 8 ft length and a 18 in web loop (wrist strap) attached near the top end. This was used to form a sling loop and attached to an over 100 ft length of 5/8-inch nylon rope. Three ropes with McGuire Rigs attached could be dropped from a UH-1 [...] "Huey" [...] helicopter, {{all on the same}} side. A deployment pack containing a sandbag carried each rope to the ground. A soldier attached his rucksack with a snap link, stepped into the loop, adjusted it, inserted his left hand in the wrist loop, and on signal the helicopter lifted off. The three men would lock arms to prevent oscillation and prevent falls if a rope were shot through; a wounded or unconscious man could fall from the harness unless secured. The system did not allow the extracted soldiers to be hoisted into the helicopter. They were flown out of the danger area and then set down in a clearing in order to board the helicopter. On a long flight the harness proved to be extremely uncomfortable.|$|E

Digital analytical balance (Mettler Toledo, Model AT 250, Switzerland) and oven (Digitheat, J.P. Selecta, Spain) were used for weighing and drying the samples, respectively. <b>Quick-fit</b> round bottom flasks (150  mL) fitted with reflux condenser were used in Kjeldahl apparatus hot plate to digest the samples. Buck Scientific Model 210 VGP (East Norwalk, USA) atomic absorption spectrophotometer equipped with deuterium ark background correctors and air–C 2 H 2 flame {{was used for the}} determination of heavy metals.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} process of {{implementation}} of a standard work program at Swedwood Board on Frame (BOF) paint shop by applying a number of lean techniques. Following the identification of waste on the operations, through {{a detailed analysis of}} the shop-floor, and identification of use of uneven work standards among the work teams, some Lean techniques were applied to stabilize the process for subsequent implementation of standard work procedures. These techniques, e. g. 5 S, visual management, poka-yoke, <b>quick-fit</b> mechanisms, among others, aimed: 1) the reduction of the defects, rework and scrap rates; 2) reduction of changeovers; and 3) reduction of the number of production halts. The standard work program that followed aimed the overall improvement of the process efficiency, rapid identification of anomalies and improved problem solving capability. The results achieved included: the reduction of defects by about 27 %; the rework rate dropped 33 % and the scrap rate dropped 31 %; improvements to the production efficiency by 14 %; along with reduction on the need for extra work hours and increased versatility of the operators...|$|E
