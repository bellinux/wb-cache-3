40|$|The starting-point {{for this}} paper is an {{interpretation}} of the word as such -слово, как таковое - (as it was first conceived within the Russian cubofuturist and acmeist poetics) as merely one of the manifestations of speculations on the ontological status of language, so widely in vogue {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century, that is, the pre-Stalinist period. However disparate the disciplines then dealing with this matter may seem, what characterizes them all is a tendency to assume the existence of a binary opposed Essence and the Word as its concrete phenomenon. We focus our energies on what are considered the two major poets of futurism and acmeism respectively,V. Chlebnikov and O. Mande'štam, and the analogous ways in which they concretize the poetic word by representing it as a spatially <b>qualified</b> <b>entity.</b> This treatment ultimately leads back to A.

40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} the use {{and need}} for involvement of external participants in the EU decision making process through the relevant instruments. The analysis begins with the Treaty of Lisbon and the observation that the principle of participation was not been retained {{in the text of}} the Treaty. At present, participation is mainly implemented by the White Paper on EU Governance; the White Paper is considered to be the starting point for the involvement of external participants as well as the use of scientific and technical knowledge in EU decision-making process. The analysis continues with the review of a myriad of communications, policies, and initiatives in this domain: for instance, the Guidelines on collection and use of expertise and the Science and society action plan are discussed in details. Better involvement has to be supported by appropriate communication and consultation policies as well as access to information and justice, the latter being implemented by the Århus Convention. This convention, which has been partially transcribed into EU law, enacts a requirement to form a <b>qualified</b> <b>entity</b> in order to be eligible to represent a public interest in the environmental field. Finally, comitology committees are recognized {{to be one of the}} legal tools to involve external participants in the EU decision-making process. Still, the scientific know-how as well as the provided expertise is non-binding; independent participation is not yet established in the EU decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|The United States has {{the most}} {{expensive}} healthcare system in the world. We pay more money per capita for care {{than any other country}} – around three times the OECD average. Healthcare accounts for nearly a quarter of our federal budget, and the average family of four in America pays over $ 20, 000 out-of-pocket each year for care. And yet, our health outcomes are no better than those of countries that spend far less money on care; we receive considerably less bang for our buck. As prices rise and we spend both more public and private dollars on healthcare, policy makers and other stakeholders must find ways to build more rational economic decision-making into the system. Unfortunately, the fee-for-service model makes this change difficult because it fundamentally misaligns incentives between patients, payers, and providers. Absent a complete overhaul of fee-for-service, several regulatory reforms and market innovations are essential to bending the healthcare cost curve. Health policy experts agree that lack of price transparency is {{a major part of the}} problem. Patients often do not know the amount they will pay for care until they receive a bill, weeks or even months later. As consumer-driven healthcare becomes more the norm and patients pay more out-of-pocket for care, their ability to make value-based decisions is severely limited by the absence of treatment cost information. Functional, competitive markets require that all participants have access to complete, correct information regarding their choices. The American healthcare market is far from this ideal. This paper reviews the price transparency problem in four parts. Part One explains the issue in more detail and provides a basic economic framework through which to understand the problem. Part Two presents an overview of government involvement in healthcare price transparency and includes policy initiatives at both the state and federal levels. Part Three covers private market involvement in the price transparency movement and shows how digital, cloud-based private market tools are making patients better healthcare consumers. Part Four looks ahead to future challenges in healthcare price transparency and outlines policy recommendations to ensure the movement’s success. The following chart summarizes these key policy recommendations. State governments may be better positioned to implement some of these changes, such as establishing all-payer claims databases, whereas federal policy makers should enact others, such as Medicare data disclosure guidelines. These policies can all support market-based healthcare price transparency reforms and effectively allow for public-private incentive alignment and collaboration. As long as fee-for-service payment remains in United States healthcare, these types of policies and partnerships are essential to creating more competitive markets and ultimately improving population health. Policy Recommendations to Support Healthcare Price Transparency: ➢	Mandate disclosure of physician quality and patient outcomes data alongside price information to illustrate value or cost-effectiveness ➢	Simplify payment models and offer clinical decision aids to help patients – particularly those with high deductible insurance plans – understand financial toxicity of treatment options and make decisions as savvy consumers ➢	Use value-based insurance design to better align payers’ and patients’ incentives and nudge patients towards higher value care ➢	Ban gag clauses in contractual agreements between insurers and providers ➢	Establish mandatory all-payer claims databases in every state ➢	Revise the <b>Qualified</b> <b>Entity</b> program under ACA Section 10332 to ensure all entities – public, private, or nonprofit – access to Medicare claims data ➢	Standardize public disclosure process and clarify data management guidelines to prevent abuse and misunderstanding of medical claims data ➢	Limit time period or scope of financial data released to prevent provider collusion around healthcare prices ➢	Provide additional resources to study the effects of price transparency on patients’ treatment and insurance purchasing decision...|$|E

40|$|I {{have read}} with {{interest}} the White Paper referred to above. 1. You recommend measures to enable consumers and small businesses to seek effective redress for competition law infringements {{and go on to}} recommend the utilisation of either a representative action brought by so-called <b>qualified</b> <b>entities</b> or opt-in collective action. Reference is then made as to the qualifications applicable to <b>qualified</b> <b>entities</b> which appear to be restricted to trade or consumer bodies. I fail to understand why it is necessary to restrict representative actions in this way. Absent such an action, an aggrieved consumer left with a collective action but only on an “optin” basis. Little indication as to how such actions would be funded or how such actions will achieve resolution for the defendant – given the potential for future actions by similarly affected parties not included in the opt-in action. However my principal concern is that such actions will be of little interest to the average consumer unless they can show substantial individual loss which is sufficient to command their attention – so the organisation of “opt-in “ actions will be difficult, time consuming and expensive purely in terms of finding claimants.

40|$|Defence date: 25 July 2014 Examining Board: Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University Institute; Professor Giorgio Monti, European University Institute; Professor Christopher Hodges, University of Oxford; Professor Norbert Reich, University of Bremen. In 1998 the European Union {{adopted a}} new self-standing {{instrument}} of collective enforcement - the Action for Injunction. Until then, {{the main focus}} was on {{the improvement of the}} position of the individual consumer through the adoption of substantive consumer law directives. The Injunction Directive provides for a general framework on consumer law enforcement in national and cross-border litigation. <b>Qualified</b> <b>entities,</b> public agencies and/or consumer organisations, are granted legal standing. National courts are bound to mutually respect the standing of EU wide registered <b>qualified</b> <b>entities.</b> Outside these clear-cut rules on the mutual recognition of standing, the Injunction Directive remains largely silent. The implementation into 28 Member States swiftly revealed the rather limited harmonising effect. The thesis investigates and explains how despite the legally approved diversity, the Injunction Directive contains the potential to turn diversity into convergence. The key to understanding the potential is the thesis of dualism of enforcement measures. Read together with the Annex the Injunction Directive establishes the deep interconnection between collective and individual enforcement, of substantive and procedural enforcement, of judicial and administrative enforcement. The different levels and means of enforcement should not be regarded separately but should always be looked at in their interplay, in their mutual institutional design and their mutual impact. Evidence for convergence {{can be found in the}} Invitel judgment of the ECJ and in the practice of consumer organisations via co-ordination actions across borders by which they overcome the boundaries of collective vs. individual or judicial vs. administrative enforcement. Regulation 2006 / 2004 re-adjusts the dualistic structure of enforcement in favour of public bodies and promotes convergence through para-legal means, through new modes of enforcement, through co-operation and co-ordination outside courts and in open interaction between administrative bodies, to which consumer organisations are admitted on approval only...|$|R

40|$|MBA 2012 ABSTRACT This {{study is}} {{focussed}} on strategy formulation in large and medium sized audit firms in South Africa {{and the key}} issues {{that contribute to the}} formation thereof. The study explores the impact of a specific change in the Companies Act which exempts certain companies from a statutory audit and the impact this has on the future strategy of large and medium sized audit firms. A qualitative research methodology was applied with data collected through semi-structured, in-depth interviews that were conducted with senior executives responsible for the formation of strategy at their respective firms. The data that was gathered was analysed through a thematic content analysis. The results of the research indicated that room for improvement exists in the formulation of strategies in these audit firms. The results revealed that a significant paradigm shift has occurred in the role that an audit firm has traditionally played. It was confirmed that audit firms would need to craft and glean their existing strategies given the impact of the change in the Companies Act and specifically the inherent provision which has removed the obligation of <b>qualifying</b> <b>entities</b> from a mandatory audit. It was deduced that strategies around pricing structures, industry attractiveness, transformation and identifying opportunities resulting from the change in the Companies Act, were the key areas impacted in large and medium sized audit firms. The data gathering exercise and related analysis enabled the researcher to develop a model for use by audit firms in their strategy sessions to ensure that they prepare appropriate mitigating responses in dealing with the identified industry challenges. The strategy formulation process and the major contributing factors were established in the study together with an assessment of the effectiveness thereof. The shortcomings identified in the strategy creation process formed a basis for the researcher in formulating an approach recommended to firms in determining a sustainable strategy...|$|R
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the protection of individual and collective health, the Constitution regulates the legality of health activity on the body of the person on the distinction between the medical procedure that takes place within a compulsory treatment and health activity that goes from this category rules (art. 32, comma 2, cost.). The rule prescribed by the judicial system for administering system of cares and access to medical treatment, therefore, is based on the “consent” of those concerned: regardless of age, to intervene legitimately on the body, the physician must always obtain the prior consent of the patient or other <b>qualified</b> <b>entities,</b> unless the medical activity does not fall within the mandatory treatment. Over time, the regulatory system has accompanied the parameter of ‘consensus’ of a peculiar qualification: the adequacy of the information. Consent to medical procedure, therefore, became “ informed”: current sources state, it is no longer enough just a simple consensus, but it must be given by the person concerned knowingly, after appropriate medical information. Consensus is defined as informed only if the doctor provides the patient with all information related to treatment, so that the manifestation of the will to be conscious and aware. If the information provided by health care personnel are not adequate, the consent may not be congruent, neither aware nor lawful and give rise to liability. In the present case, the medical responsibility will not have basis in the absence of consent, but in the lack of information. As a matter of fact, violation of obligation to provide information and the provision of incomplete information do not allow the patient to express a free consensus, informed and aware, and therefore constitute a medical default, source of professional liability...|$|R
