30|$|The {{carbonate}} {{content in}} the Ongeluk lavas and its comparison with other equivalents of various ages revealed that the total CO 2 concentration in 2.4  Ga seawater was extremely low, which potentially accounts for the assumed low atmospheric CO 2 levels during the Paleoproterozoic global glaciation. More importantly, the present study indicates {{the possibility that the}} degree of carbonation of subseafloor crusts reflects the qualitative secular change of CO 2 concentration in seawater and atmosphere. Therefore, the carbonate content in post- 2.4  Ga subseafloor crusts should be investigated to decode secular changes of CO 2 concentrations in seawater/atm., especially during the Proterozoic. Moreover, it is suggested that more <b>quantitative</b> <b>compositions</b> of ancient seawater can be estimated by analysis of subseafloor crust materials such as hydrothermally precipitated minerals and their fluid inclusions.|$|R
