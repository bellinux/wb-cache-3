5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E

25|$|The wine {{regions in}} Germany usually {{referred}} to are the 13 defined regions for <b>quality</b> <b>wine.</b> The German wine industry has organised itself around these regions and their division into districts. However, {{there are also}} a number of regions for the seldom-exported table wine (Tafelwein) and country wine (Landwein) categories. Those regions with a few exceptions overlap with the <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> regions. To make a clear distinction between the quality levels, the regions and subregions for different quality level have different names on purpose, even when they are allowed to be produced in the same geographical area.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of Mediterranean climate, geography and geology {{of the region}} are conducive to growing <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> grapes. John Patchett established the Napa Valley's first commercial vineyard in 1858. In 1861 Charles Krug established another of Napa Valley's first commercial wineries in St. Helena. Viticulture in Napa suffered several setbacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including an outbreak of the vine disease phylloxera, the institution of Prohibition, and the Great Depression. The wine industry in Napa Valley recovered, and helped {{by the results of}} the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, came to be seen as capable of producing the best <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> – equal to that of Old World wine regions. Napa Valley is now a major enotourism destination.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the Gaja and Bruno Giacosa wineries began to market Barbaresco internationally with some success.

25|$|The {{area has}} a long {{winemaking}} tradition and was {{the birthplace of the}} sparkling wine Cava, invented in the early 1870s in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia by Josep Raventos of Codorníu Winery. At the turn of the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry was at the forefront of Spain's emergence as a world leader in <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> production, being the first Spanish wine region to adopt the use of stainless steel fermentation tanks. The area is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the region}} {{experienced}} a renaissance highlighted with a substantial jump in <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> production. With {{the price of}} Burgundy wine steadily escalating, the Côte Chalonnaise developed a reputation for consistent quality for lower cost {{than some of the}} more well known villages of Burgundy. This led to a sharp increase in the price of wines from the Côte Chalonnaise which brought an influx of investment and money to the region. By the early 21st century, the prices on the wine market were beginning to experience some market correction.|$|E

25|$|Sangiovese di Romagna adapts to {{different}} soil types, producing richer, more full bodied and tannic wines {{in the central}} provinces of Forlì and Ravenna and lighter, fruitier wines in the western and eastern extremes of the regions near the border with Bologna and Marche. The grape seems to produce the highest <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> in the sandstone and clay rich hills south of the Via Emilia near the Apennines which is covered by much of the Sangiovese di Romagna DOC zone. The higher summer time temperatures of this area gives more opportunity for Sangiovese to sufficiently ripen.|$|E
25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the top soil becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E
25|$|The Riesling grape, {{grown on}} 59.7% of the region's {{cultivated}} vineyard surface in 2008, {{is widely considered}} the most prestigious and highest <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> grape of the Mosel but it cannot be planted on every vineyard site due to difficulties the grape has in ripening in particularly cool climates. Factors such as altitude, aspect and sunlight exposure can have a pronounced effect not only one the resulting quality of the wine but also whether the Riesling grape will even ripen at all. A positive characteristic of the Riesling grape is that despite less than perfect ripeness it can still create a wine of finesse and elegance that would escape most other grape varieties.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the export}} of wine during the 17th and 18th century, {{vineyards}} began to extend along the Douro River valley bringing a mature level of economic growth. But, the temptation of easy money caused many producers to alter the <b>quality</b> of Douro <b>wines,</b> resulting in poorer <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> and a fall in exports. In order to remedy this situation the Marquess of Pombal created the [...] "Zona de Produção de Vinhos Generosos do Douro" [...] to designate {{the region as a}} producer of elevated <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> and eliminate poorer quality producers.|$|R

25|$|Barbera {{can adapt}} {{to a wide range}} of {{vineyard}} soils but tends to thrive most in less fertile calcareous soils and clay loam. Sandy soils can help limit the vigor and yields. The grape rarely thrives in very alkaline or saline soils. Like many grape varieties with a long history, the Barbera vine has seen mutation and clonal variation arise with different clones of the variety found in Piedmont, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and the Mezzogiorno. The different clones can be identified by the size and shape of their grape clusters with the smaller cluster clones producing the highest <b>quality</b> <b>wine.</b> In recent years, viticulturalists have been working with clonal selection to increase Barbera's resistance to the leafroll virus.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the era of}} Charlemagne, Germanic {{viticulture}} was practiced primarily, {{although not}} exclusively, {{on the western side}} of Rhine. Charlemagne is supposed to have brought viticulture to Rheingau. The eastward spread of viticulture coincided with the spread of Christianity, which was supported by Charlemagne. Thus, in Medieval Germany, churches and monasteries played the most important role in viticulture, and especially in the production of <b>quality</b> <b>wine.</b> Two Rheingau examples illustrate this: archbishop Ruthard of Mainz (reigning 1089-1109) founded a Benedictine abbey on slopes above Geisenheim, the ground of which later became Schloss Johannisberg. His successor Adalbert of Mainz donated land above Hattenheim in 1135 to Cistercians, sent out from Clairvaux in Champagne, who founded Kloster Eberbach.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the end of}} Apartheid and {{the opening}} of export markets, the South African wine {{industry}} had a substantial learning curve to overcome in order to be competitive on the world's wine market. The Vine Improvement Programme (VIP) was established to bring modern viticultural understanding to the industry. The first phase launched in the late 20th century focused on virus-free and yield controlling rootstock as well as clonal research. The second phase, which is ongoing, focuses on matching up various combinations of grape varieties, clones and rootstock to specific terroir that can produce <b>quality</b> <b>wine.</b> Over the last 20+ years, the work of the VIP has brought the South African wine industry to the forefront of viticultural advances.|$|E

40|$|The {{study area}} is Urlaţi wine growing centre - Dealul Mare {{vineyard}} (Prahova County, Romania). The {{aim of the}} research is the assessment of viticultural potential and delineation of natural terroir units by using a new GIS based multicriteria methodology that includes environmental criteria specific to Romanian viticulture. The viticultural potential revealed by the methodology is expressed as types of wines that can be produced in a given area in accordance with its ecological suitability. The spatial distribution of the environmental parameters and the computation of their joint influence were achieved by using GIS. The results show that Urlaţi wine-growing centre has the viticultural potential to produce red and white <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine production directions revealed by the research are similarl to those traditionally practised in Urlaţi wine growing centre that validates the methodology. The map of viticultural potential reveals the existence of three distinct natural terroir units: a natural terroir unit suitable for red <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (73. 16 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable for white <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> and red table wines production (25. 41 % from the assessed area); a natural terroir unit suitable exclusively for white <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> production (1. 42 % from the assessed area) ...|$|R

25|$|While the Hunter Valley {{is usually}} grouped {{in with the}} rest of Australia as having a Mediterranean climate, the climate is {{actually}} sub-tropical with distinctive maritime influences from the Pacific Ocean. With its northerly latitude and close oceanic influences, the Hunter Valley is one of Australia's hottest and wettest wine regions. Flanked by mountains to the west and north the Hunter Valley acts as a funnel, pulling cool ocean breezes into the area. This effect is similar to the cooling that Napa Valley receives from San Pablo Bay in California. Without these cooling breezes, <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> grape production would be nearly impossible. However, with those cooling breezes also comes heavy rainfall and periodic cyclonic storms in the summer and autumn months.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} Super Tuscans is also {{rooted in the}} {{restrictive}} DOC practices of the Chianti zone prior to the 1990s. During this time Chianti could be composed {{of no more than}} 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Producers who deviated from these regulations could not use the Chianti name on their wine labels and would be classified as vino da tavola - Italy's lowest wine designation. By the 1970s, the consumer market for Chianti wines was suffering and the wines were widely perceived to be lacking quality. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce a better <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations.|$|E
25|$|Chilean wine is wine made in Chile. Chile {{has a long}} viticultural {{history for}} a New World wine region dating to the 16th century when the Spanish conquistadors brought Vitis vinifera vines with them as they colonized the region. In the mid-19th century, French wine {{varieties}} such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Carmenère and Franc were introduced. In the early 1980s, a renaissance began {{with the introduction of}} stainless steel fermentation tanks and the use of oak barrels for aging. Wine exports grew very quickly as <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> production increased. The number of wineries has grown from 12 in 1995 to over 70 in 2005.
