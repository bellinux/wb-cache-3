An ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> can maintain the fixed voltage {{independent of the}} load resistance or the output current. However, a real-world <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> cannot supply unlimited current. A <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> is the dual of a current source. Real-world sources of electrical energy, such as batteries, generators, and power systems, can be modeled for analysis purposes as a combination of an ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> and additional combinations of impedance elements.|$|R
5000|$|So, Miller theorem {{expresses the}} fact that {{connecting}} a second <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> with proportional <b>voltage</b> [...] in series with the input <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> changes the effective voltage, the current and respectively, the circuit impedance seen {{from the side of}} the input source. Depending on the polarity, V2 acts as a supplemental <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> helping or opposing the main <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> to pass the current through the impedance.|$|R
5000|$|An ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> is a two-terminal {{device that}} {{maintains}} a fixed voltage drop across its terminals. It {{is often used}} as a mathematical abstraction that simplifies the analysis of real electric circuits. If the voltage across an ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent <b>voltage</b> <b>source.</b> Conversely, if the voltage across an ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled <b>voltage</b> <b>source.</b> A mathematical model of an amplifier will include dependent <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> whose magnitude is governed by some fixed relation to an input signal, for example. [...] In the analysis of [...] faults on electrical power systems, the whole network of interconnected sources and transmission lines can be usefully replaced by an ideal (AC) <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> and a single equivalent impedance.|$|R
40|$|The {{field effect}} power {{transistors}} {{are used in}} many applications in electromechanical systems. Control of the field effect power transistors requires isolated 5 V control signals and isolated 12 V DC sources. The first problem is resolved by using optical pairs: light emitting diodes with phototransistors. The second problem can be resolved by using impulse <b>voltage</b> <b>sources.</b> The primary coil of a transformer {{is connected to the}} battery by a transistor switch. In the first period of operation of this <b>voltage</b> <b>source,</b> the energy is stored in the magnetic field of transformer’s inductance. In the second period, the energy is delivered to the output <b>voltage</b> <b>source.</b> Energy is delivered from the secondary transformer’s coil to the output capacitor through a diode. As a rule, one separate <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> has a small power, that is why one impulse <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> can have the necessary number of isolated output <b>voltage</b> <b>sources,</b> i. e., 3, 6, 9, 12, etc So, we can design an impulse DC to DC <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> with multiple isolated output <b>voltage</b> <b>sources.</b> By changing the charge time of the inductor, we can control the output voltage by using negative feedback proportional to the output voltage and / or a current. In the report, different variants of impulse <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> are considered, with analog base elements and on the base of microprocessors. Analyses operation of these impulse <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> enable us to determine the period (frequency) of internal operation with ordered maximum transformer efficiency values. The concept of controlled impulse <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> is very important because these sources are very simple. They are reliable and have high level of electrical isolation...|$|R
5000|$|No real <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> is ideal; {{all have}} a non-zero {{effective}} internal resistance, and none can supply unlimited current. However, the internal resistance of a real <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> is effectively modeled in linear circuit analysis by combining a non-zero resistance in series with an ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> (a Thévenin equivalent circuit).|$|R

5000|$|Miller theorem {{implies that}} an {{impedance}} element is supplied by two arbitrary (not necessarily dependent) <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> that are connected in series through the common ground. In practice, {{one of them}} acts as a main (independent) <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> with <b>voltage</b> V1 and the other - as an additional (linearly dependent) <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> with <b>voltage</b> [...] The idea of Miller theorem (modifying circuit impedances seen {{from the sides of}} the input and output sources) is revealed below by comparing the two situations - without and with connecting an additional <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> V2.|$|R

50|$|Similarly, {{an ideal}} <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> cannot be {{connected}} to an ideal short circuit (R = 0), since this would result a similar paradox of finite non-zero voltage across an element with defined zero voltage (the short circuit). Also, a <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> should not {{be connected to}} another <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> if their <b>voltages</b> differ but again this arrangement is frequently used (e.g., in common base and differential amplifying stages).|$|R
5000|$|Here, {{the first}} term {{reflects}} the linear summation of contributions from each <b>voltage</b> <b>source,</b> while the second term measures the contributions from all the resistors. The above expression is obtained by using {{the fact that the}} voltage of the black box for a given current [...] is identical to the linear superposition of the solutions of the following problems: (1) to leave the black box open circuited but activate individual <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> one at a time and, (2) to short circuit all the <b>voltage</b> <b>sources</b> but feed the circuit with a certain ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>source</b> so that the resulting current exactly reads [...] (Alternatively, one can use an ideal current source of current [...] ).
