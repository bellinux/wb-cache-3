However, Eco, a secular humanist, takes a negative stance on such conspiracy theories. Foucault's Pendulum was a strong debunking of themes found in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail through the medium of satire.|$|E

25|$|The phrase {{inscribed on}} the stone, one of several {{suggested}} during the design phase, was proposed by the British author, poet and Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling, whose only son {{had died in the}} war. Kipling's role was to advise the IWGC (now CWGC) on inscriptions and other literary matters, and the phrase used on the Stones of Remembrance is a <b>quote</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wisdom of Sirach.|$|E
25|$|Oxenham is {{best known}} for her Abbey Series of 38 titles which chart the lives of the main {{characters}} from their mid-teens until their daughters reach a similar age. The Hamlet Club, formed in the first book in the series Girls of the Hamlet Club, was set up to combat snobbery in the school. Underlying the club’s overt activities of folk-dancing and rambles was its motto 'To be or not to be', and its badge, the Whiteleaf Cross. These were both symbols of deeper meanings. The motto, deliberately using a <b>quote</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Shakespeare play Hamlet, is taken to mean to make the right choice, usually duty above self-interest, when it arises. Throughout the Abbey Series the various main characters come up against this choice and its consequences, and are shown growing and maturing through making difficult decisions. The badge, taken from a landmark local to the area in which the series is set, is also symbolic—as is any cross—of sacrifice.|$|E

500|$|... "Weeds" [...] was Spotnitz's writing début for the series, and saw {{the return}} of {{recurring}} guest star C. C. H. Pounder, whose appearance received some critical appreciation.

500|$|Jean Jacques Rousseau had {{published}} a book in 1762 in which he discussed giving daughters {{the right to choose}} her own husband. This is a <b>quote</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fifth book of Emile, The Creed of the Savoyard Priest about choice. Both German and Danish citizens were reading this book. This choosing for oneself verses having an authority choose for one is a difficult leap for some to make.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{was appalled}} at Manson's {{interpretation}} of the song. He also found it disturbing that Manson came to define the long-haired hippie type in the public's eyes, after the prosecution's case had resulted in widespread condemnation of rock music and the idealism associated with the late 1960s hippie movement. In his 1974 book Helter Skelter, Bugliosi says he was denied permission to <b>quote</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lyrics of [...] "Piggies" [...] in the book, yet not so for the lyrics to certain songs by Lennon and McCartney.|$|E
500|$|Fox {{emphasized}} the horror aspect of [...] "Shadows" [...] {{by using the}} tagline [...] "Don't watch it alone" [...] when advertising the episode. During the episode, Mulder jokes that Elvis was the only man ever to have successfully faked his own death. The joke would eventually become {{the first of many}} similar Elvis jokes littered throughout most of the series. When Mulder wonders whether or not {{it could have been a}} poltergeist, Scully mocks him by replying [...] "they're here". This is a tagline and famous <b>quote</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film Poltergeist.|$|E
