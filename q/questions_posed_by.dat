5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis studies sorting circuits, networks, and PRAM {{algorithms}} {{that are}} tolerant to faults. We consider both worst-case and random fault models, although we mainly {{focus on the}} more challenging problem of random faults. In the random fault model, the circuit, network, or algorithm is required to sort all n-input permutations with probability at least 1 Γ 1 n even if the result of each comparison is independently faulty with probability upper bounded by a fixed constant. In particular, ffl we construct a passive-fault-tolerant sorting circuit with O(n log n log log n) comparators, thereby answering an open <b>question</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Yao and Yao in 1985, ffl we construct a reversal-fault-tolerant sorting network with O(n loglog 2 3 n) comparators, thereby answering an open <b>question</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Assaf and Upfal in 1990, ffl we design an optimal O(log n) -step O(n) -processor deterministic EREW PRAM fault-tolerant sorting algorithm, thereby answering an open <b>question</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Feige, Peleg, Raghavan, and Upfal in 1990, and ffl we prove a tight lower bound of Ω (n log 2 n) {{on the number of}} comparators needed for any destructive-fault-tolerant sorting or merging network, thereby answering an open <b>question</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> Assaf and Upfal in 1990...|$|R

25|$|The {{synoptic}} gospels, first Mark, {{and then}} Matthew and Luke, depict Jesus as {{presiding over the}} Last Supper. References to Jesus' body and blood foreshadow his crucifixion, and he identifies them as a new covenant. In the gospel of John, {{the account of the}} Last Supper has no mention of Jesus taking bread and wine and speaking of them as his body and blood; instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples' feet, the prophecy of the betrayal, which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross, and his long discourse in response to some <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> his followers, in which he went on to speak {{of the importance of the}} unity of the disciples with him and each other.|$|E
25|$|While an {{election}} petition is pursued similarly to normal civil claims, a judge sitting in {{an election}} court holds more of a inquisitorial role.

To aid its decision, the court has the power to require the attendance of any person as a witness, and to examine such a witness even if they are not called by either of the opposing parties. Witnesses are required to answer all questions posed to them, but none of their answers may be admitted as evidence against them in future court proceedings except in cases of perjury proceeding against the witness in respect of the evidence given.|$|E

They rely heavily on requiring testimony from individuals by wielding the threat of loss of membership or a bar from the industry (permanent, if decided by the NASD) when the individual asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. If a person chooses to provide statements in testimony to the SRO, the SRO may provide information about those statements to law enforcement agencies, who may then use the statements in a prosecution of the individual.|$|E

Each round begins with an adviser stating [...] "Hamurabi: I beg to report to you" [...] the current status of the city, including the prior year's harvest and change in population, followed by a series of questions as to how many bushels of grain to spend on land, seeds, and feeding the people.|$|E

500|$|As {{these reforms}} were being carried out, {{questions}} arose {{as to whether}} the decisions were truly made by Tkach himself or by others in the church leadership. The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell, executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, editor of The Plain Truth, and Joseph Tkach, Jr., the son of Joseph W. Tkach, and church administration director. One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership. Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career, kept them hidden from Armstrong, and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong's death. Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> church ministers and members. These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell, but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach authorized the formation of a [...] "Doctrinal Manual Group", consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency, refinement, and advice to the Pastor General. Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} {{is followed}} by a transcript of Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, originally given to Occupy Boston in Dewey Square on October 22, 2011. Contrasting the hope of the working classes in the Great Depression of the 1930s with the pessimism of their contemporaries in the current recession, Chomsky discusses the changes to the U.S. economy that have occurred since the 1970s: de-industrialization, de-development {{and the rise of the}} financial sector at the expense of other parts of the economy. He notes how both Adam Smith and David Ricardo partly foresaw this situation. Highlighting the work of Tom Ferguson, he discusses how the political parties have come under the increasing control of the corporate sector. Proceeding to look at corruption among the 1%, he makes reference to both Citigroup and Alan Greenspan, before discussing the role that worker sit-ins and industry takeovers could play in democratizing the U.S. economy, as well as the threat posed by both nuclear war and environmental catastrophe, both problems exacerbated by the current capitalist system. Finally, he responds to <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> <b>by</b> the audience, discussing the concept of corporate personhood, rejecting the idea that the U.S. elite could resort to fascism, and discussing the possibility of a general strike, arguing that that would be [...] "a possible idea at a time when the population is ready for it." ...|$|E
