5|$|Along {{with the}} course curriculum, the exam is {{developed}} by the AP Statistics Test Development Committee as well. With the help of other college professors, the committee creates a large pool of possible <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> is pre-tested with college students taking statistics courses. The test is then refined to an appropriate level of difficulty and clarity. Afterwards, the Educational Testing Service is responsible for printing and administering the exam.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> are deemed to be hard but underconfident on <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> are considered easy.|$|E

A question as practical as for daily-life situations such as at a bank, a hospital or a service center {{as well as for}} technical applications such as in manufacturing or call centers. A <b>question</b> <b>that</b> involves fundamental insights of queuing theory. A <b>question</b> <b>that</b> can only be answered in a realistic situation by simulation.

A <b>question</b> <b>that</b> in realistic situations not only benefits from but even requires a hybrid combination of analysis and simulation. This paper aims to illustrate that simulation and queuing theory can and should go hand in hand for a variety of practical problems, both in daily-life and industry. To this end, it will highlight real-life cases taken from daily-life situations (postal office or bank), administrative logistics (reengineering), transportation (railways) and call center analysis...|$|R

5|$|Doom was {{released}} to positive reception regarding the fast-paced gameplay, single-player campaign, visuals and soundtrack whereas criticism was predominantly toward the multiplayer mode. Many critics believed that Doom {{was a successful}} return to form for the series. Following the wide release, the game received scores of 85/100 for PC and PlayStation 4 and 87/100 for the Xbox One on Metacritic. The {{final version of the}} game received very positive reviews from users on Steam. It also received praise from other video game creators, including Cliff Bleszinski and Greg Kasavin, who said that the game answers <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> other modern shooters do not answer.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games. Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E

5|$|Jellyvision Games did {{not want}} to change much of the older games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep as many of the old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish <b>Questions</b> <b>that</b> required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Second Law asserts {{the direct}} {{proportionality}} of acceleration to {{force and the}} inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> remain {{as to what is}} the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.|$|E
5|$|Research programs, {{including}} field {{projects such}} as the VORTEX projects (Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment), deployment of TOTO (the TOtable Tornado Observatory), Doppler On Wheels (DOW), {{and dozens of other}} programs, hope to solve many <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> still plague meteorologists. Universities, government agencies such as the National Severe Storms Laboratory, private-sector meteorologists, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are some of the organizations very active in research; with various sources of funding, both private and public, a chief entity being the National Science Foundation. The pace of research is partly constrained by the number of observations that can be taken; gaps in information about the wind, pressure, and moisture content throughout the local atmosphere; and the computing power available for simulation.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer to whether it was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking to answer <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> {{are difficult to}} test in the field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects {{have been carried out}} there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, which started with opening {{greetings}} from the hosts {{and went on to}} thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's side door. The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwords, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and questioned him for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present during the interview but were not allowed in by police. Alvarado admitted during <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.|$|E
5|$|When he {{graduated}} from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum. He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics {{that he could not}} focus on any other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. In August 1905, Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for about a month. He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in other subjects, such as English, physiology and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.|$|E
