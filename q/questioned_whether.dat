5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the idea, but <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than treated with the respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> the body should be displayed at all.

5|$|Miller's career started {{during the}} reign of behaviorism in psychology. Behaviorists <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> mental thought {{processes}} were fit for scientific study, not being observable. They focused on working with responses to stimuli, particularly among other animals. Miller disagreed. He, Jerome Bruner, and Noam Chomsky are considered the founders of the field of Cognitive Psychology that replaced behaviorism as the framework for analyzing the mind.|$|E

5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> the diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures {{with the historical}} Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E

40|$|Most {{people who}} have {{discussed}} the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> attributions of intentional attitudes or contents are normative have assumed that this question boils down to the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> such judgements have normative force "by themselves", or as it is often put, to the <b>question</b> <b>whether</b> they are "intrinsically " or "non-hypothetically " normative. I take issue with this and argue that a judgement can be normative, {{in the sense of}} essentially involving a normative concept, even if its normative force is "extrinsic", and even if it lacks normative force altogether. The result is that most attempts to show that attributions of attitudes or contents lack normative force, even if successful, could not count as refutations of intentional normativism...|$|R

After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
