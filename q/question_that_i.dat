25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

In {{an opening}} statement, Gröning asked for forgiveness for his mainly clerical role at Auschwitz {{in the summer}} of 1944, by saying: [...] "For me there's no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> share moral guilt," [...] the 93-year-old told the judges, acknowledging that he knew about the gassing of Jews and other prisoners. [...] "I ask for forgiveness. I share morally in the guilt but whether I am guilty under criminal law, you will have to decide." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{may have}} been {{challenged}} by voters with the concern that a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would take commandments {{from the president of}} the church who is regarded as a living prophet. In an interview aired on Fox News Romney said, [...] "America has a political religion, which is to place the oath of office, an oath to abide by a nation of laws and the Constitution, above all others. And there's no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> make that my primary responsibility." [...] Mike Otterson, an LDS spokesman, said, [...] "The suggestion that a Mormon leader would dictate policy to a President Romney is absurd. I can't imagine any president that would allow that." [...] During the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, similar allegations were made that a Roman Catholic would take orders from the Pope.|$|E

2500|$|Democrats on the {{committee}} grilled Alito on his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton. Alito stated that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department {{in order to establish}} his conservative credentials: [...] "You {{have to look at the}} <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position." [...] During the confirmation hearings, Alito disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: [...] "I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly." [...] During Alito's Senate confirmation hearings, his wife, Martha Ann Alito, broke into tears after Republicans expressed their disapproval of how Alito was being characterized by some Democrats on the panel.|$|E
2500|$|James Jackson Kilpatrick (1920–2010) was a {{well-known}} newspaper editor in Richmond, Virginia, {{who was a}} leader in supporting segregation and {{the control of the}} South by whites only. MacLean states: [...] "The National Review made Kilpatrick its voice on {{the civil rights movement and}} the Constitution, as Buckley and Kilpatrick united North and South in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy." [...] In the August 24, 1957, issue, Buckley's editorial [...] "Why the South Must Prevail" [...] spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until [...] "long term equality could be achieved." [...] It argued that [...] "the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes—the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race." [...] His answer was that temporary segregation in the South was a good idea now (in 1957) and the black population lacked the education, economic, or cultural development for racial equality to be possible, claiming the white South had [...] "the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races." [...] Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L. Brent Bozell Jr. (Buckley's brother-in-law), wrote in the National Review: “This magazine has expressed views on the racial <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> consider dead wrong, and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes. There is a law involved, and a Constitution, and the editorial gives White Southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the Negro politically impotent." ...|$|E
