40|$|This report {{represents}} {{the conclusions of}} a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee convened to evaluate the safety of various food additives, {{with a view to}} recommending acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) and to prepare specifications for the identity and purity of food additives. The first part of the report contains a general discussion of the principles governing the toxicological evaluation of food additives (including flavouring agents) and contaminants, assessments of intake, and the establishment and revision of specifications for food additives. A summary follows of the Committee’s evaluations of toxicological and intake data on various specific food additives (a-amylase from Bacillus lichenformis containing a genetically engineered a-amylase gene from B. licheniformis, annatto extracts, curcumin, diacetyl and fatty acid esters of glycerol, D-tagatose, laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila expressed in Aspergillus oryzae, mixed xylanase, b-glucanase enzyme preparation produced by a strain of Humicola insolens, neotame, polyvinyl alcohol, <b>quillaia</b> <b>extracts</b> and xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus expressed in Fusarium venenatum), flavouring agents, a nutritional source of iron (ferrous glycinate, processed with citric acid), a disinfectant for drinking-water (sodium dichloroisocyanurate) and contaminants (cadmium and methylmercury). Annexed to the report are tables summarizing the Committee’s recommendations for ADIs of the food additives, recommendations on the flavouring agents considered, and tolerable intakes of the contaminants considered, changes in the status of specifications and further information requested or desired...|$|R
5000|$|Soap bark tree has a {{long history}} of {{medicinal}} use with the Andean people who used it especially as a treatment for various chest problems. It is the source of <b>quillaia,</b> the <b>extract</b> of which is used as a food additive and as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and fire-fighting foam. It is used as additive for photographic films and foaming for drinks. The saponin content of the bark helps to stimulate the production of a more fluid mucus in the airways, thus facilitating the removal of phlegm through coughing. The saponins of this tree are also considered to have adjuvant properties for vaccine solutions., [...] QS21 adjuvant is a saponin obtainable from Quillaja saponaria extract.|$|R
