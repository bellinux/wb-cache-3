To {{meet the}} requirements, {{based on the}} {{provision}} of Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine(AQSIQ), of gas leakage monitoring inside dosing room of fumigant warehouse at the inspection and <b>quarantine</b> <b>port,</b> a fumigant gas trace detection system(FGTDS) based on photoionization detector(PID) is developed. The principle, structure and characteristic of the system design are especially demonstrated. The test data under different temperature, relative humidity(RH) and methyl bromide concentration demonstrate that the FGTDS based on PID can measure methyl bromide under very low concentration. A conclusion can be drawn that the requirements of gas leakage monitoring inside dosing room of fumigation warehouse at the inspection and <b>quarantine</b> <b>port</b> can be met through further proper design...|$|E

50|$|From {{the decade}} commencing in 1830 both Muslim and Christian {{citizens}} of Cyprus became increasingly {{aware of the}} need to control public health. An example is the fundraising in Larnaca in order to fund an institution to control disease outbreaks imported from shipping through the port. In 1835 the first Quarantine in Larnaca received bi-communal funding; however the Quarantine in Limassol did not open until 1845, and was a Christian-only initiative. Coincidental to the local efforts, the Ottoman Sultan ordered the establishment of <b>port</b> <b>Quarantines</b> throughout the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} points {{to be dealt with}} in 1897 was to settle the {{incubation}} period for this disease, and the period to be adopted for administrative purposes. It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of disease notification was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, {{and at the same time}} state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the Red Sea, it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in <b>quarantine</b> at <b>Port</b> Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in <b>quarantine</b> at that <b>port.</b> Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.|$|R
50|$|His tenure was chiefly {{marked by}} the first officially {{recorded}} outbreak of yellow fever, and the subsequent creation of the city's first Board of Health in 1817, which among other things provided for systematic garbage removal and the institution of a <b>port</b> <b>quarantine.</b> In 1816, a comprehensive ordinance regulated theaters. In 1817, house numbering was instituted. In 1818, the city limits were expanded to include {{what is now the}} Eighth Ward. In 1819, the city's first public waterworks system was begun; its execution was entrusted to Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who succumbed to yellow fever there himself, the following year.|$|R
50|$|Against this background, {{preventing}} {{and controlling}} infectious diseases became his prime objective. Like his predecessors, {{he continued to}} strengthen <b>port</b> <b>quarantine</b> measures, educate the general public {{in the prevention of}} infectious diseases through staging public campaigns, conduct field researches, distribute medicine to people at risk, and encourage the general public to receive free vaccinations. In particular, he strongly encouraged children to receive free BCG-vaccination. By 1961, as many as 80% of pregnant women who gave birth in hospital agreed to let their new-born babies receive BCG-vaccination within 48 hours. The measure helped significantly bring down the infection rate and mortality rate of tuberculosis among children under five.|$|R

40|$|According to our {{previous}} research results, the X-ray quarantine system {{we have developed}} is capable of detecting insect infection onto various fruits effectively, and thus can be actually applied to quarantine practices. To make this system {{more in line with}} the requirements of <b>quarantine</b> in <b>port,</b> the hardware and software of the system will be improved in the project of this year, and the anticipated benefits are quarantine technology improvement, detection efficiency enhancement, and system security refinement. In terms of hardware, we will purchase new machinery and materials to improve the protection facilities of system. To enhance image quality and to obtain more information, the control and transportation elements of the three-dimensional imaging mechanism will be improved. A user-friendly software as the interface of the system will be made. The integration and optimization of the hardware systems, algorithms, as well as the user interface are the important objectives for this year. The outcome of this project will establish a mobile automatic system for quarantine inspection and enhance future applications in this field. The project will improve the detecting capability using non-destructive technique without delaying the decision-making in customs and reduce the labor power of customs officer and merchandise loss. Besides, digital images will be the scientific evidence for quarantine inspection and avoiding arguments from importers or foreign countries. 過去的研究成果顯示，本團隊所開發之X光檢疫系統，能有效檢測出各種水果中蟲害蛀食與蟲卵寄生痕跡，可確實應用於檢疫工作上。為使本系統能夠更加符合港口現場之檢疫工作需求，本年度計畫之工作施行重點為針對目前之X光檢疫自動化系統，進行硬體及軟體之增補與改良，以持續改善目前進口鮮果檢疫技術，增進檢出效率，並提升系統安全性。在硬體方面，將購置新型的機器與材質，改良X光檢疫系統的防護設施。另將改善三維成像機構之控制與輸送設備，以提昇影像品質及提供更多資訊。在軟體方面，將使X光自動化檢測系統的操作介面更為人性化，以利港口檢疫人員使用。此外，進行硬體系統、演算法，以及操作介面的整合最佳化，亦為本年度重要目標。本計畫完成後將可開發出一套具有機動性的高效能數位X光自動化檢疫系統，以增進檢疫領域的未來應用。本系統之開發可降低商品因剖檢所造成的損失，及減少人力與時間之成本消耗，且對於檢疫工作上易產生的糾紛，亦可藉由數位影像分析紀錄而有判定上的實證依據。本計畫之成果將可作為未來建立我國病蟲害自動化檢測系統之基礎...|$|R

Sunderland, a main trading port at the time, was the first British town to be struck with the 'Indian cholera' epidemic. The first victim, William Sproat, died on 23 October 1831.

2500|$|Many {{individuals}} {{prominent in}} the little-known history of south Texas are buried there. Captain John W.

He was the first sheriff in Bee County before moving to Nueces County, and worked for Richard King of King Ranch fame. He was a captain in the Confederate forces under John Salmon Ford ("Rip" [...] Ford) and a Texas Ranger. In 1877 he bought a ranch in Nueces County, moved to San Antonio in 1899 where he lived until 1905 when he sold his business to live in Boerne. In 1868 he married Avaline Byington of Banquette, Texas and raised a large family. Dr. T.

40|$|Public {{health policy}} {{is one of}} the main {{mechanisms}} for establishing and enforcing borders locally and globally. In an era when few simple effective therapies existed for infectious diseases, public health officials sought to prevent the spread of disease by improving the underlying environmental infrastructure of communities or by subjecting certain population groups to segregation, surveillance, inspection, and control. By deciding what neighborhoods to improve and which people to include or exclude through discriminatory policies, policymakers used medical science to establish explicit and implicit boundaries of care in response to rising mortality from tuberculosis, the national push for immigration restriction, increasing morbidity from venereal disease, and a concern for maternal and infant welfare. ^ El Paso 2 ̆ 7 s geographical location, economic situation, and political climate provided a unique social and cultural context for the participation of local El Pasoans in global conversations on disease and difference. Although El Paso boosters advertised the city as a healthy place, it was a diseased urban space due to the presence of tubercular health-seekers and lax enforcement of public health laws. Government officials struggled with medical inspection of immigrants and the protocols for <b>quarantine</b> at its <b>port</b> of entry on the Mexican border. A regulated 2 ̆ 2 vice zone 2 ̆ 2 gave El Paso a venereal disease problem. Prior to the mid- 1910 s, local public health officials targeted four different population groups for increased suspicion, supervision, and surveillance: indigent whites, Syrians and non-Mexican immigrants, 2 ̆ 2 loose women, 2 ̆ 2 and all mothers. However, in the turmoil of the Mexican Revolution and during the interwar years, the Mexican portion of the local population became the primary focus for surveillance and control. Public health officials deloused local Mexican workers, questioned the morals of Mexican men and women, and 2 ̆ 2 rounded up 2 ̆ 2 Mexican mothers for prenatal care. By the 1930 s, El Paso 2 ̆ 7 s city-county health officer was willing to re-label all Mexicans as 2 ̆ 2 colored 2 ̆ 2 to reduce the 2 ̆ 2 white 2 ̆ 2 statistical infant mortality rate. Theoretically informed and based on extensive archival research, this social history demonstrates that racialized procedures not only bolstered prejudices already present in the community but also constructed them, as El Paso established its own boundaries of care. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporaries {{explained}} {{public health}} practice in late nineteenth-century Philadelphia {{in terms of}} the prevailing view of disease causation: the filth theory of disease in the 1850 s and 2 ̆ 760 s, and the germ theory in later decades. However, critical examination of records of the Board of Health and of other nineteenth-century sources reveals that the central motivation for public health activity was the maintenance of social order. ^ Public health activity was divided between <b>port</b> <b>quarantine</b> and sanitary campaigns. The latter generally served as a means to discipline the underclass and other disruptors of order. The class content of port control was most manifest in 1892, when health authorities used the threat of cholera to justify extreme measures against immigrants. Smallpox prevention was somewhat distinct from both of these arenas, because smallpox was preventible by vaccination, and because [...] in the 1850 s and 2 ̆ 760 s [...] it was almost uniquely understood as contagious and therefore controllable by isolating its victims. ^ During the 1870 s and 2 ̆ 780 s, city officials determined to make use of science in safeguarding the city 2 ̆ 7 s salubrity. The Board of Health 2 ̆ 7 s interest in milk analysis led to the establishment of a chemistry laboratory; but by 1892, it appeared that bacteriology would provide tools of greater power. In 1895 the Board established a second laboratory, whose main tasks were bacteriological diagnosis and treatment of diphtheria. ^ By the late 1880 s, diphtheria [...] now recognized as contagious and bacterial [...] had become a central concern of public health. The three-part smallpox strategy (isolation, disinfection and medical intervention) was applied against it, but with greater force than ever before. Throughout the 1890 s poor families were forced to choose between police-enforced household quarantines, or removal of their sick children to an isolation hospital. ^ For the most part, members and employees of the Board of Health in the nineteenth century were sincere, hardworking people. Although their efforts were efficacious in a few areas, the overall effect of public health work on disease incidence and death was barely noticeable. However, by serving as gatekeepers at the port, by keeping watch on the sanitary condition of the city, and by using coercion to isolate victims of contagious disease, health authorities helped enforce behavioral standards appropriate to a growing industrial city. ...|$|R
