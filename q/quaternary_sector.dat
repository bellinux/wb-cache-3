During the bubble, the valuations of {{companies}} in the <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector</b> of the economy increased rapidly. Venture capitalists, eager to profit on this investment demand, moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices, market confidence that the companies would turn future profits, speculation in stocks by individuals, and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. The low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding.

In recent years, the city’s tertiary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>sectors</b> have expanded rapidly, and in the process, have become the dominant engines of local growth. This economic shift, and its attendant social and cultural expressions, suggest that Kamloops may be entering a new phase of development.

There are identified countries that have the closest position to the knowledge economy nowadays by the knowledge economy index, and, secondly, after examination of the structural changes of the national economies with emphasis on the knowledge sector, there is made a statistical evaluation of the influence of the knowledge core’s changes on the knowledge economy index (KEI).

5000|$|... "Quaternary sector" [...] is {{a further}} {{delineation}} of the three-sector hypothesis of industry {{in the sense that}} the <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector</b> refers to a part of the third or tertiary sector along with the quinary economic sector. It has been argued that intellectual services is distinct enough to warrant a separate sector and not be considered merely as a part of the tertiary sector. This sector evolves in well-developed countries and requires a highly educated workforce.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} sectors are increasingly dominated by automation, {{and the demand for}} workforce numbers falls in these sectors. It is replaced by the growing demands of the tertiary sector. The situation now corresponds to modern-day industrial societies and the society of the future, the service or post-industrial society. Today the tertiary sector has grown to such an enormous size that it is sometimes further divided into an information-based <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector,</b> and even a quinary sector based on human services.|$|E

This itself is unsurprising, having been foreshadowed in Daniel Bell’s presumption as to how economic employment patterns will evolve in such societies. He asserts employment will grow faster in the tertiary (and <b>quaternary)</b> <b>sector</b> relative to employment in the primary and secondary sector and that the tertiary (and quaternary) sectors will take precedence in the economy. This will continue to occur such that the “impact of the expert” will expand and power will be monopolized by knowledge.|$|E
40|$|Design and {{implementation}} of strategy is {{the backbone of the}} business enterprise. Strategic management process begins by establishing the vision and mission. Therefore, they are important components of further development of the overall company strategy. Following the above, we can conclude that it is of paramount importance to set a quality statement about the vision and mission to develop strategies in a positive direction, being at the same time comprehensible and stimulating to all target groups. Economic development divides activities in four different sectors (primary, secondary, tertiary and <b>quaternary).</b> Each <b>sector</b> has its own specifics, which become a key component of differentiation of that sector in relation to others. Therefore, it can be assumed that the company's strategy within each sector is set in accordance with sector specifics. On the basis of the above mentioned facts we come to a conclusion that there are key components that are company’s strategies specific for each sector, which also differentiate strategy compared to strategies of other sectors. The aim {{of this paper is to}} find specific components to develop a strategy for each sector, and key components of inter-sectoral differentiation in setting the vision and mission...|$|R
40|$|Though strong {{branding}} and {{a distinctive}} product range are often identified as important factors for companies’ economic success (see, e. g., Robinson [1999]) many UK womenswear retailers offer surprisingly similar products. The author argues that product sameness amongst many high street womenswear retailers in the UK is a deliberate strategy employed by industry practitioners to limit demand uncertainty. Based on an empirical study of UK high street womenswear retailers the author {{argues that the}} womenswear fashion industry, like other industries operating in markets faced by high levels of demand uncertainty (Crane 1992), has adopted strategies to minimise economic risks. The author explores how fashion information created by companies/groups in the <b>quaternary</b> industry <b>sector</b> is used as inspirational sources for fashion workers at retailing level and contributes {{to the development of}} a collective taste amongst them. Collective taste in the context of this research is seen not as a by-product of interaction as theorised by Blumer (1969), but as a strategy to cope with the inherent demand uncertainty experienced by firms operating in the womenswear market and as a means for establishing some orderliness in the fashion system...|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{a further}} {{division}} of the tertiary <b>sector</b> into a <b>quaternary</b> or quinary <b>sector</b> for information and leisure is being discussed (Maleri 1997, p. 10). According to Clark, a distinction can also be made between direct and indirect services. While the end-user is the direct user of direct services, indirect services are production factors. Intangible real goods can be subdivided into performance, services, information, and rights. Especially the distinction between performance and services seems to be relevant {{in the context of}} robotics and highlights again the fuzziness of the everyday usage of the term “service.” Performance is understood as the physical and mental human performance provided by households. Although it is also a characteristic of numerous services, in the end, it is an isolated, non-complex offer, that is, not a good resulting from the use or the combination of several production factors (auxiliaries, supplies, current assets, planning, organization,…) (Maleri 1997, p. 23 and p. 53).|$|R

50|$|The {{decline of}} this group of people and the area meant the loss of an {{important}} source of clients. Following deindustrialisation was the expansion of the <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector</b> of the post-industrial economy over at the West End, shifting major economic activities to the new city centre near Burrard and Georgia streets, further reducing Woodward's prominence. In the 1980s, Woodward's sold the food floor - long known for its quality and its line of unusual specialities - to Safeway. The flagship food floor became an IGA store until the building closed as Safeway showed no interest in that location.|$|E
50|$|As {{tertiary}} and <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector</b> {{positions are}} essentially knowledge-oriented, {{this will result}} in a restructuring of education, at least in its nuances. The “new power… of the expert” consequently gives rise to the growing role of universities and research institutes in post-industrial societies. Post-industrial societies themselves become oriented around these places of knowledge production and production of experts as their new foci. Consequently, the greatest beneficiaries in the post-industrial society are young urban professionals. As a new, educated, and politicized generation more impassioned by liberalism, social justice, and environmentalism the shift of power into their hands, {{as a result of their}} knowledge endowments, is often cited as a good thing.|$|E
40|$|The {{stratigraphy}} of terraced sediments {{as well as}} morphological {{features of}} the middle reach of the Rosandra Valley (Trieste, NE Italy) were studied in order to reconstruct its <b>Quaternary</b> evolution. This <b>sector</b> forms a fluviokarst valley, which {{is characterized by a}} deep incised gorge with abrasional features. Downstream, the gradient is reduced, the valley widens and terraced deposits occur. Alluvial/colluvial terraces crop out for about 1 to 1. 5 km along the creek. They show the coalescence of the alluvial deposits with debrisfalls from the steep limestone slopes and colluvial fans related to some minor tributaries. The highest terrace is roughly 15 m high. 14 C datings on a frustule plant collected in {{the lower part of the}} deposit (> 45. 000 yrs. BP), together with geological and geomorphological considerations, suggested that the terrace scarp could be Middle Pleistocene in age. The geomorphic regime of the creek changed from aggradation to erosion, as recorded by fanhead trenching and incision of fluvial terrace scarps, and it still persists. The tectonic uplift, which is partly responsible for the downcutting of the terrace and is still active, could be related to the SE-NW tilting of the Karst plateau...|$|R
40|$|The {{drainage}} basin of the Rio Lozoya (Madrid) is a tectonic depression {{located in the}} eastern part of the Spanish Central System. This area is characterized by a very heterogeneous lithology and a complex structural history.

The absence of sedimentary deposits becomes very difficult to obtain numerical information from such morphologies. To overcome this problem we used the method of dating by exposing an erosional surface isotopes cosmogenic by inverse modeling of chi-square to adjust the measured 10 Be and 26 Al in models of depth profiles on two levels of the sequence values regional rocky terraces: TE 15 (+ 62 - 64 m) and TE 17 (+ 42 - 46 m). In both cases, the concentration ratios 26 Al / 10 Be in the measured samples is very similar to surface ratio of production (~ 6. 75), indicating a constant exposure. Using inverse modeling, they have been calculated minimum ages of> 232 ka and erosion ratios of 18 to 19 mm / ka for TE 15 and> 140 ka and 7 - 8 mm / ka for TE 17...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{explicitly}} {{incorporating a}} <b>quaternary</b> or information <b>sector</b> {{have for a}} long time been confined to the analysis of developed countries. In this paper the information sector approach is applied to the economy of the Republic of Korea for the years 1975 and 1980. Using an alternative national accounting framework and reworked input-output tables, the existence of a large information sector and its rapid growth is demonstrated. Further, a structural analysis using various multiplier and linkage criteria has been performed at the highly aggregated four sector level and the disaggregated thirty-two sector level. The analysis confirms the dominant position that the information sector occupies in generating potential growth in the economy. The multipliers are also decomposed into production and consumption induced effects. This reveals an important feature of the information sector: its consumption-induced effects are more important (on average) than its production induced effects. The opposite is true for the manufacturing sector. The stimuli of a growing information sector {{on the rest of the}} economy will only be realised if the consumption induced effects are preserved. This gives some justification to the Republic of Korea 2 ̆ 7 s policy of import restrictions of consumer goods. Another feature of the information sector, the high growth potential of the sector 2 ̆ 7 education and research 2 ̆ 7, is also discussed.

50|$|The {{post-industrial society}} is {{repeatedly}} stressed {{to be one}} where knowledge is power and technology is the instrument. Naturally, where one is creatively inclined, they are advantaged by such a society. The doctrine of “speed, mobility and malleability” is well suited to a dynamic creative industry and as industries of good production decrease in precedence, the way is paved for artists, musicians, and other such types, whose skills are better utilized by the tertiary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>sector.</b> Urban geographer Trevor Barnes, in his work outlining the Vancouver experience in post-war development, evokes the post-industrial condition, citing the emergence and consolidation of a significant video games industry as a constituent of the elite service sector.|$|E
50|$|This {{increased}} {{faculty of}} the post-industrialist society with respects to the creative industry is itself reflected by the economic history of post-industrial societies.

This is necessitated by {{the demands of a}} tertiary and quaternary sector: in order to better service an industry focused on finance, education, communication, management, training, engineering, and aesthetic design, the city must become points of exchange capable of providing the most updated information from across the globe.
