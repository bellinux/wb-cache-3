5|$|A 2002 {{article in}} BusinessWeek {{said that a}} series of {{bankruptcies}} of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, {{many of which were}} failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.|$|E
5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone. One major point of contention was that it did not allow for trial by jury for American citizens arrested there. They raised <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the quality of the judges in the territory and other issues.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm chaser deaths, Kansas Emergency Management Association {{president}} Brian Stone called for there to be regulations put on future storm chasing; however, he stated that there are <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how it would actually be implemented. AccuWeather Senior Vice President Mike Smith urged against overreacting to their deaths, citing that they were the first chasers to be killed in 40years of the practice and that chasing as a whole is a significant source of real-time and research information.|$|E

5|$|A member may be disqualified if he {{is found}} to be of unsound mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, {{if he is}} convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, or if he has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied to a foreign country. Any <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> whether he had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
