40|$|In {{the last}} few years the world in which Quantum Cryptography evolves has deeply changed. On the one side the revelations of Snowden, though he said nothing really new, made the world more aware of the {{importance}} to protect sensitive data from all kinds of adversaries, including sometimes "friends. " On the other side, breakthroughs in quantum computation, in particular in superconducting qubits and surface-codes, made it possible that in 15 to 25 years there might be a quantum machine able to break today's codes. This implies that in order to protect today's data over a few decades, one has to act now and use some <b>quantum-safe</b> <b>cryptography.</b> Comment: Key note talk for Qcrypt 2015, Tokyo, September 28 - October 2. 3 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} method for {{integrating}} NTRUEncrypt into the ntor key exchange protocol {{as a means of}} achieving a quantum-safe variant of forward secrecy. The proposal is a minimal change to ntor, essentially consisting of an NTRUEncrypt-based key exchange performed in parallel with the ntor handshake. Performance figures are provided demonstrating that the client bears most of the additional overhead, and that the added load on the router side is acceptable. We make this proposal for two reasons. First, we believe it to be an interesting case study into the practicality of <b>quantum-safe</b> <b>cryptography</b> and into the difficulties one might encounter when transi-tioning to quantum-safe primitives within real-world protocols and code-bases. Second, we believe that Tor is a strong candidate for an early transition to quantum-safe primitives; users of Tor may be jus-tifiably concerned about adversaries who record traffic in the present and store it for decryption when technology or cryptanalytic techniques improve in the future. ...|$|E
