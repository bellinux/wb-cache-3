5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other <b>quadratic</b> surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary <b>quadratic</b> surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, {{dating back to the}} Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term <b>quadratic</b> equation. Babylonian mathematicians from circa 400 BC and Chinese mathematicians from circa 200 BC used geometric methods of dissection to solve <b>quadratic</b> equations with positive roots. Rules for <b>quadratic</b> equations were given in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, a Chinese treatise on mathematics. These early geometric methods do not appear to have had a general formula. Euclid, the Greek mathematician, produced a more abstract geometrical method around 300 BC. With a purely geometric approach Pythagoras and Euclid created a general procedure to find solutions of the <b>quadratic</b> equation.
