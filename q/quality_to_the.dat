Mozart (d. 1791) liked {{the sound of}} the clarinet (he considered its tone the closest in <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> human voice) and wrote numerous pieces for the instrument., and by the time of Beethoven (c. 1800–1820), the clarinet was a standard fixture in the orchestra.|$|E

5|$|In retrospect, however, critics often cite Atari's Pac-Man as a {{major factor}} in the drop of {{consumer}} confidence in the company, which contributed to the North American video game crash of 1983. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game's poor quality damaged the company's reputation. Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari's games. Former Next Generation editor-in-chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari's <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disappointment he had from buying the game as a child. Calling the game the top video game disaster, Buchanan credits Pac-Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the 1980s. Author Steven Kent also blames the game, along with Atari's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, for severely damaging the company's reputation and profitability. Montfort and Bogost stated that the game's negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers, which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash.|$|E

5|$|In the {{economic}} fields, he {{was influenced by}} the principles of physiocracy, an economic doctrine that considered that nature was the source of wealth. As a result, much of his works and reform proposals at the Consulate were oriented towards improving agriculture, livestock, manufacturing, and free trade. He maintained a fluent contact with the consulates of other cities, developing a view of the viceroyalty as a whole. This led to an increased work in cartography of the largely unpopulated areas of the territory; the maps designed during this period would later prove a great help for José de San Martín during the Crossing of the Andes. He introduced new crops, and promoted the use of local fauna for livestock production. He protected the weaving industry by increasing the production of cotton in Cochabamba, as he considered the local crop to be of similar <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cotton from Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began {{to build their own}} castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E

50|$|In psychoanalytic theory, when an {{individual}} is unable to integrate difficult feelings, specific defenses are mobilized <b>to</b> overcome what <b>the</b> individual perceives as an unbearable situation. The defense that helps in this process is called splitting. Splitting is <b>the</b> tendency <b>to</b> view events or people as either all bad or all good. When viewing people as all good, the individual is said <b>to</b> be using <b>the</b> defense mechanism idealization: a mental mechanism in which the person attributes exaggeratedly positive <b>qualities</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> self or others. When viewing people as all bad, the individual employs devaluation: attributing exaggeratedly negative <b>qualities</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> self or others.|$|R

25|$|While the riddarasögur {{were widely}} read in Iceland for many centuries they have {{traditionally}} been regarded as popular literature inferior in artistic <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Icelanders' sagas and other indigenous genres.

25|$|Henceforward, it will {{be found}} that the Royalist foot, now a {{thoroughly}} professional force, is superior in <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> once superb cavalry, and not merely because its opportunities for plunder, etc. are more limited.

It reacted differently to harvest. The older trees didn't split or warp as the infant California crop did. There was a vast difference between the two, and this would doom the California eucalyptus industry.|$|E

25|$|Sound {{designer}} Mark Mangini {{stated that}} he viewed the War Rig as an allegory for Moby-Dick with Immortan Joe {{playing the role of}} Captain Ahab. As such, the mechanical truck sounds were layered with whale calls to provide a more animal-like <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truck. When the tank is pierced with harpoons and milk sprays out, the sound of whale blow-holes were used. For the final destruction of the War Rig, the only sounds used were slowed down bear growls to symbolise the death of the truck as a living creature.|$|E
25|$|City {{life does}} not dominate, as half the {{population}} live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While manufacturing has become {{an important part of}} the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region, quite distinct from the neighbouring Wellington Region. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the New Zealand Defence Force, which maintain three bases in the region: RNZAF Base Ohakea, Linton Military Camp, and Waiouru Military Camp.|$|E
25|$|Most {{categorical}} {{alcoholic beverages}} have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe {{have always been}} conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorised into several grades (ordinaire, demi-fine, fine, and Suisse—the latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' makes no guarantee as {{to the quality of}} its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.|$|E

25|$|Service {{quality is}} {{generally}} good with continuous water supply. In early 2008 private operators published {{for the first}} time consolidated performance indicators on service quality. It showed that 99.7% of samples complied with bacteriological standards for drinking water quality, but only 82.3% of samples complied with standards for the discharge of treated wastewater. The share of unplanned water service interruptions was less than 3%. The indicators do not include statistics on sewer overflows.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of anecdotal devices, the {{painting}} is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in a space that is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure. Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used to describe her figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body, rendering her presence palpable.|$|E
25|$|The first aircraft, F.300, {{made its}} first flight on 29 September 1931. The M.F. 11s were {{equipped}} with the British-designed Armstrong Siddeley Panther II radial engine, the first 14 of which {{were made in the}} United Kingdom. From 1934 license manufacturing of the Armstrong Siddeley Panther II began in Norway at Marinens Minevesen in Horten, with F.314 being the first aircraft equipped with a Norwegian-made engine. As the handmade Norwegian power plants were installed they soon proved to be of superior <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> machine manufactured originals. The same engine was also produced for the Norwegian Army Air Service aircraft. A total of 17 Panther IIs were made in Norway, seven for Navy and ten for Army aircraft. The licence production ended in 1938 as import engines became freely available at a low cost after the Panther II was abandoned by the UK armed forces as it could no longer be used to propel the increasingly powerful British aircraft.|$|E
