5|$|Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand {{cell phones}} in 2005.

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, {{many ideas}} were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II.</b> The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 1993, Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> was remade and {{combined}} with Dragon Quest {{as part of}} Dragon Quest I & II for the Super Famicom, which used Dragon Quest Vs engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an enemy is defeated before a character who was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers. The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Remakes of Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> {{were also}} {{successful}} and well received. Famitsu awarded the Japanese Super Famicom remake a 35/40.

It also received the RPGamer's Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000.|$|E
50|$|Shapeir: Alexander may accidentally {{be dropped}} into Shapeir's Forbidden City if the player is not careful. This {{is not a}} good {{situation}} for a character that cannot swim. Shapeir is also said to be a land west of the Llewdorian desert. Shapeir is a land from <b>Quest</b> for Glory <b>II,</b> and appears in AGD Interactive's <b>Quest</b> for Glory <b>II</b> remake. In that game, Alexander can be seen falling off a waterfall and bobbing down river. In KQ3 Redux it is possible to cause Alexander to end up in that situation through an improper use of a magical gate on Treasure Island.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{planned to}} follow the D21 Hard Body in being {{designed}} by Nissan Design International in La Jolla, CA, design of the D22 was reluctantly given to Japan during the 1994-1995 period. This was due to NDI being busy with many design projects of for concepts and models, such as the <b>Quest</b> (VX54 <b>II),</b> Altima (L30), and Maxima (A32.5). Design of an updated D22 was eventually given to NDI in 1998.|$|R

5|$|Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> is a {{role-playing}} video game. It {{allows the}} player to control {{more than one}} character, each of whom has their own characteristics, {{and it is the}} first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members {{during the course of the}} game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells.|$|E
5|$|Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E
5|$|Planning for Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> {{began in}} April 1986, {{a month before}} the release of the {{original}} Dragon Quest. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming almost everything {{by the time of the}} initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year. In the Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed to deliver to Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987.|$|E

50|$|Both Space <b>Quests</b> I and <b>II</b> were {{developed}} in Adventure Game Interpreter, Sierra's own programming language. Space Quest III was written in Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI), which had 3-D capabilities.

500|$|In {{the first}} Dragon Quest game, the hero, the player-character, is a {{descendant}} of Erdrick who follows in his footsteps to reach the Dragonlord's Castle and confront him. In Dragon <b>Quest</b> <b>II</b> the heroes are also descendants of Erdrick, exploring the expanded world of Torland that includes the continent of Alefgard.
