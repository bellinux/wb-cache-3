40|$|Waves {{identified}} as whistler-mode waves {{have been observed}} in the nightside ionosphere of Venus by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter. These waves are propagating in a collisional, weakly magnetized ionosphere, {{and it has been}} argued that as such they should be damped through collisions, and the wave should not retain the characteristics of the whistler-mode because of non-linear modifications to the dispersion relation. We show that non-linearities do not modify the wave dispersion since the non-linear force causes a longitudinal current, and the associated charge separation electric field acts to balance the non-linear force. The <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> <b>approximation</b> is therefore appropriate for whistler-mode waves in the nightside ionosphere of Venus. Further, we find that while the waves will heat the bottomside ionosphere, little effect is found at altitudes where in situ observations were made by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter...|$|E
40|$|The non-ducted {{propagation}} {{characteristics of}} the VLF waves in the inner magnetosphere were studied {{with respect to their}} frequency, source localization, and initial polar angle between the wave-normal and the background magnetic field and azimuthal angle. The ray tracing software based on multi-components cold plasma approach was developed by use of the Olson-Pfitzer magnetic field model and the GCPM model of plasma density. We described dynamics of the wave-normals direction during its propagation and magnetospheric reflection. We showed that whistler waves can be reflected when lower hybrid resonance frequency becomes greater than the wave frequency: ωLH > ω. It corresponds to magnetic latitude λ ∼ 50 °. The simulation results confirmed the inapplicability of the <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> <b>approximation</b> to describe the propagation of magnetospheric whistlers. The simulation results of chorus emissions propagation, which use realistic distributions of waves on the initial parameters are presented. Particularly, we obtained distributions of chorus emission waves in dependence on the wave-normal directions for different magnetic latitudes, with respect to initial azimuthal angle. It is required for studying diffusive processes in the radiation belts. The results are found to be in a good agreement with the CLUSTER STAFF-SA measurements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe ray {{trajectories of}} {{waves in the}} very low {{frequency}} (VLF) range {{in the case of}} nonducted propagation in the earth's inner magnetosphere are studied as functions of location of their source region, frequency, and initial angle between the vector of wave normal and intensity vector of external magnetic field. Simulation is performed on the basis of geometric ray tracing approach in multicomponent plasma. The parameters of the magnetospheric medium were calculated using a diffusion model of the concentration distribution of plasma components and the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) model. It is shown that the magnetospheric wave reflection can occur if the lower hybrid resonance frequency is greater than its own wave frequency (omega (LHF) > omega), i. e., at the latitudes lambda a parts per thousand 50 A degrees. The simulation results confirm that the <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> <b>approximation</b> cannot be used to describe the magnetospheric whistler propagation. We present simulations of propagation of chorus-type wave magnetospheric emissions that were performed using realistic wave distributions over initial parameters. In particular, we present distributions of chorus waves over directions of wave vector as functions of geomagnetic latitude; these distributions are required to study the particle scattering and acceleration processes in the radiation belts. Our results well agree with CLUSTER satellite measurements...|$|E
40|$|Thepresent paper {{conducts a}} {{scientific}} review on ionospheric absorption, extrapolating the research prospects {{of a complex}} eikonal model for one-layer ionosphere. As regards the scientific review, here a <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> (QL) <b>approximation</b> for nondeviative absorption is deduced which is more refined than the corresponding equation reported by Davies (1990). As regards the research prospects, a complex eikonal model for one-layer ionosphere is analyzed in depth here, already discussed by Settimi et al. (2013). A simple formula is deduced for a simplified problem. A flat, layered ionospheric medium is considered, without any horizontal gradient. The authors prove that the QL nondeviative amplitude absorption according to the complex eikonal model is more accurate than Rawer’s theory (1976) {{in the range of}} middle critical frequencies...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{proposes to}} discuss the ionospheric absorption, {{assuming}} a quasi-flat layered ionospheric medium, with small horizontal gradients. A recent complex eikonal model [Settimi et al., 2013 b] is applied, useful to calculate the absorption due to the ionospheric D-layer, which can be approximately characterized by a linearized analytical profile of complex refractive index, covering a short range of heights between h 1 = 50 km and h 2 = 90 km. Moreover, Settimi et al. [2013 c] have already compared the complex eikonal model for the D-layer with the analytical Chapman’s profile of ionospheric electron density; the corresponding absorption coefficient is more accurate than Rawer’s theory [1976] {{in the range of}} middle critical frequencies. Finally, in this paper, the simple complex eikonal equations, in <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> (QL) <b>approximation,</b> for calculating the non-deviative absorption coefficient due to the propagation across the D-layer are encoded into a so called COMPLEIK (COMPLex EIKonal) subroutine of the IONORT (IONOspheric Ray-Tracing) program [Azzarone et al., 2012]. The IONORT program, which simulates the three-dimensional (3 -D) ray-tracing for high frequencies (HF) waves in the ionosphere, runs on the assimilative ISP (IRI-SIRMUP-P) discrete model over the Mediterranean area [Pezzopane et al., 2011]. As main outcome of the paper, the simple COMPLEIK algorithm is compared to the more elaborate semi-empirical ICEPAC formula [Stewart, undated], which refers to various phenomenological parameters such as the critical frequency of E-layer. COMPLEIK is reliable just like the ICEPAC, with the advantage of being implemented more directly. Indeed, the complex eikonal model depends just on some parameters of the electron density profile, which are numerically calculable, such as the maximum height...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of seasonality in the attenuation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) radiation transiting the ionosphere. To calculate this transionospheric attenuation we constructed a program we call “Iriatten. ” Our program implements the <b>quasi-longitudinal</b> <b>approximation</b> for the propagation of radiation put forth by Helliwell [1965], where the k vector of the wave is nearly aligned with the Earth’s magnetic field. Inputs are electron densities taken from the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI); Earth’s geomagnetic field comes from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF); and neutral particle densities come from the Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter Radar (MSISE) code. Calculations are a function of latitude and longitude, year, month, day, and hour. Expressions for e- and ion–neutral particle collisions, including electron temperature dependence, come from Banks [1966]. In the literature Helliwell famously presented a series of atmospheric attenuation curves for day and night, 2 and 20 kHz, as a function of latitude. Iriatten is used to re-calculate Helliwell’s curves as a check against his published answer and then to assess seasonality. High power VLF transmitters are utilized as a reference signal and two physical models are used to simulate them. In the Straight Up model waves are launched ‘straight up’ from the location of the VLF transmitter. In the Crary model waves are launched from a dipole source and attenuation is applied for large distances over the Earth’s surface prior to calculating ionospheric attenuation with Iriatten. Results show a seasonality pattern that is unmistakable. Using the two models the ionospheric attenuation is calculated for four VLF transmitters and compared to DEMETER satellite observations. Plots are presented for electron, ion, and neutral particle densities, electron temperatures, and TEC. Results from the Crary vs Straight Up transmitter model more realistically portray seasonal variations exemplified by DEMETER satellite data. Crary errors are +/- 4. 5 dB, with a systematic bias of 8. 8 dB. The motivation for the dissertation topic: understanding the anthropogenic contribution to VLF radiation observed in orbit. A code is presented that calculates ionospheric attenuation as a function of day/night, latitude, longitude and frequency. Parameters are taken from the IRI suite of codes.
