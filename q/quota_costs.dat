Globally loading production among different plants usually involves substantial uncertainty and great risk because of uncertain market demand, fluctuating <b>quota</b> <b>costs</b> incurred in the global manufacturing process, and shortening lead times. This study proposes a dual-response production loading strategy for two types of plants—company-owned and contracted—to hedge against the short lead time and uncertainty, and to be as responsive and flexible as possible to cope with the uncertainty and risk involved. Three types of robust optimization models are presented: the robust optimization model with solution robustness, the robust optimization model with model robustness, and the robust optimization model with the trade-off between solution robustness and model robustness. A series of experiments are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed robust optimization models. Compared with the results of the two-stage stochastic recourse programming model, the robust optimization models provide a more responsive and flexible system with less risk, which is particularly important in the current context of global competitiveness...|$|E

We isolate the impact of distortionary policy, i. e., the tobacco quota, by decomposing aggregate productivity growth into the contribution of farm-level productivity growth and the contribution of reallocation of resources among tobacco growers. Reallocation of resources includes entry into and exit from tobacco farming, as well as growth or decline of the resources allocated to existing tobacco farms. We find that aggregate productivity of Kentucky tobacco farms grew 37 % between 2002 and 2007. Reallocation of resources among continuing tobacco farms contributed 22 percentage points to productivity growth.

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} {{pervasiveness of}} web browsing on portable devices {{calls for the}} careful consideration of how web pages are accessed by mobile users. While flat-rate pricing (independent of the usage) has been the conventional data pricing model in rich countries, mobile roaming users and users in developing regions are typically subject to usage-based pricing based on cost per megabyte downloaded. With the exceptional growth in both the size and complexity of web pages, usage-based pricing can result in high monthly bills even under nominal web usage. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware mobile web browsing mechanism that aims to substantially reduce the usage cost incurred for the end-user due to usage-based pricing. The key idea of our approach is to leverage the data plan of the user to compute a <b>cost</b> <b>quota</b> for each web request and a network middle-box to automatically adapt any web page to the <b>cost</b> <b>quota.</b> Given the complexity of existing web pages, we leverage a suite of content adaptation techniques to automatically produce the best possible version of a web page for a given quota.

40|$|This paper uses a {{numerical}} {{general equilibrium model}} to examine the quantitative importance of pre-existing factor tax distortions for the welfare effects of restrictive trade policies in economies with and without market power in trade. We analyze tariffs, non-auctioned import quotas (with rents accruing to domestic firms) and voluntary export restraints (with rents accruing to foreign firms). We find that allowing for interactions with pre-existing taxes can greatly magnify the overall costs of these policies - possibly by over several hundred percent! In the case of import tariffs, much of this additional cost can be offset if the tariff revenues are used to reduce other distortionary taxes. Indeed the cost discrepancy between revenue-neutral tariffs and import quotas is dramatic at modest levels of import reduction, but declines to zero as these policies become prohibitive. We find that the optimal tariff for a country with market power in trade is greatly reduced, and possibly to zero, unless tariff revenues finance cuts in other distorting taxes. The proportionate increase in costs due to pre-existing taxes is much smaller under voluntary export restraints than under import <b>quotas</b> when <b>costs</b> are measured by domestic welfare losses, but not when measured by world welfare losses. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{alternative}} to traditional regulations of fisheries to avoid rent dissipation {{is the use}} of individual transferable quotas (ITQ s) where prices in the quota market provide the necessary information to owners of harvest rights to contract with each other. However, even under such a decentralized regime, information on the underlying technology of the fishing vessels is also necessary. First, since most fisheries consist of many interrelated production processes, in order to avoid rent dissipation by discarding wrong output mix etc., the structure of production in the multispecies fishery must be known to design a proper quota system. Second, an ITQ system may create incentives for misreporting by understating the actual catch. This may especially be the case where the expected degree of self-enforcement is low. The paper proposes a way to reduce the information requirements under regulation with asymmetric information by constructing a typical firm and comparing performance for the other vessels to this firm. Based on the typical firm, and if the industry is relatively homogenous, the performance and hence catch of any other firm in the industry can be predicted within a certain range. Further, the paper applies this idea to the Norwegian trawler fleet to assess the production structure in terms of jointness, input-output separability, and the supply and demand elasticities for the fishing firms. This information characterizes the fishery and thus how the quota system may be designed and how to construct a yardstick {{in order to reduce the}} enforcement cost under a decentralized regulation of ITQs.

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to study the}} costs of achieving pollution reductions under a range of environmental policy instruments in a second-best setting with pre-existing factor taxes. We compare the costs and efficiency impacts of emissions taxes, emissions quotas, fuels taxes, performance standards, and mandated technologies, and explore how costs change with the magnitude of pre-existing taxes {{and the extent of}} pollution abatement. We find that the presence of distortionary taxes raises the costs of pollution abatement under each instrument relative to its costs in a first-best world. This extra cost is an increasing function of the magnitude of pre-existing tax rates. For plausible values of pre-existing tax rates and other parameters, the cost increase for all policies is substantial (35 % or more). The impact of pre-existing taxes is large for non-auctioned emissions <b>quotas,</b> the <b>cost</b> increase can be several hundred percent. Earlier work on instrument choice emphasized the potential reduction in compliance cost from converting fixed emissions quotas into tradeable emissions permits. Our results show the regulator's decision to auction or grandfather emissions rights can have important cost impacts. Similarly, the choice of how to recycle revenues from environmentally motivated taxes can be as important to cost as whether the tax takes the form of an emissions tax or fuel tax, particularly when modest emissions reductions are involved. In both first- and second-best settings, the cost differences across instruments depend on the extent of pollution abatement under consideration. Total abatement costs differ markedly at low levels of abatement. Strikingly, for all instruments except the fuel tax these costs converge to the same value as abatement levels approach 100 percent. ...|$|R

Empirical analysis of North Carolina peanut production {{reveals that the}} marginal (and lower) price received by production above quota, that is the world price, {{is far more important}} in determining acreage than is the inframarginal subsidy of the quota support price. Key words: marketing quotas, peanuts, price supports, supply response, yield uncertainty. Many commodity markets are restricted by government-imposed supply controls. Ex-amples include milk, poultry, and eggs in Canada, milk in Australia, and tobacco and pea-nuts in the United States. Where firm-level quotas are used to restrict supply, failing to pro-duce enough to meet one's quota can be costly. The cost will depend upon the price received on quota production and the regulations governing unused quota. To reduce the probability of these losses, producers may on average produce more than their <b>quota.</b> The <b>costs</b> of this precau-tionary over-production depend, in part, on the marketing alternatives for excess production. In many quota schemes, excess production can be sold in a surplus market, where it receives a lower price. Alston and Quilkey examined this phenom-enon in milk production in New South Wales. They argued that farmers produce "insurance milk " in excess of the quota to guard against production uncertainty. Alston and Quilkey noted two opportunity costs of not meeting quota.

This scenario matches that of many fisheries in which regulators attempt to simultaneously manage harvests of targeted species and bycatch of other species through common pool quotas and seasonal closures. Under a competitive equilibrium, individual fishermen fail to fully account for the external effects of their harvest decisions on the season length, leading to excessive discards, drastically shortened seasons, and large shares of un-harvested quota for all but the smallest of fishery sizes.
