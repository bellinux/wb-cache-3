40|$|Black liquor {{gasification}} at {{high temperature}} is a promising {{alternative to the}} conventional recovery boiler process used in chemical pulp mills today. Compared to a conventional recovery boiler a black liquor gasifier can increase the total energy efficiency of a chemical pulp mill and produce a synthesis gas {{that can be used}} for production of motor fuel. In Piteå, a 3 MW or 20 tons per day entrained flow pressurized black liquor gasification development plant has been constructed by Chemrec at Energy Technology Center. The plant has been run more than 12 000 h since 2005. One of the key parts in the gasification process is the spray burner nozzle where the black liquor is disintegrated into the hot gasifier as a spray of fine droplets. In this thesis the spray burner nozzle as characterized with high speed photography in order to visualize the atomization process of black liquor. The results showed that black liquor forms non-spherical and stretched ligaments and droplets with the considered nozzle. Comparison of the results with atomization of a syrup/water mixture showed that the results were qualitatively very similar which means that a syrup/water mixture can be used instead of black liquor for burner optimization experiments. This is a considerable experimental simplification. Also spatially resolved measurements of the gas composition in the development plant with a water cooled <b>quench</b> <b>probe</b> have been performed. From the gas composition measurement and the spray visualization it has been showed that the preheating of black liquor has a significant influence on the gas composition. Another important part in the gasification plant is the counter-current condenser where the gas is cooled and the water content in the gas is condensed away in vertical tubes that are cooled on the outside by a counter-current flow of water or steam. In this thesis a computational fluid dynamics model of the counter-current condenser have been developed. The model consists of a two-phase fluid model on the tube-side of the condenser and a single phase model of the shell side. Predictions from the model are in excellent agreement with temperature measurements from the condenser used in the 3 MW Black Liquor Gasification development plant. However, more validation data is necessary before a definite conclusion can be drawn about the predictive capability of the code, in particular with respect to scale up with about two orders of magnitude for commercial size gas coolersGodkänd; 2011; 20110228 (mikris); LICENTIATSEMINARIUM Ämnesområde: Energiteknik/Energy Engineering Examinator: Adj professor Rikard Gebart, Institutionen för teknikvetenskap och matematik, Luleå tekniska universitet Diskutant: Tekn lic Mats Lindblom, Chemrec, Piteå Tid: Fredag den 1 april 2011 kl 10. 00 Plats: E 231, Luleå tekniska universite...|$|E

Building on previous findings, in this work we report CFD simulations of the pressure and velocity fields, as well as the streamlines, in the vicinity of cylindrical probes of various geometries. In particular, flat-end, conical-end, hemispherical-end and chamfered cylindrical probes were studied. The simulations were carried out for probes located concentrically in a cylindrical tube with water flowing parallel to the probe longitudinal axis. The system was assumed to be isothermal in order to separate the hydrodynamic from the thermal effects. To validate the model, cellophane ribbons were attached to the probe end in order to trace the streamlines near that region; the cellophane position was compared to the computed streamlines. Previously, the optimum water temperature required to obtain a faithful visualization using the ribbons was determined. From the simulations, it was concluded that the conical-end cylindrical probe generates hydrodynamic conditions particularly suitable for estimating the heat transfer boundary condition at the probe-liquid interphase as well as for studies on wetting front kinematics...|$|R

Although retreatment often prolongs survival, how to select the appropriate population for retreatment has not been clarified. Methods:We used novel methods to identify EGFR mutations: wild inhibiting polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and <b>quenched</b> <b>probe</b> system (WIP-QP) for exon 19 deletions and mutation-biased PCR and <b>quenched</b> <b>probe</b> system for L 858 R. After the detection limits were determined, we examined DNA isolated from lung cancer specimens and circulating plasma DNA samples of 39 adenocarcinoma patients whose primary tumors harbored EGFR exon 19 deletions or L 858 R. Results:Detection limit was 0. 005 to 0. 04 ng in genomic DNA and 0. 1 % to 0. 3 % in mutant plasmids. The results of cancer tissue specimens were identical to those with existing systems (nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid PCR clamp or cycleave PCR), except for two samples that showed both exon 19 deletions and L 858 R. One of the two samples was confirmed to harbor L 858 R mutation by allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR; the other one did not. Exon 19 deletions and L 858 R were detected in 44. 7 % and 8. 7 % of patients, using plasma DNA, among those who carried the identical abnormalities in primary tumors all of cases that evidenced pathological stage IV except for one patient, suggesting that EGFR mutations might be preferentially detected in plasma DNA obtained from patients in advanced stages. Serial monitoring of these mutations with T 790 M, a gate keeper mutation, demonstrated correlation with disease state.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} behaviour {{of human}} orosomucoid was investigated. The intrinsic fluorescence was {{more accessible to}} acrylamide than to the slightly larger succinimide, indicating limited accessibility to part of the tryptophan population.

40|$|Abstract. Quenching heat {{treatment}} in a liquid medium {{is a very}} complex heat transfer process. Heat extraction from the part surface occurs through several different heat transfer mechanisms in distinct temperature ranges, namely, film boiling, partial film boiling (i. e. transition), nucleate boiling and convection. The maximum heat transfer occurs during the nucleate boiling stage. Experimental study shows that, the effective surface heat transfer coefficient varies more than two orders of magnitude with the temperature during the quenching. For quenching process simulation, accurate prediction of the time-temperature history and microstructure evolution within the part largely depends on the accuracy of the boundary condition supplied. The heat transfer coefficient is the most important boundary condition for process simulation. This study focuses on creating a database of heat transfer coefficients for various liquid quenchant-metallic alloy combinations through experimentation using three different <b>quench</b> <b>probes.</b> This database is a web-based tool for use in quench process simulation.

Since metastasis arises through complex steps, a suitable animal model is indispensable for investigation of metastasis. To establish an animal model reflecting human metastatic lung cancers, we used NOD/SCID/Jak 3 null (NOJ) mice, which exhibit deficiencies in NK cell activity, macrophage and dendritic cell function, and complement activation, as well as T and B cell deficiencies. After screening twenty human lung cancer cell lines through expression patterns of E-cadherin and vimentin according to epithelial mesenchymal transition features, an H 1975 cell line carrying EGFR mutations, L 858 R and T 790 M, was selected for investigation. Inoculation of the cells into the dorsal flanks caused systemic metastases after one month in lymph nodes, liver, lung, and peritoneum, suggesting that metastases occurred both lymphogenically and hematogenously.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{specifically}} attach chemical probes to individual proteins represents a powerful {{approach to the}} study and manipulation of protein function in living cells. It provides a simple, robust and versatile approach to the imaging of fusion proteins {{in a wide range}} of experimental settings. However, a potential drawback of detection using chemical probes is the fluorescence background from unreacted or nonspecifically bound probes. In this report we present the design and application of novel fluorogenic probes for labeling SNAP-tag fusion proteins in living cells. SNAP-tag is an engineered variant of the human repair protein O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (hAGT) that covalently reacts with benzylguanine derivatives. Reporter groups attached to the benzyl moiety become covalently attached to the SNAP tag while the guanine acts as a leaving group. Incorporation of a quencher on the guanine group ensures that the benzylguanine probe becomes highly fluorescent only upon labeling of the SNAP-tag protein. We describe the use of intramolecularly <b>quenched</b> <b>probes</b> for wash-free labeling of cell surface-localized epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) fused to SNAP-tag and for direct quantification of SNAP-tagged β-tubulin in cell lysates. In addition, we have characterized a fast-labeling variant of SNAP-tag, termed SNAPf, which displays up to a tenfold increase in its reactivity towards benzylguanine substrates. The presented data demonstrate that the combination of SNAPf and the fluorogenic substrates greatly reduces the background fluorescence for labeling and imaging applications.

However, half of the patients acquire resistance because of the gatekeeper T 790 M mutation. Noninvasive mutation detection system is desired considering the difficulty in obtaining tissue specimens during disease progression. MethodsSixty-seven plasma DNA samples from 49 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 30 healthy volunteers were evaluated. T 790 M in plasma DNA was determined using the mutation-biased polymerase chain reaction (PCR) <b>quenching</b> <b>probe</b> (MBP-QP) method. The method combines MBP and genotyping, the latter based on analysis of the melting curve of the probe DNA binding the target mutated site using a fluorescence QP system. ResultsThe detection limit was two copies of control plasmid and 0. 2 ng of genomic DNA. The mutant plasmid could be detected when it accounted {{for as little as}} 0. 3 % of a mixture of plasmids carrying EGFR exon 20 with or without T 790 M. The T 790 M mutation was detected in plasma DNA from 10 of 19 patients (53 %) who acquired resistance, but not in nonresponders, patients responding to treatment, or those not treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Other mutation detection systems, such as the nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid PCR clamp, the cycleave PCR technique, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR, detected T 790 M in three, four, and six patients, respectively, among 10 in which T 790 M was detected by the MBP-QP method. ConclusionsThe MBP-QP method is simple, sensitive, and—intriguingly—reflective of clinical course, compared with the other three mutation-detection systems.

Forty-two HHV- 6 B clinical isolates were repeatedly recovered from 15 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients, and 20 isolates were recovered from 20 exanthem subitum (ES) patients. Of the 15 HSCT recipients, 9 received GCV during the observa-tion period; however, none of the ES patients were treated with GCV. Two established laboratory strains, Z 29 and HST, were used as standards in this study. Regions 1 and 2 of the U 69 gene of all of the clinical isolates demonstrated the samemelting tem-perature as regions 1 and 2 of the Z 29 strain. For region 3, the melting temperatures of all clinical isolates fell between the melt-ing temperature of the plasmid containing the A 462 D single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and the melting temperature of the Z 29 strain, and the melting temperatures profiles of all clinical isolates were similar to the melting temperature profile of the Japanese HST strain. As expected, none of the 20 clinical isolates recovered from the ES patients and the 14 isolates recovered from the HSCT recipients who did not receive GCV treatment carried the six known SNPs associated with GCV resistance.

All three peptides bind to liposomes containing a mixture of zwitterionic POPC and negatively charged POPS lipids as determined by Zeta potential measurements. Circular dichroism measurements indicated folding of MAX 1 and MAX 35 {{in the presence of}} the POPC/POPS liposomes, whereas no such folding was observed with MAX 8 V 16 E. There was no binding or folding of these peptides to liposomes containing only POPC. MAX 1 and MAX 35 induced release of contents from negatively charged liposomes, whereas MAX 8 V 16 E failed to promote solute release under identical conditions. Thus, MAX 1 and MAX 35 bind to, and fold at the surface of negatively charged liposomes adopting a lytic conformation. We ruled out leaky fusion as a mechanism of release by including 2  mol % PEG-PE in the liposomes, which inhibits aggregation/fusion but not folding of MAX or MAX-induced leakage. Using a concentration-dependent <b>quenching</b> <b>probe</b> (calcein), we determined that MAX-induced leakage of liposome contents was an all-or-none process. At MAX 1 concentrations, which cause release of ∼ 50 % of the liposomes that contain small (Rh < 1. 5  nm) markers, only ∼ 15 % of those liposomes release a fluorescent dextran of 40  kDa. A multimeric model of the pore is presented based on these results. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations show that barrels consisting of 10 β-hairpin MAX 1 and MAX 35 peptides are relatively more stable than MAX 8 V 16 E barrels in the bilayer, suggesting that barrels of this size are responsible for the peptides lytic action...|$|R

QUENCHING, as one of the most important processes of heat treatment, can improve the performance of various metallic alloys greatly, but an important side effect of quenching is the formation of thermal and transformational stresses that cause changes in size and shape that may result in cracks[2]. Therefore, the technical challenge of quenching is to select the quenchant medium and process that will minimize the various stresses that develop within the part to reduce cracking and distortion while at the same time providing heat transfer rates sufficient to yield the desired as-quenched properties such as hardness [3]. The performance of a quenchant can be characterized by its ability to extract heat from the part surface [...] It can be expressed into two ways – by measuring hardness of the quenched part as a function of position beneath the surface or by measuring time-temperature data at pre-specified locations in a standard specimen. Most of the commercial Quench Sensors/Probes measure the time-temperature data, which are later used to estimate quench severity indices...|$|R
40|$|Global {{analysis}} with the reference convolution method {{is applied to}} study the effect of probe migration between micelles on the fluorescence quenching. AnalYsis of synthetic single-photon timing data based on a modified Infelta-Tachiya equation including probe migration is {{used to test the}} capability to discriminate between competing models and determine the accuracy of the recovered model parameters. The applicability of this simultaneous analysis is extended to real experimental data obtained for <b>quenching</b> of the <b>probe</b> sodium 1 -pyrenesulfonate by the quencher N-tetradecylpyridinium chloride in aqueous hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) micelles. Values of the rate constant of <b>quenching</b> and <b>probe</b> migration as well as the mean aggregation number (nu) of CTAC are determined {{as a function of the}} surfactant concentration. In the range 0. 02 - 0. 07 M surfactant no appreciable variation in the mean aggregation number of CTAC micelles and also in the quenching rate constant (k(q)) was observed. The average values of nu and k(q) were 82 +/- 7 and (8. 4 +/- 0. 5) X 10 (7) s- 1, respectively. Within this range of surfactant concentration the probe migration rate constant (k) was a linear function of the micelle concentration ([M]) (k = k(m) [M] with k(m) = (3. 0 +/- 0. 4) X 10 (9) L mol- 1 s- 1). Analysis of the system where the probe sodium 1 -pyrenesulfonate was replaced by 1 -methylpyrene confirms that this more hydrophobic probe does not migrate between micelles during its excited-state lifetime. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMacrophage {{infiltration}} into tumors {{has been}} correlated with poor clinical outcome in multiple cancer types. Therefore, tools to image tumor-associated macrophages could be valuable for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Herein, {{we describe the}} synthesis and characterization of a cathepsin S-directed, <b>quenched</b> activity-based <b>probe</b> (qABP), BMV 083. This probe makes use of an optimized nonpeptidic scaffold leading to enhanced in vivo properties relative to previously reported peptide-based probes. In a syngeneic breast cancer model, BMV 083 provides high tumor-specific fluorescence that can be visualized using noninvasive optical imaging methods. Furthermore, analysis of probe-labeled cells demonstrates that the probe primarily targets macrophages with an M 2 phenotype. Thus, BMV 083 is a potential valuable in vivo reporter for tumor-associated macrophages that could greatly facilitate the future studies of macrophage function {{in the process of}} tumorigenesis...|$|R

The quenching data are interpreted {{in terms of a}} local fluorophore concentration factor.
