5000|$|The cargo trailer is, {{by means}} of a king pin, hooked to a horseshoe-shaped <b>quick-release</b> <b>coupling</b> device called a fifth wheel or a {{turntable}} hitch {{at the rear of the}} towing engine that allows easy hook up and release. The truck trailer cannot move by itself because it only has wheels at the rear end: it requires a forward axle, provided by the towing engine, to carry half the load weight. When braking hard at high speeds, the vehicle has a tendency to fold at the pivot point between the towing vehicle and the trailer. Such a truck accident is called a [...] "trailer swing", although it is also commonly described as a [...] "jackknife". Jackknifing is a condition where the tractive unit swings round against the trailer, and not vice versa.|$|E
