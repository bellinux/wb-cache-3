5|$|A two-sport star in high school, Hansen rose <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Giants' {{minor league}} system {{and made his}} major league debut at age 19. He played for the Giants until 1946, when he voluntarily retired due to a family illness and then served in the United States Army. He {{returned}} to baseball in 1947 and earned a career-best five wins in 1948. After a contract holdout in 1949, Hansen's bullpen workload increased in 1950, leading to an elbow injury and the Giants sending him to the Phillies in the Rule 5 draft.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Iniki made {{landfall}} on the south-central {{portion of}} Kauai island, bringing its dangerous inner core {{to the entire}} island. Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6feet (1.4–1.8m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet (5.5m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35feet (10.5m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800feet (250m) inland. Because it moved <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1479, Báthory {{was made}} {{governor}} of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania {{with a force}} of 43,000 men. The Turks moved very <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> land while pillaging it, giving Báthory little time to gather his militia at Sibiu. Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory. As Báthory approached Sebeş, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş, totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him.|$|E

5|$|Though Gloria moved <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> region, {{it dropped}} {{moderate}} rainfall in locations, including 6.04 inches (153 mm) at Baltimore–Washington International Airport. In addition, some unofficial reports in southeastern Virginia indicated amounts {{of up to}} 8 inches (200 mm) of rain. Because much of the Mid-Atlantic experienced the western, weaker side of this hurricane, damage was relatively light. High winds downed numerous trees throughout the area, leaving hundreds of thousands without power, including 237,000 in New Jersey, 124,000 in Maryland, and 56,000 in Virginia. Extreme rainfall in Virginia resulted in $5.5 million (1985 USD) in damage. Intense flood waters split Long Beach Island in half {{for a period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ekeka {{continued}} weakening, degrading to {{tropical depression}} status by February 4. The depression moved <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Marshall Islands, and on February 6 {{turned to the}} west-southwest. On February 8, the JMA declared Ekeka dissipated; however, the JTWC continued monitoring the system, with Ekeka passing over Chuuk as a weak depression. Early on February 9, the JTWC declared Ekeka dissipated about 800miles (1300km) east-southeast of Palau, or about 310miles (500km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{accompanied}} the First Corps to northern Georgia {{in the fall}} of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle, but served as Longstreet's chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He returned with the corps to Virginia {{for the remainder of the}} war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee's army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able to move his guns <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lines, emplacing them to repel the main attack.|$|E

5|$|Born to a {{merchant}} {{and his wife}} in Gresik, Dutch East Indies, Fakih studied {{with his father and}} at a series of pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) until the 1920s. In 1925 he became involved with the Muhammadiyah, rising <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> leadership until he became the head of the Surabaya branch in 1938. He was also active in local politics. When a group of Islamic organisations formed the Indonesian Islamic Assembly in 1937, Fakih became treasurer. He continued to be involved in politics and Islamic groups during the Japanese occupation and ensuing national revolution. While serving as minister of religious affairs, he oversaw educational and institutional reform, growing in prominence within the Muhammadiyah. He served as deputy chairman of the organisation under several different leaders before being chosen as its chairman in late 1968, several days before his death.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> building, although from the outside nothing was visible. Because of the wooden construction, the building was soon engulfed in flames. The guests on the top level could not escape and stood panicked in the windows. When the fire reached the rooms of some guests, they leaped out of the windows to escape. At 6:42 the first large fire engine arrived. On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire. The fire fighters tried to fold out a life net in the Papenbroekssteeg (which runs between the Rokin and the Kalverstraat) but the alley was too narrow for it.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{was born}} and raised in Longview, Texas. He {{attended}} Navarro Junior College and was selected by the Texas Rangers in the fifth round of the 2006 MLB draft. Davis ascended <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rangers' minor league system, getting named their Minor League Player of the Year in 2007. He was called up in the middle of 2008 and had a strong start to his major league career. He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and a tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} quickly weakened as it progressed inland {{and moved}} over Lake Okeechobee, although the large size {{allowed it to}} maintain hurricane status for several more days. Late on September17, the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near Jacksonville early {{the next day with}} winds of 75mph (120km/h). At 08:00UTC on September18, the storm once again reached open waters. Later that day, the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters, making a second United States landfall near Edisto Island, South Carolina, at 19:00UTC with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Accelerating northeastward, the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over North Carolina. On September19, the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone, although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status. The cyclone turned to the north-northwest, moving <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eastern United States. On September21, the former hurricane dissipated over Ontario, having merged with another disturbance.|$|E
5|$|When the {{rebellion}} finally {{broke out in}} Batoche in March, Irvine advanced <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> snow from Regina to Prince Albert, which he garrisoned with 90 police. Superintendent Leif Crozier took a force of police, civilian volunteers and a 7-pounder (3kg) gun to Fort Carlton and attempted to seize a cache of supplies. In the process, Crozier confronted a larger force of rebels at Duck Lake, where his detachment came off much worse in the resulting fight. Emboldened, some of the Cree leaders, including Poundmaker and Big Bear, now joined the Métis in their revolt, although others continued to tacitly support the government, in part {{the result of the}} good relationship the police had built up with them. The police rapidly abandoned most of their posts along the valley, falling back to more easily defensible locations; Inspector Francis Dickens was forced to flee Fort Pitt with his men on a makeshift boat.|$|E
