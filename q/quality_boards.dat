40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between comprehensive measures of board quality and the cost {{as well as the}} non-price terms of bank loans. We show that firms with higher <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> and even a single (non-insider) advisory board member borrow at lower interest rates. This relation exists even after controlling for ownership structure, CEO compensation policy, and shareholder protection as well as the size and financial characteristics of the borrower. We also show that board quality and other governance characteristics influence the likelihood that loans will have covenant requirements, but the relations differ by covenant type. Firms with high <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> are less likely to have loans with financial ratio restrictions or collateral requirements, though these covenants are more likely when CEO cash compensation is high or when the percentage of incentive-based pay is low.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{corporate}} boards in bank loan contracting. We find that when corporate boards are more independent, both price and non-price loan terms (e. g., interest rates, collateral, covenants and performance pricing) are more favorable and syndicated loans comprise more lenders. In addition, board size, board diversity, audit committee structure and other director characteristics also influence bank loan price. However they do not consistently affect all non-price loan terms except for audit committee independence. Moreover, the impact of board independence on bank loans varies with borrower characteristics (e. g., leverage, tangibility and anti-takeover environments) and loan characteristics (e. g., loan types and loan structures). Overall, our study provides strong evidence that banks tend to recognize the benefits of board monitoring in mitigating agency risk and information risk, and reward borrowers with higher <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> with more favorable loan contract terms.

Law and Corporate Boards: Evidence from Europe When minority shareholder laws are strong, then minority shareholders should have more power to affect board composition and structure. Therefore, countries with strong minority shareholder laws should have ‘good ’ corporate boards of directors (i. e., one that looks out for minority shareholders ’ bests interests). Assuming that boards with independent directors and fewer directors are indicative of ‘good ’ <b>quality</b> <b>boards,</b> we hypothesize that a country’s law quality and the firm’s board quality are compliments, and thus positively related. In empirical tests, we find that European firms in countries with stronger shareholder laws have (i) more independent directors and (ii) fewer directors. We also provide some evidence on causality; of how strong laws lead to good boards. Our overall findings imply that countries should have strong shareholder laws in order for their firms to have good firm-level governance. Law and Corporate Boards: Evidence from Europe 1...|$|E
40|$|Embedding {{capacitors}} and resistors into {{printed circuit}} boards (PCBs) offers many benefits over surface mount technology (SMT) and through-hole packaging (PTH). These benefits include improvements in electrical performance and reliability, and potential cost reduction. Embedded devices also enable signal integrity at speeds over 1 GHz. Also, replacement of surface mounted discrete passives with an embedded passives layer allows for tighter component spacing, fewer holes and a larger routing area. All these are essential for board miniaturization. However, the goals of reliability improvement, space conservation, performance enhancement and solder joint reduction by using embedded passives can only be realized if the PCB fabricator can produce high <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> in a practical production environment in a timely manner. This paper describes {{an investigation of the}} manufacturing of embedded resistors and capacitors on a prototype basis and the possibility of extending this technique to normal mass production. The proposed sequential lamination technique (SLT) was applied to form a PCB with embedded passives. Then, to verify the manufacturing capability, samples of integrated planar resistors and buried capacitors were fabricated on specially designed PCB test panels. The component readings are also presented in this paper. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{cross-laminated}} timber (CLT) {{plates are}} increasingly used in high-performance building structures, a tailored composition of them or, at least, a performance-based classification scheme is not available. Especially, {{the influence of}} the quality of the ‘raw’ material (wooden boards) on the load carrying capacity of CLT elements is hardly investigated yet. For this reason, within this work, bending tests on 24 CLT plates consisting of wooden boards from three different strength classes have been carried out. The global mechanical response as well as the formation of failure mechanisms were investigated, including a full-field deformation measurement system, which allowed for a qualitatively as well as quantitatively identification of board failure modes. Interestingly, no influence of the board strength class on the elastic limit load of the CLT plates was observed, but the situation was different for the load displacement history beyond the elastic regime, where basically, two different global failure mechanisms could be distinguished. The obtained knowledge about the ‘post-elastic’ behaviour of CLT plates may serve as a basis for the optimisation of CLT products and the development or improvement of design concepts, respectively. Moreover, the obtained large ‘post-elastic’ capacity reserve of CLT consisting of high <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> could lead to a better utilisation of the raw material...|$|E

The authors concentrated on UK universities and journals, but also provide some data on non-UK schools and journals. Findings – There were six main findings. First, editorial appointments were normally held by nationals of the country where the journal was published. Second, US academics had a significant presence on all boards. Third, there was a lack of penetration of UK academics, particularly on US or high <b>quality</b> <b>boards.</b> Fourth, overseas academics were present in significant numbers on UK boards. Fifth, editorial board appointments tended to be concentrated in a limited number of institutions and individuals. Sixth, journals, particularly generalist journals, used reviewers extensively. Practical implications – This research will inform the debate about the degree of influence which UK academics have on journal research agendas and on the international stage. The findings show that journal editorial boards do not capture all high ranking institutions and individuals. Editors could consider widening the scope of their editorial board opportunities.

40|$|A TQM based {{approach}} has been developed {{to improve the quality}} of products of MDF boards manufacturing industry. The methodology developed has been implemented in a selected local company and a considerable improvement in the quality of boards have been observed. As the MDF boards manufacturing process is almost the same everywhere, the methodology implemented for quality improvements can be used for the entire MDF industry. As an initial step, a customer survey was carried out on the external customers. This survey covered the customer perception about quality of purchased boards and the product variety needed by the customers. For this survey, it used five MDF board manufactures both locally and in abroad. A questioner survey method was used for this purpose. Outcomes of this are poor <b>quality</b> <b>boards,</b> poor response for the customer complains and unavailability of customer preferred boards. Depending on the external survey outcomes, another survey was carried out on internal customers to reveal the exact reasons for poor quality. Main outcomes of this are, poor quality control method implemented, poor customer orientation, inadequate quality parameters and lack of quality related parameters exist within the industry. As a solution for these problems, a new TQM based quality control methodology has been developed and implemented for the entire production process. Further a quality council system and work team involvement method has been introduced to address the issues from both internal and external customers. Then process improvement technique was implemented in order to further improve quality and minimize waste. Here the Kaizen theory has been used as the main tool for process improvement.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between board alignment with shareholder interests using a new measure of perceived board effectiveness, which is designed to capture the alignment of the directors with the interests of shareholders. Design/methodology/approach – Specifically, the paper looks at the Rotman/Clarkson (CCBE 2) Canadian Board Shareholder Confidence Index as the measure of shareholder's perceptions of the board's efficiency as it relates to company performance. The index is ostensibly designed to capture the essential factors affecting shareholders' confidence in the boards' abilities to fulfill their duties. The CCBE 2 Board Shareholder Confidence Index assigns scores to companies based on the consideration of the following three perspectives: potential of individual board members; potential of the board as a group and past practices of the board. The measure of performance is the firm's Economic Value Added™ (ER), which is a metric for a company's ability to generate economic profits that enhance the wealth for shareholders. Findings – Based on regression analysis, it is found that high shareholder confidence index values are generally associated with higher ER, although the relationship is not monotonic for higher graded boards. This suggests that while highly graded boards are generally beneficial, there may be diminishing returns to efforts to design “optimal” boards in the sense of their alignment with shareholder interests. The performance gap between firms with high vs low expected agency costs as reflected in terms of higher differentials between board members' interests alignments with those of shareholders amounts to almost 30 percent. Originality/value – This paper is the first study to appear that looks at how a new, comprehensive measure of board alignment with shareholder interests relates to company performance. The findings should be of considerable interest to investors, policy makers, and firms looking at the incentive structures for directors, and how aligning directors interests with those of shareholders can create economic value for firms.

40|$|Effective {{corporate}} governance of boards {{can become a}} sustainable competitive advantage for organisations. In the extant literature {{a number of reasons}} are cited for dysfunctional boards. Some of the reasons attributed to board failure relate to poor {{corporate governance}}, practice and oversight. Some of the reasons for board failure pertain to micromanaging of the organisation, an ineffective nominating committee, size of the board, non-functioning committee structure, absence of strategic plan, no orientation plan and no rotational plan. Poor governance practises across all sectors has negatively tainted economic investment in South Africa consequentially affecting economic growth. Below South Africa’s competitive rating slipped from (52 nd) in 2012 - 2013 to 53 rd in 2013 - 2014 rating is given to show that marked improvement is needed in corporate governance. South Africa’s rating in the Corruption Perceptions Index for 2012 was 43 and slipped to position 69 amongst 176 countries for the Corruption Perception Index, 2013. The trend analysis report of the Public Service Commission reported that In 2006 / 7, there were 1 042 cases of corruption, amounting to R 130. 6 -million; in 2007 / 8, there were 868 cases, amounting to R 21. 7 -million; in 2008 / 9, there were 1 204 cases, amounting to R 100. 1 -million; in 2009 / 10, there were 1 135 cases, amounting to R 346. 5 -million; in 2010 / 11, there were 1 035 cases, amounting to R 932. 3 -million; in 2011 / 12, there were 1 243 cases, amounting to R 229. 9 -million. Good governance frameworks, policies, procedures, processes and practices attract foreign direct investments. Better governance practices are critical for improved economic growth and development that will result in an improvement in the South Africa’s competitiveness and corruption perception index ratings. South Africa’s continued economic growth and development is dependent on attracting foreign direct investment. From 1994 corporate governance regimes were promulgated. Although there are a collection of corporate governance codes and guidelines that have been published, few specifically cover governance practices in public entities. Moreover, with better governance practices state-owned enterprises can significantly contribute to the economic transformation and development in South Africa. The purpose of the study is to establish that improved governance is a function of board structure and board process variables. With the presence of structural and process variables board activism will improve resulting in board decision quality. Independent directors without no conflict of interest, the requisite industry expertise and intelligence (functional area knowledge), the information to make decisions are adequate, accurate and timely (information quality), directors exert the needed effort (effort norms), directors robustly explore all dimensions and options (cognitive conflict) and the board functions optimally (cohesiveness) influence board decision <b>quality.</b> <b>Boards</b> which are configured optimally are able to execute their fiduciary responsibility optimally. In 2012 a budget of R 845. 5 billion was provisioned for infrastructural development to boost economic development. This budget allocation must be prudently and frugally managed in accordance with good governance practises to achieve economic development. In particular South Africa has to improve its competitiveness rating and corruption perception index to attract investments and continual growth. In terms of the research design, to address the research questions, a mixed research approach was selected for the study. The phenomenological (qualitative) and positivist (quantitative) philosophical paradigms were adopted with the purpose to obtain a greater understanding of board decision quality in the Public Entities in South Africa. The data collection instruments used in the study was in-depth interviews, focus group interviews and administration of a survey. The population for the qualitative research was 19 in-depth interviews and two focus group interviews. For the quantitative study a population of 215 public entity board members were selected for the study. A total of 104 board members of Public Entities completed the survey for the study. In relation to data analysis for the qualitative study Tesch’s coding, thematic analysis was used to analyse the in-depth and focus group interviews. For the quantitative study, SPSS was used to analyse responses from the surveys. The hypothesis was tested using inferential statistics, namely, factor analysis and multiple regression was used [...] The findings generated from the first phase, the qualitative study that provided support for the positive relationship between board structure, board process variables and board decision quality. The following five variables are incorporated in a model that seeks to identify the strongest predictor of board decision quality: (1) board independence, (2) effort norms, (3) functional area knowledge and skill, (4) cognitive conflict and (5) information quality. The findings show that information quality is the strongest predictor of board decision quality followed by expert knowledge and skill. As expected, expert knowledge does not only increase the cognitive capacity of the board, but it also positively affects company competitiveness. The findings also show that cognitive conflict has a negative association with decision quality. The study argues that political influence exerted by board political appointees may explain the negative relationship between cognitive conflict and board decision quality. The major contribution {{of this study is that}} it provides a 28 -item instrument that can be used practically by public entity boards in the reflective process to improve board decision quality. The study concludes by offering avenues for further research. The model suggests that board decision quality is a product of board structure (board independence), board process (functional area knowledge, information quality, and cognitive conflict and effort norms).
