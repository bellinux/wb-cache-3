5|$|At {{the end of}} the bout, the {{contestant}} {{with the}} higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.|$|E
5|$|Some {{studies have}} {{reported}} reductions in numbers of cells or volume of tissue, but the amount of data relating to this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not very large.|$|E

50|$|First, eight <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> posed {{simultaneously}} to all contestants who response with a touchscreen {{and a computer}} keyboard. Three of the <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> Duo, three <b>question</b> <b>are</b> Carré, and two <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> Cash. Points are awarded as above.|$|R
50|$|The Everybody Votes Channel {{features}} general two-choice poll {{questions for}} users to answer. Three regional <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> offered, {{as well as}} one or more global polls; after a set time period, a <b>question</b> closes and <b>is</b> replaced by another one. New regional <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> posted every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Global <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> due to be posted twice a month, although to launch the channel two worldwide <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> released in quick succession.|$|R
30|$|To do the comparison, {{we first}} {{implemented}} {{a method for}} machine-generating questions from a biology knowledge base. A second set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> formed by selecting questions retrieved from the web. The authors of most web <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> probably students and not biology experts. Our third set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> comprised of professional human-generated questions from textbooks and a biology study website ([URL] University biology students were recruited to act as judges. They rated the three sets of questions on four measures. Our primary <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether the machine-generated <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> worse than the human-generated ones. We were also interested in whether {{the two types of}} human-authored <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> of different quality.|$|R
5|$|Although this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{brought up}} {{now for the}} first time to be decided by this Court, we {{consider}} it as having been long since settled in public opinion. In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted, and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This <b>question</b> <b>is</b> never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive and negative lights.|$|E
5|$|F >^^^^^^^^ The {{abbreviation}} Sh Ch {{stands for}} Show Champion, a title awarded to gundogs and Border Collies for winning three Challenge Certificates under three different judges {{with at least}} one of those Certificates being awarded when the dog in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> more than twelve months old.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{not asked}} in this survey; instead the two part <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked (see below).|$|R
25|$|A-not-A <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{not usually}} used in English, but the {{following}} example shows how A-not-A <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> answered.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand oral <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{asked at}} 2pm on each sitting day. Twelve {{principal}} oral <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> asked, with supplementary questions also given that must {{relate to the}} initial subject matter. The opportunity to ask <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> equally shared amongst {{the members of the}} house, excluding ministers. Urgent <b>Questions,</b> while possible, <b>are</b> uncommon.|$|R
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a single fixed graph G on left side of input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |V(H)|O(|V(G)|), so polynomial {{in the size of}} the input graph H. In other words, the problem is trivially in P for graphs G of bounded size. The interesting <b>question</b> <b>is</b> then what other properties of G, beside size, make polynomial algorithms possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{which of}} the areas developed first and created a template for subsequent development. Haas rejects suggestions that maritime development at sites immediately adjacent to the coast was initial, pointing to contemporaneous development based on his dating. Moseley remains convinced that coastal Aspero is the oldest site, and that its maritime subsistence served {{as a basis for}} the civilization.|$|E
5|$|When modern {{medicine}} has identified a drug in a medicinal plant, commercial quantities {{of the drug}} may either be synthesised or extracted from plant material, yielding a pure chemical. Extraction can be practical when the compound in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> complex.|$|E
50|$|In this game, {{two kids}} competed {{against each other}} in a memory game. A brief video {{documentary}} about the day's animal was shown to the contestants, and then three <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> posed about the video. The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth 50 points, the second was worth 100, and the third <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth 150 points. After this, a second video was shown with and three more <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked with doubled point values.|$|R

3000|$|To measure daily {{internet}} use and activities with ESM, the text message surveys included three questions. The first <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> “Are you currently online?” Answer options {{to the first}} <b>question</b> <b>were</b> Y for yes and N for no. The second <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> “If so, for how many minutes have you been online?” For this second <b>question,</b> participants <b>were</b> instructed to numerically enter the number of minutes they had been online. The third <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> “What are you currently doing online?” For the third question, participants entered all applicable options from a predetermined list included as follows: [...]...|$|R
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> only one of limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, {{may be related to}} Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. Each <b>question</b> <b>is</b> given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play {{the same set of}} questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing <b>question</b> <b>is</b> whether RAD {{should be}} thought of as a {{disorder}} of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of You Don't Know Jack <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> multiple choice, with four possible choices. Some <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> fill-in-the-blank, requiring a typed response.|$|R
50|$|Three {{teenagers}} competed. Five or six {{pop music}} trivia <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked; {{some of them}} {{having to deal with}} visual clues (such as pictures or clips from music videos). Each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth $50. After the final <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked, the performer mentioned in the question would come out and perform a song.|$|R
5|$|<b>Questions</b> can <b>be</b> {{formed in}} several ways in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{constructed}} by adding a sentence-final question marker rá. Constituent questions (sometimes called Wh-questions or <b>question</b> word <b>questions)</b> <b>are</b> doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial <b>question</b> word and <b>are</b> marked with a sentence-final question marker hin.|$|R
5|$|Debates are {{punctuated with}} {{vigorous}} gestures which enliven the ambience of the occasion. Each gesture has a meaning. The debater presents his case with subtlety, robed {{in a formal}} monk’s attire. Some of the gestures (said to have symbolic value), made during the debates, generally subtle dramatic gestures are: clapping after each question; holding right hand and stretching left hand forward and striking the left palm with the right palm; clapping hands loudly to stress the power and decisiveness of the defender’s arguments denoting his self-assurance; in case of wrong answer presented by the defender, the opponent gestures three circles with his hand around the defenders head followed by loud screaming to unnerve the defender; opponent's mistake is demonstrated by wrapping his upper robe around his waist; loud clapping and intense verbal exchange is common; and the approach is to trap the defender into a wrong line of argument. Each time a new <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked, the teacher strikes his outstretched left palm with his right palm. When a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> answered correctly, it is acknowledged by the teacher bringing {{the back of his}} right hand to his left palm. When the defender wins the debate he makes an allegorical dig at the questioner by questioning his basic wisdom as a Buddhist.|$|E
5|$|Disregarding the dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same {{sequence}} of events for {{this part of the}} Sacred War. The principal <b>question</b> <b>is</b> therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E
5|$|I wish {{to state}} that my book, Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen, {{contains}} a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follow. First, we describe how <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> generated from the biology knowledge base. Second, we describe how <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> collected via web search and how the irrelevant <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> filtered out. Lastly, we describe the comparison of {{these two types of}} questions to the professional human-generated questions.|$|R
50|$|In {{several of}} the republics, {{additional}} <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> added to the ballot. In Russia, an additional <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked on whether an elective post {{of the president of}} the Russian SFSR should be created. In Kirghizia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan the additional <b>question</b> <b>was</b> on the sovereignty of their republics as part of a new union.|$|R
50|$|Yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{formed in}} various ways in various languages. In English, a special word order (verb-subject-object) is used to form yes-no questions. In the Greenlandic language, yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> formed with a special verb morphology. In Latin, yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{indicated}} {{by the addition of}} a special grammatical particle or an enclitic. In some languages, such as in Modern Greek, Portuguese, and the Jakaltek language, the only way to distinguish a yes-no question from a simple declarative statement <b>is</b> the rising <b>question</b> intonation used when saying the <b>question.</b> (Such <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> labelled declarative <b>questions</b> and <b>are</b> also available as an option in those languages that have other ways of asking yes-no questions.) The use of rising question intonation in yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> one of the universals of human languages.|$|R
5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that the gun dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. The gun shop in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license. Because the gun was used by {{a person with a}} criminal history, and because the NYPD was denied requests to look up the seller of the gun, legislators sought {{to make it easier for}} law enforcement to carry out their investigative duties.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> a toss up, and {{the value}} for each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} by a randomizer. After the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked, whichever team member that buzzed in first was told {{the value of the}} question and prompted for an answer. Answering correctly awarded the points, but answering incorrectly gave the opponent a chance to steal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the bonus}} round, the winning family were asked three more {{questions}} with four possible answers {{on the first}} question, five on the second, and six on the third. Each <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> worth $50 and if the first two <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> answered correctly, the last <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth a bonus prize, otherwise it was played for an additional $50.|$|R
