The {{purposes of this}} thesis are thus to investigate the prerequisites of rationalizing environmental audits by integrating them with quality audits and other inspection procedures at Ericsson's factories, and to investigate how one can apply TQM in such an integrated audit, to analyze the effects of such an audit, and to give recommendations for Ericsson's further auditing work. We found that integration possibilities largely depend on whether the environmental audit should be conducted at systems or technical level. For the most-hazardous plants, traditional environmental audits seem most appropriate. For the less-hazardous majority of plants, however, we suggest that the internal <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> <b>audit</b> (QSA) audit systems-related issues, and that the internal risk management function audit issues requiring technical competence. The main drawback is a loss in overview, and a risk that the procedure will not {{be approved by the}} Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMS) ...|$|E
30|$|Clinical audit in the {{document}} {{is defined as a}} ‘systematic examination or review of medical radiological procedures. It seeks to improve the quality and outcome of patient care through structured review whereby radiological practices, procedures and results are examined against agreed standards for good medical radiological procedures. Modifications of practices are implemented where indicated and new standards applied if necessary’. It emphasises that clinical audit is not research, <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> <b>audit,</b> accreditation or a regulatory activity, but a multi-professional activity that is both scheduled and systematic, carried out by auditors with knowledge of the procedures, combining internal assessment of performance with external review and identifying areas for future improvement. All those involved in audit should respect the confidentiality of patient data, staff discussions, audit reports and other performance data. Much emphasis is placed on the difference between clinical audit and other quality systems and regulatory inspections, there being clear differences in the purpose, focus, scope, methods and consequences {{of the results of the}} observations, their impact and use. Regulatory bodies should neither carry out clinical audits directly not exclusively set up the criteria for the audits.|$|E

This paper describes the research leading {{to the development of a}} cost-effective and systematic methodology for performing quality capability self-diagnosis. ISO 9000 series standards and the methods used to implement multicriteria system evaluation are employed to provide a sound basis for the development of this quality capability self-diagnosis scheme (QCSDS). The QCSDS has been developed to assist manufacturers in the conduct of quality assurance audits using internal personnel. The methodological structure of QCSDS is presented in two major parts: a regular model and a refined model. The regular model includes: (1) development of <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> <b>auditing</b> criteria, (2) selection of a suitable checklist developed from ISO 9000 series requirements, (3) development of importance weights for applicable criteria, (4) performance measurement, (5) <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> rating, (6) analysis of quality auditing results, and (7) suggestions for improvement. The refined model is developed to strengthen capability of the model and its reliability for confirming the effectiveness of an operating <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> using <b>quality</b> cost analysis, utility theory and regression analysis.

40|$|D. Cur. During {{the last}} decade {{there has been a}} surge of {{interest}} in quality issues in education. This is largely due to spiralling costs of education and political demands for accountability in public institutions. In South Africa, higher education institutions are now required by law (Higher Education Act No. 101 of 1997 and the South African Qualifications Act No. 58 of 1995) to introduce quality management in an attempt to assure quality ofboth the programmes and the education providers. The Nursing Colleges in Gauteng provide nursing education to nearly 2000 nurses and, as such, make the major contribution to providing for the quality of the health care services. The colleges therefore have a double reason for introducing quality improvement measures, which start with a system for monitoring the quality of the colleges. In this study a <b>quality</b> <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> has been developed to address this need. There is no comprehensive internal <b>audit</b> <b>system,</b> which allows for quantitative measurement and acts as an empowerment strategy for institutional quality improvement in the nursing colleges in South Africa. The following research questions are relevant: • what should an <b>auditing</b> <b>system</b> for nursing colleges comprise? • what are the indicators of quality in a nursing college? • is the <b>auditing</b> <b>system</b> trustworthy? The overall aim {{of the study was to}} develop an <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> for the nursing colleges in Gauteng. This aim was supported by the following objectives: Phase one: to conduct a value clarification of quality within the nursing colleges in Gauteng, as perceived by the internal and external customers. Phase two: to explore and describe a conceptual framework for a <b>quality</b> <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> for nursing colleges in Gauteng. Phase three: a. to develop a <b>quality</b> <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> for the nursing colleges in Gauteng b. To pilot the <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> in one nursing college in Gauteng. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual design was conducted within the nursing colleges of Gauteng in order to develop a contextual framework and a <b>quality</b> <b>audit</b> <b>system</b> for the nursing colleges.

Objective: To describe {{the impact of the}} Strengthening of Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) training programme and mentorship amongst five clinical laboratories in the Caribbean after 18 months. Method: Five national reference laboratories from four countries participated in the SLMTA programme that incorporated classroom teaching and implementation of improvement projects. Mentors were assigned to the laboratories to guide trainees on their improvement projects and to assist in the development of <b>Quality</b> Management <b>Systems</b> (QMS). <b>Audits</b> were conducted at baseline, six months, exit (at 12 months) and post-SLMTA (at 18 months) using the Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) checklist to measure changes in implementation of the QMS during the period. At the end of each audit, a comprehensive implementation plan was developed in order to address gaps. Results: Baseline audit scores ranged from 19 % to 52 %, corresponding to 0 stars on the SLIPTA five-star scale. After 18 months, one laboratory reached four stars, two reached three stars and two reached two stars. There was a corresponding decrease in nonconformities and development of over 100 management and technical standard operating procedures in each of the five laboratories.

Hemovigilance begins with donors and must enable the collection of information on reactions occurring during the donation of blood, selections of donors and to prevent such incidents. The aim of study was to help identify the trends of adverse events, occurring in blood donors at a tertiary-care hospital, to recommend best practices to improve donor care and safety Materials and Methods: This record-based study was conducted on all adverse events related to allogenic whole blood donations performed over 24 months. All whole blood donations were analyzed. All adverse events occurring during or at the end of the donation were noted using a standardized format and analyzed determining significance at p< 0. 05. Results: Overall rate was 0. 3 % with vasovagal reactions constituting 82 %, and 18 % mild syncopal reactions (p< 0. 001). Immediate vasovagal reaction with injury was very rare (0. 007 %). Vasovagal reactions showed a significant association with young age, female gender, first time donation status. Mean age of persons recording adverse effects was 30. 23 ± 7. 49 years as compared to those without adverse effects, 31. 14 ± 8. 56 years. Conclusion: Donor safety is an essential perquisite to increase voluntary blood donation. AE analysis helps in identifying the blood donors at risk of AE, applying appropriate motivational strategies, predonation counseling, care during and after donation, developing guidelines and hemovigilance programme in countries with limited resources.

Moreover, this has to be approved. To do so, purchasers can perform supplier audits or ask for evidence provided by certificates. Typically, certificates stating conformity to the requirements of a <b>quality</b> management <b>system</b> are issued by professional audit service companies, so called certification bodies. This study helps to remedy the dearth of studies concerning the effectiveness of audits conducted by certification bodies. This qualitative study uses a limited number of case studies to analyse and assess the approaches and techniques used by auditors for certification or re-certification audits. Additionally, this study attempts to understand whether auditors involved have taken into account the paradigm change of the early 2000 s. To this end, auditors involved in the case studies were interviewed. The interviews were dedicated to understanding the cognitive processes of data analysis and the resulting judgements which led to the issuance of certificates stating conformance to the relevant standards. The study was completed on <b>quality</b> management <b>system</b> <b>audits</b> founded on the ISO 9001 : 2008. This standard establishes the foundation for various further industry-dedicated standards, for example the IRIS or the ISO/TS 16949. Cases studies were performed out in small sized companies and recorded through audio tape recordings, as well by notes concerning auditors’ observed actions. These were transcribed and coded. Analysis of the data indicates that auditors have a detailed idea of what is to be found, regardless the type of business an auditee conducts and the aims of a company. The structure, policy, and individual processes of the audited company {{did not seem to be}} of interest. Additionally, audits were performed on the results of audited processes more so than on the progress of the process action and their input/output relation. The interviews shed light on auditors’ understandings of the underlying concepts of the ISO 9001 : 2008. The results show that the auditors examined still have problems with applying these concepts for their audit practices. Furthermore, the study shows the relationship between power and independence of auditors and their impact on effectiveness. Consequently, the study shows that a certificate issued by a professional audit service does not guarantee conformance to the ISO 9001 : 2008...|$|R
