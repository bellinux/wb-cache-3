50|$|The idea of Sticky {{information}} {{found in}} Fischer's model was later developed by Gregory Mankiw and Ricardo Reis. This {{added a new}} feature to Fischer's model: there is a fixed probability that you can replan your wages or prices each period. Using <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> they assumed a value of 25%: that is, each quarter 25% of randomly chosen firms/unions can plan a trajectory of current and future prices based on current information. Thus if we consider the current period: 25% of prices {{will be based on}} the latest information available; the rest on information that was available when they last were able to replan their price trajectory. Mankiw and Reis found that the model of sticky information provided a good way of explaining inflation persistence.|$|E

The seasonally adjusted PPPweighted real GDP for the G20zone, however, is a good indicator for the world GDP, and it was measured to have suffered a direct quarter on quarter decline during the three quarters from Q32008 until Q12009, which more accurately mark when the recession took place at the global level.|$|E

While X-12/13-ARIMA can only be applied to monthly or <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> STL decomposition {{can be used on}} data with any type of seasonality. Furthermore, unlike X-12-ARIMA, STL allows the user to control the degree of smoothness of the trend cycle and how much the seasonal component changes over time. X-12-ARIMA can handle both additive and multiplicative decomposition whereas STL can only be used for additive decomposition. In order to achieve a multiplicative decomposition using STL, the user can take the log of the data before decomposing, and then back-transform after the decomposition.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the mild}} {{recession}} of 2012, the GDP picked up again from 2014, {{and based on}} the Commission’s Winter 2015 forecast it was projected to have accelerated to 3.3%. The more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation. The surge (3.8% {{in the first half of}} 2014), however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors, such as the stepped-up absorption of EU-funds and the central bank’s Funding for Growth Scheme, which subsidised loans for small-and medium-sized enterprises. The fundaments of growth didn't considerably change in 2015 as well - the government supported EU-fund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization - fueled the fair GDP growth. However, from the beginning of 2016, the significantly shrunk base of available EU-funds had an immediate impact on the country's performance. The disappointing <b>quarterly</b> <b>data</b> showed a mere 0,9% hike beating most expectations. Therefore, the government may need to revise its year-on-year growth in the upcoming months.|$|E
5000|$|The {{changes in}} Stamp Duty rates in 1974, 1984, and 1986 {{provided}} researchers with [...] "natural experiments", {{allowing them to}} measure the impact of transaction taxes on market volume, volatility, returns, and valuations of UK companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Jackson and O'Donnel (1985), using UK <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> found that the 1% cut in the Stamp Duty in April 1984 from 2% to 1% lead to a [...] "dramatic 70% increase in equity turnover". Analyzing all three Stamp Duty rate changes, Saporta and Kan (1997) found that the announcements of tax rate increases (decreases) were followed by negative (positive) returns, but even though these results were statistically significant, they {{were likely to be}} influenced by other factors, because the announcements were made on Budget Days. Bond et al. (2005) confirmed the findings of previous studies, noting also that the impact of the announced tax rate cuts was more beneficial (increasing market value more significantly) in case of larger firms, which had higher turnover, and were therefore more affected by the transaction tax than stocks of smaller companies, less frequently traded.|$|E
