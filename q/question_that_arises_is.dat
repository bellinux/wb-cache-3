5000|$|As {{with most}} new {{technologies}} {{the idea of}} being able to erase memories comes with many ethical questions. One ethical <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> <b>is</b> the idea that although there are some extremely painful memories that some people (for example PTSD patients) would like to be rid of, not all unpleasant memories are bad. The ability to soften or erase memories could have drastic effects on how society functions. The ability to remember unpleasant effects from one's past has a huge impact on the future actions they may take. Remembering and learning from past mistakes is crucial in the emotional development of a person and helps to ensure they do not repeat previous errors. [...] The ability to erase memory could also have a massive impact on the law. When it comes to determining the outcome of a trial, the ability to modify memory could have a massive impact on the judicial system. Another ethical <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> <b>is</b> to how the government will use this technology and what restrictions would need to be put in place. Some worry that if soldiers can go into battle knowing that the memories created during that time period can simply be erased they may not uphold military morale and standards.|$|E

We demonstrate empirically that these alternatives can provide considerable improvements in the computational complexity, whilst maintaining the performance of the original algorithm (and in some cases improving it) ...|$|R
