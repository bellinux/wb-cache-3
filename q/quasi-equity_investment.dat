40|$|Venture {{capital is}} a temporary-equity or <b>quasi-equity</b> <b>investment</b> in a growth-oriented, usually small or medium-size {{business}} managed by a highly motivated entrepreneur. Management assistance {{often comes with}} the investment. For the investment, the investor expects either a minority share in the company or the irrevocable right to acquire it. The paper notes that venture capital cannot be expected {{to grow in the}} developing countries at the same pace as it did in its early years of development in the United States and Canada. But {{there is no reason to}} believe that conditions cannot be improved so that it can contribute to industrial and entrepreneurial development in the Third World. Governments can create an enabling climate for venture capital by improving the macroeconomic environment, trying to change attitudes about risk and entrepreneurship, improving information and infrastructure, and providing and promoting the availability of venture capital funds.
