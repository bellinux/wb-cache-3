40|$|Propagation of the Wigner {{function}} is studied {{on two levels}} of semiclassical propagation, one based on the van-Vleck propagator, the other on phase-space path integration. Leading quantum corrections to the classical Liouville propagator {{take the form of}} a time-dependent <b>quantum</b> <b>spot.</b> Its oscillatory structure depends on whether the underlying classical flow is elliptic or hyperbolic. It can be interpreted as the result of interference of a pair of classical trajectories, indicating how quantum coherences are to be propagated semiclassically in phase space. The phase-space path-integral approach allows for a finer resolution of the <b>quantum</b> <b>spot</b> in terms of Airy functions. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of semiclassical phase-space propagation in the Wigner representation, emphasizing numerical applications, in particular as an initial-value representation. Two semiclassical approximation schemes are discussed: The propagator of the Wigner function based on van Vleck's approximation replaces the Liouville propagator by a <b>quantum</b> <b>spot</b> with an oscillatory pattern reflecting the interference between pairs of classical trajectories. Employing phase-space path integration instead, caustics in the <b>quantum</b> <b>spot</b> are resolved in terms of Airy functions. We apply both to two benchmark models of nonlinear molecular potentials, the Morse oscillator and the quartic double well, to test them in standard tasks such as computing autocorrelation functions and propagating coherent states. The performance of semiclassical Wigner propagation is very good even {{in the presence of}} marked quantum effects, e. g., in coherent tunneling and in propagating Schrödinger cat states, and of classical chaos in four-dimensional phase space. We suggest options for an effective numerical implementation of our method and for integrating it in Monte-Carlo [...] Metropolis algorithms suitable for high-dimensional systems.

40|$|A {{memory unit}} is a {{gathering}} of capacity cells together with related circuits expected to change data all through the gadget. Memory cells which can be gotten to for data exchange to or from any coveted arbitrary area is called Random Access Memory (RAM). A decoder is an imperative part of memory, for address disentangling and encoding. The sizes of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) transistor continue contracting to build the thickness on chip as per Moore's Law. The scaling influences the gadget execution because of requirements like warmth dissemination and power utilization. A <b>Quantum</b> <b>spot</b> Cellular Automaton (QCA) is another option to CMOS. It offers higher speed, bring down power utilization, and higher thickness. In non reversible doors some measure of energy misfortune is included. Enthusiasm for reversible rationale offers lessened warmth dispersal and expands the speed. It is another transistor less calculation in nanotechnology. In this venture propose a SRAM CELL configuration utilizing Feynman gate based decoder. It gives reversibility and territory minimization. QCA architect instrument has been utilized to approve the execution of reversible decoders. Keywords-...|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{likelihood}} method {{is used for}} the first time to restore parameters of electron photon cascades registered on X-ray films. The method permits one to carry out a structural analysis of the gamma <b>quanta</b> family darkening <b>spots</b> independent of the gamma quanta overlapping degree, and to obtain maximum admissible accuracies in estimating the energies of the gamma quanta composing a family. The parameter estimation accuracy weakly depends on the value of the parameters themselves and exceeds by an order of the values obtained by integral methods...|$|R
40|$|It {{becomes more}} {{difficult}} to explain the social information transfer phenomena using the classic models based merely on Shannon Information Theory (SIT) and Classic Probability Theory (CPT), because the transfer process in the social world is rich of semantic and highly contextualized. This paper aims to use twitter data to explore whether the traditional models can interpret information transfer in social networks, and whether quantum-like phenomena can be spotted in social networks. Our main contributions are: (1) SIT and CPT fail to interpret the information transfer occurring in Twitter; and (2) Quantum interference exists in Twitter, and (3) a mathematical model is proposed to elucidate the <b>spotted</b> <b>quantum</b> phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} classical {{description of}} non-laminar charge particle beams in paraxial approximation is {{extended to the}} context of two wave theories. The first theory is the so-called Thermal Wave Model (TWM) that interprets the paraxial thermal spreading of the beam particles as the analog of the quantum diffraction. The other theory, hereafter called Quantum Wave Model (QWM), {{that takes into account}} the individual quantum nature of the single beam particle (uncertainty principle and spin) and provides the collective description of the beam transport {{in the presence of the}} quantum paraxial diffraction. QWM can be applied to beams that are sufficiently cold to allow the particles to manifest their individual quantum nature but sufficiently warm to make overlapping-less the single-particle wave functions. In both theories, the propagation of the beam transport in plasmas or in vacuo is provided by fully similar set of nonlinear and nonlocal governing equations, where in the case of TWM the Compton wavelength (fundamental emittance) is replaced by the beam thermal emittance. In both models, the beam transport in the presence of the self-fields (space charge and inductive effects) is governed by a suitable nonlinear nonlocal 2 D Schroedinger equation that is used to obtain the envelope beam equation in quantum and quantum-like regimes, respectively. An envelope equation is derived for both TWM and QWM regimes. In TWM we recover the well known Sacherer equation whilst, in QWM we obtain the evolution equation of the single-particle spot size, i. e., single <b>quantum</b> ray <b>spot</b> in the transverse plane (Compton regime). We show that such a quantum evolution equation contains the same information carried out by an evolution equation for the beam spot size (description of the beam as a whole). This is done by defining the lowest QWM state reachable by a system of overlapping-less Fermions.

40|$|The {{standard}} classical {{description of}} non-laminar charged particle beams in paraxial approximation is {{extended to the}} context of two wave theories. The first theory that we discuss (Fedele R. and Shukla, P. K. 1992 Phys. Rev. A 45, 4045. Tanjia, F. et al. 2011 Proceedings of the 38 th EPS Conference on Plasma Physics, Vol. 35 G. Strasbourg, France: European Physical Society) {{is based on the}} Thermal Wave Model (TWM) (Fedele, R. and Miele, G. 1991 Nuovo Cim. D 13, 1527.) that interprets the paraxial thermal spreading of beam particles as the analog of quantum diffraction. The other theory is based on a recently developed model (Fedele, R. et al. 2012 a Phys. Plasmas 19, 102106; Fedele, R. et al. 2012 b AIP Conf. Proc. 1421, 212), hereafter called Quantum Wave Model (QWM), that takes into account the individual quantum nature of single beam particle (uncertainty principle and spin) and provides collective description of beam transport in the presence of quantum paraxial diffraction. Both in quantum and quantum-like regimes, the beam transport is governed by a 2 D non-local Schrödinger equation, with self-interaction coming from the nonlinear charge-and current-densities. An envelope equation of the Ermakov-Pinney type, which includes collective effects, is derived for both TWM and QWM regimes. In TWM, such description recovers the well-known Sacherer's equation (Sacherer, F. J. 1971 IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci. NS- 18, 1105). Conversely, in the quantum regime and in Hartree's mean field approximation, one recovers the evolution equation for a single-particle spot size, i. e. for a single <b>quantum</b> ray <b>spot</b> in the transverse plane (Compton regime). We demonstrate that such quantum evolution equation contains the same information as the evolution equation for the beam spot size that describes the beam as a whole. This is done heuristically by defining the lowest QWM state accessible by a system of non-overlapping fermions. The latter are associated with temperature values that are sufficiently low to make the single-particle quantum effects visible on the beam scale, but sufficiently high to make the overlapping of the single-particle wave functions negligible. This lowest QWM state constitutes the border between the fundamental single-particle Compton regime and the collective quantum and thermal regimes at larger (nano-to micro-) scales. Comparing it with the beam parameters in the existing accelerators, we find that it is feasible to achieve nano-sized beams in advanced compact machines...|$|R
