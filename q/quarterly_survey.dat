40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The National Agricultural Statistical Service (NASS) conducts <b>quarterly</b> <b>surveys</b> for {{estimation}} of some primary commodities produced on farms and ranches. The commodities often have highly skewed distributions {{with a few}} farms producing very large amounts. NASS uses dual sampling frames comprised of the list frame for efficient stratification and the area frame for {{estimation of}} the part (nonoverlap) {{of the population that}} is not included in the list frame. Because the area frame sampling probabilities are relatively small, a few large observations in the nonoverlap sample can greatly influence the usual direct expansion (DE) estimates for population totals. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate modifications of the usual DE estimators which could produce more efficient estimators for the NASS <b>quarterly</b> <b>surveys.</b> An empirical Bayes approach is used as a method for including estimates from previous <b>quarterly</b> <b>surveys</b> to help stabilize the estimate for the current survey. Another approach is to right-censor the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample to produce a censored direct expansion (CDE) estimator. A bias adjustment, formed as the ratio of the DE and CDE sums over the repeated surveys, is applied to the CDE estimator to produce the adjusted censored direct expansion (ACDE) estimator. The empirical Bayes technique is then applied to the ACDE estimates. The empirical Bayes and censored estimates are calculated for total hogs and pigs in the nine quarterly surveys: March 1987 -March 1989 from Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio. A bootstrap method is constructed to estimate and compare the biases, standard errors, and root mean square errors (RMSE's) of the various estimators. Only a slight reduction in RMSE resulted from censoring the very large expanded observations in the nonoverlap sample. Application of the empirical Bayes technique to either the DE or the ACDE estimators reduced the average RMSE by about 10 % {{in each of the three}} states...|$|R
40|$|The {{high level}} of hunger {{incidence}} {{in the country is}} {{perhaps one of the most}} pressing issues that need to be addressed by our policy makers. Official government statistics and data from self-rated hunger surveys show an increasing trend in hunger incidence among Filipino households. Data from National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) show that the percentage of subsistence poor in the country increased to 14. 6 percent in 2006 from 13. 5 percent in 2003. The Social Weather Stations (SWS) <b>quarterly</b> <b>surveys</b> on hunger incidence also show an increasing trend in the percentage of families that experienced hunger, reaching an alarming level of 24 percent in December 2009, representing about 4. 4 million households. One probable cause of the increasing trend in hunger is the rising food prices akin to what the country experienced in 2008. This paper aims to determine the impact of food inflation and underemployment on hunger incidence in the Philippines, using the hunger incidence data from the SWS <b>quarterly</b> <b>surveys</b> on hunger. A vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used to determine the effect of a shock or increase to food inflation and underemployment on total involuntary hunger. Results from the model show that an increase in food prices at the current quarter will increase hunger incidenc...|$|R
