5000|$|Players tend to {{increase}} the probability of playing an action which gives them a higher payoff. E.g, in the payoff matrix above, Even will tend to play more Heads. This is intuitively understandable, {{but it is not}} a Nash equilibrium: as explained above, the mixing probability of a player should depend only on the other player's payoff, not his own payoff. This deviation can be explained as a <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> equilibrium. In a quantal-response-equilibrium, the best-response curves are not sharp as in a standard Nash equilibrium. Rather, they change smoothly from the action whose probability is 0 to the action whose probability 1 (in other words, while in a Nash-equilibrium, a player chooses the best response with probability 1 and the worst response with probability 0, in a quantal-response-equilibrium the player chooses the best response with high probability that is smaller than 1 and the worst response with smaller probability that is higher than 0). The equilibrium point is the intersection point of the smoothed curves of the two players, which is different than the Nash-equilibrium point.|$|E
40|$|A {{public good}} is {{produced}} if {{and only if}} a team of m or more volunteers contribute to it. An equilibrium-selection problem leads to the questions: will collective action succeed?

The paper studies the evolution of collective action: as part of a strategy-revision process, updating players choose <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> to existing play. With symmetric players, success depends upon the cost of contribution, the benefit from provision, and the critical team-size m; the relative variability of costs and benefits, and their correlation, are also critical. When players differ, successful teams consist of either the most efficient contributors, or those with the most idiosyncratic preferences. The addition of a single bad apple (for instance, an individual whose costs are particularly variable) to a population in which a successful team operates may result in destabilisation: over time, the bad apple might supplant an existing contributor, prompting a collapse.

These same procedures can be utilized for estimating the relative hazard involved if one compares the liver-damaging potency to the median effective dose for some other pharmacologic parameter. Alterations in hepatic triglycerides, lipid peroxidation, and the activities of various hepatic enzymes can also be quantitated in a dose-related manner.

Both the rise and the decay times are essentially amplitude-independent in control conditions, but become markedly amplitude-dependent after desensitization has been suppressed by aniracetam. Strong amplitude-dependence of the rise and decay times suggests that in absence of desensitization the process(es) that determine(s) {{the time course of}} unitary events is/are concentration-dependent. Highly nonuniform, and strongly amplitude-dependent desensitization can be explained by its concentration dependence.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Drosophila and Lucilia {{photoreceptor}} mutants, trp and nss, respond like wild-type {{flies to}} a short pulse of intense light or prolonged dim light; however, upon continuous intense illumination, the trp and nss mutants are unable to maintain persistent excitation. This defect manifests itself by a decline of the receptor potential toward baseline during prolonged intense illumination with little change in the shape or amplitude of the <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> to single photons (quantum bumps). Previous work on the trp and ms mutants suggests that a negative feedback loop may control the rate of bump production. Chemical agents affecting different steps of the phototransduction cascade were {{used in conjunction with}} light to identify a possible branching point of the feedback loop and molecular stages which are affected by the mutation. Fluoride ions, which in the dark both excite and adapt the photoreceptors of wild-type flies, neither excite nor adapt the photoreceptors of the trp and nss mutants. The hydrolysis-resistant analogue, GTP~,S, which excites the photoreceptors of wild-type flies, resulting in noisy depolarization, markedly reduces the light response of both mutant flies...|$|R
40|$|Submaximal {{concentrations}} of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) rapidly release {{only a fraction}} of the InsP 3 -sensitive intracellular Ca 2 + stores, despite the ability of further increases in InsP 3 concentration to evoke further Ca 2 + release. The mechanisms underlying such quantal Ca 2 + mobilization are not understood, but have been proposed to involve regulatory effects of cytosolic Ca 2 + on InsP 3 receptors. By examining complete concentration-effect relationships for InsP 3 -stimulated 45 Ca 2 + efflux from the intracellular stores of permeabilized hepatocytes, we demonstrate that, at 37 degrees C, responses to InsP 3 are quantal in Ca(2 +) -free media heavily buffered with either EGTA or BAPTA [1, 2 -bis-(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetra-acetic acid]. Lower {{concentrations of}} InsP 3 were used to examine the kinetics of Ca 2 + mobilization at 2 degrees C, because at the lower temperature the stores were more sensitive to InsP 3 : the concentration of InsP 3 causing half-maximal Ca 2 + release (EC 50) after a 30 s incubation decreased from 281 +/- 37 nM at 37 degrees C to 68 +/- 3 nM at 2 degrees C. At 2 degrees C, the EC 50 for InsP 3 -stimulated Ca 2 + mobilization decreased as the duration of exposure to InsP 3 was increased: the EC 50 was 68 +/- 3 nM after 30 s, and 29 +/- 2 nM after 420 s. InsP 3 -stimulated Ca 2 + mobilization is therefore non-quantal at 2 degrees C: InsP 3 concentration determines the rate, but not the extent, of Ca 2 + release. By initiating <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> to InsP 3 at 37 degrees C and then simultaneously diluting and chilling cells to 2 degrees C, we demonstrated that the changes that underlie <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> do not rapidly reverse at 2 degrees C. At both 37 degrees C and 2 degrees C, modest increases in cytosolic Ca 2 + increased the sensitivity of the stores to InsP 3, whereas further increases were inhibitory; both Ca 2 + effects persisted after prior removal of ATP. We conclude that the effects of Ca 2 + on InsP 3 receptors are unlikely either to be enzyme-mediated or to underlie the quantal pattern of Ca 2 + release evoked by InsP 3...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{synaptic}} {{transmission is}} a fundamental component of interneuronal communications in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Discharge of a presynaptic vesicle containing a few thousand molecules (a quantum) of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft generates a transmitter concentration signal that drives postsynaptic ion-channel receptors. These receptors exhibit multiple states, with state transition kinetics dependent on neurotransmitter concentration. Here, a novel and simple analytical approach for describing gating of multi-state receptors by signals with complex continuous time courses is used to describe the generation of glutamate-mediated <b>quantal</b> postsynaptic <b>responses</b> at brain synapses. The neurotransmitter signal, experienced by multi-state N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) - and L-alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) -type glutamate receptors at specific points in a synaptic cleft, is approximated by a series of step functions of different intensity and duration and used to drive a Markovian, multi-state kinetic scheme that describes receptor gating. Occupancy vectors at any point in time can be computed interatively from the occupancy vectors at the times of steps in transmitter concentration. Multi-state kinetic schemes for both the low-affinity AMPA subtype of glutamate receptor and for the high-affinity NMDA subtype are considered, and expected NMDA and AMPA components of synaptic currents are calculated. The amplitude of <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> mediated by postsynaptic receptor clusters having specific spatial distributions relative to foci of quantal neurotransmitter release is then calculated and related to the displacement between the center of the postsynaptic receptor cluster and the focus of synaptic vesicle discharge. Using this approach we show that the spatial relation between the focus of release and the center of the postsynaptic receptor cluster affects synaptic efficacy. We also show how variation in this relation contributes to variation in synaptic current amplitudes...|$|R

40|$|The 9 -methyl {{group of}} 11 -cis-retinal plays {{a crucial role}} in photoexcitation of the visual pigment rhodopsin. A hydrogen-substituted analogue, 11 -cis- 9 -desmethylretinal, {{combines}} with opsin to form a pigment that produces abnormal photoproducts and diminished activation of the GTP-binding protein transducin in vitro. We have measured the formation of this analogue pigment in bleached salamander rods and determined {{the size and shape of}} its <b>quantal</b> <b>response.</b> In addition, we have characterized the influence of opsin and newly formed analogue pigment on the <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> to native porphyropsin. We find that, as 11 -cis- 9 -desmethylretinal combines with opsin in bleached rods, the amplitude of the <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> from residual native pigment is elevated by approximately 7. 5 -fold to 0. 15 +/- 0. 09 pA, a value close to the amplitude of the <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> before bleach (0. 31 +/- 0. 10 pA). When activated by light, the new analogue pigment produces a <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> that is approximately 30 -fold smaller and decays approximately 5 times more slowly than that of native pigment in unbleached cells.

40|$|The {{structural}} <b>Quantal</b> <b>Response</b> Equilibrium (QRE) generalizes the Nash equilibrium by augmenting payoffs with random {{elements that}} are not removed in some limit. This approach has been widely used both as a theoretical framework to study comparative statics of games and as an econometric framework to analyze experimental and field data. The framework of structural QRE is flexible: it {{can be applied to}} arbitrary finite games and incorporate very general error structures. Restrictions on the error structure are needed, however, to place testable restrictions on the data (Haile et al., 2004). This paper proposes a reduced-form approach, based on <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> functions that replace the best-response functions underlying the Nash equilibrium. We define a regular QRE as a fixed point of <b>quantal</b> <b>response</b> functions that satisfies four axioms: continuity, interiority, responsiveness, and monotonicity. We show that these conditions are not vacuous and demonstrate with an example that they imply economically sensible restrictions on data consistent with laboratory observations.

40|$|A model {{explaining}} quantal Ca 2 ~ release as {{an intrinsic}} {{property of the}} inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor has been put forward. The model {{is based on the}} hypothesis that the IP 3 receptor can catalyze a transformation f the IP 3 molecule differing from its conventional metabolism. A simple kinetic mechanism is considered, in-which IP 3 -induced Ca 2 § channel opening is followed by the step of IP 3 conversion and channel closure. Examination of the resulting mathematical model shows that it can reproduce well both partial release of stored Ca 2 ~ and the same responsiveness to subsequent IP 3 additions. On incorporation of an additional closed state of the channel, the model describes also a time-dependent channel inactivation at a high IP 3 dose. Temperature s nsitivity of the catalytic step accounts for the reported elimination of <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> and inactivation at low temperature.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundVision in starlight {{relies on}} {{our ability to}} detect single absorbed photons. Indeed, the {{sensitivity}} of dark-adapted vision approaches limits set by the quantal nature of light. This sensitivity requires neural mechanisms that selectively transmit <b>quantal</b> <b>responses</b> and suppress noise. Such mechanisms face an inevitable tradeoff because signal and noise cannot be perfectly separated, and rejecting noise also means rejecting signal. ResultsWe report measurements of single-photon responses in the output signals of the primate retina. We find that visual signals arising from a few absorbed photons are read out fundamentally differently by primate On and Off parasol ganglion cells, key retinal output neurons. Off parasol cells respond linearly to near-threshold flashes, retaining sensitivity to each absorbed photon but maintaining {{a high level of}} noise. On parasol cells respond nonlinearly due to thresholding of their excitatory synaptic inputs. This nonlinearity reduces neural noise but also limits information about single-photon absorptions. ConclusionsThe long-standing idea that information about each photon absorption is available for behavior at the sensitivity limit of vision is not universally true across retinal outputs. More generally, our work shows how a neural circuit balances the competing needs for sensitivity and noise rejection...|$|R

We investigated if quantal excitations in the same rod are different depending on whether they are initiated by isomerization of a rhodopsin or a porphyropsin molecule. Current photoresponses were recorded from dark-adapted rods by sucking the outer segment into a recording pipette. The relation between pigment composition and spectral sensitivity was established by comparison with microspectrophotometrically measured absorbance spectra of rods from the same neighbourhood. Rods with suitable porphyropsin: rhodopsin mixtures (ideally between 1 : 4 and 1 : 2) were stimulated with flashes of red (608 nm) and blue (465 nm) light, whereby the red light will isomerize porphyropsin much more often than rhodopsin, and the reverse will be true of the blue light. The amplitude {{and shape of the}} single-photon response were found to be identical for the “red” and “blue” flash series to within measurement error (ca 10 %).
