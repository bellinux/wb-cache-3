5|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or curtailment of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E

500|$|The {{theory that}} this Siward is Siward Barn was {{advocated}} by Jonathan Shepard and Christine Fell. Shepard pointed out, although never called [...] "Earl of Gloucester", Siward had holdings in Gloucestershire – the only substantial Siward in Domesday Book with property in that county — and {{was indeed a}} participant in resistance to the Normans. Shepard argued that the narrative in <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> not, as the Chronicon Laudunensis had asserted, to the 1070s, but to the 1090s, after Siward's release from prison. Fell, while acknowledging {{that there were two}} Siwards participating in resistance to William the Conqueror, Siward Barn and Siward of Maldon, pointed out that Siward Barn is more prominent in the literary sources and, unlike Siward of Maldon, had property in Gloucestershire. Two other historians who have since commented on the point, John Godfrey and Ann Williams, accepted that the identification is tenuous and remained neutral.|$|E

Prime Minister Asquith intervened, having the <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Admiralty Naval War Staff for study. After considering the problem, the chiefs of the military services issued {{a report to the}} War Cabinet. They warned that even though Force [...] "D" [...] might prevail, Nixon's command had only 9,000 men available for combat. Intelligence estimates indicated that as many as 60,000 fresh troops would be arriving in the region by January at the latest. Even with this report, the Asquith government gave the approval for an advance on Baghdad, setting the stage for the Battle of Ctesiphon.|$|E

2500|$|March – Apostle Holland {{addressed}} {{a question on}} homosexuality in the church's first [...] "face to face" [...] broadcast event for youth on March 8. Stated at around 1 hour and 13 minutes into the broadcast, the <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to homosexual members who felt [...] "scared", [...] "alone", and like they didn't [...] "fit into the Lord's kingdom". Holland respond that the church does not [...] "make any attempt to say why ... or how [...] happened" [...] and that those with homosexual attractions have [...] "complexities in their makeup" [...] that we don't fully understand. He continued saying that what the church asks [...] "for those inclined to a homosexual feeling {{is exactly what we}} ask for those with heterosexual feelings" [...] and that the church is not making them [...] "second-class citizens", later comparing them to women who never married.|$|E
2500|$|Two notable {{people who}} had {{previously}} defended Cosby, and believed in his innocence, changed their minds. American actress and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg and Joseph C. Phillips (a Cosby Show regular for three years) each made public statements on July 15, 2015. Goldberg said, [...] "If {{this is to be}} tried {{in the court of public}} opinion, I got to say all of the information that's out there kind of points to guilt." [...] In an interview Goldberg had a message for Cosby: [...] "It looks bad, Bill. Either speak up or shut up." [...] Goldberg had received threats for staunchly standing by Cosby. Goldberg, in the form of a <b>question,</b> <b>referred</b> to Cosby as a [...] "serial rapist" [...] and questioned why he was still on the streets. Phillips was more direct in a separate comment from Goldberg, saying [...] "Of course Bill Cosby is guilty!" ...|$|E

If the <b>question</b> <b>refers</b> to chicken eggs specifically, the answer is again the egg, but the explanation is more complicated. An animal nearly identical to the modern chicken (i.e., a proto-chicken) laid a fertilized egg that had DNA identical to the modern chicken (due to mutations in the mother's ovum, the father's sperm, or the fertilised zygote). Put more simply by Neil deGrasse Tyson: [...] "Which came first: the chicken or the egg? The egg - laid by a bird {{that was not a}} chicken." ...|$|R

6000|$|Pedro {{shook his}} head sadly, and the {{expression}} of the old man became grave. The <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to Pedro's search for his lost child. It had long been the first inquiry when these two met after a separation. The old man seemed never to lose hope, but he had become so accustomed to the reply that his despondency was now of short duration. He had known and loved the child in days gone by--had helped the mother in cultivating her garden-plot, and had gone out hunting with the father many a time. He was a fine-looking man, above seventy years of age, with iron-grey hair, turning in some places to pure white. The hunter's spare though still upright figure showed that he must have been a powerful man in his youth, and the deeply-marked wrinkles about his mouth and eyes told eloquently that he was a kind one. Round his shoulders were twined the cords of the heavy [...] "bolas," [...] or balls, with which he sometimes felled, at other times entangled, his prey. These balls were covered with clotted blood. He carried a short gun in his hand, and a large knife was stuck in his belt.|$|E
6000|$|When {{you begin}} seriously to {{consider}} the <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to in my second letter, of the essential, and in the outcome inviolable, connection between quantity of wages, and quantity of work, {{you will see that}} [...] "wages" [...] in the full sense don't mean [...] "pay" [...] merely, but the reward, whatever it may be, of pleasure as well as profit, and of various other advantages, which a man is meant by Providence to get during life, for work well done. Even limiting the idea to [...] "pay," [...] the question is not so much what quantity of coin you get, as--what you can get for it when you have it. Whether a shilling a day be good pay or not, depends wholly on what a [...] "shilling's worth" [...] is; that is to say, what quantity of the things you want may be had for a shilling. And that again depends, and a great deal more than that depends, on what you do want. If only drink, and foul clothes, such and such pay may be enough for you; if you want good meat and good clothes, you must have larger wage; if clean rooms and fresh air, larger still, and so on. You say, perhaps, [...] "every one wants these better things." [...] So far from that, a wholesome taste for cleanliness and fresh air is one of the final attainments of humanity. There are now not many European gentlemen, even in the highest classes, who have a pure and right love of fresh air. They would put the filth of tobacco even into the first breeze of a May morning.|$|E
6000|$|The Tawny Owl {{lay on the}} {{far side}} of the island. There were ladies in it; and Gilray's misery was meant to date from the moment when he asked one of them a question, and she said [...] "No." [...] Gilray was strangely unlucky during the whole of his time on board. His evil genius was there, though there was very little room for him, and played sad pranks. Up to the time of his asking the <b>question</b> <b>referred</b> to, Gilray meant to create a {{pleasant}} impression by being jolly, and he only succeeded in being as depressing as Jaques. Afterward he was to be unutterably miserable; and it was all he could do to keep himself at times from whirling about in waltz tune. But then the nearest boat had a piano on board, and some one was constantly playing dance music. Gilray had an idea that it would have been the proper thing to leave Molesey when she said [...] "No;" [...] and he would have done so had not the barbel-fishing been so good. The barbel-fishing was altogether unfortunate--at least Gilray's passion for it was. I have thought--and so sometimes has Gilray--that if it had not been for a barbel she might not have said [...] "No." [...] He was fishing from the house-boat when he asked the question. You know how you fish from a house-boat. The line is flung into the water and the rod laid down on deck. You keep an eye on it. Barbel-fishing, in fact, reminds one of the independent sort of man who is quite willing to play host to you, but wishes you clearly to understand at the same time that he can do without you. [...] "Glad to see you with us if you have nothing better to do; but please yourself," [...] is what he says to his friends. This is also the form of invitation to barbel. Now it happened that she and Gilray were left alone in the house-boat. It was evening; some Chinese lanterns had been lighted, and Gilray, though you would not think it to look at him, is romantic. He cast his line, and, turning to his companion, asked her the question. From what he has told me he asked it very properly, and all seemed to be going well. She turned away her head (which is said not to be a bad sign) and had begun to reply, when a woful thing happened. The line stiffened, and there was a whirl of the reel. Who can withstand that music? You can ask a question at any time, but, even at Molesey, barbel are only to be got now and then. Gilray rushed to his rod and began playing the fish. He called to his companion to get the landing-net. She did so; and after playing his barbel for ten minutes Gilray landed it. Then he turned to her again, and she said, [...] "No." ...|$|E
