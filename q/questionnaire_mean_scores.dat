The present study compares parents’ self-reported child-feeding behaviours in two socio-economically contrasting areas. A cross-sectional survey using the Parental Feeding Style <b>Questionnaire.</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated for five child-feeding behaviours: control over eating, emotional feeding, encouragement/prompting, instrumental feeding and restriction. Parents’ self-reported child-feeding behaviours were compared with their sociodemographic characteristics. Three primary schools in two contrasting electoral wards of Sheffield, UK. Two hundred and ten parents of children aged 4 to 11 years, recruited from a convenience sample. Parents in the least deprived ward reported using all five types of child-feeding behaviour more frequently than parents in the most deprived ward. After adjusting for parent sex, parent age, single parent status, employment status and level of education, emotional feeding was the only behaviour showing any evidence of a difference between wards. The most frequently used behaviours were control, encouragement and restriction – behaviours that might be used to directly influence children’s food intake and weight. Child-feeding behaviours differ between areas within a single city and within a largely white population, and this distribution is related to socio-economic and educational factors. Experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to further investigate the potential role of child-feeding behaviours in childhood overweight and obesity...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of positive surgical margins (PSM) on health-related quality of life and illness perception after radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: Of all patients with prostate cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2009 in 7 participating hospitals in the Eindhoven region of the Netherlands Cancer Registry, 197 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were invited to fill in a questionnaire. Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry were combined with questionnaire data (including European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire-C 30, quality of life questionnaire-Prostate Module 25, and the Brief Illness Perception <b>Questionnaire).</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>scores</b> per margin status group were compared in multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: Of the addressed patients, 166 (84 %) responded to the questionnaire. At time of questioning, their surgery was 1. 7 to 6. 4 years ago. The prevalence of PSM was 34 %. On most scales, patients with PSM reported more favorable scores than patients with negative surgical margins. However, differences were mostly trivial (< 5 points on 100 -point scales), or of small (5 - 10) to medium (10 - 20) clinical importance. Only differences on hormonal complaints and illness comprehensibility were statistically significant. Effect of PSM on scores did not vary between patients who were at different time points after surgery. CONCLUSION: Although patients with PSM showed a trend toward more favorable scores, these differences were of little or no clinical importance.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{comparatively}} {{assess the}} psychological, social well-being and general {{state of health}} in patients with stage 1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (according to 1997 TNM), who underwent either elective nephron sparing surgery (NSS) or radical nephrectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in 88 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy and in 56 treated with elective NSS. The measurement of the main QoL components has been made using domain-specific questionnaires tested and validated in Italian language. Each questionnaire has been self-administrated during follow-up (cross-sectional study). RESULTS: The two analysed group resulted perfectly comparable regarding age, gender, civil status, educational level, profession and mean follow-up. A low level anxiety has been documented in 11. 4 % of patients after radical nephrectomy and in 1. 8 % of those treated with an elective conservative surgery. The mean score {{difference between the two}} groups resulted statistically significant (p = 0. 003). A mild depression has been recorded in 7 % of patients who underwent radical nephrectomy and in 2. 3 % of NSS group. The mean score {{difference between the two groups}} was statistically significant (p = 0. 01). The general health status was impaired in 12. 5 % of cases after radical nephrectomy and in 7 % after elective NSS.

40|$|One {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there were any differences in embarrassment between Chinese, Chinese American, and Caucasian American college students. A related purpose was to determine if there were any behavioral characteristics associated with embarrassment among the three groups. A total of 137 college students were given the Embarrassment Questionnaire (Modigliani, 1966) and the revised California Psychological Inventory (CPI; Gough, 1987). Three hypotheses were tested. The first: that there was no significant difference on the embarrassment <b>questionnaire</b> <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> between the three groups. The second: that there was no commonality in the kinds of embarrassing situations experienced by the three groups. The third: that there was no significant difference between the three groups in behavioral characteristics as measured by the CPI. The first hypothesis was tested using ANOVA. The three groups' <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> on the embarrassment questionnaire were significantly different at the. 05 level. The Chinese Americans were the least embarrassable.

Background: Families of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients have specific needs that should also be addressed by the ICU-care team. Current research has mostly concentrated on families from an urban setting, therefore may not be applicable to other populations. Design: Prospective cohort study Methods: Subjects: Family members of patients admitted in the ICU for ? 48 hours over 18 months, in a mixed medical-surgical, 11 bed closed ICU. Questionnaire: The Greek translation of Critical Care Family Need Inventory (CCFNI), which consists of 45 need items covering the information, reassurance, proximity, support and comfort domains. Each item was scored on a four-point scale (1 = very important to 4 = not important). Participants {{were also asked to}} single out the most important need from the CCFNI and complete a questionnaire on basic demographic characteristics. Results: 230 (65 %) family members completed the <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>score</b> for each of the 45 items ranged from 1. 03 - 3 (scale from 1 : very important to 4 : not important). 14 items were rated by responders as very important (<b>mean</b> <b>score</b> < 1. 25). Reassurance need items were consistently singled out as most important regardless of the participant’s background.

Urinary levels of oestrone, oestradiol, oestriol, pregnanediol, 17 -oxosteroids, 17 -hydroxycorticosteroids, testosterone and epitestosterone were determined. No consistent pattern of hormonal abnormality emerged. Thirty-seven of the subjects completed the Eysenck Personality Inventory and 39 completed a <b>questionnaire.</b> The <b>mean</b> neuroticism <b>score</b> for the group was significantly higher and the <b>mean</b> extra-version <b>score</b> was significantly lower than in the normal population. This finding of dysthymia was reflected to some extent by the high incidence of past psychiatric treatment for anxiety and/or depression...|$|R

We investigated {{the mental health}} status of school-aged children referred to a pediatric hospital {{with a history of}} prenatal {{exposure to}} alcohol or other substances. Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and compared with a reference group. A total of 105 of 128 (82 %) eligible children prenatally exposed to substances participated in the study, with 48 children exposed to alcohol and 57 to other substances. Strengths and Difficulties <b>Questionnaire</b> subscale <b>mean</b> <b>scores,</b> total difficulties scores, and total impact scores were statistically significantly higher in the group of exposed children, compared with the reference group. In this hospital-based population of school-aged children prenatally exposed to alcohol or other substances, the exposed group had an increased risk of mental health problems, compared with the reference group...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a widespread}} disease. It produces some night symptoms such as nighttime cough and dyspnea. Then subjective and objective changes in sleep pattern are expected. Present {{study was conducted to}} determine frequency of sleepiness and quality of sleep in patients with COPD. Materials & Methods : Present case-control study has been performed on 120 patients with diagnosis of COPD who had been referred to {{pulmonary disease}} clinic in a University teaching hospital. One hundred twenty age- and sex- matched healthy individuals were recruited in the study and served as control. Spirometry (PFT) was performed for all patients. Patients were categorized under 3 groups in relation to their PFT as follow: mild COPD (FEV 1 /FVC Results : 120 patients with COPD (79 males and 41 females) and 120 normal individuals responded to the <b>questionnaires.</b> <b>Mean</b> <b>scores</b> of quality of sleep were 8. 03 ± 3. 66 and 4. 2 ± 2. 8 in COPD patients and control group respectively. 32. 1 % of the patients had good sleep quality (PSQI score less than 5) and 67. 9 % had poor sleep quality. Daytime sleepiness (ESS? 10) was present in 34. 8 % of the patients and 15 % of control people. Multiple logistic regressions showed that the patients reported significantly worse sleep quality and more daytime sleepiness than control group [OR= 2. 9; 95 % CI (1. 6 - 3. 7) & OR= 3. 5; 95 % CI (2. 5 - 4. 3) respectively]. Conclusion : Results of present study confirmed that COPD is associated with daytime sleepiness and poor quality of sleep, possibly attributable to nighttime respiratory difficulties and concomitant sleep apnea. Assessment of the patients for symptoms of sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness should be a part of regular follow up visits of patients with COPD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Spontaneous {{reporting}} {{is an important}} tool in pharmacovigilance. However, its success depends on cooperative and motivated prescribers. Under-reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by prescribers is a common problem. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding ADR reporting among prescribers at the Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, to get an insight into the causes of under-reporting of ADRs. Materials and Methods: A pretested KAP questionnaire comprising of 15 questions (knowledge 6, attitude 5, and practice 4) was administered to 436 prescribers. The questionnaires were assessed for their completeness (maximum score 20) {{and the type of}} responses regarding ADR reporting. Microsoft Excel worksheet (Microsoft Office 2007) and Chi-Square test were used for statistical analysis. Results: A total of 260 (61 %) prescribers completed the <b>questionnaire</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>score</b> of completion 18. 04). The response rate of resident doctors (70. 7 %) was better than consultants (34. 5 %) (P < 0. 001). ADR reporting was considered important by 97. 3 % of the respondents; primarily for improving patient safety (28. 8 %) and identifying new ADRs (24. 6 %). A majority of the respondents opined {{that they would like to}} report serious ADRs (56 %). However, only 15 % of the prescribers had reported ADRs previously. The reasons cited for this were lack of information on where (70 %) and how (68 %) to report and the lack of access to reporting forms (49. 2 %). Preferred methods for reporting were e-mail (56 %) and personal communication (42 %). Conclusion: The prescribers are aware of the ADRs and the importance of their reporting. However, under reporting and lack of knowledge about the reporting system are clearly evident. Creating awareness about ADR reporting and devising means to make it easy and convenient may aid in improving spontaneous reporting...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of infrastructure in developing country such as Malaysia was increasingly {{founded by the}} Public-Private Partnership (PPP) scheme. Collaboration with private sector has become popular {{as a means to}} improve the delivery of public facilities. Yet, empirical evidence on how PPP initiative has benefits the delivery of public facilities within Malaysia context is lagging. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify and assess the perception of stakeholders on the benefits of adopting PPP in delivering public facilities in Malaysia. Literature review was carried out to identify PPP benefits, which were then incorporated into the <b>questionnaire.</b> The <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>score</b> ranking was conducted to assess the agreement level of stakeholders towards the PPP benefits. The overall findings show that the implementation of PPP has benefitted the delivery of public facilities in both financial and non-financial aspects. From the analysis, improvement in service quality is perceived as the top advantage followed by innovation in design and transfer of risk. The findings provide more informed basis on the rationale of PPP implementation and its potential in improving the delivery of public facilities within Malaysia context...|$|R
