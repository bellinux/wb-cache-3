40|$|The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> is very {{important}} for both human and animal nutrition. Fusarium mycotoxins include a great number of compounds. Trichothecenes, zearalenone (ZEN) and fumonisins are the major Fusarium mycotoxins occurring in cereal grains, animal feeds and forages. Conditions that predispose to mycotoxin production by Fusarium species include humidity, temperature, aeration and substrate type. Even if a great number of fungal metabolites have been designated as mycotoxins, a small number are known to have significant animal/human health and economic significance. For this, the world-wide impact of mycotoxins on human and animal health is likely underestimated and the future in this area is to identify additional specific biomarkers and group of biomarkers {{that can be used to}} establish the exposition of human and animals to individual mycotoxins...|$|E

The study quantified the effect of amount and type of fiber and whole grain on (i) texture, (ii) structure, and (iii) rehydration properties <b>of</b> extruded <b>cereals.</b> New innovative methods were applied and combined with traditional techniques to characterize both the structure and the rehydration properties. Extruded cereals were produced using a starch-based recipe (whole and wheat flours) and two sources of fibers (oat bran concentrate and wheat bran).

40|$|Versatile {{microbiota}} {{are inevitably}} naturally present on cereals.

However, {{the real problem is}} their harmful metabolites—mycotoxins—that affect the health of humans and animals. In the era of emerging analytical methodologies, the spectrum of known toxins originating from microorganisms that can pose a threat to humans has grown tremendously. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor microflora throughout the productive “barley to beer” chain and to act suppressive on the proliferation of unwanted microorganisms, before and during malting, preventing the occurrence of mycotoxins in final products and by-products.

The antioxidant activity (39. 5 % on kidney beans and 225 % on oats in relation to the controls) and content of total polyphenols (kidney beans three times higher regarding the controls) increased significantly by the presence of the fungus mycelium, even after simulated digestion. There was a significant increase in protein digestibility (from 39. 99 to 48. 13 % in black beans, 44. 06 to 69. 01 % in kidney beans, and 63. 25 to 70. 01 % in oats) and a decrease of antinutrient tannins (from 65. 21 to 22. 07 mg in black beans, 35. 54 to 23. 37 in kidney beans, and 55. 67 to 28. 11 in oats) as well as an increase in the contents of some essential amino acids.

40|$|The protein {{synthesis}} elongation factor 1 A (eEF 1 A) is a multifunctional protein in eukaryotic cells. In maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm eEF 1 A co-localizes with actin around protein bodies, and its accumulation is {{highly correlated with}} the protein-bound lysine (Lys) content. We purified eEF 1 A from maize kernels by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange, and chromatofocusing. The identify of the purified protein was confirmed by microsequencing of an endoproteinase glutamic acid-C fragment and by its ability to bundle actin. Using purified eEF 1 A as a standard, we found that this protein contributes 0. 4 % of the total protein in W 64 A+ endosperm and approximately 1 % of the protein in W 64 Ao 2. Because eEF 1 A contains 10 % Lys, it accounts for 2. 2 % of the total Lys in W 64 A+ and 2. 3 % of the Lys in W 64 Ao 2. However, its concentration predicts 90 % of the Lys found in endosperm proteins of both genotypes, indicating that eEF 1 A is {{a key component of}} the group of proteins that determines the nutritional quality of the grain. This notion is further supported by the fact that in floury 2, another high-Lys mutant, the content of eEF 1 A increases with the dosage of the floury 2 gene. These data provide the biochemical basis for further investigation of the relationship between eEF 1 A content and the nutritional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals...</b>|$|E

40|$|Granule Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI), which {{influences}} the grain <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> and, particularly, rice, {{is one of}} the most important plant genes. Using GBSSI as a model plant gene in this study, we examined a number of different computational algorithm tools and programs to explore the functional SNPs of this important rice gene and the possible relationships between genetic mutation and phenotypic variation. A total of 51 SNPs/indels were retrieved from databases, including three important coding non-synonymous SNPs, namely those in exons 6, 9 and 10. Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) results showed that a candidate [C/A] SNP (ID: OryzaSNP 2) in exon 6 (coordinate 2494) is the most important non-synonymous SNP with the highest phenotypic impact on waxy protein. This SNP can alter a tyrosine to serine residue at position 224 of waxy protein. Computational simulation of GBSSI protein with the Geno 3 D suggested that this mutant SNP creates a bigger loop on the surface of waxy protein and results in a shape different from that of native GBSSI. Here, we suggest a potential transcriptional binding factor site (TBF 8) which has one [C/T] SNP [rs 53176842] at coordinate 2777 in boundary site of intron 7 /exon 8, according to Transcriptional Factor (TF) search analysis. This SNP might potentially have a major effect on regulation and function of GBSSI.

40|$|International audienceProtein intake has {{increased}} in the world during the last 5 decades, from 62 to 75 g/kg/d in average. In industrialized countries, animal products mainly contribute to protein consumption (60 to 75 %) whereas in Africa, plant proteins, and especially cereals, are the main contributors (up to 90 %). Cereals are relatively rich in proteins (4 to 10 % depending on the foods) {{and because they are}} largely consumed in industrialized countries, they significantly contribute to protein supply. In France, they are the third contributor after meat and milk products. Despite a good digestibility, the protein <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> is assumed to be relatively low because of their poorness in lysine. For instance, wheat contains about twice less lysine than the reference protein profile, which corresponds to the indispensable amino acid composition that is required to satisfy amino acid requirements. In other terms, when cereals are the unique dietary source of proteins, it would be necessary to ingest about the double of the recommended protein intake (i. e. 0. 83 g/kg/d) to satisfy the lysine requirement. This low lysine content results in a decreased in vivo utilization of dietary amino acids for protein synthesis. In contrast, there are no other limiting amino acids in cereals and this protein source can easily be completed with other sources, such as legumes. Cereal fermentation is implemented in many countries and is suggested to improve nutritional quality. However, the benefit regarding the amino acid profile has not been clearly demonstrated, even if {{it has been reported that}} it increased the available lysine. Beside, pseudo cereals, such as quinoa and amaranth, are interesting protein sources. They are richer in proteins than cereals (12 to 14 % protein) and they are not lysine deficient. In conclusion, cereals are an important protein source worldwide, in developing and industrialized countries. Because of their limiting content of lysine, they must be combined to other protein source to satisfy the amino acid requirements...|$|E
40|$|Farmers and growers {{are seeking}} higher crop yields to help balance {{increasing}} productions costs. Methods/practices used to increase yield include crop zoning to suitable climates (Bunting et al., 1982), improved cultivars, higher applications of fertilizers and agrochemicals, use of growth promoters/ripening agents, using modified soil management practices, growing in different media, modifying atmospheres and controlling temperature in protected cultivation, and through using irrigation and higher plant densities. These methods/practices, while increasing yield, may lower the sensory {{quality of the}} crop and adversely affect composition. In the period 1961 - 1979 the world cereal grain yield per hectare (ha) has increased by 26 % with an increase of 42 & for millet (MacKey, 1981); in the last 10 years the yield of greenhouse tomatoes in Ireland has risen by 30 % to about 250 t/ha (Gornley, 1982). Similar increases have been recorded with many other crops. However, crop yields are often inversely related to quality (MacKey, 1981; Gormley et al., 1973, 1982) and there are increasing consumer complaints {{about the quality of}} intensively produced food, i. e. that fruit, vegetables and other foods do not have the flavour they had when yields were lower and agricultural practices les intense; this has led to an upsurge in the demand for organically grown foods in some countries (Kramer, 1973; Knorr, 1979). The Commission of the European Communities (1978, 1983) has expressed its concern on the intensity versus quality issue by launching a research programme o this topic in member states; the sensory and compositional aspects of intensively produced apples, tomatoes and poultry are being studied and it is proposed to include beef and potatoes in future programmes. Saurer (1981) has discussed some of the effects of modern agricultural methods on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> and vegetables while Stoll (1969) emphasised the detrimental effects of excessive fertilizer applications on crop quality. This discussion examines some of the effects of intensive production methods on the quality of plant foods; this is a wide topic and only superficial coverage can be given to many of the aspects. Most attention is given to studies where a significant amount of quality evaluation of the food produced, in terms of sensory and/or chemical and/or physical analyses, has been carried out. The impact of plat breeding and cultivars, as part of the intensive production system is not discussed in view of the extensive nature of this area. However, {{it is important to note}} that there is considerable emphasis on breeding for high quality in addition to yield (Axtel, 1981) in many crops, including apples (Alston, 1981), legumes (Milner, 1973), cereals (Doussinault et al, 1975) and strawberries (MacLachlan, 1981) ...|$|E

Analysis of feed value have highlighted that there is a significant variation between varieties as well as due to an environmental variation between regions and the harvest year. The chemical analysis is, however, time-consuming and costly, and it is therefore desirable to have a rapid and less expensive method, which makes it possible to carry out more analyses in-situ. Near infra-red reflection spectroscopy (NIRS) is appropriate as a standard analysis of dry matter, total N and starch in grains, since it is rapid (approximately 1 minute per measurement of a ground test) and cheap. NIRS is therefore appropriate as a quick method for the determination of EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. The outcome of a successful NIRS calibration will be a relatively cheap tool to monitor, diversify and evaluate the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> for animal feed, a possible tool to assess the feed value of new varieties in the variety testing and a useful, cheap and rapid tool for cereal breeders. A collection of 1213 grain samples of wheat, triticale, barley and rye, and related chemical reference analyses to describe the feed value have been established. The samples originate from available field trials over a three-year period. The chemical reference analyses are dry matter, crude protein, crude ash, crude oils and fats, EDOM, EDOMi, FEso and FEsv. All samples were ground on a laboratory mill and scans were obtained using a QFA-Flex 400 FT-NIR instrument (Q-interline, Roskilde, Denmark). The samples were packed in glass vials with a height of 6 cm and a diameter of 2. 6 cm and measured using a rotating sample device. The sample was rotated with a speed of three rounds per minute, with a measuring sample window at the rotating sample device has a diameter of 6 mm and the analysis surface is 510 mm 2.

40|$|Póster presentado en el EuroFoodChem XVII celebrado en Istambul (Turkey) del 7 al 10 de mayo de 2013. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{a staple}} food for {{over half of}} the world's population. Brown rice, which is hulled {{directly}} from rough rice, consists of a bran layer, embryo, and endosperm. From a nutritional point of view, brown rice should be the preferred eating type as contains higher dietary fiber, B-vitamins and minerals than white rice as well as important phytochemicals such as tocopherols, tocotrienols, γ-oryzanol and polyphenols, suggested to have properties that may benefit health. Germination is an effective and common process used to improve the nutritional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> Bioactive compounds with antihypertensive activity (γ-aminobutyric acid, GABA) and antioxidant activity (polyphenols) are accumulated in sprouts. During germination, the synthesis and accumulation of bioactive compounds is highly affected by operating parameters such as time and temperature. The objective of this research was to optimize temperature and time during the germination process of brown rice for the maximum GABA concentration, total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity using the response surface methodology (RSM). Long-grain brown rice varieties 15 and 17 were provided by the National Institute of Agricultural Research from Ecuador (INIAP). GABA concentration and TPC was determined by HPLC-MS and Folin-Ciocalteau method, respectively. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity method. Response surface plots showed that germination time and temperature significantly influenced the GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity of germinated brown rice varieties. The longer the germination time the higher was the GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity in germinated brown rice. In contrast, temperature had no influence on GABA synthesis during germination. Under the predefined conditions of the temperature from 28 to 34 ºC, and germination time from 24 to 120 h, the maximum GABA concentration, TPC and antioxidant activity were obtained at different germination conditions. The maximum GABA concentration (137. 8 and 119. 7 mg/ 100 g dry weight in 15 and 17 brown rice varieties, respectively) was achieved at a temperature of 34 ºC and time of 120 h. The maximum TPC (3066, 5 and 2878, 9 μg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight for 15 and 17 brown rice varieties, respectively) was achieved at a temperature of 28 ºC and 120 h of germination. Finally, the maximum predicted antioxidant capacity (28. 7 and 27. 4 μmol Trolox equivalents in 15 and 17 brown rice varieties, respectively) was obtained at a temperature of 34 ºC and 28 ºC for variety 15 and 17, respectively and 120 h.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the current}} role of contract {{production in the}} Finnish cereal market. Contract production {{has a long tradition}} in Finland and has been described as the first step towards a more co-ordinated food chain. In contract production, the farmer and the cereal buyer agree upon the quantity and variety of cereal produced. By using contract production, the supply chain gets a stronger control of quality, quantity and delivery. This study describes some critical points of the cereal supply chain as well as the farmers' motives and incentives for contract production. The goal of the study is to analyse contract production between farmers and cereal buyers. Cereal production in Finland has some special characteristics. Production costs in the cereal production are higher in Finland compared to other EU countries, mainly due to the unfavourable climate conditions. The average yield level is low and the average farm size is quite small (25 hectares). While the average size of farms has increased, the size of base barcel has not increased. The small farm size combined with the distance between arable areas pose great challenges in terms of logistics. The Finnish cereal market is small and concentrated. There are only a few big cereal traders and industrial buyers in the cereal market. Farmers' possibilities to compare different buyers are scarce. In the Finnish cereal market, there are typically two types of business orientations: logistic alliances where trade is organised by cereal traders or partnership between farmers and industrial buyers. The main problems of contract production are risk and uncertainty. Especially in Finland, risks of unstable production levels induced by climate cause difficulties in fulfilling agreed contracts. The data given in this study is obtained from the bookkeeping data of farms participating in the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and survey based on questionnaires given to farmers. Price determination in advance is important especially for bread grain and malt barley farmers. A year is regarded as an appropriate length of contract period for all cereals. The most important incentive for farmers is the premium structure. Also, the relationship between the ordinary price and incentives play a crucial role. The basic problems for Finnish farmers are low yields and high production costs. The main concerns of cereal traders and industrial buyers are price risk as well as quality and quantity control. Due to low cereal prices, there might be a serious threat that farmers have no incentives to produce quality cereals required by processors. By means of tighter co-ordination, {{it might be possible to}} quarantee consistent <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> With tighter co-ordination in all levels, contract production secures the marketing channel for cereals. Alternative market-channels are open-market systems, which are organised for example via the Internet. Contract production is one way to reinforce co-ordination between farmers and cereal buyers. The main challenge is to solve the motivation problem between participants. It can be solved by means of effective incentives and optimal contract design. vokMTT TaloustutkimusThe role of contract production and co-ordination in the Finnish cereal marke...|$|E

Our experiment aimed at investigating {{the effects of}} pea intercropping with cereals on the improvement <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> supply with nitrogen and protein content in grain on a loamy soil in organic farming conditions. It was carried out during 2007 - 2009 at the Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture in Dotnuva. Pea (Pisum sativum L) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L), spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L) oats (Avena sativa L), and triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm) were sown as intercrops 50 : 50 or as a sole crop. The results obtained during the experimental years showed that the productivity and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> spring <b>cereal</b> sole crops or intercrops depended on the species <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> and varied between different year's cultivation conditions. Grain productivity in some cases {{was estimated to be}} higher in the intercrops, however it was not stable in three experimental years.

40|$|Cereals {{microstructure}} is one <b>of</b> {{the primary}} <b>quality</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> Cereals rehydration and milk diffusion depends on such microstructure and thus, the crispiness and the texture, {{which will make}} it more palatable for the final consumer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) {{is a very powerful}} tomographic tool since acquisition parameter leads to a wide possibility for identifying textures, structures and liquids mobility. It is suited for noninvasive imaging of water and fats. Rehydration and diffusion cereals processes were measured by MRI at different times and using two different kinds of milk, varying their fat level. Several images were obtained. A combination of textural analysis (based on the analysis of histograms) and segmentation methods (in order to understand the rehydration level of each variety <b>of</b> <b>cereals)</b> were performed. According to the rehydration level, no advisable clustering behaviour was found.

40|$|A six-year {{research}} program, “Premium Grains for Livestock”, {{funded by}} the Grains R&D Corporation, several animal R&D Corporations and Ridley Agriproducts is focussed on improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> grains for livestock. Cereal grains provide {{the major source of}} energy for animals raised in intensive production systems. However, the energy available from cereal grains can vary widely between both grain and animal species. For example, the digestible energy (DE) content of wheat and barley for pigs has been reported to range from 13. 3 to 17. 0 and from 11. 7 to 16. 0 MJ/kg, respectively (van Barneveld, 1999). Similarly, Hughes and Choct (1999) reported a range in apparent metabolisable energy (AME, MJ/kg) for broiler chickens from 10. 4 to 15. 9 MJ/kg for wheat, 10. 4 to 13. 5 for barley and 8. 6 to 16. 6 for triticale. There are also large differences between animal species in their capacity to digest starch in cereals. Sorghum starch is almost completely digested by poultry, compared with significant excretion of sorghum starch in the faeces of cattle (Rowe et al. 1999). A primary aim of the research is to identify the chemical, physical and morphological characteristics of grains that determine their nutritional value for sheep, cattle, pigs and poultry...|$|R
