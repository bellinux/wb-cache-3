Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840.

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for <b>quench</b> cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic ash {{particles}} erupted during magmatic eruptions {{are made}} up of various fractions of vitric (glassy, non-crystalline), crystalline or lithic (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions (e.g., Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of sideromelane (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare microlites (small <b>quench</b> crystals) and phenocrysts. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky tachylite (black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of pulverised products of pumice (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments (xenoliths).|$|E

40|$|Observations {{indicate}} that galaxies with high stellar masses or in dense environments have low specific star formation rates, i. e. they are <b>quenched.</b> Based on cosmological hydrodynamic simulations {{that include a}} prescription where <b>quenching</b> occurs in regions dominated by hot (> 10 ^ 5 K) gas, we argue that this hot gas <b>quenching</b> in halos > 10 ^ 12 Msun drives both mass <b>quenching</b> (i. e. central <b>quenching)</b> and environment <b>quenching</b> (i. e. satellite <b>quenching).</b> These simulations reproduce {{a broad range of}} locally observed trends among <b>quenching,</b> halo mass, stellar mass, environment, and distance to halo center. We show that mass <b>quenching</b> is independent of environment because 10 ^ 12 - 10 ^ 13 Msun "quenching halos" [...] those where most mass <b>quenching</b> occurs [...] inhabit a large range of environments. On the other hand, environment <b>quenching</b> is independent of stellar mass because galaxies of all stellar masses may live in dense environments as satellites of groups and clusters. Furthermore, satellite galaxies show signs of mass <b>quenching</b> independent of halo mass because massive satellites at z= 0 have typically been mass <b>quenched</b> as centrals in their own hot halos at higher z [...] a kind of pre-processing. As in observations, the fraction of <b>quenched</b> satellites increases with halo mass and decreases with distance {{to the center of the}} group or cluster. We investigate <b>quenched</b> centrals in low-mass halos (< 10 ^ 12 Msun), and show that most of these are ejected former satellites of groups or clusters, while about 20 per cent were never satellites but are enveloped in hot gas that extends up to 3 Rvir from the centers of clusters. The agreement of our model with key observational trends suggests that hot gas in massive halos plays a leading role in <b>quenching</b> low-redshift galaxies.

One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to <b>quench</b> the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure hydrants caused by building collapses.

According to the Stern-Volmer plots, the fluorescence emission was <b>quenched</b> by both collisions (dynamic <b>quenching)</b> and complex formation (static <b>quenching)</b> with the same quencher but the effect of static <b>quenching</b> was larger than that of dynamic <b>quenching.</b> Large static and dynamic <b>quenching</b> constants for both OFL and FLU support significant ion-dipole and orbital-orbital interactions between fluorophore and quencher.

Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to <b>quench</b> the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E
