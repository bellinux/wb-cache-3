40|$|Development of the {{collective}} Thomson scattering (CTS) diagnostic system for LHD is presented. High frequency, tunable (87 - 91 GHz), medium power (- 100 kW) <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron</b> {{will be used as}} aradiation source. We will show the detailed description of the system as well as initial calculations of the scattered microwave power from the LHD plasma. Using the <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron</b> as a radiation source was inspired by the fact that this particular evice has the ability of tuning of the operational frequency. Which is made it very attractive for using under the various scenarios for LHD plasmas. Keywords: collective Thomson scattering, sma diagnostics, ion temperature, LHD, quasi-optical gyrotro...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} {{performance}} of a quasi-optical, internal-gyrotron mode converter. When cold testing mode converters, a rotating higher-order mode is commonly used. However, this requires a nontrivial design and precise alignment. We thus propose a new technique for testing gyrotron mode converters by using a simple, non-rotating, higher-order mode generator. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for a W-band <b>gyrotron</b> <b>quasi-optical</b> mode converter by examining the excitation of a TE 6, 2 mode from a non-rotating mode generator. Our results demonstrate that this new cold-test scheme is an easy and efficient method for verifying {{the performance of}} quasi-optical mode converters. open 0...|$|R
40|$|Design of a {{depressed}} collector {{system for a}} <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron,</b> which had a severe constraint on the maximum allowable radius of the collector region is outlined. The needs for unwinding of spent beam and for energy sorting could be accommodated by precise control of the magnetic field profile, especially in the collector region. Techniques used for defining and obtaining such profiles; and for dovetailing the profile with the collector geometry are discussed. Results on profiles and electron trajectories are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility of the design. From primary electron trajectories a collector efficiency of up to 68 % has been calculated for a three collector design...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{parallel}} code for electron gun, beam tunnel and collector simulation. It is a three-dimensional, electrostatic, self-consistent electron trajectory code. For a conventional gyrotron, the code {{can be used}} to study effects associated with deviations from cylindrical symmetry, such as those produced by non-uniform electron emission from the cathode, misalignments between the mechanical and the magnetic axes, etc. In addition, it can handle fully three-dimensional geometries (with dependencies on the polar angle), such as {{can be found in the}} case of a sheet beam for a <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron.</b> The code has already been used in order to study the effects associated with azimuthally non-uniform emission from the cathode of the coaxial gyrotron assembly of FZK; we present the results of the simulations. © 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|An initial {{design of}} a Thomson {{scattering}} system for fusion plasma diagnostic in the Large Helical Device (LHD) at the National Institute for Fusion Science (Toki-shi, Japan) is described. The developed system utilizes as a radiation source a high frequency (92 GHz), tunable in a wide frequency range (about 10 % from 87 to 97 GHz), middle power (up to 100 kW) <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron.</b> Using plasma parametera typical for the LHD, the expected spectrum of the scattered radiation has been analyzed. It {{has been shown that}} due to the conventional lasers (e. g.

40|$|To {{increase}} {{the performance of}} future ECR ion sources, microwave sources at frequencies above 20 GHz at cw power levels of some 10 kW are required. As conventional microwave tubes, like Klystrons or TWTs reach their limit at about these values, the application of gyrotron tubes is considered. The paper describes first the physics of the gyrotron interaction. Then the two gyrotron concepts pursued by ABB are presented, the cylindrical and the <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron,</b> respectively. The technical realisation and the operation of a gyrotron oscillator is demonstrated with some experimental results of an 8 GHz, 400 kW tube presently under test. The layout of low power gyrotron oscillators for ECR plasma heating at 30 GHz with a cw output power of 20 kW follows. Operation at 1 st and 2 nd harmonic for both gyrotron concepts is evaluated. Finally some ideas concerning the r. f. transmission line and wave launching structure into an ECRIS are shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of high power gyrotrons {{makes it possible}} to use the Gaussian output RF beam as input for the interaction with a sheet electron beam, with the aim of generating even higher RF power. Since this interaction is from the beginning in the high-efficiency nonlinear regime, it can proceed without the need of a resonator and without the restrictions of mode competition inherent in a <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron</b> arrangement. The nonlinearly perturbed electron trajectories have been tabulated, as function of field amplitude and frequency mismatch, as the first step to an iterative self-consistency scheme. In addition, the radiation fields from the nonlinearly perturbed electrons are calculated, under an assumed longitudinal profile of the RF fields. This second step is to be repeated, until convergence is achieved. The first results show that the radiated fields indeed have a Gaussian cross-section, {{so that it can be}} reasonably expected that they can add constructively to the initial input. © 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and experimentally demonstrated {{the operation of}} a novel <b>quasi-optical</b> <b>gyrotron</b> oscillator based on an overmoded confocal waveguide cavity. This cavity effectively suppresses undesired modes, and therefore has extremely low mode density. Stable single-mode, single-frequency operation was achieved in the TE 06 mode at 136 GHz. A peak RF output power of 66 kW, corresponding to an efficiency of 18 %, was measured. By varying the cavity magnetic field, high-power generation was observed at 136 GHz in the TE 06 mode, and at 114 GHz in the TE 05 mode. These frequencies correspond to the high Q modes of the confocal resonator. The low Q modes were either weak or not observed. In this paper we will review the design procedure for this cavity, and present experimental data verifying its effectiveness in {{reducing the number of}} modes that can be excited. The confocal waveguide could also be used in high power, gyro-TWT amplifiers to provide greater operating stability and bandwidth, especially in an overmoded waveguide structure. ...|$|E
