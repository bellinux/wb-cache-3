40|$|Abstract Background To {{communicate}} population-based cancer statistics, cancer {{researchers have}} {{a long tradition of}} presenting data in a spatial representation, or map. Historically, health data were presented in printed atlases in which the map producer selected the content and format. The availability of geographic information systems (GIS) with comprehensive mapping and spatial analysis capability for desktop and Internet mapping has greatly expanded the number of producers and consumers of health maps, including policymakers and the public. Because health maps, particularly ones that show elevated cancer rates, historically have raised public concerns, it is essential that these maps be designed to <b>be</b> <b>accurate,</b> <b>clear,</b> and interpretable for the broad range of users who may view them. This article focuses on designing maps to communicate effectively. It is based on years of research into the use of health maps for communicating among public health researchers. Results The basics for designing maps that communicate effectively are similar to the basics for any mode of communication. Tasks include deciding on the purpose, knowing the audience and its characteristics, choosing a media suitable for both the purpose and the audience, and finally testing the map design to ensure that it suits the purpose with the intended audience, and communicates accurately and effectively. Special considerations for health maps include ensuring confidentiality and reflecting the uncertainty of small area statistics. Statistical maps need to be based on sound practices and principles developed by the statistical and cartographic communities. Conclusion The biggest challenge is to ensure that maps of health statistics inform without misinforming. Advances in the sciences of cartography, statistics, and visualization of spatial data are constantly expanding the toolkit available to mapmakers to meet this challenge. Asking potential users to answer questions or to talk about what they see is still the best way {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a specific map design. </p...|$|R

From all regions of China, a population-based sample of 417 respondents had completed the structured questionnaire in a door-to-door survey conducted by neurologists from local hospitals calling unannounced. They were contacted for re-interview by telephone by headache specialists who were unaware of the questionnaire diagnoses. A screening question ascertained whether headache had occurred in the last year. If they had, the specialists applied their expertise and ICHD-II diagnostic criteria to make independent diagnoses which, as the gold standard, were later compared with the <b>questionnaire</b> diagnoses. There <b>were</b> 18 refusals; 399 interviews were conducted in 202 women and 197 men aged 18 – 65  years (mean age 44. 4  ±  12. 6  years). In comparison to the specialists’ diagnoses, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Cohen’s kappa (95 % CI) of the questionnaire for the diagnosis of migraine were 0. 83, 0. 99, 0. 83, 0. 99 and 0. 82 (0. 71 – 0. 93), respectively; for the diagnosis of tension-type headache (TTH), they were 0. 51, 0. 99, 0. 86, 0. 92 and 0. 59 (0. 46 – 0. 72), respectively.

Therefore, relying only on the data obtained from the postal questionnaires gives a less favourable impression of the outcomes from this intervention.

40|$|Adherence to HIV/AIDS therapies {{has been}} an {{important}} health problem since the early 1980 s when AZT was first prescribed as a therapy for HIV/AIDS. It became particularly important between 1995 and 1997 with the advent of protease inhibitors (Chesney, Ickovics, Hecht, Sikipa, 2 ̆ 6 Rabkin J., 1999) and became even more significant as persons with HIV/AIDS began to develop resistance to medications. Low-literacy populations have poorer health (Brez 2 ̆ 6 Taylor, 1997) and higher AIDS rates (Simon, Hu, Diaz, 2 ̆ 6 Kerndt, 1995), than their higher literacy counterparts due to delayed treatment (Baker, Parker, Williams, Clark, 2 ̆ 6 Nurss, 1997), shame of literacy skills (Parikh, 1996), and poor access to care (Williams, et al., 1995). Poorer health and higher AIDS rates can also be attributed to poor patient-provider relationships (Crespo-Fierro, 1997; Eldred, Wu, Chaisson, 2 ̆ 6 Moore, 1998) to a poorer understanding of medical protocols (Murphy, 1997), and inadequate patient education (Ungvarski, 1997; Davis, Michielutte, Askov, Williams, 2 ̆ 6 Weiss, 1998, Doak, Doak, 2 ̆ 6 Root, 1996). ^ The ALP intervention was developed for HIV positive low-literacy populations of African American women in Houston, Texas. The intervention was based on a needs assessment, using the PRECEDE model, an innovative process referred to as Intervention Mapping, and validated using formative evaluation methods with 54 individuals. The needs assessment resulted in a list of behavioral, environmental, predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing determinants of adherence. The Intervention Mapping framework was used to refine these determinants and develop a list of objectives describing what must be learned or changed to for the target population to adhere to HIV/AIDS therapies. Methods and strategies, were developed using theoretical constructs from the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1974) and Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1986). These theories, empirical evidence, and information from the target population indicated that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy were important and changeable determinants of adherence to HIV/AIDS therapies for this population. ^ These components were brought together {{in the form of a}} theory-based color cartoon book and 10 -minute cassette tape. The book was developed for people with 2. 9 years of U.

This study compares self-administered questionnaires to history taking by a physician to evaluate the reliability of such a screening tool for prepregnancy risk detection. METHODS: One hundred ninety-three women from the outpatient clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University Medical Center Nijmegen, The Netherlands, were included in a study on preconception care. A Preconceptional Health Assessment form with risk variables pertaining to social, nutritional, medical, infectious disease, medication, reproductive and family history, and two Family History surveys (for {{the woman and her}} partner) were completed by 186 couples at home. A physician then orally verified the written answers. Agreement between the written and the oral answers was calculated using kappa statistic. RESULTS: An excellent agreement level was found for all sections of the Preconceptional Health Assessment form (overall kappa = 0. 88) except for nutritional history (kappa = 0. 70). The Family History surveys also showed a high agreement level (kappa = 0. 92 for women and kappa = 0. 90 for men).
