Nurses {{must be aware of}} retential stressors, because they add to the cumulative effect of other stressful events. Holmes and Rahe both found a relationship between life <b>change</b> <b>unit</b> as stressors and health changes. This research reported here aims to measure the life <b>change</b> <b>units</b> as stressors among Iranian Hospitals Nurses by LCU rating. A cross - sectional, descriptive and analytical study was conducted among 389 nurses working in 15 teaching hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The respondents were asked to select each of 54 events that cause stress ranked in order of their life <b>change</b> <b>units</b> developed by Holmes and Rahe as stress scale. Before beginning the main study, the reliability and coincidental validity was performed. All data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 18, t-test, Anova statistical methods. Approximately, half of the nurses associated major mortgage, foreclosure of mortgage or loan. More than 50 % of the Iranian nurses had 150 - 300 and more than 300 LCU rating which had the chance to expose to extremely serious risk to health. Iranian hospitals nurses suffer from stress that caused by Life <b>Change</b> <b>Units</b> organizational factors such as change in the financial state, change in the work environment and major mortgage. We recommend to Iranian nursing policy-makers to choose strategies to help nurses cope effectively with workplace stressors. Nursing managers and / or nursing management should develop strategies to address and improve the quality of working conditions for nurses in the hospitals.

40|$|Life crises as {{stressor}} agents can {{disrupt the}} best stress management regime. Different life crises have different impacts. A standard scale to rate change and its related stress impact {{has been developed}} {{commonly referred to as}} LCU (Life <b>Change</b> <b>Unit)</b> Rating. This allocates a number of Life Crisis <b>Units</b> or Life <b>Change</b> <b>Units</b> (LCUs) to different event and then evaluates them and takes action accordingly. This idea behind this approach of is to rundown the LCU table, totaling the LCUs for life crisis that have occurred in the previous one year. A Cross - sectional, descriptive and analytical study was conducted among 900 Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) Employees by a Holms and Rahe LCU questionnaire at 15 hospitals. The respondents were asked to determine their demographic information, list of stress symptoms which suffered from these diseases in the previous one year and finally, responded to 45 Life <b>Change</b> <b>Unit</b> as stressful life events and the value of each in "stress units" which occurred in the previous one year. The results showed that there is significant correlation between the employees LCU rating by sex, educational degree and size of hospital. Also we found that there are significant correlations between the employees stress symptoms with their LCU rating. Totally, 40 % of the employees have less than 150 LCU rating (normal range) and 60 % of them have 150 - 300 or more than 300 LCU rating (abnormal range). In conclusion most of TUMS hospitals' employees who had stress symptoms have more LCU rating. One third of these employees are not in danger of suffering the illness effect, while two third of them are in danger. </p...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} magnitude of life change events for the two groups, Life <b>Change</b> <b>Unit</b> totals were derived for the years 1966 and 1967. To test the hypothesis that patients in psychiatric treatment have experienced a quantitatively significant greater amount of life change than a group of non-therapy subjects, an analysis of variance was used to determine whether there were significant differences between the scores for the two groups. For the year 1966, no significant difference was found between the therapy and non-therapy samples. For the year 1967, {{there was a significant difference}} between the mean Life <b>Change</b> <b>Unit</b> scores for the two groups. As a result of these findings, it is concluded that an accumulation of life change events may serve to precipitate mental health change, and that that probability of such health change occurring is significantly greater when there is a clustering of life change events during any given year than when such a clustering does not occur...|$|R
