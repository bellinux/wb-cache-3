5|$|The iPad {{up to the}} 4th {{generation}} uses a Micro-SIM, {{while the}} first generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same <b>quad-band</b> GSM and <b>quad-band</b> UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.|$|E
5|$|The Dream uses a 528MHz Qualcomm MSM7201A {{system on}} a chip with 192 MB of RAM, {{and comes with}} 256 MB of {{internal}} storage, which can be expanded by up to 16 GB using a Micro SD card slot. For network connectivity, the Dream supports <b>Quad-band</b> GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and GPRS/EDGE, plus Dual band UMTS Bands I and IV (1700 & 2100MHz) and HSDPA/HSUPA (in US/Europe) at 7.2/2 Mbit/s. The device also supports standalone GPS and A-GPS.|$|E
5|$|The 5th {{generation}} iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced {{support for}} many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models {{come in two}} variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, <b>quad-band</b> GSM, penta-band UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant which supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers {{at the time of}} the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Steve Jobs' announcement at WWDC 2010, recent Federal Communications Commission documentation {{has shown that}} the iPhone 4 contains a penta-band 3G UMTS antenna, not a <b>quad-band</b> 3G UMTS radio, as advertised by Apple. According to the FCC documentation filed by Apple, the radio inside the iPhone 4 supports 800, 850, 900, 1,900, and 2,100MHz. The 800MHz frequency, which is most commonly used in Japanese mobile phones, is not advertised as being supported by Apple. However, the 800MHz band is a subset of the 850MHz band, which probably explains why the device is advertised as <b>quad-band.</b> The chip-sets were manufactured by Skyworks Solutions and Infineon for GSM version.|$|E
25|$|The Apple iPhone {{is a small}} {{device with}} {{multimedia}} capabilities and functions as a <b>quad-band</b> touch screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller. The iPhone 4 is thinner than previous models, has a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and adds a secondary front-facing camera for video calls. A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.|$|E
