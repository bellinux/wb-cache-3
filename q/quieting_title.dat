It acknowledged a circuit split among the Ninth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit, the Federal Circuit, and the Court of Federal Claims {{on the question}} of whether 1875 Act rights of way reverted to the United States on abandonment.

5000|$|In 1854, at the {{invitation}} of a Vermont friend, Trevor Park, Shafter came to California and practiced law in San Francisco with Halleck, Peachy, Billings & Park. His brother, James McMillan Shafter, also attended Wesleyan University, and graduated from Yale Law School. Arriving in San Francisco in 1855, James joined his brother Oscar in forming the firm of Shafter, Shafter, Park and Heydenfeldt with Trevor Park and Solomon Heydenfeldt, who was the first elected Jewish member of the California Supreme Court, serving from 1852 to 1857. Oscar was renowned as a real estate attorney and expert in <b>quieting</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Quiet</b> <b>title</b> {{claims are}} {{unaffected}} by the Act. [...] The Supreme Court has held that the separate, 12-year statute of limitations contained in the <b>Quiet</b> <b>Title</b> Act applies to actions by allottees under that Act.|$|R
50|$|Not all <b>quiet</b> <b>title</b> actions “clear title” completely. Some {{states have}} a <b>quiet</b> <b>title</b> action {{for the purpose of}} {{clearing}} a particular, known claim, title defect, or perceived defect. Contrast title registration which settles all title issues, both known and unknown. <b>Quiet</b> <b>title</b> actions are always subject to attack and are particularly vulnerable to jurisdictional challenges, both subject matter and personal, even years after final court decree in the action. It usually takes 3-6 months depending on the state where it is done.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Quiet</b> <b>title</b> {{action is}} a lawsuit to settle {{competing}} claims or rights to real property, for example, missing heirs, tenants, reverters, remainders and lien holders all competing to get ownership to the house or land.

40|$|This is {{an appeal}} to this Court from the trial court 2 ̆ 7 s grant of summary judgment, entered on May 1, 1995, {{in favor of the}} Western Mortgage and Realty Company and against Clayton and Nita Kearl, <b>quieting</b> <b>title</b> to certain real {{property}} located in Draper City, Salt Lake County, Utah, in Western by adverse possession...|$|E
40|$|A {{husband and}} wife were {{residents}} of Wyoming. In a divorce proceeding in that state, having both parties before it and having jurisdiction over {{the subject matter of}} the suit, the Wyoming court granted a decree of divorce to the wife. The decree ordered the husband to deliver to the wife a quit claim deed to property in Nebraska. The husband did not comply with this order. Instead, he left Wyoming and went to the situs of the land in Nebraska and brought a suit there to have the Wyoming decree declared void and to quiet his interest in the property. The wife cross-petitioned asking that the Wyoming decree be enforced, or in the alternative, to quiet title in the wife to the husband 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the property. The Nebraska Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court with orders to render a judgment either enforcing the order of the Wyoming Court, or in the alternative, <b>quieting</b> <b>title</b> in the wife to the husband’s interest in the property. The problem presented in this case is the effect, in Nebraska, of a decree of a sister state ordering a conveyance of Nebraska real estate. The maxim that a court of one state cannot directly affect or determine title to real property located in another state is not as final as it sounds. Under the guise of “indirectly affecting” real property, courts of one state may affect real property in another by rendering an in personam order to convey title to that land. Once this order becomes final, it is then backed by the full faith and credit clause of the United States Constitution...|$|E
40|$|The {{struggle}} over land constitutes {{one of the}} most persistent and important themes of California’s nineteenth-century legal history. Ultimately that struggle pitted those who had objections to the concentration of land in a few hands against those who believed in the sanctity of vested interests; those who recognized the letter and spirit of treaty obligations to Mexico, against those with an antipathy toward Hispanics; those concerned with protecting the public’s welfare against real estate speculators; and the civil law against the common law tradition. While the {{struggle over}} land in San Francisco was not typical of all California land disputes, it raised virtually all the problems confronted in <b>quieting</b> <b>title</b> and resolving the state’s land disputes. Moreover, the resolution of San Francisco’s land disputes brought federal judges into conflict with one another and provides insight into the dynamics of the state’s federal judiciary {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth century. Integral to the complexity of the struggle over land in San Francisco was the city’s right to 18, 000 acres of pueblo land that it claimed under Mexican law. The resolution of San Francisco’s pueblo title provides a good example of the types of land solutions that were forged by federalism. Under the California Land Act of 1851, the segregation of public from private land was technically the exclusive province of the federal government in its examination of Mexican land grants. In practice, however, the state courts’ early involvement with land issues affected how the federal courts exercised their “exclusive” jurisdiction. Further, the struggle over land in San Francisco offers a microcosm of the elements that affected the pace, nature, and ultimate outcome of California land litigation in general. More than anything else, the struggle over the pueblo title offered a view of the contrasting judicial styles of the Federal District Court Judge Ogden Hoffman and U. S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field, the federal judges who played a central role in resolving the San Francisco land disputes. The relationship and differing approaches of Hoffman and Field not only shaped the eventual settlement of San Francisco’s pueblo title in 1866, but also influenced the character of federal justice in California until Hoffman’s death in 1891...|$|E
