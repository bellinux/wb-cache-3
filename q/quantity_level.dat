40|$|In a {{standard}} oligopoly supergame with identical Þrms, {{a necessary condition}} {{on the level of}} marginal costs is derived for optimal collusion to be sustainable, either in prices or in quantities, for any degree of product differentiation, and any number of Þrms. Only in the Cournot version of the model, and with at most three Þrms, the level of marginal costs plays no role in the sustainability of collusion. Otherwise, for any degree of differentiation and any size of industry, the marginal cost must be higher than a threshold value for an optimal single-period punishment to be obtained. When parameter values are such that no optimal single-period punishment can be implemented, a multi-period punishment can always be constructed that leads Þrms to sustain collusion at the proÞt-maximizing price or <b>quantity</b> <b>level.</b> In that case, punishments last longer when the level of marginal costs decreases. By contrast, the length of the punishment phase does not impact the minimum discount factor for which collusion can be implementable. More differentiation and/or concentration unambiguously facilitate collusion.

The broad range of interests of Patrizi reflects both the continuous development of humanism in the scholarly circles during the sixteenth century, and the attention to practical, scientific and engineering issues carried on by many philosophers of his time. From 1577 to 1592 Patrizi was in Ferrara at the Court of the Dukes of Este, appointed to teach Platonic philosophy at the local University. Patrizi was involved in the hydraulic problems of the city from 1579 to 1581. In these three years he produced a great amount of writings, reports and letters addressed mostly to Duke of Ferrara. It is clear that, in Patrizi’s mind, all practical works had to be subordinate to science. In hydraulics this meant subordinating the works to knowledge of the nature of water. In the letter to Alfonso II dated November 28, 1580, Patrizi claimed he was the first to have established a general, orderly, real science of water, resulting from natural and mathematical principles. He based his hydraulic proposals on a scientific basis which took several elements into account: <b>quantity,</b> <b>level</b> and velocity of the water, gradient, breadth and shape of the bed...|$|E

A new place-type resilient material is made from cement, silica powder, sodium sulfate, expanded-polystyrene, anhydrite, fly ash, and acrylic polymer emulsion resin. Its physical characteristics such as density, compressive strength, dynamic stiffness, and remanent strain are analyzed to assess the acoustic performance of the material. The experimental results showed the density and the dynamic stiffness of the proposed resilient material is increased with proportional to the use of cement and silica powder due to the high contents of the raw materials. The remanent strain, related to the serviceability of a structure, is found to be inversely proportional to the density and strength. The amount of reduction in the heavyweight impact noise is significant in a material with high density, high strength, and low remanent strain. Finally, specimen no.
