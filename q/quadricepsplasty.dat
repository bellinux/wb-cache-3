40|$|BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic knee {{stiffness}} {{is a very}} debilitating condition. Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty</b> {{technique has}} been used for more than 50 years. However, few reports of <b>quadricepsplasty</b> results exist in the literature. METHODS: We report the results of 45 cases of posttraumatic arthrofibrosis of the knee treated with Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty.</b> The results of the procedure were analyzed by measuring the degrees of flexion of the operated knees at different time points (before, immediately after, and late postoperatively). RESULTS: The degree of flexion increased from 33. 6 degrees (range, 5 - 80 degrees) preoperatively to 105 degrees (range, 45 - 160 degrees) immediately after surgery, followed by a slight fall in the range of motion (ROM) in the late postoperative period, which reached an average of 84. 8 degrees. There was no significant correlation between knee strength and the patient's gender, but there was a slight trend of lower strength with age. Although Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty</b> technique dates from more than 50 years ago, it still provides good outcomes in the treatment of rigid knees of various etiologies. In general, all cases showed the same pattern of a small decrease in the ROM in the late postoperative period. CONCLUSION: Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty</b> can increase the ROM of rigid knees.

30|$|Several <b>quadricepsplasty</b> {{techniques}} have been described. Thompson {{was the first}} to describe the <b>quadricepsplasty</b> technique in 1945 followed by Judet with his own technique in 1956. The Judet technique consists of surgical phases for treating knee extension contractures [1]. This technique allows for a gradual release, without disruption of the continuity or integrity of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis or rectus femoris muscles, and has had more favourable results when compared to the Thompson technique [9]. Since then, various modifications to the initial technique have been described in the literature. Paley modified the Judet <b>quadricepsplasty</b> by emphasizing that parapatellar incisions should extend only to the medial articular line of the proximal tibia, which would allow for the elevation of the medial collateral ligament, minimizing the manipulation of soft tissues and avoiding additional blood loss [10].|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{performing}} <b>quadricepsplasty</b> for contracture {{that develops}} after application of an external fixator for femoral fractures, surgeons {{must be aware}} of the potential risk for re-fracture and pin-related problems. The purpose of this report is to highlight these not well-detailed complications and to discuss specific findings and treatment suggestions. Case Report: 4 men (mean age, 40 years) presenting with secondary to contracture that developed after application of an external fixator for femoral fractures were included in this study. The radiographs showed union across the fracture site however two of these patients couldn't stand on one leg raising suspicion about the union status. A computed tomographic image indeed demonstrated limited continuity of the cortex. Bone grafting was performed prior to <b>quadricepsplasty.</b> The mean extension and flexion before the <b>quadricepsplasty</b> were 0 o and 570, respectively. At the final follow-up examination, the mean active flexion of the knee had increased to 98 o. Results: The incidence of re-fracture during and after <b>quadricepsplasty</b> has been reported to be between 10 and 25 %. There are 2 preoperative features that may mislead surgeons into believing that complete union of the fractures has been attained: one is the patient's ability to stand on a single leg, and the other is the fact that plain radiographs may lend themselves to different interpretations. In such cases, computed tomography will provide evidence of the continuity of the cortical bone. Bone grafting in 2 of our patients is thought to have prevented the postoperative complications of re-fracture. Complications at pin sites induce contracture at surrounding structures. When extreme tightness of the skin is noted, a tension-releasing procedure such as a skin graft should be performed. Conclusion: In conclusion, re-fracture or pin-site contracture should be carefully managed before <b>quadricepsplasty,</b> because the patients who need a lengthy application of an external fixator experience greater difficulty in bone healing and have more soft tissue damag...|$|E
40|$|Background : Stiffness of {{the knee}} after trauma and/or surgery for femoral {{fractures}} {{is one of the}} most common complications and is difficult to treat. Stiffness in extension is more common and can be reduced by vigorous physiotherapy. If it does not improve then <b>quadricepsplasty</b> is indicated. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the results of Thompsons <b>quadricepsplasty.</b> Materials and Methods : 22 male patients (age range 20 - 45 years) with posttraumatic knee stiffness following distal femoral fractures underwent Thompson&#x 2032;s <b>quadricepsplasty</b> where knee flexion range was less than 45 &#x 00 B 0;. The index injury in these patients was treated with plaster cast (n= 5), plates (n= 3), intramedullary nailing (n= 3) and external fixator for open fractures (n= 9). Thompson&#x 2032;s <b>quadricepsplasty</b> was performed in all the patients using anterior approach, with incision extending from upper thigh to tibial tubercle. Release of rectus femoris from underlying vastus intermedius and release of intraarticular adhesions were performed. After surgery the patients needed parentral analgesia for three days and then oral analgesics for three weeks. Active assisted knee mobilization exercises were started on the first post-operative day. Continous passive motion machine was used from the same day. Supervised physiotherapy was continued in hospital for six weeks followed by intensive knee flexion and extension exercise including cycling at home for atleast another six months. Results : Out of 22 patients, 20 had excellent to good results and two patients had poor results using criteria devised by Judet. One poor result was due to peroperative fracture of patella which was then internally fixed and hence the flexion of knee could not be started immediately. There was peroperative avulsion of tibial tuberosity in another patient who finally gained less than 50 &#x 00 B 0; knee flexion and hence a poor result. Conclusion : Thompsons <b>quadricepsplasty</b> followed by a strict and rigourous postoperative physiotherapy protocol successfully increases the range of knee flexion...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty</b> for treatment of knee contractures and to identify the effect of local infiltration of epinephrine on blood loss associated with this procedure. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in which all cases of knee contractures managed with Judet's <b>quadricepsplasty</b> from 1 st January 2009 to 31 st December 2013 were included and were divided into two groups. The epinephrine group included patients who were infiltrated with diluted epinephrine (1 : 400, 000) along with xylocaine, around the operative field 15  min prior to the incision time, while the control group did not receive any infiltration. Judet's outcome, blood loss, drop in hemoglobin and required blood transfusion were noted for all patients and compared between both groups. Results: Most common preceding pathology identified for the development of knee contractures was periarticular fracture while ilizarov application was the most common etiology.

40|$|Background: Static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacers {{have been}} used widely to treat chronically {{infected}} total knee arthroplasties with a high success result. However, difficulty in surgical exposure during revision has been encoun-tered. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the clinical results of two-stage reimplantation of an infected total knee arthroplasty using a static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. Methods: Thirty-one patients (32 knees) with infected total knee arthroplasty had a two-stage reimplantation using a static antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer. Twelve (37. 5 %) of 32 knees required a V-Y <b>quadricepsplasty</b> and five (15. 6 %) required a quadriceps snip for surgical exposure at revision. One patient was lost to follow-up and three patients died of unrelated causes. The remaining 27 patients (28 knees) returned at a mean of 68. 3 months (8 - 197 months) for clinical evaluation. Results: Four knees (14 %) had recurrent infection. The mean Knee Society score improved from 40 points preoperatively to 82 points postoperatively. The mean functional score improved from 10 points preoperatively to 60 points postoperatively. The mean range of knee motion improved from 57 ° preoper-atively to 88 ° at the latest follow-up. Three knees with V-Y <b>quadricepsplasty</b> developed an extension lag from 20 ° to 45 ° and three knees had a patella baja postoperatively.

40|$|Dear Editor, I {{have read}} the article “Decreasing Complications of <b>Quadricepsplasty</b> for Knee Contracture after Femoral Fracture Treatment with an External Fixator: Report of Four Cases” [1]. I congratulate the authors for the description; however, I {{would like to make}} the {{following}} points: 1. The authors had mentioned nonunion of distal femur for the case discussed in article after CT- scan (figure 2), which seems to be united in x ray- AP view (figure 1). But the lateral view was not provided for the same case. As the CT scan – sagittal section resembles a lateral view of the distal femur and there was no need of CT scan. Routine antero-posterior view and lateral view are enough to assess the union and if needed oblique views can be taken. This saves the patient from unnecessary radiation hazard of CT-scan. 2. With the use of ilizarov external fixator for femoral reconstruction, the tensioned wires do not cause over-tightening of skin. <b>Quadricepsplasty</b> is an elective procedure, purposefully giving the scar of skin grafting is not a profitable decision as after skin grafting, active quadriceps exercises would be delayed leading to failure of surgery and shows lack of preoperative planning. The letter intends to bring these important issues to the kind notice of readers...|$|E
30|$|The {{complications}} {{of the original}} Judet surgical procedure have been described in up to 23 %, including deep sepsis, quadriceps tendon rupture, skin necrosis, fracture of the lateral femoral condyle, wound dehiscence, loss of extension caused by extensive incisions and prolonged surgery or severe post-operative pain [9, 14]. Intra-operative patellar fracture has been documented as a potential complication of the <b>quadricepsplasty</b> technique [8]. In this series, there were no major complications. Infection {{was the most common}} complication after surgery and was associated with the decrease in the mobility of the knee. No patient with such complication required additional surgical procedures.|$|E
40|$|Background: There are {{not many}} reports {{regarding}} the treatment approaches of congenital dislocation of the knee in the literature. Therefore, the preferred method of treatment of this rare congenital disease is still controversial. Hereby, we report the treatment outcome of 29 patients admitted in Shafa Yahyaian Hospital during 40 years. Methods: In this retrospective study done in Shafa Yahyaian Hospital in Tehran, Iran during 2010, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 29 patients treated conservatively or surgically for congenital dislocation of the knee. Patients had been evaluated for an average follow-up of 8. 5 years. Results: Overall, 54 knee dislocations had been treated surgically (58 %) or conservatively (42 %). Range of knee motion, persistent recurvatum, instability, valgus deformity after treatment and limping were the more important factors reported in the two surgically or conservatively treated groups. Knee function was satisfactory in patients with conservative treatment. Despite 80 % of instability in the operated knees, patients could ambulate with or without braces and had a range of motion equal to 80 degrees. Knee function was also good after <b>quadricepsplasty</b> with transarticular pins in selected cases. Conclusion: We recommend a conservative approach to the disease, regardless of the patients age {{at the time of}} treatment and subsequent surgery in patients with dissatisfactory recovery. <b>Quadricepsplasty</b> with transarticular fixation is recommended as a good option in treating these patients. Posterior capsulorrhaphy for patients with CDK and ligamentous laxity is also recommended...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the above-mentioned residual knee stiffness, approach-related complications, and delayed fracture union, three cases (25  %) had mild pain at the iliac grafting donor site and two cases (16.7  %) had manipulation under general anesthesia after 3  weeks from surgery due to manifest delay in rehabilitation response and fear of development of arthrofibrosis. The five cases with cruciate ligament insult had objective anteroposterior laxity of only ± 1 without subjective instability or giving way. The two cases (16.7  %) with severe restriction of knee flexion had initially severe injury to the suprapatellar pouch area, and they sought <b>quadricepsplasty</b> surgery after 14 and 16  months, respectively.|$|E
30|$|Surgical {{management}} of neglected patellar tendon rupture is more demanding {{than that of}} acute ruptures, {{and the results are}} less favorable because of retraction, adhesion, atrophy of the quadriceps muscle and proximal patellar migration [1 – 3]. There are several methods to relocate the patella to its anatomic location including preoperative traction, intraoperative traction, external fixation and <b>quadricepsplasty</b> [1 – 8]. We present a patient with a neglected patellar tendon rupture treated successfully with a modified Ecker technique [7] and adjustable knee brace in the postoperative period. Neither preoperative traction nor additional intraoperative procedures were performed to relocate the patella to its anatomic position in the extended knee. Good functional result was achieved with intensive rehabilitation.|$|E

40|$|Background: Posttraumatic and/or postsurgical knee {{stiffness}} {{is one of}} the orthopedic complications {{which is}} difficult to be treated and can affect individual's life negatively. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the results of <b>quadricepsplasty</b> in patients with knee stiffness resulted from femoral fracture. Materials and Methods: This is a cross-sectional study on all patients with femoral fracture which has caused knee flexion limitation referred to Kashani and Al-Zahra Hospitals in Isfahan from January 2010 to March 2013. The type and site of fracture, joint extension, and fracture fixation technique were recorded. Moreover, the range of motion (ROM) before surgery, under general anesthesia, and 3 - and 6 -month postoperation were measured. Results: Among the patients, 13 had a simple fracture (48 %) and 14 had a segmental fracture (51. 9 %). Considering the fracture site, 11, 10, and 6 patients had femoral (40. 74 %), supracondylar (37. 3 %), and femoral supracondylar (22. 2 %) fractures, respectively. The fracture fixation was performed by the plate, external, and Wagner fixation techniques for 24 (88. 9 %), 2 (7. 4 %), and 1 (3. 7 %) patients, respectively. The mean ROM before operation, under general anesthesia, and 3 - and 6 -month postoperation were determined to be 33. 15 ° ± 24. 73 °, 122. 60 ° ± 10. 22 °, 99. 63 ° ± 16. 52 °, and 100. 74 ° ± 15. 67 °, respectively. The mean ROM value at various stages was not similar (P < 0. 001). The mean changes in the ROM were 79. 2 ° ± 24. 6 ° and 62. 1 ° ± 19. 7 ° in the cases with simple and segmental fractures, respectively. The mean changes in the knee ROM were significantly higher in simple fractures in comparison with the segmental femoral fracture (P = 0. 03).

Hussein et al. described a modification of the Judet technique to perform a limited exposure avoiding transverse incisions in the rectus femoris, and through an incision in the midline of the quadriceps, the rectus femoris was separated from the vastus medialis, lateralis and intermedius {{in the form of}} a belt. The vastus intermedius was then separated from the patella, and a manipulation performed after these releases to gain knee flexion [3]. Lee et al. [15] described another modification of the technique, by combining a modified <b>quadricepsplasty</b> and an Ilizarov frame for the management of severe knee rigidity after a diaphyseal fracture around the knee joint which improved the range of motion without any rebound phenomenon.|$|E
30|$|C 3 -type distal femur {{fracture}} {{presents a}} challenging problem to orthopedic surgeons. Distal femoral nails cannot address these injuries {{due to the}} low fracture lines with articular comminutions, {{and the need for}} free multidirectional lag screws for prior assembly of the fragments that would interfere with insertion of these nails. Therefore, Kim et al. [6], with less severe injuries, stated that poor results, nail failure, and complications were related to the low fracture lines with comminution. Also, Pröbstel and Börner [7] declared that retrograde nailing achieves early consolidation without primary bone grafting but is complicated by a greater amount of instability and malalignment in the presence of comminutions. Ilizarov external fixators with minimal internal fixation have many disadvantages in managing C-type injuries including imperfect reduction, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pin tract infection, loss of reduction, delayed union or nonunion requiring bone grafting, and limited knee motion, requiring manipulation under anesthesia or <b>quadricepsplasty,</b> due to spanning of the knee in ordinary apparatus and tethering of the quadriceps muscles in the low-profile apparatus [8 – 12].|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{retrospective}} {{review of a}} single-surgeon series of 30 consecutive lengthenings in 27 patients with congenital short femur using the Ilizarov technique performed between 1994 and 2005. The mean increase in length was 5. 8 cm/ 18. 65 % (3. 3 to 10. 4, 9. 7 % to 48. 8 %), with a mean time {{in the frame of}} 223 days (75 to 363). By changing from a distal to a proximal osteotomy for lengthening, the mean range of knee movement was significantly increased from 98. 1 ° to 124. 2 ° (p = 0. 041) and there was a trend towards a reduced requirement for <b>quadricepsplasty,</b> although this was not statistically significant (p = 0. 07). The overall incidence of regenerate deformation or fracture requiring open reduction and internal fixation was similar in the distal and proximal osteotomy groups (56. 7 % and 53. 8 %, respectively). However, in the proximal osteotomy group, pre-placement of a Rush nail reduced this rate from 100 % without a nail to 0 % with a nail (p < 0. 001). When comparing a distal osteotomy with a proximal one over a Rush nail for lengthening, there was a significant decrease in fracture rate from 58. 8 % to 0 % (p = 0. 043). We recommend that in this group of patients lengthening of the femur with an Ilizaro...|$|E
