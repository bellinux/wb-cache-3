25|$|A Chevelle SE (special edition) was {{available}} and provided {{front and rear}} spoilers, turbine II wheels, F60x15 tires, special graphics and decals, <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> trim, front and rear sway bars, F41 sport suspension and a deluxe interior. Three colors were available. 50 of these rare cars were built. In 1978, GM downsized its intermediate line and decided to apply the Malibu name to the whole range as it had higher recognition among buyers than Chevelle.|$|E
25|$|The Mustang Bullitt {{returned}} in February 2008, {{a variant of}} the Mustang GT, the last version of which was produced in 2001. It is reminiscent of the Dark Highland Green GT-390 fastback Mustang driven by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film Bullitt. Available in Dark Highland Green or Black exterior paint without spoiler and GT fender emblems; the faux gas cap on the deck lid is replaced by a unique Bullitt version. The Mustang GT's standard fog light-equipped grille is replaced with a specially designed pony-less style grille highlighted by an aluminium accent. Dark Argent Gray 18-inch cast-aluminum euro-flange wheels are used with matching brake calipers and larger, 3.5inch exhaust tips replace the Mustang GT's standard 3 inch tips. Although side (<b>quarter)</b> <b>window</b> louvers (as shown in picture) are not standard, they are added by owners because they are similar to those on the 1968 Mustang fastback.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the title}} being {{included}} in Sony's announced PlayStation 3 launch lineup at its annual Gamers' Day event in San Francisco, online retailers EBgames.com and Gamestop.com—two sites {{with a history}} of revealing the release dates of games before their publisher's announcements—were found on November 8, 2006 to have set Oblivions release date as January 1, 2007. Some few hours later, the delay was confirmed, as Pete Hines issued the statement that [...] "Oblivion PS3 is now a Q1 2007 title". Hines gave no reason for the delay, but the news stirred suspicions of development difficulties working with the PlayStation 3, and that Bethesda was discouraged by the scarcity of PlayStation 3 consoles at launch. The North American PS3 release was later confirmed to be March 20, 2007, {{near the end of the}} first <b>quarter</b> <b>window,</b> with the European PS3 release set at April 27, 2007. Some reporters commented on a perceived parallelism between the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 delays and releases.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Heuliez {{produced}} {{two examples of}} pillarless targa top convertible, the SM Espace. Unlike the factory SM, the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> could retract into the bodywork.|$|R
2500|$|The pre-war cars {{usually had}} a right side {{arrangement}} of front door, five windows, center door, five windows, and one large rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window.</b> These cars were [...] long and [...] wide. There were variations, Washington, D.C. ordered shorter cars, at , with one less window, while Chicago ordered longer and wider cars, at [...] by , with a three-door arrangement ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} {{featured a}} blacked out grille, headlight bezels, rear window molding, door and <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> frames, rear license plate depression, and wiper arms, a black front air dam, black {{front and rear}} fender flares, dual flat black rear-view mirrors, black rear window louvers, black body side scuff moldings, silver [...] "targa" [...] roof band, contrasting [...] "AMX" [...] decals ahead of the rear wheels, silver slot-styled steel wheels, and body painted bumpers with black rubber guards and scuff moldings.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 {{the revised}} Series 2 (or S2) Esprit was introduced. External changes {{included}} intake and cooling ducts added behind the rear quarter windows, taillights from the Rover SD1, and an integrated front spoiler. S2 Esprits also had [...] Speedline alloy wheels designed by Lotus. Other changes included relocating the battery from above {{the right side}} fuel tank under the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> {{to the rear of}} the car, adding an access door to the engine cover, installing wider seats and replacing the Veglia instrument cluster with individual gauges made by Smiths and a new style of illuminated dashboard switches.|$|E
50|$|The AC Frua may be {{confused}} with the very similar looking Pietro Frua designed Maserati Mistral. However, only the front <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> and door handles are shared.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, Heuliez {{produced}} {{two examples of}} pillarless targa top convertible, the SM Espace. Unlike the factory SM, the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> could retract into the bodywork.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{automobiles}} {{the fixed}} quarter glass may {{set in the}} corner or [...] "C-pillar" [...] of the vehicle. There are also designs that incorporate two <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> (see bottom left image) one {{that is part of}} the door and the second mounted in the roof pillar. This arrangement may help to increase driver visibility. In this case, the quarter glass in the C-pillar would not be called an [...] "opera window". Non-opening, fixed <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> are installed like windshields in that they are bonded to the body with urethane.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the last}} Bel Air 2-door sedan was {{available}} in the USA in 1969, Chevrolet introduced a Canadian market-only two door hardtop, the Bel Air Sport Coupe, from 1970-75. [...] Based on the Impala Sport Coupe, this new model featured Bel Air trim {{at a lower price}} than the Impala. [...] Each year through 1975, this model's body followed the design of the contemporary Impala Sport Coupe. [...] The 4-door sedan and station wagon continued in production, identical to the U.S. models. [...] For 1976, the Canadian Bel Air Coupe featured the same body as the Impala Custom Coupe, with the large fixed rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> and frameless front door glass.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1973 model year, Chargers {{received}} new {{sheet metal}} (though {{at first glance}} only the rear roof [...] "C-Pillars" [...] looked different) and were in fact longer, wider, and slightly taller than the 1971-72 cars. Also new were vertically slatted taillights and new grilles. Hidden headlights were dropped, even as an option. The 318 was still standard, with the 340 (available only on the Rallye), 360 (2-barrel only), 400 (low power 2-barrel/single exhaust and high performance 4-barrel/dual exhaust) and 440 remaining as options. The SE models had a new roof treatment that had a [...] "triple opera window" [...] surrounded by a canopy-style vinyl roof. All other models had a new <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> treatment, discontinuing its AMC Gremlin-style window {{in favor of a}} more conventional design. Total sales this year were around 108,000 units, the highest ever for the 1971-74 Charger generation, though more than 60 percent of the cars had the non-high performance engines. The 1973 Chargers, and all Chrysler products, were equipped with 5mph bumpers, front and rear.|$|E
2500|$|With the Laguna {{nameplate}} now {{bearing the}} sporty {{model in the}} Chevelle line, the top-line series for 1974 was the new Malibu Classic series (which was marketed as the upscale luxury trim level similar to the Chevrolet Caprice Classic), offered in sedan, coupe and station wagon models. Unlike the 1973 Laguna, the Malibu Classic used the same front end and chrome bumper as the lesser (Malibu) models, but the smaller vertical rear quarter [...] "opera" [...] windows and a spring-loaded hood ornament were featured. Early '74 Classic coupes required the vinyl roof option; apparently inserts were used to cover part of the big rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window.</b> [...] Later '74s were available with a standard painted roof that included the smaller [...] "opera" [...] window. [...] Inside, the Malibu Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. Optional on Malibu Classic coupes were swivel bucket seats (with console) in cloth or vinyl. [...] The base Deluxe series was dropped for 1974, making the Malibu the base model. Base engines were the 250-cubic-inch six and the 350-cubic-inch V8.|$|E
25|$|As a restyled {{variant of}} the Gremlin, the Spirit {{featured}} distinctly larger rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> while retaining the instrument panel introduced on the 1978, with a wood grain overlay on DL and Limited models.|$|R
50|$|Three-door van: Sold only in Europe. Uses {{the same}} {{bodyshell}} as the three-door hatchback, modified with solid panels {{in place of}} the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> and a flat load floor replacing the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|The EXT {{could be}} {{identified}} by its much straighter rear doors (which were not in-line with the rear wheel arches), {{as well as by}} the circular, metal cap on each of the <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> where the opening mechanism attaches, on the 2003 models only.|$|R
50|$|Two {{body styles}} were available, a 6-light saloon and 4-light sports saloon. The 6-light saloon had a rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to a 6-window saloon) while the 4-light sports saloon had the lack of the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> (sometimes {{referred to a}} 4-window saloon).|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{was designed}} to bear family resemblance to the Nissan Rogue, while still maintaining distinctly Murano cues with an aggressive front fascia and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows.</b> The interior was completely redesigned, {{with the use of}} a more traditional instrument cluster and notably higher-quality materials.|$|R
5000|$|For 1971, the Challenger line up was {{modified}} {{to include a}} new model, the [...] "Challenger Coupe" [...] with either a I6 or V8 engine, and as the most basic version it had fixed in position <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> and a basic black steering wheel with horn button.|$|R
5000|$|A Mark I-A line, {{introduced}} in September 1961, featured a minor restyle with added front <b>quarter</b> <b>windows,</b> intended to [...] "assist the dashboard ventilation". Under the metal, the 1A featured {{modifications to the}} engine mountings and the automatic transmission and hydrosteer variable ratio power steering as an option.|$|R
5000|$|... 5-window — 2-door coupé; {{so named}} for having rear window plus one door window and one <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> {{on each side}} ...|$|E
50|$|In April 1969, the car gained gauge-pack cluster, HD suspension, wider tires; {{adjustable}} seat back (45% of production); bumpers restyled, lower valance panels added; swing-out <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> option (10% of production).|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{distinguished}} by a grille {{that had the}} traditional ox-yoke shape, but also with a then fashionable [...] "shovel" [...] nose. Closed Light Eights had a <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> layout that was not shared by other Packards.|$|E
2500|$|The Barcelona {{included}} numerous {{comfort and}} appearance upgrades {{in addition to}} the extensive standard equipment that came on all Matadors. The special items were: individual reclining seats in velveteen crush fabric with woven accent stripes, custom door trim panels, unique headliner, headlight bezels painted accent color, black trunk carpet, rear sway bar, GR78x15 radial whitewall tires, color-keyed slot styled wheels, body color front and rear bumpers, two-tone paint, landau padded vinyl roof, opera <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> with accents, dual remote control mirrors painted body color, Barcelona medallion on glove box door and fenders, [...] carpeting and bumper nerf strips. The standard roll-down rear <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> were converted into fixed [...] "opera windows" [...] with fiberglass covers over the stock openings that were finished with padded vinyl inside and out.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 MK III had larger rear <b>quarter</b> light <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the pillar nomenclature derived from viewing an automobile in profile, some older cars have a two-part windshield or a split rear window, with the two halves separated by a pillar. Posts for <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> (a smaller window typically between the front window and the windshield) are not considered a named pillar.|$|R
50|$|For 1967, all {{full-sized}} Dodges, the Monaco included, {{received a}} significant facelift with all-new exterior sheet metal. Chief designer Elwood Engel's work featured generally flat body planes with sharp-edged accent lines. The hardtop coupes {{got a new}} semi-fastback roofline with a reverse-slanted trailing edge on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 870 Aero-Eight was {{technically}} {{much the}} same in 1919 but there were now seven bodies to choose from at prices between $2,595 and $3,795 for the new town car and the [...] "Tourcoupe". Some closed bodies got an octagonal rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> as a [...] "beauty" [...] feature. That year, 6,225 Coles were built.|$|E
5000|$|The 968 also {{featured}} numerous small equipment and detail upgrades from the 944, including a Fuba roof-mounted antenna, updated single lens tail lamps, [...] "Cup" [...] style 16" [...] alloy wheels, a wider selection of {{interior and exterior}} colors, and a slightly updated [...] "B" [...] pillar and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>window</b> to accommodate adhesive installation to replace the older rubber gasket installation.|$|E
50|$|The DB6 {{continued}} with then high-tech Armstrong Selectaride cockpit-adjustable rear shock absorbers as {{available on the}} DB5. Other highlights include adopting front-door <b>quarter</b> <b>windows,</b> an oil-cooler air scoop low on the front valance, quarter-bumpers at each corner, revised tail-lamp clusters; additionally the spoiler affected the overall proportions of the DB6, {{with an increase in}} length by approximately two inches.|$|R
50|$|The 219 {{from the}} {{a-pillar}} forward was {{identical to the}} long-nosed 220a, including the single-carburettor 2.2 L 6-cylinder engine. However, from the a-pillar back, it used the shorter body of the W120/W121 180/190 models. This can be identified by the one-piece windows in the rear doors, {{as opposed to the}} 220a and 220S having separate <b>quarter</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{vehicles}} {{also have}} glass that rolls {{down like a}} regular window or have hinged opening vent <b>quarter</b> <b>windows</b> for rear seat passengers. This may be a side window between the B-pillar and the C-pillar, {{and in the case}} of US minivans between the C and D-pillars (examples include the Chrysler Town and Country power-operated venting glass).|$|R
