40|$|A {{generic drug}} product (World Health Organization (WHO) terminology: multisource product) is usually marketed and {{manufactured}} after {{the expiry date}} of the innovator’s patent. Generic drugs are less expensive than the innovator products because generic manufacturers {{do not have to}} amortize the investment costs of research, development, marketing, and promotion. Multisource products must contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as the original formulation and have to be shown to be interchangeable with the original formulation. Multisource products have to be shown bioequivalent to the innovator counterpart with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Multisource products are therefore identical in dose, strength, route of administration, safety, efficacy, and intended use. Bioequivalence can be demonstrated by in vitro dissolution, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or clinical studies. Since 2000, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows the approval of certain multisource products {{solely on the basis of}} in vitro studies, i. e. by waiving in vivo studies in humans (“Biowaiver”), based on the Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme (BCS). The BCS characterizes APIs by their solubility and permeability in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The different BCS Classes I-IV (Class I: high solubility, high permeability; Class II: low solubility, high permeability; Class III: high solubility, low permeability and Class IV: low solubility, low permeability) result from all possible combinations of high and low solubility with high and low permeability. Since the adoption of the BCS by the FDA in 1995, the BCS criteria have been under continuous development. In 2006, the WHO has released the most recent bioequivalence guidance including relaxed criteria for bioequivalence studies based on modified BCS criteria. According to this guidance, APIs belonging to the BCS classes I – and under defined conditions - II and III – are eligible for a biowaiver-based approval. The principal objective of this work was to characterize the first-line anti tuberculosis APIs, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol dihydrochloride and rifampicin, according to their physicochemical, biopharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties and to classify them according to the BCS. Ethambutol dihydrochloride and isoniazid were classified as borderline BCS class I/III APIs. Pyrazinamide was classified as a BCS class III and rifampicin as a BCS class II API. Based on the BCS classification and the additional criteria defined in the WHO bioequivalence guidance, the possibility of biowaiver-based approval for immediate release (immediate release) solid oral dosage forms containing the first-line antituberculosis drugs was evaluated. A biowaiver-based approval with defined constraints was recommended for immediate release solid oral dosage forms containing isoniazid (interaction with reducing sugars), pyrazinamide and ethambutol dihydrochloride (relative narrow therapeutic index). Rifampicin was classified as a BCS class II API, and it was concluded that rifampicin containing solid oral immediate release drug products as well as Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes (SUPAC) changes should not be approved by a biowaiver on the following basis: (i) its solubility and dissolution are highly variable due to polymorphism and instability, (ii) concomitant intake of food and antacids reduces its absorption and bioavailability, (iii) no in vitro predictive dissolution test has been found which correlates to in vivo absorption and (iv) several publications reporting cases of non-bioequivalent and bioinequivalent rifampicin products have been located in the literature. Thus, it is recommended that bioequivalence of rifampicin containing solid oral immediate release drug products should be established by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in humans. This risk-benefit benefit assessment of a biowaiver-based approval was presented as a poster at the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) 2005 and subsequently published as “Biowaiver Monographs” in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Based on the assessment of the dissolution properties of the antituberculosis drugs for a biowaiver approval, quality control dissolution methodologies for the International Pharmacopoeia (Pharm. Int.) were developed, presented at the WHO expert meeting and adopted in the Pharm. Int. ([URL] Additionally, preliminary biowaiver recommendations were also developed for four firstline antimalarial drugs listed on the WHO Essential Medicines List (EML) : Quinine, as both the hydrochloride and sulphate, and proguanil hydrochloride were classified as borderline BCS class I/III APIs. Since quinine is a narrow therapeutic index drug and many cases of non-bioequivalence have been reported in the literature, a biowaiverbased approval was not recommended. For solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing proguanil a biowaiver-based approval was recommended under the condition that they dissolve very rapidly. Primaquine phosphate was classified as a BCS class I API. Therefore, a biowaiver-based approval was recommended for immediate release solid oral dosage forms containing primaquine phosphate. Mefloquine hydrochloride was classified as a basic, BCS class IV/II API, making it ineligible for the biowaiver. Additionally, reports of non-bioequivalence and a narrow therapeutic index were found in the scientific literature. Consequently, bioequivalence of solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing mefloquine hydrochloride should be established by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. The results for <b>quinine</b> hydrochloride and <b>sulphate,</b> proguanil hydrochloride, primaquine diphosphate and mefloquine hydrochloride were presented as a poster at the Pharmaceutical Sciences World Congress (PSWC) 2007 and published as a WHO Collaborating Center Report in June 2006. The aim of this project was to collect, evaluate, generate and publish relevant information for a biowaiver-based approval of essential medicines in order to provide a summary to local regulatory authorities. This information complements the selected list of essential medicines by providing information about the biopharmaceutical properties and pharmaceutical quality of solid oral immediate release dosage forms containing these APIs. The aim of the biowaiver project, inspired by the WHO and brought in life by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), is to enable access to essential medicines in standardized quality at an affordable price. In this work, a significant contribution to this aim in the form of four biowaiver monographs for the antituberculosis drugs and several reports on the antimalarials has been achieved. Nach Ablauf des Patentes der Erstzulassung eines Arzneistoffes (Originalpräparat) mit etablierter Wirksamkeit, Sicherheit und Qualität ist es erlaubt, Nachahmerpräparate (Generika) mit diesem Arzneistoff zuzulassen. Als Generikum bezeichnet man ein Arzneimittel, welches den gleichen Wirkstoff eines bereits auf dem Markt befindlichen Medikaments enthält. Von dem Originalpräparat kann sich das Generikum bezüglich der enthaltenen Hilfsstoffen und der Herstellungstechnologie unterscheiden, muss aber dem Originalpräparat in dessen beanspruchter/n Indikation(en) äquivalent sein. Üblicherweise werden Generika mittels einer bezugnehmenden Arzneimittelzulassung zugelassen. Dabei muss Bioäquivalenz zum Orginalpräparat gezeigt werden. Zwei Produkte bezeichnet man als bioäquivalent, wenn eine äquivalente Bioverfügbarkeit beider Präparate, welche den identischen Wirkstoff enthalten, mittels geeigneter Testmethoden nachgewiesen wurde. Derartige Testmethoden wurden in den Bioäquivalenzrichtlinien unter anderem der US-amerikanischen Behörde für Lebensmittel- und Arzneimittelsicherheit (FDA) 7, der Europäischen Arzneimittelagentur (EMEA) 8 und der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) 19 festgelegt. Diese Testmethoden können vergleichende pharmakokinetische, pharmakodynamische oder klinische Studien im Menschen sein. Dabei muss laut der Bioäquivalenzrichtlinie z. B. der WHO der 90 -%-Vertrauensbereich des Quotienten der für die zu vergleichenden Kenngrößen, meistens Cmax und AUC, ermittelten durchschnittlichen Werte für Testprodukt und Originalprodukt innerhalb fest definierter Grenzen liegen (üblicherweise 80 – 125 %). Die Auswahl der Kenngrößen und das Studiendesign hängen unter anderem von der Indikation und der Darreichungsform des Arzneimittels ab. Alternativ können, unter bestimmten Bedingungen, diese Bioäquivalenzstudien im Menschen durch in vitro Freisetzungsstudien ersetzt und somit das Zulassungsverfahren vereinfacht und beschleunigt werden. Dieses vereinfachte Zulassungsverfahren, bei dem Studien im Menschen ausgesetzt „waived“ werden, wird als Biowaiver-Zulassung bezeichnet. [...] ...|$|R

Salt intake has been shown to alter quinidine bioavailability. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic properties of oral <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (600 mg salt) were investigated in seven healthy Caucasian volunteers, in a randomised, crossover study, on low- and high-salt diets. Plasma quinine concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the 24 -h urinary sodium excretion was assayed. RESULTS: Although the 24 -h urine sodium excretion was significantly higher when the volunteers were on a high-salt diet, there were no significant differences in quinine AUC 0 -infinity, tmax, and Cmax after the two diets. The median (range) quinine elimination half-life was significantly shorter after a high-salt diet [8. 5 (4. 3 - 10. 2) h] than after a low-salt diet [10. 0 (7. 6 - 14. 8) h] (P = 0. 04).

40|$|Background: The {{relatively}} little resistance to quinine globally {{has led to}} an increase in its use in P. falciparum malaria especially in multi-drug resistant strains. Objective: To evaluate the physicochemical and equivalency of three brands of <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> tablets available in South Western region of Nigeria. Methods: The pharmaceutical and chemical equivalence of three brands of <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> tablets were assessed through the evaluation of some biopharmaceutical parameters and active drug content. Results: All the brands complied with the official specification for uniformity of weight. Two of the brands (A & B) gave similar crushing strengths while the third brand (C) gave a much lower value. Similarly all the brands complied with the official specification of disintegration test but the obtained values were statistically different (p< 0. 05). The T 70 obtained from the dissolution rate profile was less than 45 minutes for the three brands, although A and B were not statistically different but C was statistically from A and B. The quinine content of brands B and C are within the official specification however brand A with percentage content of 110 ± 1. 3 %w/w, is above the specification while it is statistically different from the other brands.

The Forms I and II depict endo/exo events suggesting conversion of metastable low melting forms to higher melting and stable form indicated by sharp melting endotherms. The low melting form IL {{is found to be}} monotropically related to high melting Form IH while low melting Form IIL is enantiotropically related to high melting Form IIH. The Form III and IV showed broad endotherms accompanied by mass loss in TGA prior to melting indicating the existence of solvatomorphism.

The enthalpy of solution was found to be endothermic for all the forms which followed the order: Form O > Form II > Form III > Form I > Form IV and is further related to the lattice energy suggesting Form II to be least crystalline. The solubility for Form II was found to be highest with maximum release rate in dissolution studies.

We present a case series illustrating an association between imatinib, relative hypocalcaemia, {{and the development of}} cramps. Patients. The index patient developed muscle spasms and cramps after receiving imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) for 5 months. The adjusted serum calcium had dropped to the lower limit of normal. The low serum calcium and muscle cramps improved on stopping imatinib and recurred on rechallenge.

FTIR, 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis {{have been used}} to characterize the structures of the new nine pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidine derivates. Absorption and fluorescence spectra have been recorded. The appropriate solvent for the photoluminescence properties of the studied compounds {{has been found to be}} chloroform:acetonitrile mixture (1 : 1). The main spectral features such as molar extinction coefficients (ε), Stokes shifts, quantum yields using <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> as standard, fluorescence quenching in the presence of benzoquinone and Stern-Volmer constants have been calculated. The substituent effects on intensity of absorption, maximum absorbance wavelengths and fluorescence parameters have been discussed. The highest quantum yield value was found for ethyl 3 -(4 -biphenylyl) - 7 -(3, 4 -dimethoxybenzoyl) pyrrolo[1, 2 -c]pyrimidine- 5 -carboxylate (0. 55). The obtained results suggest that the studied compounds are promising candidates for future study in order to evaluate their use in practical applications in fluorescent chemical sensors...|$|E
40|$|Incessant malaria {{endemicity}} {{in the tropics}} and subtropical regions and the recent work done on the synthesis of metal drug complexes of antimalarial drugs and the evaluation of their antimalarial activities in vitro, {{has led to the}} development of this study. Quinine-Zinc complex (QZ) was synthesized using a modification of Singla and Wadhwa method. Melting point determination, TLC analysis, infra red, ultra violet, atomic absorption spectroscopy and mole ratio determination were all carried out on the complex synthesized. Direct measurement of the antimalarial activity of the potential new drug (QZ) against parasite growth in vitro was used to comparatively ascertain the antimalarial activity of QZ relative to <b>Quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> (QS). Measurement of antimalarial activity was carried out based on the inhibition of parasite growth with respect to inhibition of schizont formation in freshly collected infected blood samples from patients. The results showed that QZ complex was formed and its antimalarial activity was three times that of QS alone. This study suggests that the quinine-zinc complex could have a better therapeutic activity than quinine...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of {{a single}} dose (600 mg) of <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> were examined {{in a group of}} non-smokers (n = 10) and in heavy cigarette smokers (n = 10). The mean (+/- s. d.) oral clearance of quinine in smokers (0. 189 +/- 0. 075 1 h(- 1) kg(- 1)) was significantly greater than in non-smokers (0. 107 +/- 0. 045 1 h(- 1) kg(- 1), P < 0. 01). The unbound clearance of quinine which reflects activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme, was considerably greater (1. 5 -fold) in the smokers than in the non-smoker subjects. The mean elimination half-life of quinine in smokers was 7. 5 +/- 1. 4 (s. d.) h, significantly shorter (P < 0. 005) than the mean value in non-smokers (12. 0 +/- 3. 1 h). These results suggest that cigarette smoking enhances the elimination of quinine. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown but they indicate the need for caution in the administration of quinine to patients who are heavy cigarette smokers...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of quinine from cinchona bark in 1820 opened new {{possibilities for the}} mass-production and consumption of a popular medicine that was suitable {{for the treatment of}} intermittent (malarial) fevers and other diseases. As the 19 th century European empires expanded in Africa and Asia, control of tropical diseases such as malaria was seen as crucial. Consequently, quinine and cinchona became a pivotal tool of British, French, German and Dutch empire-builders. This comparative study shows how the interplay between science, industry and government resulted in different historical trajectories for cinchona and quinine in the Dutch and British Empires {{during the second half of}} the 19 th century. We argue that in the Dutch case the vectors of assemblage that provided the institutional and physical framework for communication, exchange and control represent an early example of commodification of colonial science. Furthermore, both historical trajectories show how the employment of the laboratory as a new device materialised within the colonial context of agricultural and industrial production of raw materials (cinchona bark), semi-finished product (<b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate)</b> and plant-based medicines like quinine. Hence, illustrating the 19 th century transition from 'colonial botany' and 'green imperialism' to what we conceptualise as 'colonial agro-industrialism'...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To assess quantitatively the {{efficacy}} of quinine (as <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate)</b> compared with placebo {{in the treatment of}} nocturnal leg cramps. DESIGN [...] A meta-analysis of six randomised, double blind, crossover trials. SETTING [...] Randomised trials that were available as of April 1994. SUBJECTS [...] A total of 107 general ambulatory patients who suffered from regular nocturnal leg cramps from six clinical trials. RESULTS [...] Data from individual patients were used to calculate point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for each of the outcome measures reported by these studies. Treatment with quinine resulted in a significant {{reduction in the number of}} cramps for a four week period compared with placebo (8. 83 fewer cramps; 95 % confidence interval 4. 16 to 13. 49). Treatment with quinine reduced the number of nights with cramps by 27. 4 % (24. 0 % to 30. 8 %) compared with placebo. Treatment did not produce a significant change in the severity or duration of individual nocturnal leg cramps. Side effects were uncommon. CONCLUSIONS [...] The results indicate that quinine can prevent nocturnal leg cramps in general ambulatory populations. Given the possible serious side effects of treatment with quinine, the benefits and risks in patients taking this drug should be closely monitored...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of quinine after {{a single}} 600 mg oral dose of <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> were studied in seven female subjects who used oral contraceptives and in seven age-matched female controls who did not. There {{were no significant}} differences (P greater than 0. 05) in the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time of peak concentration (tmax) between the subjects who used oral contraceptives (Cmax = 5. 3 +/- 1. 0 (s. d.) mg l- 1; tmax = 1. 4 +/- 0. 7 h) and the control subjects (Cmax = 5. 6 +/- 0. 9 mg l- 1; tmax = 2. 1 +/- 0. 9 h). The mean elimination half-life of quinine in the oral contraceptives user group (12. 5 +/- 1. 9 h) was similar (P greater than 0. 05) to that in the control group (11. 8 +/- 2. 7 h). The oral clearance of quinine in the oral contraceptive user group was 0. 133 +/- 0. 055 l h- 1 kg- 1 (range 0. 073 - 0. 233) and was not significantly different (P greater than 0. 05) from that observed in the control group (0. 125 +/- 0. 025 l h- 1 kg- 1, range 0. 075 - 0. 148) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{statement}} made by Sollmann (1) that quinine; quinidine, cinchonine, and cinchonidine produce {{muscular depression}} with dilute solutions and toxic rigor with more concentrated solutions is apparently based mainly upon work done with isolated nerve-muscle preparations of the frog. Piccinini (2, 3) investigated {{the effects of}} quinine on the frog nerve-muscle preparation {{and also in the}} intact frog. He reported that small doses increased the muscle response. Smith and Fantus (4) working with frogs reported that the tetanus response to nerve faradization was changed to a single twitch response after quinine, although the muscle still responded fully to direct stimulation. Vondracek (5) ran ergographic and dynamometer experiments on a group of soldiers and concluded that quinine increased the muscle work not so much through direct muscle action but through action on the central nervous mechanism. The recent report of Kolb, Harvey and Whitehall (6) in which <b>quinine</b> <b>sulphate</b> abolished the myotonus of myotonia atrophica but had no effect on mus-cular strength indicates that in the myotonic patient no depression ‘Since the preparation of this article, an abstract in the proceedings of the xvi International Physiological Congresses on The Actions of Quinine on Skeletal Muscle by A.
