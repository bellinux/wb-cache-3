5000|$|Mexico {{brings the}} {{complaint}} through GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) dispute resolution system utilizing the WTO committee {{arguing that the}} US MMPA product ban on tuna imports was inconsistent with the provisions of GATT. Mexico argues through WTO panel dispute resolution mechanism that the import prohibition was inconsistent with Article XI, Article XIII, Article III of GATT. Mexico also claimed that the embargo {{did not meet the}} exceptions of Article XX. Article III refers to the National treatment provision and the fact that countries must apply tariffs equally to similar products of all other contracting parties. This also brings to debate the Product vs. process debate. Also known as PPM's (Process and Production Methods), referring to desire of some countries to regulate international trade on like for like goods {{on the basis of their}} process technologies or harvesting techniques in this case. Although the intention of the embargo is to bring to light the externalities of dolphin casualties due to the purse-seine harvesting techniques, the issue of PPMs is that the process is irrelevant if the product is the same. Developing countries have historically been wary of including PPM's in the WTO. The fear being that this will create an imposition of environmental, technological and other <b>qualitative</b> <b>standards</b> with high thresholds set by industrialized countries thus creating a technical disadvantage for developing countries. Essentially what Mexico argues is that MMPA is discriminating against like products based on their production methods. Article XI addresses the quantitative restriction provision which involves the dispute over embargoes vs. tariffs. Article XI says that a country is permitted to impose tariffs as a trade restriction but prohibits any type of non-tariff restriction such as quotas or limiting importing/ exporting licenses. Further, Mexico argues the Article XX provision of GATT is inconsistent with that of the MMPA. Specifically Article XX(b) and XX(g) which refer to the allowance of trade restrictions when it is deemed [...] "necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health" [...] or [...] "relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources". The issue with Article XX is that even while it may be valid, it cannot be applied outside the jurisdiction of the United States, hence making the argument in the favor of Mexico. The outcome of this challenge fell in the favor of Mexico however these findings were not adopted formally due to the upcoming NAFTA negotiations, however the argument was revisited in the Dolphin Tuna II case in 1992.|$|E

40|$|Casting is an {{economical}} way {{to manufacture}} parts.

This conservatism in utilization is due, in part, to the traditional limitations in evaluation technology for castings.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the remediation of water containing the insecticide chlorpyrifos by using constructed wetlands (CW) cultivated with Polygonum punctatum, Cynodon spp. and Mentha aquatica, operated under different hydraulic retention times: 24, 48, 96, 144 and 192 h. The system efficiency was based on reduction of the initial concentration of chlorpyrifos and toxicity of the contaminated water. The results showed that constructed wetlands are an excellent alternative for remediation of the insecticide chlorpyrifos in aqueous medium. It was observed that the average overall removal efficiency of the insecticide was 98. 6 %, and in the first hydraulic retention time, 24 h, chlorpyrifos was removed to levels below the detection limit in all CW. This result is mainly attributed to adsorption and microbial degradation. For the <b>qualitative</b> <b>standard</b> acute toxicity tests with Daphnia similis, for most samples there was a reduction in toxicity greater than 80 %. It was reported that the ecotoxicological tests with the effluents of the constructed wetland are a good option as an indicator of the effectiveness of treatments and a promising alternative to complement the physical and chemical analyses...|$|R

40|$|The {{productivity}} of sugar beet is strongly limited by several biotic stresses, among them rhizomania (induced by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus, BNYVV) which causes yield losses of 20 – 50 % or more. The {{only way to}} control this disease {{is the use of}} resistant varieties. Sources of resistances have been found in the ancestor of the cultivated beets Beta vulgaris L. ssp. maritima (L.) Arcang. Rz 1 is the major resistance gene present within commercial sugar beet varieties. This resistance was recognized as monogenic and dominant. Experimental evidence highlighted that Rz 1 originated from sea beets belonging to Munerati’s genetic pool. The development of molecular markers linked to Rz 1 allows the use of marker assisted selection (MAS) to introgress this gene into pollinator lines, to assess the trueness of hybridity and to remove off-type individuals. MAS speeds variety development and reduces production costs guaranteeing {{at the same time a}} high <b>qualitative</b> <b>standard</b> in variety development. Recent studies have shown an emergence of new BNYVV strains with increased virulence that could overcome Rz 1 resistance.

Despite their relative abundance and short distribution range, the biostratigraphic potential of these taxa is as yet unknown, mainly due to relevant taxonomic difficulties. The complexity of the test and the canal system in the Rotaliidae and the necessity to investigate specimens from thin sections are the most common obstacles to investigate in detail these taxa. In the light of these difficulties, systematic description at the high <b>qualitative</b> <b>standard</b> level normally achieved in larger foraminifera may seem a daunting or unfeasible task. From these considerations arises the necessity to recognize provisionally flexible operative criteria, in order to establish working hypotheses for employing these taxa.

Consequently, we present a selection of rotaliid taxa from the Maiella Mt.
