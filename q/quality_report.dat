25|$|In the California Healthcare <b>Quality</b> <b>Report</b> Card 2013 Edition, Kaiser Permanente's Northern California and Southern California regions, Kaiser {{received}} {{four out}} of four possible stars in Meeting National Standards of Care. Kaiser North and South also received {{three out of four}} stars in Members Rate Their HMO. KP's performance has been attributed to three practices: First, KP places a strong emphasis on preventive care, reducing costs later on. Second, its doctors are salaried rather than paid per service, which removes the main incentive for doctors to perform unnecessary procedures. Thirdly, KP attempts to minimize the time patients spend in high-cost hospitals by carefully planning their stay and by shifting care to outpatient clinics. This practice results in lower costs per member, cost savings for KP and greater doctor attention to patients. A comparison to the UK's National Health Service found that patients spend 2–5 times as much time in NHS hospitals as compared to KP hospitals.|$|E

40|$|Context: Poorly written {{radiology}} {{reports are}} common among residents {{and are a}} significant challenge for radiology education. While training may improve <b>report</b> <b>quality,</b> a professionally developed reliable and valid scale to measure <b>report</b> <b>quality</b> does not exist. Objectives: To develop a measurement tool for <b>report</b> <b>quality,</b> the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale, with rigorous validation through empirical data. Methods: A research team of an experienced psychometrician and six senior radiologists conducted qualitative and quantitative studies. Five items were identified for the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale, each measuring a distinct aspect of <b>report</b> <b>quality.</b> Two dedicated training sessions were designed and implemented to help residents generate high-quality reports. In a blinded fashion, the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale was applied to 804 randomly selected reports issued before (n[*]=[*] 403) and after (n[*]=[*] 401) training. Full-scale psychometrical assessments were implemented onto the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale’s item- and scale-scores from the <b>reports.</b> The <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale scores were correlated with report professionalism and attendings’ preference and were compared pre-/post-training. Results: The <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale showed sound psychometrical properties, with high validity and reliability. <b>Reports</b> with higher <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale score were more professional and preferable by attendings. Training improved the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale score, empirically validating the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale further. Conclusion: While succinct and practitioner friendly, the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale is a reliable and valid measure of radiology <b>report</b> <b>quality</b> and {{has the potential to}} be easily adapted to other fields such as pathology, where similar training would be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Quality</b> <b>reporting</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} tool to encourage health systems, hospitals, and their practitioners to deliver the greatest health benefit. However, <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> systems may have unintended negative consequences, such as inadvertently encouraging “cherry-picking” by inadequately adjusting for patients who are challenging to take care of, or underpowering to reliably detect meaningful differences in care. There have been no reports seeking to identify a minimum level of accuracy that ought to be viewed as a prerequisite for <b>quality</b> <b>reporting.</b> Method: Using a decision analytic model, we seek to delineate minimal standards for quality measures to meet, using the simplest assumptions to illustrate what those standards may be. Results: We find that even under assumptions regarding optimal performance of the <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> system (sensitivity and specificity of 1), we can identify a minimal level of accuracy required for the <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> system to “do no harm”: the increase in health-related quality of life from a higher rather than lower quality practitioner must be greater than the number of practitioners per patient divided by the proportion of patients willing to switch from a lower to a higher quality provider. Conclusion: Quality measurement systems that have not been demonstrated to improve health outcomes should be held to a specific standard of measurement accuracy...|$|R
