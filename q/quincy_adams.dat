5|$|When Mexico won its {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the United States did not contest the new republic's claims to Texas, and both presidents John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> (1825–1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) persistently sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government, without success.|$|E
5|$|As president, John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> and released.|$|E

5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E

5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
5|$|Prescott began formal {{schooling}} {{at the age}} of seven, studying under Mr. Jacob Knapp. The {{family moved}} to Boston, Massachusetts in 1808, where his father's earnings substantially increased. His studies continued under Dr. John Gardiner, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church. As a young man, Prescott frequented the Boston Athenæum, which at the time held the 10,000-volume private library of John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> who was on a diplomatic mission to Russia. In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15years.|$|E
5|$|Seward {{originally}} {{supported the}} Regency, but by 1824 had broken from it, concluding it was corrupt. He {{became part of}} the Anti-Masonic Party, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; he was most likely killed by fellow Masons for publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E

5|$|Stevens's first {{political}} {{cause was}} Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance {{and death of}} William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E
5|$|With {{the roads}} {{becoming}} impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City {{for the winter}} of 1824–25, and thus {{was there for the}} climax of the hotly contested 1824 election, in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives. On 9 February 1825, that body selected Secretary of State John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> as president; that evening, the runner-up, General Andrew Jackson, shook hands with Adams at the White House as Lafayette looked on.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{began his}} {{political}} career in the House of Representatives. As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction, Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against British infractions of American independence and neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars. He then served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe, and in this position reorganized and modernized the War Department. Calhoun was {{a candidate for the}} presidency in the 1824 election. After failing to gain support, he let his name be put forth as a candidate for vice president. The Electoral College elected Calhoun for vice president by an overwhelming majority. He served under John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> and continued under Andrew Jackson, who defeated Adams in the election of 1828.|$|E

50|$|Built about 1840, {{the house}} is a fine local example of Greek Revival architecture.

Charles Adams was a farmer, state legislator, {{and one of the first}} tenants of Boston's <b>Quincy</b> Market. <b>Adams</b> gave land for a schoolhouse on Broadway (now the site of the Winter Hill Congregational Church). Woodbury Locke, a later resident, was involved in the leather business in Boston.|$|R
5000|$|The Adams County Courthouse {{is located}} in Corning, Iowa, United States. <b>Quincy</b> was <b>Adams</b> County's first county seat, and a frame {{building}} was built for a courthouse in the 1850s.

5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a predilection for wine. His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief. He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death. Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia. His epitaph was written by John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams.</b> The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Letcher's {{family came}} to Kentucky around 1800. Letcher {{attended}} the private academy of Joshua Fry, then studied law. He was briefly a judge advocate in John Allen's volunteer militia during the War of 1812. He began {{his political career}} in 1813, representing Garrard County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. In 1823, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for more than a decade. During the 1824 presidential election, he acted as an intermediary between John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams</b> and Henry Clay. Adams' opponent, Andrew Jackson, charged that, through these negotiations, Clay agreed to support Adams for president in exchange for being named Secretary of State.|$|E
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John <b>Quincy</b> <b>Adams,</b> an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further impeachment proceedings in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
