5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held. The concept for the celebration was confusing to church members {{as it was}} unclear what the 50th anniversary was honoring. Groberg was not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> himself. However, several years prior to his appointment as mission president, Groberg received inspiration that he would preside over the mission in Tonga and hold a 50th anniversary jubilee during his term. A {{few months before the}} celebration, which was scheduled for November, Groberg received a letter from the widow of Tonga's first mission president. In the letter, she shared that the mission's first conference was held in November 1918. The anniversary of the Tonga's first mission-wide conference became the reason for the jubilee.|$|E

25|$|Further explanation: Speakers who {{use this}} {{intonation}} pattern {{do not do}} so categorically, but instead also end many questions with a rising pitch. Such speakers typically use falling pitch for yes/no questions for which they already are <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> of the answer. So, a speaker uttering the above example is simply confirming what they think they already know, that yes, the person they're talking to is painting his/her garage.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} U.S. {{military}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, unprecedented in peacetime, caused concern in some circles, primarily as to the potential effect of maintaining such a large force in a democratic society. Some predicted disaster and were concerned with the growing militarization of American society. These writers were <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> that a distinctly military culture was inherently dangerous to a non-militaristic liberal society. Others warned that the ascendancy of the military establishment would fundamentally change American foreign policy and would weaken the intellectual fabric of the country. However, most of the arguments were less apocalyptic and settled along two tracks. The two tracks are highlighted, respectively, by Samuel P. Huntington's Soldier and the State and Morris Janowitz's The Professional Soldier.|$|E
25|$|Exactly {{how and why}} did Merezhkovsky {{found himself}} on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting Nina Berberova) was blaming her own {{secretary}} Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man {{to come to the}} studio {{in the early days of}} the Nazi invasion into the USSR. In his speech (if its printed version entitled Bolshevism and Humanity is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to Joan of Arc, called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s:Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.|$|E

25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

"Dear Lucy, Your letter gave {{me quite}} a shock, fancy you wanting to draw four pounds {{to buy a}} brooch, ring, bangle, work basket, tea set, etc, etc. [...] I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> Mrs. Henry would expend the money {{carefully}} for you, but I {{must tell you that}} no Aborigine can draw 4/5 of their wages unless they are sick and in hospital and require the money to buy comforts...

500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I was terribly unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeremy sucks his sore fingers, but a trout {{rises from}} the water and seizes him with a snap (Mr. Jeremy screams, [...] "OW-OW-OW!!!"). The trout dives to the bottom, but finds the Macintosh {{tasteless}} and spits Jeremy out, swallowing only his goloshes. Jeremy bounces [...] "up {{to the surface of}} the water, like a cork and the bubbles out of a soda water bottle", and swims to the pond's edge. He scrambles up the bank and hops home through the meadow, having lost his fishing equipment but <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> he will never go fishing again.|$|E

500|$|Like James, Anne later {{supported}} a Catholic match for both their sons, and her correspondence {{with the potential}} bride, the Spanish Infanta, Maria Anna, included a request that two friars be sent to Jerusalem to pray for her and the King. The papacy itself was never <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> where Anne stood; in 1612, Pope Paul V advised a nuncio: [...] "Not considering the inconstancy of that Queen and the many changes she had made in religious matters and that even if it might be true {{that she might be}} a Catholic, one should not take on oneself any judgement." ...|$|E
500|$|The Smithsonian Institution has {{categorized}} The Quest as both {{abstract and}} figurative. In 2002, journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a [...] "large tangle of snow-white bodies in a fountain". She {{wrote that the}} work is privately owned but in public view, {{and that it has}} been around [...] "long enough that no one is <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> how it got there in the first place". As of 1990, The Quest was considered Portland's largest single piece of white sculptured marble. It was surveyed and considered [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in January 1994. Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure's nose.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{decided to}} release the film under their Touchstone Pictures banner because they thought the film would be [...] "too dark and scary for kids", Selick remembered. [...] "Their biggest fear, and why {{it was kind of}} a stepchild project, [...] they were afraid of their core {{audience}} hating the film and not coming." [...] To convey Burton's' involvement and attract a wider audience, Disney marketed the film as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Burton explained that,"...it turned more into more of a brand-name thing, it turned into something else, which I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> about." [...] The film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, and was given a limited release on October 15, 1993, before its wide theatrical release on October 29.|$|E
6000|$|... "I kenned it. Ye'll no be gettin' any {{machine to}} tak' ye there. They'll be sending a {{carriage}} for ye--if ye're EXPECTED." [...] He glanced half doubtfully at the consul {{as if he}} was not <b>quite</b> so <b>sure</b> of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] {{answered}} Sewell, who smiled again. [...] "Most of them are, however, {{capable of}} improvement. I am <b>quite</b> as <b>sure</b> {{of that as}} ever. The question is, whether anybody would gain much if it were effected too rudely." ...|$|R

500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> if that's how I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is obviously very complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> {{how they feel about}} the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{judge was}} not <b>quite</b> so <b>sure</b> {{as he had}} been once. However, he said nothing of his doubts to Madeline. [...] "Mr. Graham's task on that account will only be the more trying if it becomes {{difficult}} to establish her innocence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm not <b>quite</b> so <b>sure</b> about you," [...] he observed, {{watching}} the colour rise quickly in her cheeks. [...] "Off {{with you to}} dress, young woman. It's past seven, and we must be there early. I still have the wine to order." ...|$|R
60|$|Jeff did {{not feel}} <b>quite</b> so <b>sure</b> on that point, for he had counted on a long tete-a-tete with his old friend. He took care, however, to conceal his disappointment, and before {{he had time to}} reply, the door opened with a crash.|$|R
