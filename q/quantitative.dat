5|$|<b>Quantitative</b> {{chemicals}} {{are those that}} are present in high concentration in plants (5 – 40% dry weight) and are equally effective against all specialists and generalist herbivores. Most <b>quantitative</b> metabolites are digestibility reducers that make plant cell walls indigestible to animals. The effects of <b>quantitative</b> metabolites are dosage dependent and the higher these chemicals’ proportion in the herbivore’s diet, the less nutrition the herbivore can gain from ingesting plant tissues. Because they are typically large molecules, these defenses are energetically expensive to produce and maintain, and often take longer to synthesize and transport.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing <b>quantitative</b> easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising <b>quantitative</b> easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising <b>quantitative</b> easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for <b>quantitative</b> easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

5|$|<b>Quantitative</b> {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In <b>quantitative</b> research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

5|$|The Accounting Review was {{established}} in 1926. In its early decades, the journal tended to publish articles that would {{be of interest to}} accounting practitioners, but over time it shifted towards a preference for <b>quantitative</b> model building and mathematical rigor. In the 1980s the AAA began to publish two other journals, Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons, that were more relevant to accounting educators and accounting practitioners respectively, to allow The Accounting Review to focus more heavily on <b>quantitative</b> articles.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', <b>quantitative</b> and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a <b>quantitative</b> study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both <b>quantitative</b> and qualitative studies. <b>Quantitative</b> research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best <b>quantitative</b> studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{economic}} traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in <b>quantitative</b> genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling <b>quantitative</b> traits. As the <b>quantitative</b> trait loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 <b>quantitative</b> traits have been mapped in nine crop species. In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the central}} criticisms of Gestaltism {{are based on the}} {{preference}} Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of <b>quantitative</b> research supporting Gestalt ideas.

25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling <b>quantitative</b> analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the <b>quantitative</b> operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented <b>quantitative</b> analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV <b>quantitative</b> analyst would typically earn a fraction of <b>quantitative</b> analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E

25|$|In sales & trading, <b>quantitative</b> analysts work to {{determine}} prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically {{this was a}} distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk <b>quantitative</b> analyst and a <b>quantitative</b> trader is increasingly blurred, {{and it is now}} difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some <b>quantitative</b> analysis education. In the field of algorithmic trading it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.|$|E
