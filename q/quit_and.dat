The Browns had offered him a part-time coaching job but made clear {{that he could not}} stay on as offensive coordinator; Jones declined the reduced role. After leaving the Browns, Jones moved back to Ruston and did occasional scouting for the team at the nearby Grambling State University. He was also a volunteer coach of receivers on Grambling's football team. Later in life, he worked for his son Tom's general contracting business in Ruston.|$|E
5|$|Grace's (Debra Messing) {{pregnancy}} prompts Karen (Megan Mullally) {{to have a}} baby of her own. She pays a surrogate, Cricket (Wanda Sykes), {{to carry}} her child. Grace, who is bewildered at the idea of Karen having a baby, suspects that the only reason is that she is having one. Karen, however, dismisses the idea. Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> Karen revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether or not there exists a meaningful economic distinction between <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> layoffs has attracted considerable attention. This paper utilizes a recent test proposed by J. S. Cramer and G. Ridder (1991) to test formally whether <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> layoffs may legitimately be aggregated into a single undifferentiated job-mover category. The paper also estimates wage equations for job stayers, <b>quits,</b> <b>and</b> layoffs, corrected for the endogeneity of job mobility. The major results are that <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> lay-off cannot legitimately be pooled and correction for sample selection would appear to be important. ...|$|R

Differences between <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> layoffs over the life and business cycles and across demographic groups are generated by differential rates of general productivity growth. The standard approach to <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> layoffs, based on wage rigidity, is shown to be incapable of accounting {{for many of the}} empirical regularities. Although a formal test rejects a structural prediction of the efficient turnover model, the specification does well in predicting both the level of, and time-series variation in, the fraction of separations labeled quits.

5|$|ABC aired another series {{featuring}} the Hardy Boys, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, from 1977 to 1979. The prime time series starred Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy as Frank and Joe Hardy; Pamela Sue Martin and later Janet Louise Johnson played Nancy Drew. During the first season, the series alternated between episodes {{featuring the}} Hardy Boys one week and Nancy Drew the next. The Hardy Boys were cast as young adults (Stevenson and Cassidy were twenty-four and eighteen respectively {{during the filming}} of the first episodes) {{to appeal to a}} prime time television audience. The series featured original plots as well as ones based on Hardy Boys books, among them The Clue of the Screeching Owl, The Disappearing Floor and The Flickering Torch Mystery. The series received an Emmy nomination and featured a number of guest stars, including Kim Cattrall, Ray Milland, Howard Duff, and Ricky Nelson. During the second season, the series format changed to focus more on the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew appearing mostly in crossover episodes with the brothers; midway through production of the second season, Martin <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> was replaced by Johnson. The series returned for a third season, dropping the Nancy Drew character completely and shortening its title to The Hardy Boys.|$|E

Donna's is negative, but Bridget discovers that she is pregnant. Donna's younger siblings, Simon and Tegan, arrive in Ramsay Street and their mother, Cassandra, follows not long after. Ringo and Donna break up and she becomes closer to Rachel's brother, Zeke. They share a kiss and Donna decides to leave Erinsborough to sort her head out. On her return, she gets back together with Ringo and clashes with her mother. Before Cassandra leaves town, she tells Donna that Matt is not her biological father.

5|$|As Sonic Team {{was working}} on Nights into Dreams, Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute (STI) with {{developing}} {{what would have been}} the first fully 3D entry in its popular Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game, Sonic X-treme, was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a fisheye lens camera system that rotated levels with Sonic's movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the engine created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development time proved fruitless after Stolar rescinded STI's access to Sonic Team's Nights into Dreams engine following an ultimatum by Nights programmer Yuji Naka. After programmer Ofer Alon <b>quit</b> <b>and</b> designers Chris Senn and Chris Coffin became ill, the project was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D Sonic title for the Saturn, but development was shifted to the Dreamcast and the game became Sonic Adventure. STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.|$|E

5|$|The Bessy comics {{were also}} {{published}} in Felix, a German comic magazine by Bastei Verlag. From 1965 on, {{they wanted to}} publish a complete new story every month, a rhythm they increased to twice a month in 1966. Unable to produce so fast, Vandersteen had to expand his Studio considerably. Led by Karel Verschuere, a team of some ten young artists mass-produced the comics, which were of considerable lower quality. The {{most important of these}} artists were Frank Sels and Edgar Gastmans, while many stories were produced by Daniël Janssens. When in late 1967 Verschuere <b>quit,</b> <b>and</b> at the same time Bastei increased the rhythm again, now to one complete comic a week, the Studio was disbanded and Sels and Gastmans started to work on a free lance basis. The next year, they decided to go behind Vandersteen's back and to sell directly to the Germans. Vandersteen then had to reorganize the Bessy Studio and hired Jeff Broeckx. The Studio continued until 1985, with artists like Patrick van Lierde, Ronald Van Riet, Eugeen Goossens, and Walter Laureyssens. It produced more than 900 Bessy-comics.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states began}} the process of forming governments, Johnson's {{policies}} received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners {{to ensure that the}} war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not <b>quit,</b> <b>and</b> allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.|$|E

Nevertheless, the distinction between <b>quits</b> <b>and</b> layoffs seems economically meaningful since the share of workers reporting a drop in job satisfaction after a job change (without an intervening unemployment spell) is much higher for workers who changed jobs due to layoff (30 percent) than for workers who left for a better job (19 percent).|$|R
