40|$|In {{an effort}} to fill an {{existing}} need two small electric ser-vice vehicles were designed, constructed, and tested. The first acted as a feasibility study and the second as a design prototype. The vehicleS had low cost and the capability of being fabricated by their users as two main design goals. The prototype design vehicle is three wheeled; utilizing a unique asymmetrical design to arrange a full length load box along one side. Motive power is provided by four automotive batteries running an electric motor. Power transmission is by a <b>quiet</b> <b>gear</b> belt drive to one rear wheel. A five solenoid switching system allows for two speeds, forward and reverse, of 5 and 10 mph. The vehicle uses motorcycle wheels and a motorcycle front fork assembly. Brakes are provided in the rear wheels. A full lighting system, consisting of headlight, tail lights, brake lights, and turn signals, is provided. Useful endurance between charges is about five hours at 10 mph. The vehicle is simple to operate and fully capable of negotiating any terrain found on the Oregon State campus...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the role of materials in the generation of noise made by plastic gears. Sound levels were recorded for gears running in various running combinations. Frequency analyses were conducted on all the noise measurements and these showed that the harmonics for plastic gears mainly occur at multiples of the tooth meshing frequency. Materials such as Polyoxymethylene (POM), when run against itself were very noisy, but when run against a dissimilar material or steel they became <b>quiet.</b> <b>Gears</b> made from a polymer composite were the quietest. Measurements of surface roughness showed that the nosiest gears were those that developed high surface roughness when run-in...|$|R
40|$|Gearbox-generated {{noise and}} {{vibration}} is objectionable in many vehicles, particularly helicopters. This noise excitation {{is caused by the}} load fluctuation as gear teeth enter and leave mesh. In high-quality gears, a common technique to reduce gear {{noise and vibration}} is to modify the tooth profile. Gear noise reduction is a NASA and U. S. Army goal, and a NASA/U. S. Army research project sponsored development of gear dynamics computer codes to help design <b>quiet</b> <b>gears.</b> As part of this project, a series of experiments was performed in the NASA Lewis Research Center's Gear Noise Rig to develop a data base of dynamic test data and to validate the predictions of the codes for several gear designs under a variety of test conditions...|$|R
50|$|Other major {{modifications}} included {{the use of}} special high-strength steel in the chassis frame, a more powerful steering gear; quieter axle differentials, redesign of the geared hubs to use <b>quieter</b> helical <b>gears,</b> new induction, exhaust and electrical power systems; and re-engineering of the fuel supply and filtration system.|$|R

50|$|A Speed Meteor Twenty {{version was}} {{announced}} 21 July 1932. The compression ratio was increased to 6.8 : 1, a downdraught carburettor fitted {{and an extra}} large exhaust pipe with special Pullswell silencer. Although a choice of bodywork was available this was a special sports 4-seater with air cushions (for the seats) stone guards for lamps, remote gear change control, extra large faces on the speedometer and revolution counter and Rudge-Whitworth special wire wheels. This Speed model was fitted with a single-plate clutch, 4-speed gearbox with <b>quiet</b> third <b>gear</b> and a central remote control.|$|R

40|$|Drive {{requirements}} of tractors and communal vehicles are demanding and varied. Energy efficiency {{and the different}} requirements in off-road and on-road operation are {{the basis for a}} powerful drive. Combinations with the so-called hydrostatic wide angle technology are often used. The article deals with a hydraulic drive with wide angle technology (45 °) and an integrated, quick-shift, single stage transmission. A particularly large conversion range can be realized with this. Special shift elements, sensors and an adjustment developed for this purpose enable a fast, <b>quiet</b> and low-wear <b>gear</b> change. This new gearbox development will in future be implemented at RIGITRAC in cooperation with SAUER BIBUS...|$|R
50|$|In the 1850s, Thomas Green of Leeds {{introduced}} a revolutionary mower design called the Silens Messor (meaning silent cutter), which used a chain to transmit {{power from the}} rear roller to the cutting cylinder. The machine was much lighter and <b>quieter</b> than the <b>gear</b> driven machines that preceded them, and won first prize at the first lawn mower trial at the London Horticultural Gardens. Thus began a great expansion in the lawn mower production in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. Around 1900, Ransomes' Automaton, available in chain- or gear-driven models, dominated the British market. In 1902, Ransomes produced the first commercially available mower powered by an internal combustion gasoline engine. JP Engineering of Leicester, founded after World War I, invented the first riding mowers.|$|R
40|$|Noise {{from heavy}} trucks is an {{important}} environmental issue. Several sources contribute to the total noise level of a vehicle, such as the engine, gearbox, tires, etc. The tonal noise from the gearbox can be very disturbing for the driver, even if the noise level from the gearbox {{is lower than the}} total noise level. The human ear has a remarkable way of detecting pure tones of which the noise from loaded gears consists of. To be allowed to sell a heavy truck within the European Union, the so called pass-by noise test must be completed successfully. The maximum noise level permitted is 80 dB(A) and undercertain conditions, the gearbox can be an important contributor to the total noise level. Gear noise is therefore an important issue for the automotive industry. In this thesis gear noise and dynamic transmission error is investigated. Traditionally, transmission error (TE) is considered to be the main excitation mechanism of gear noise. The definition of TE is ”the difference between the actual position of the output gearand the position it would occupy if the gear drive were perfect”. Measurements of dynamic transmission error (DTE) and noise have been performed on a gearbox. The measurement object was a commercial truck gearbox powered by an electrical motor. The torque used was in the normal operating range of the gearbox and the correlation between gear noise and DTE, when the torque is changed, is investigated. The result differs for different gear pairs and for the first gear stage, located close to the housing, the correlation is high for most speeds. The measured DTE and noise show a poor correlation with calculated transmission error. A minimisation of TE therefore does not necessarily mean a minimisation of gear noise. A transfer function can be employed to calculate the relationship between DTE and noise. The general trend of the gear noise is an increase of 6 dB per doubling of the rotational speed together with fluctuations around the mean due to resonances of the system. The magnitude of the transfer function can be estimated using the amplitudesof the gear mesh orders and harmonics. Two gear pairs with similar macro geometry but different profile modifications are investigated. Although the gear pairs have similar transmission error, the noise level display a significantly different trend, further strengt hening the position that transmission error is not the single most important gear noise excitation mechanism. Further analysis concludes that shuttling forces and friction forces can be more important than what is often suggested. A dynamic model including transmission error and shuttling forces is used to investigate the two gear pairs. The bearing forces show that for some frequency regions shuttling forces can be of the same order of magnitude as the forces caused by transmission error. This work highlights the importance of considering other excitations of gear noise besides transmission error when designing <b>quiet</b> <b>gears.</b> The influence of transmission error can not be determined by investigating the gears only. A deeper knowledge of the gear system is needed in order to minimise gear noise for a specific gear design. QC 2010071...|$|R
40|$|Earth’s {{magnetic}} halo {{is generated}} in its core of molten nickel-iron alloy. Currents driven by Earth’s rotation, like a dynamo, spread {{the magnetic field}} far into the surrounding space. Billions of cosmic rays bombard Earth every second; they are guided by the magnetic field and pulled into tightening spirals toward the polar regions. The highly energetic charged plasma flowing out from the Sun and charging past the Earth’s magnetic field act as a gigantic natural generator whose power continually drives the auroral currents. Sometimes the enormous energy pump runs in low <b>gear</b> (<b>quiet</b> aurora); sometimes it will rev up with heightened solar activity, thereby increasing the flow of plasma out of the plasmasheet and driving the auroral discharge more powerfully. The aurora is a natural, visible manifestation of a large electrical-current system that is continually pumping millions of megawatts of electromagnetic power into the upper polar atmospheres, exceeding the total electrical generating capacity of the United States. Auroras begin on the Sun, where the energy spirals away into interplanetary space at hundreds of miles per second; four days after i...|$|R
40|$|In {{helicopters}} and other rotorcraft, the gearbox {{is a major}} source of noise and vibration (N&V). The two N&V excitation mechanisms are the relative displacements between mating gears (transmission errors) and the friction associated with sliding between gear teeth. Historically, transmission errors have been minimized via improved manufacturing accuracies and tooth modifications. Yet, at high torque loads, noise levels are still relatively high though transmission errors might be somewhat minimal. This suggests that sliding friction is indeed a dominant noise source for high power density rotorcraft gearboxes. In reality, friction source mechanism is associated with surface roughness, lubrication regime properties, time-varying friction forces/torques and gear-mesh interface dynamics. Currently, the nature of these mechanisms is not well understood, while there is a definite need for analytical tools that incorporate sliding resistance and surface roughness, and predict their effects on the vibro- acoustic behavior of gears. Toward this end, an experiment was conducted to collect sound and vibration data on the NASA Glenn Gear-Noise Rig. Three iterations of the experiment were accomplished: Iteration 1 tested a baseline set of gears to establish a benchmark. Iteration 2 used a gear-set with low surface asperities to reduce the sliding friction excitation. Iteration 3 incorporated low viscosity oil with the baseline set of gears to examine the effect of lubrication. The results from this experiment will contribute to a two year project in collaboration with the Ohio State University to develop the necessary mathematical and computer models for analyzing geared systems and explain key physical phenomena seen in experiments. Given the importance of sliding friction in the gear dynamic and vibro-acoustic behavior of rotorcraft gearboxes, there is considerable potential for research & developmental activities. Better models and understanding will lead to <b>quiet</b> and reliable <b>gear</b> designs, as well as the selection of optimal manufacturing processes...|$|R
