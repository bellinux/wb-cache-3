5|$|Barbera's {{desk was}} {{opposite}} that of William Hanna. The two <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> {{they would make}} a good team. By 1939, they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Barbera and Hanna worked alongside animator Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that a glass {{dispersive}} prism was {{not suitable}} {{for use in the}} ultraviolet spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> the {{futility}} of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E

5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> the book would require {{illustrations}} of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E

5|$|Hanna {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon the comic strip of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> they would make a good team. By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Shelby, Dixon <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> {{that he was in}} the wrong place to begin to {{cultivate}} his playwriting skills. After his initial disappointment from his Frobisher rejection Dixon, with the encouragement of his father, enrolled in the Greensboro Law School in Greensboro, North Carolina. An excellent student, Dixon received his law degree in 1885.|$|E
25|$|In Moscow, {{experimental}} transmissions {{of electronic}} television {{took place on}} March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by RCA. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quickly</b> <b>realizing</b> {{the superiority}} of this design in terms of range and {{firepower}} over the domestic Type 88 75 mm AA Gun, the Japanese Army Technical Bureau quickly “reverse engineered” it, and placed it into production. Approximately 1000 units were built.|$|R

25|$|In May 1938, the Governor of San Luis Potosí, General Saturnino Cedillo, {{declared}} himself in rebellion and President Lázaro Cárdenas travelled there to personally mount {{the campaign against}} the revolt. The Air Force organized a mixed fleet of 17 aircraft that included some new V-99M Corsair, engaging the enemy assertively when spotted. Cedillo <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> he had no chance in open fields against {{the air force and}} ran to the Huasteca Hills, where his men dispersed, abandoning him.|$|E
25|$|Taken utterly by surprise, Callao's crew {{at first}} mistook the American ships for Montojo's {{squadron}} and the gunfire for target practice by Montojo's ships, but <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> {{that they were}} under attack and hopelessly outgunned. They struck their colors and surrendered to Raleigh. They were quickly paroled ashore at Cavite, and it was later rumored that the commanding officer of Callao {{was sentenced to death}} by Spanish authorities for not fighting back against the American ships.|$|E
25|$|Al Pacino as Carlito Brigante. Pacino came to Carlito's Way {{directly}} from his Oscar-winning role in Scent of a Woman. To {{get into the}} character, he accompanied Torres through East Harlem. There he could absorb the sights and atmosphere. Pacino first envisioned Carlito with a ponytail. But after his visits to Harlem he <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> the guys there were not into wearing their hair that way. The beard was Pacino's idea. The black leather coat just fit into the period setting.|$|E

25|$|Roberts {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} romantic {{suspense}} novels in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, {{at the urging of}} her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance novels while she built a following of readers. After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that they were unable to keep up with Roberts's prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so that {{they would be able to}} publish more of her work each year.|$|E
25|$|The {{aforementioned}} submarines were {{an attempt}} to gain an edge over the Greek navy (which had only one Nordenfelt submarine, a smaller and older version). However, it was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> that – like the other Nordenfelt submarines ordered by Russia – they suffered from stability problems and were too easy to swamp on the surface. The Turks {{could not find a}} crew that was willing to serve on the primitive submarines. Abdül Hamid ended up rotting at dock, while Abdül Mecid was never fully completed.|$|E
25|$|FitzRoy <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> {{that he did}} {{not have}} the {{resources}} to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then Governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied.|$|E
