50|$|Orleans House was {{demolished}} in 1926, and {{the area}} formerly occupied by the house used to <b>quarry</b> <b>gravel</b> throughout the 1930s.

50|$|Rather {{than being}} {{pristine}} conservation land, the park contains {{a number of}} reclaimed former industrial sites, including <b>quarries,</b> <b>gravel</b> pits, a gold refining mill, and a 53-acre landfill. The land parcels were purchased piecemeal by John George Bock in the 1920s and 1930s, and acquired {{by the city of}} Colorado Springs in 2003 for use as a recreational site. Today the most visible scars from past exploitation of the land are the remains of the Kenmuir Quarry, which produced Lyons sandstone in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and the Gypsum canyon landfill, which operated from 1970-1986 and remains off-limits to park visitors.|$|R

40|$|The {{suitability}} of aquaculture for inland water {{bodies in the}} State of Yucatan, a karstic area of southeast Mexico was investigated. Five types of water bodies distinct in morphometric and hydrological characteristics were identified through land-based surveys. Representative sites for each were selected for further study: a sinkhole, a permanent aguada (clogged sinkhole), a rain-filled seasonal pond, a small 9 ha) <b>gravel</b> <b>quarry.</b> The water quality {{in all of the}} sites had a high pH (range 7. 2 - 9. 4) alkalinity (range 130 - 840 mg/l CaC 03) and hardness (range 198 - 998 mg CaC 03). Their nutrient status varied from the permanently stratified and hypereutrophic conditions in the permanent aguada, to oligotrophic conditions in <b>gravel</b> <b>quarries.</b> In general, the water quality resulted adequate for fish culture in the <b>gravel</b> <b>quarries,</b> the sinkhole and in the seasonal pond, but ecological considerations prevented sinkholes for aquaculture development. Aquaculture trials involving the stocking of fry of the native cichlid Cichlasoma urophthalmus and O. niloticus in seasonal ponds and a small <b>gravel</b> <b>quarry</b> demonstrated the feasibility of neglected water bodies for small-scale aquaculture. A net yield of 180 Kg/ha/ 6 months was obtained from a <b>gravel</b> <b>quarry</b> fertilised with grass Panicum virgatum and stocked with C. urophthalmus. Yields from seasonal ponds were 157 Kg/ha of O. niloticus from a small (0. 010 ha), and 30 kg/ha of C. urophthalmus from a large (1. 11 ha) seasonal pond (no fertilisation or feeding. An environmental impact assessment was carried out at an experimental cage site in <b>gravel</b> <b>quarry.</b> An estimated 0. 02 kg of phosphorus was wasted per kg fish produced. A socioeconomic survey on attitudes towards aquaculture adoption was carried out in four agricultural villages and a fishing port. This led to the construction and operation of a small pond demonstration unit. Results suggest that farmers are receptive and adoption of aquaculture as a complementary activity may be feasible and beneficial to rural development, especially in areas with existing water bodies. Economic modelling of the different production units involved showed returns to labour higher than the average agricultural wage. A computer-based Geographical Information System identified areas suitable for aquacultural development. Two major areas were identified: the northern Karst plains where <b>gravel</b> <b>quarries</b> are abundant and suitable for intensive cage-culture; and the southern hilly region where small-scale seasonal aquaculture could be developed...|$|R
40|$|In {{industry}} {{the flow}} of mineral particles in silos playa very {{important role in the}} recovery of these particles into containers for bagging and transport. The silo design parameters and particulate properties are restricting the flow behavior in silos thereby controlling the rate of packing into containers as a finished product or else in the utilization of these particles for subsequent unit operations down the processing line. Further, telescopic silos have been introduced recently in mining industry [1] for dust suppression in <b>quarries,</b> <b>gravel</b> pits by minimizing the distribution of dust and fines in to the surrounding areas. There are factors affecting the flow behavior in silos [2] such as particle size, angle of repose. moisture content, static electric charges of powders and so on. In order to simulate the behavior of mineral particulates in silos, glass funnels of different dimensions have been chosen due to their transparency...|$|R
