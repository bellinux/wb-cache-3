In the adult population, the approximate sex ratio between males to females is roughly one to one, but further observational studies of gulf fritillaries are needed to better support the hypothesis of an equal sex ratio between the two dimorphic sexes. The average duration of the adult stage is roughly 14 to 27 days after the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis depending on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> (i.e. factor in the availability of food, the presence of predators, competition between individuals).|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{redevelopment}} {{plan in the}} West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic Go-tiau-kang area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment.</b> By the mid-1990s, there was a growing {{awareness of the need}} to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures.

Canadian Pacific Railway was added on August 14 after World Fuel Services, as shipper of the crude oil, claimed its only contractual relationship is to the CPR with MMA (as CP's subcontractor) exercising sole control of the site. The claim that MMA was contracted by CP (and not WFS) was later drawn into question. Blanchet stated “I will leave it up to lawyers, but let’s be clear: under the law on environmental quality, the minister does not ask for, or suggest, compensation ... he orders it."

2500|$|In 1982, Southwark Council leased the Wood to London Wildlife Trust {{to manage}} as a nature reserve. In 1984 Southwark Council’s Mid/South Southwark Local Plan {{included}} proposals for blocks {{of up to}} 146 flats on the top part of the Wood. London Wildlife Trust's Southwark Wildlife Group ran a [...] "Save the Woods" [...] campaign backed by West Lewisham MP John Maples and other local MPs. Dulwich MP Gerald Bowden asked the Secretary of State for the Environment to intervene. A full-page Evening Standard article set the scene for a New Year public inquiry into the Plan. The January inquiry heard evidence from a dozen ecologists on the Wood's wildlife diversity, other witnesses describing the Wood’s educational and amenity value, visited the site and listened to views from several hundred {{members of the public}} at an evening meeting at Kingswood House. Southwark MP Simon Hughes spoke in favour of saving the wood in the House of Commons. Further, Dulwich College Estates applied for planning permission to build 36 flats on the site of Beechgrove House. In July, the Local Plan inspector reported that most of the Wood should be protected from development. The written report was published in the same week that Southwark Council’s planning committee rejected the Beechgrove application. In advance of a public inquiry into the Beechgrove plans held in November 1986, Gerald Bowden MP said: [...] "I’ve never had quite such a wide range of ordinary people writing to me on one subject. There is very broad opposition to the flats." [...] The inspector's decision against the plan was hailed as [...] "Wood reprieve a policy precedent." [...] "The need to preserve areas of existing natural woodland within the urban areas is of as much importance in preserving our heritage and improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> as that of preserving the countryside," [...] the inspector said.|$|E

This dissertation focuses on <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early childcare <b>environment</b> in Chile and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> ethnicity and socio-economic inequality. Ninety-five mother-child dyads were followed in their first year of life to examine changes in the attachment relationship and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home <b>environment,</b> dependent on type of care (maternal care versus center daycare) and ethnicity (Mapuche versus non-Mapuche). Our results show that differences in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> home <b>environment</b> between <b>the</b> two ethnic groups are very small and that Mapuche families are distinguished from the majority group by lower income and lower maternal education.

40|$|In urban {{academic}} research, {{there is}} an ongoing debate whether commercial gentrification benefits or disadvantages local residents. Two pertinent questions have arisen from this debate.

Second, do these specialty stores contribute to local residents’ assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>environment?</b> This article seeks to examine the differences in use of specialty stores by local residents and gentrifiers, and in addition, users’ assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>environment</b> in Prague, Czech Republic. The results show that local residents and gentrifiers only slightly differ {{in their use of}} specialty stores, they all benefit from the stores. Furthermore, users of specialty stores are more positive in their assessment on <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>environment.</b> These findings therefore support the position in the debate that commercial gentrification can have positive implications for local residents...|$|R
