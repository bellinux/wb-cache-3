These included a defense attorney as saying [...] "ime will tell whether this activist conservative-majority Supreme Court is {{doing the right thing}} in moving back the clock on Miranda rights" [...] and a district attorney as saying [...] "Miranda had been broadened over the years far beyond what was necessary for its original goal of protecting suspects from [...] ... police culture has dramatically changed for the better in the 40-plus years since it came into being". A second defense attorney was quoted as saying that [...] "t's placing too much on a person who is already in an incredibly stressful situation. If I sit you down in a chair in a little room and shine a harsh light in your face and <b>question</b> <b>you</b> for three hours, under those conditions I could get a ham sandwich to confess." [...] A county public defender opined that the ruling was not unfavorable, as a clear answer would be preferable to uncertainty. Local police stated the ruling did not affect how interrogations would be conducted.|$|E
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, {{to a lot of}} the early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step would be to have somebody <b>question</b> <b>you</b> and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

We kinda had that from the beginning. I remember it not even being a <b>question.</b> <b>You</b> know the HD formats, I didn't really like them very much at all. I'm just not warming up to them. But they change a lot. The film would have six different looks if we tried to keep up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lead {{prosecutor}} Linda Drane Burdick in {{the prosecution}} rebuttal told the jurors {{that she and her}} colleagues backed up every claim they made in their opening statement six weeks ago, and implied that the defense never directly backed up their own opening-statement claims. [...] "My biggest fear is that common sense will be lost in all the rhetoric of the case," [...] she said, insisting that she would never ask the jury to make their decision based on emotion but rather the evidence. [...] "Responses to guilt are oh, so predictable," [...] she stated. [...] "What do guilty people do? They lie, they avoid, they run, they mislead... they divert attention away from themselves and they act like nothing is wrong." [...] She suggested that the garbage bag in the trunk of the car was a [...] "decoy" [...] put there to keep people from getting suspicious about the smell of the car when she left it abandoned in a parking stall directly beside a dumpster in an Amscot parking lot. [...] "Whose life was better without Caylee?" [...] she asked, stressing how George and Cindy Anthony were wondering where their daughter and granddaughter were in June and July 2008, the same time Casey was staying at her boyfriend's apartment while Caylee's body was decomposing in the woods. [...] "That's the only <b>question</b> <b>you</b> need to answer in considering why Caylee Marie Anthony was left {{on the side of the}} road dead." [...] Burdick then showed the jury a split-screen with a photo of Casey partying at a night club on one side and a close-up of the [...] "Bella Vita" [...] (meaning [...] "Beautiful Life") tattoo that she got weeks after Caylee died on the other.|$|E
