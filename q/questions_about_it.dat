5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant to ask <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>IT</b> work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want}} to deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, [...] "The thing is, some bands {{that are trying to}} get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I don’t really mind it, because I’m a Christian, and I’m okay talking about it. With the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don’t understand how a band can be Christian. We get the question, 'Is Anberlin a Christian band?' and it’s like, yeah, Anberlin is — as humans".|$|E
2500|$|Faldo {{had a very}} erratic {{relationship}} with the media prior to and during the competition. It was suggested by some journalists that Faldo's actions lost himself considerable credibility. During practice, photographers had taken pictures of him holding a list of players' initials, seemingly outlining the partnerships for the coming days. In the following press conference, he denied the list had any part in his tactics, and claimed it was {{a list of the}} players' sandwich orders. This was met with extreme skepticism from the media, which notably irritated Faldo when he was asked continuing <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Faldo eventually admitted they were in fact possible player pairings and he'd been [...] "caught out".|$|E
2500|$|As far as squad {{selection}} was concerned, {{the primary focus}} was the omission of David Gower, who had averaged over 50 in the previous summer's series against Pakistan. [...] His replacement was Dermot Reeve who ended up not even featuring in the Test series. [...] The official reason for leaving Gower out of the squad {{was that he was}} [...] "too old", but with veterans Mike Gatting and John Emburey also making the trip, despite having only just returned from a ban for playing cricket in apartheid South Africa, this seemed rather spurious. [...] <b>Questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> were even raised in Parliament and a special general meeting of the MCC convened, but to no effect, and Gower's presence in India was as a media representative only. [...] Buried beneath this furore was the additional omission of Jack Russell, considered by most to be England's best wicketkeeper, in favour of the largely unheralded Richard Blakey.|$|E

60|$|I saw she was embarrassed, so I {{asked her}} no further <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Perhaps, I thought, she's {{going to be}} married.
