50|$|In 1954 {{while he}} was still a {{graduate}} student, Goto invented the parametron, a circuit element that combined a ferrite core with a capacitor to generate electrical oscillations whose timing could be controlled. This provided an alternative to the vacuum tube technology then in use for building computing devices. He completed the construction of the PC-1, one of the first general-purpose computers built in Japan, in 1958, using parametron-based logic.Soon afterwards, he proposed the Goto pair, a device related to the parametron. Parametrons continued to be used for computing in Japan until the 1960s when they gave way to transistors. The <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> parametron is a later improvement of the parametron, also by Goto, that uses superconducting Josephson junctions to improve both the speed and the energy consumption of these devices.|$|E
50|$|Invented by Eiichi Goto at the University of Tokyo, the <b>Quantum</b> <b>Flux</b> Parametron (QFP) is an {{improvement}} over his earlier parametron based digital logic technology. Unlike its predecessor, QFP uses superconducting Josephson junctions on integrated circuits to improve speed and energy efficiency enormously. In some applications, {{the complexity of the}} cryogenic cooling system required is negligible compared to the potential speed gains. While his design makes use of quantum principles, it is not a quantum computer technology, gaining speed only through higher clock speeds. Apart from the speed advantage over traditional CMOS integrated circuit design is that parametrons can be operated with zero energy loss (no local increase in entropy), making reversible computing possible. Low energy use and heat generation is critical in supercomputer design, where thermal load per unit volume {{has become one of the}} main limiting factors.|$|E

40|$|We {{established}} {{a theoretical framework}} {{in terms of the}} curl flux, population landscape, and coherence for non-equilibrium quantum systems at steady state, through exploring the energy and charge transport in molecular processes. The curl <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> plays the key role in determining transport properties and the system reaches equilibrium when flux vanishes. The novel curl <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> reflects the degree of non-equilibriumness and the time-irreversibility. We found an analytical expression for the <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> and its relationship to the environmental pumping (non-equilibriumness quantified by the voltage away from the equilibrium) and the quantum tunneling. Furthermore, we investigated another quantum signature, the coherence, quantitatively measured by the non-zero off diagonal element of the density matrix. Besides the environment-assistance which can give dramatic enhancement of coherence and <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> with high voltage at a fixed tunneling strength, the <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> is promoted by the coherence in the regime of small tunneling while reduced by the coherence in the regime of large tunneling, due to the non-monotonic relationship between the coherence and tunneling. In view of the system as a quantum heat engine, we studied the non-equilibrium thermodynamics and established the analytical connections of curl <b>quantum</b> <b>flux</b> to the transport quantities such as energy (charge) transfer efficiency, chemical reaction efficiency, energy dissipation, heat and electric currents observed in the experiments. We observed a perfect transfer efficiency in chemical reactions at high voltage (chemical potential difference). Our theoretical predicted behavior of the electric current with respect to the voltage is in good agreements with the recent experiments on electron transfer in single molecules.

40|$|What is {{the right}} {{statistics}} for the measurements of arrival times of a quantum particle? Although this question is very old, it is still open. Usual experiments are performed in far-field regime and this question becomes unimportant, as a semiclassical analysis suffices. Nevertheless, the development in the detector technology will soon allow for near-field investigations, thus {{a better understanding of}} arrival time measurements is needed. Since outcomes of quantum measurements are always described by POVMs, various arrival time POVMs have been proposed.
