40|$|Context: Although <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> are {{becoming}} more appreciated in healthcare, the number of publications of quality studies remains low. Little {{is known about the}} frequency and characteristics of citation in <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies.</b> Objective: To compare the academic impact of <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> to that of two quantitative studies: systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Methods: Publications in BMJ between 1997 and 2006 (BMJ’s median impact factor was 7. 04 during this period) employing qualitative methods were matched to two quantitative studies appearing the same year using PubMed. Using Web of Science, citations within a 24 -month publication period were determined. Additionally, three hypotheses were examined: <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> are 1) infrequently cited in original articles or reviews; 2) rarely cited by authors in non-English-speaking countries; and 3) more frequently cited in non-medical disciplines (e. g., psychology or sociology). Results: A total of 121 <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies,</b> 270 systematic reviews, and 515 randomised controlled trials were retrieved. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> were cited a total of 1, 089 times, with a median of 7. 00 times (range, 0 – 34) for each study. Matched systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials were cited 2, 411 times and 1, 600 times, respectively.

40|$|This is {{the first}} issue of a new journal, {{entitled}} <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies.</b> We hope that this new journal will become a central forum for discussions of qualitative research in psychology, education, communication, cultural studies, health sciences and social sciences in general. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> is peer-reviewed and publishes papers in English and the Scandinavian languages in any of these areas. We are interested in papers that discuss qualitative methods, their promises, problems and philosophies, and also papers that apply such methods in concrete <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies.</b> We aim to publish two issues a year, but since <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> is an open access and web-based journal, we can allow ourselves some flexibility in this regard, and for example choose to publish additional special issues, if such options arise. &# 13; &# 13; <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> is associated with the Center for <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> at Aalborg University in Denmark (www. cqs. aau. dk). But we hope that potential authors from other universities in Denmark {{and the rest of the}} world will take an interest in <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> as an outlet for their work. In preparing this first issue, we have received a fair amount of manuscripts, many of which are still under review, but in order to show that <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> is alive as a journal, we have chosen to publish this first issue with four articles, two of which are in English and two of which are in Danish. &# 13; &# 13; Together, these articles show the scope of themes and approaches that we hope will flourish in <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies.</b> Abbey and Zittoun offer a semiotic analysis of interview processes, Kristensen analyses power dynamics as reflected in people’s everyday lives, in casu modern traffic, Klausen reports a study of parkour, an art of urban movement, and Frimann & Jantzen present a cultural-poetic analysis of a short interaction sequence at a gas station. All articles integrate theory and empirical material in fruitful, albeit very different, ways. We hope that this will inspire future contributors to <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies.</b> As a journal its mission is on the one hand to discuss qualitative methods, but equally important to be a forum for the publication of <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> that contribute to our knowledge about the human, social and cultural world. &# 13; &# 13; We wish to thank the anonymous reviewers, whose generous comments have helped improve the quality of the manuscripts and also our editorial board. &# 13; &# 13; We look forward to seeing how <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Studies</b> will develop!&# 13; &# 13; The Editors,&# 13; Svend Brinkmann, email: svendb@hum. aau. dk&# 13; Lene Tanggaard, email: lenet@hum. aau. d...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} use of {{qualitative}} approaches alongside randomised trials of complex healthcare interventions. DESIGN: Review of randomised controlled trials of interventions to change professional practice or the organisation of care. DATA SOURCES: Systematic sample of 100 trials published in English from the register of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group. METHODS: Published and unpublished <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> linked to the randomised controlled trials were identified through database searches and contact with authors. Data were extracted from each study by two reviewers using a standard form. We extracted data describing the randomised controlled trials and <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies,</b> the quality of these studies, and how, if at all, the qualitative and quantitative findings were combined. A narrative synthesis of the findings was done. RESULTS: 30 of the 100 trials had associated qualitative work and 19 of these were published <b>studies.</b> 14 <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> were done before the trial, nine during the trial, and four after the trial. 13 studies reported an explicit theoretical basis and 11 specified their methodological approach. Approaches to sampling and data analysis were poorly described. For most cases (n= 20) we found no indication of integration of qualitative and quantitative findings {{at the level of}} either analysis or interpretation. The quality of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> was highly variable. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> alongside randomised controlled trials remain uncommon, even where relatively complex interventions are being evaluated. Most of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> were carried out before or during the trials with few studies used to explain trial results. The findings of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> seemed to be poorly integrated with those of the trials and often had major methodological shortcomings...|$|R

2500|$|The type of {{trajectory}} may be {{more important}} than one particular trajectory. [...] Some trajectories may be periodic, whereas others may wander through many different states of the system. Applications often require enumerating these classes or maintaining the system within one class. [...] Classifying all possible trajectories has led to the <b>qualitative</b> <b>study</b> of dynamical systems, that is, properties that do not change under coordinate changes. Linear dynamical systems and systems that have two numbers describing a state are examples of dynamical systems where the possible classes of orbits are understood.|$|E

40|$|Question: What {{influence}} do physiotherapists’ {{beliefs and}} attitudes about chronic {{low back pain}} have on their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain? Design: Systematic review with data from quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies.</b> Quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> were included if they investigated an association between physiotherapists’ attitudes and beliefs about chronic low back pain and their clinical management of people with chronic low back pain. Results: Five quantitative and five <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> were included. Quantitative studies used measures of treatment orientation and fear avoidance to indicate physiotherapists’ beliefs and attitudes about chronic low back pain. Quantitative studies showed that a higher biomedical orientation score (indicating a belief that pain and disability result from a specific structural impairment, and treatment is selected to address that impairment) was associated with: advice to delay return to work, advice to delay return to activity, and a belief that return to work or activity {{is a threat to}} the patient. Physiotherapists’ fear avoidance scores were positively correlated with: increased certification of sick leave, advice to avoid return to work, and advice to avoid return to normal activity. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> revealed two main themes attributed to beliefs and attitudes of physiotherapists who have a relationship to their management of chronic low back pain: treatment orientation and patient factors. Conclusion: Both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> showed a relationship between treatment orientation and clinical practice. The inclusion of <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> captured the influence of patient factors in clinical practice in chronic low back pain. There is a need to recognise that both beliefs and attitudes regarding treatment orientation of physiotherapists, and therapist-patient factors need to be considered when introducing new clinical practice models, so that the adoption of new clinical practice is maximised.

2500|$|The {{qualitative}} {{properties of}} dynamical systems {{do not change}} under a smooth change of coordinates (this is sometimes taken as a definition of qualitative): [...] a singular point of the vector field (a point wherev(x)=0) will remain a singular point under smooth transformations; a periodic orbit is a loop in phase space and smooth deformations of the phase space cannot alter it being a loop. [...] It is {{in the neighborhood of}} singular points and periodic orbits that the structure of a phase space of a dynamical system can be well understood. In the <b>qualitative</b> <b>study</b> of dynamical systems, the approach is to show that there is a change of coordinates (usually unspecified, but computable) that makes the dynamical system as simple as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The {{biological}} {{relationship between}} a parent and child is important, and {{the separation of the}} two has led to concerns about adoption. The traditional view of adoptive parenting received empirical support from a Princeton University study of 6,000 adoptive, step, and foster families in the United States and South Africa from 1968 to 1985; the study indicated that food expenditures in households with mothers of non-biological children (when controlled for income, household size, hours worked, age, etc.) were significantly less for adoptees, step-children, and foster children, causing the researchers to speculate that, instinctively, people are less interested in sustaining the genetic lines of others. [...] This theory is supported in another more <b>qualitative</b> <b>study</b> where in adoptive relationships marked by sameness in likes, personality, and appearance, both adult adoptees and adoptive parents report being happier with the adoption.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Quantitative {{studies are}} {{becoming}} more recognized as important to understanding health care {{with all of its}} richness and complexities. The purpose of this descriptive survey was to provide a quantitative evaluation of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> published in 170 core clinical journals for 2000. Methods All identified <b>studies</b> that used <b>qualitative</b> methods were reviewed to ascertain which clinical journals publish <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> and to extract research methods, content (persons and health care issues studied), and whether mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative methods) were used. Results 60 330 articles were reviewed. 355 reports of original <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> and 12 systematic review articles were identified in 48 journals. Most of the journals were in the discipline of nursing. Only 4 of the most highly cited health care journals, based on ISI Science Citation Index (SCI) Impact Factors, published <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies.</b> 37 of the 355 original reports used both qualitative and quantitative (mixed) methods. Patients and non-health care settings were the most common groups of people studied. Diseases and conditions were cancer, mental health, pregnancy and childbirth, and cerebrovascular disease with many other diseases and conditions represented. Phenomenology and grounded theory were commonly used; substantial ethnography was also present. No substantial differences were noted for content or methods when articles published in all disciplines were compared with articles published in nursing titles or when studies with mixed methods were compared with studies that included only qualitative methods. Conclusions The clinical literature includes many <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> although they are often published in nursing journals or journals with low SCI Impact Factor journals. Many <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> incorporate both <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative methods. </p...|$|R
