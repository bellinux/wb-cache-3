40|$|We {{postulate}} {{a direct}} role for energy {{prices in the}} 2008 financial crisis. Rising energy prices constrain consumer budgets and thereby raise mortgage delinquency rates. This hypothesis is tested by estimating a quarterly cointegrating vector autoregressive (CVAR) model that seeks to quantify {{the factors that influence}} the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> and those that enter foreclosure. Results identify a long-run relationship for the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> that includes the interest rate on one-year adjustable mortgages, household expenditures on energy, nominal home prices, rates of home ownership, and the fraction of mortgages 90  days or more <b>past</b> <b>due</b> that enter foreclosure [...] unemployment rates have a short-run effect. Together, these variables account for much of the historical variation in the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> and indicate that the post 2006 rise in this measure of mortgage delinquency is associated with falling home prices, an increase in household expenditures on energy, and rising unemployment.
