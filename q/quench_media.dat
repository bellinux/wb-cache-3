50|$|The two {{important}} aspects of quenching are the cooling rate and the holding time. The most common practice is to quench into a bath of liquid nitrite-nitrate salt and hold in the bath. Because of the restricted temperature range for processing it is not usually possible {{to quench in water}} or brine, but high temperature oils are used for a narrow temperature range. Some processes feature quenching and then removal from the <b>quench</b> <b>media,</b> then holding in a furnace. The quench and holding temperature are primary processing parameters that control the final hardness, and thus properties of the material.|$|E
50|$|As with {{conventional}} quench and tempering the material being heat treated must be cooled from the austenitizing temperature {{quickly enough to}} avoid the formation of pearlite. The specific cooling rate {{that is necessary to}} avoid the formation of pearlite {{is a product of the}} chemistry of the austenite phase and thus the alloy being processed. The actual cooling rate is a product of both the quench severity, which is influenced by <b>quench</b> <b>media,</b> agitation, load (quenchant ratio, etc.), and the thickness and geometry of the part. As a result, heavier section components required greater hardenability. In austempering the heat treat load is quenched to a temperature which is typically above the Martensite start of the austenite and held. In some patented processes the parts are quenched just below the Martensite start so that the resulting microstructure is a controlled mixture of Martensite and Bainite.|$|E

The unique properties of these nanoparticles are (i) size dependent physical properties, (ii) large surface area, (iii) large number density and (iv) surface structure [9]. Fluids with nanoparticles suspended in them are called nanofluids [8]. Commonly used materials for nanoparticles are oxide ceramics (Al 2 O 3, CuO), metal carbides (SiC), nitrides (AlN, SiN), metals (Al, Cu), nonmetals (graphite, carbon nanotubes), layered (Al+Al 2 O 3, Cu+C), PCM and functionalized nanoparticles and the base fluids includes are water, Ethylene or tri-ethylene glycols, oil, polymer solutions, bio-fluids and other common fluids [10]. There are mainly two techniques {{used to produce}} nanofluid: the single-step and two-step method. Latter method is extensively used in the synthesis of nanofluids in which nanoparticles was first produced and then dispersed in the base fluids [8]. The properly prepared nanofluids are expected to give the benefits of (i) higher heat conduction, (ii) more stability, (iii) microchannel cooling without clogging, (iv) reduced chances of erosion and (v) reduction in pumping power [11]. The addition nanoparticles to the conventional fluids result in anomalous change in thermo-physical properties of the fluid. Apart from that, the addition of nanoparticles affect the boiling behaviour at the surfaces as they fill up the discontinuity at the surfaces and probably affect the critical heat flux.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} and comparative study {{was carried out}} on some locally sourced oils melon oil Africa elemi oil and Africa locust bean oil to evaluate suitability as substitute <b>quenching</b> <b>media</b> to mineral-based oil. The cooling ability of the oils was investigated using AISI 1034 medium carbon steel. The effect of heat transfer coefficient on quench severity mechanical properties of the quenched specimens were investigated {{in the course of}} the study. Results showed that the peak rate of heat extraction of melon oil Africa locust bean and Africa elemi oil were higher than that of mineral oil. Higher heat transfer coefficient of 1463 1023 Wm 2 k were obtained for melon oil and Africa locust bean Africa elemi and SAE 40 oil have heat transfer coefficient of 982 and 469 Wm 2 k respectively. The selected oils can be used as quenchants for medium carbon steel since the oils exhibits better cooling properties and mechanical properties than mineral-based oil...|$|R
40|$|For {{quenching}} of age hardenable {{aluminum alloys}} today predominantly aqueous <b>quenching</b> <b>media</b> are used, {{which can lead}} due to the Leidenfrost phenomenon to a non-uniform cooling of the parts and thus to distortion. Particularly at thin-walled or complex shaped parts local plastic deformations can occur by the uneven thermal stresses. In relation to the conventional quenching procedures in aqueous <b>media,</b> gas <b>quenching</b> exhibits a number of technological, ecological and economical advantages. The quenching intensity can be adjusted by the variable parameters gas pressure and gas velocity {{as well as the}} kind of gas and thus can be adapted to the requirements of the alloy. By the higher uniformity and the better reproducibility, gas quenching offers a high potential to reduce distortion. For this purpose a new age hardening process was developed, which includes a gas quenching step. The distortion behavior of cast and forged aluminum parts was examined after gas quenching and after water quenching...|$|R
