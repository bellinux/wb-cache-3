50|$|Freezing food {{preserves}} it {{from the}} time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved their grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing).

The authors {{analyze the}} {{regulation}} {{of the system of}} mandatory (preventive) retention of data in electronic communications in European Union law and the law of the Republic of Croatia. Many questions and issues of contention concerning blanket data retention regulation at EU level, especially after the adoption of the Data Retention Directive and its implementation in EU Member States, are examined in terms of sensitivity and special regulation of processing user data in electronic communications, and the severe impact of retention on guaranteed rights and freedoms of all users. The paper focuses on the impact of data retention on the right to respect for private life and communications and the right to personal data protection. The authors also analyze recent developments in the implementation of the Data Retention Directive in the EU and its evaluation by the European Commission. Procedures initiated following the implementation of this Directive in certain EU States, aimed at challenging the constitutionality and legality of relevant domestic law, point to the sensitive nature of the introduction of mandatory data retention systems on account of its interference with guaranteed rights of citizens. Furthermore, the authors also point out cases which were, until today, referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union by national courts of certain EU Member States in order to evaluate compatibility of the Directive with human rights and fundamental freedoms. The authors research and analyze solutions implemented in the domestic legal system on the subject of mandatory retention of data in electronic communications. Among other things, they call attention to the need for assessing these issues in line with the necessity and proportionality requirements, observing both European Union and international law, notably the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Moreover, the authors emphasise the need for consistent implementation of relevant criteria in cases where guaranteed rights of citizens are interfered with, and for precise and clear legislative solutions especially with a view to preventing abuse.

Four times methanol wash were done to hexane/methanol extract and merged with chloroform/methanol extract to ensure optimized lipid classes distribution between two solvent systems. <b>Quick</b> <b>freeze</b> of hexane/methanol solvent system by dry ice was adopted to avoid adverse effect of generation of micelle. The glass aminopropyl bonded column was used to fractionate the lipid classes into: neutral lipids (NL), free fatty acids (FFA), phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine (PC/PE) and phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylinositol (PS/PI). The results show that 99 % of neutral lipids were extracted into hexane while the chloroform/methanol remained 95 % of PC/PE and 88 % of PS/PI. According to verification of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography (GC) results, the solid phase extraction (SPE) separated the lipid classes effectively with good recoveries. The fatty acids profiles were compared with Folch extraction. There were some differences between these two methods. However, the two-step extraction showed very good repeatability and provided higher concentration of phospholipids in SPE eluates, which make it suitable for analysis of livers from wild Atlantic cod fish. Forty-three of wild Atlantic cod fish (Gadus morhua) were analyzed by the two-step extraction we proposed. The lipid distribution and fatty acid composition of different lipid classes were studied.

Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and storyboarded everything because of the complicated style throughout.

It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, [...] "So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts?—That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show". He adopted a frenetic style to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put plenty of detail in every frame because the gangster life is so rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop [...] "because a point was being reached" [...] in Henry's life.|$|R
40|$|Storage {{methods are}} {{important}} to preserve the viability and biochemical characteristics of microbial cultures between experiments or during periods when bioreactors are inactive. Most {{of the research on}} storage has focused on isolates; however, there is an increasing interest in methods for mixed cultures, which are of relevance in environmental biotechnology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different storage methods on electrochemically active enrichment cultures. Acetate-oxidizing bioanodes generating a current density of about 5 A m− 2 were enriched in a microbial electrolysis cell. The effect of five weeks of storage was evaluated using electrochemical techniques and microbial community analysis. Storage by refrigeration resulted in <b>quicker</b> re-activation than <b>freezing</b> in 10 % glycerol, while the bioelectrochemical activity was entirely lost after storage using dehydration. The results showed that the bioelectrochemical activity of bioanodes stored at low temperature could be retained. However, during the re-activation period the bioanodes only recovered 75 % of the current density generated before storage and the bacterial communities were different in composition and more diverse after storage than before...|$|R
