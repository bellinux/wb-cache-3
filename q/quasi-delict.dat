Drie verordening en zijn op dit moment van kracht: · de verordening betreffende de rechterlijke bevoegdheid, de erkenning en de tenuitvoerlegging van beslissingen in burgerlijke en handelszaken (de Brussel I-vo); · de verordening betreffende de bevoegdheid en de erkenning en tenuitvoerlegg ing van beslissingen in huwelijkszaken en inzake de ouderlijke verantwoordelijkh eid (de Brussel IIbis-vo); · de insolventieverordening (insolventie-vo). De thesis vertrekt van het perspectief van derde staten. Vier hoekstenen worden geïdentificeerd: · de woonplaats van de verweerder; · exclusieve bevoegdheidsgronden; · forumbedingen; · procedurele regels die een nauw verband vertonen met de internationale bevoegdheid. In de laatste plaats bestudeert de thesis de externe bevoegdheden van de Europese Gemeenschap en of deze bevoegdheid exclusie f is dan wel gedeeld wordt met de lidstaten van de Europese Unie.

50|$|By contrast, {{the civil}} law of German-speaking {{countries}} does not differentiate between delict (Delikt) and <b>quasi-delict</b> (Quasidelikt) as do French and Roman law. Under German Deliktsrecht, or ‘law of delict’, claims for damages can arise from either fault-based liability (Verschuldenshaftung), i.e. with intention (Vorsatz) or through negligence (Fahrlässigkeit), or strict liability (Gefährdungshaftung). Under § 823 BGB, damages can {{be based on}} harm inflicted either on an erga omnes right (absolute Rechtgut) such as life, bodily autonomy, health, freedom and ownership, or on the violation of a law protecting a certain legal interest.|$|E
50|$|Article 5(3) of the Regulation (2012 recast: Article 7(2)) {{gives the}} plaintiff, in matters {{relating}} to tort, delict or <b>quasi-delict,</b> {{the option to}} sue the defendant in the courts for {{the place where the}} ‘harmful event occurred or may occur’, in other words, the forum delicti commissi. In the Bier or Mines de Potasse case, the ECJ specified that the expression ‘place where the harmful event occurred‘ can encompass both “the place where the damage occurred and the place of the event giving rise to it”. Although this specification can be very helpful to the case, its implications, such as the possibility of a multitude of fora, have led to a rather extensive case-law governing the subject, making this provision a complex matter.|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis {{is the issue of}} {{determining}} jurisdiction in matters of tort, delict or <b>quasi-delict</b> with regard to the internet. The author finds that the general rules of determining jurisdiction are suitable for use even in disputes arising with connection to the internet. However, strict application of the aforementioned rules would lead to undesirable results. Therefore it is necessary to construe the general rules {{in such a way that}} takes into account the unique characteristics of the internet environment. Given the fact that courts are mainly responsible for the interpretation and application of the general rules, significant decisions of European and American courts are thoroughly analyzed. Even though the {{main focus of}} the thesis are the decisions of the courts, recent findings of jurisprudence and recommendations of the international bodies are taken into account as well. In the opening chapters, the unique characteristics of the internet and basic rules for determining the special jurisdiction are presented. Although the issue of determining jurisdiction in contracts is also mentioned in chapter 3, this topic exceeds the scope of this work and is discussed mainly in connection with the "targeting" criterion, which is also significant for out of contract issues.

40|$|In the {{conjoined}} cases C- 509 / 09 e-Date Advertising GmbH v X and C- 161 / 10 Olivier Martinez {{and others}} v MGN Ltd, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) {{was required to}} determine the scope of applicability of both Article 5 (3) of Regulation EC 44 / 2001 (the Brussels I Regulation) and Article 3 of Directive EC 2000 / 31 (the Electronic Commerce Directive). Both cases were concerned with defamation and breach of personality and image rights {{as a result of}} the publication of two newspaper articles which were accessible online via each of the defendants' websites. As readers will be fully aware, Article 5 (3) of the Brussels I Regulation enables claimants to establish special jurisdiction in the case of a tort, delict or <b>quasi-delict,</b> in the courts of the Member State where a harmful event has occurred or may occur. The effectiveness of Article 5 (3) as a ground of jurisdiction focuses on the locality of the event. The question that arose in both cases was, essentially, where could the claimants bring proceedings for breach of personality and defamation as a result of newspaper articles published online via websites, when those websites were accessible in multiple jurisdictions? According to an experienced legal practitioner in the United Kingdom, ‘more than 25 billion individual items of content are shared each month on Facebook alone. ’ There are increasing concerns regarding the dissemination of comments through the medium of ‘ubiquit(ous), converged and displace(d) ’ Web 2. 0 communications technologies. Such communications increase the potential for criminal and civil consequences in numerous jurisdictions. The ability of injured parties (famous or not) to seek redress in the most appropriate forum for the purposes of protecting their private lives and reputations is acutely significant...|$|E
40|$|The first {{evidence}} of Roman delicts {{is in the}} XII Tables {{that in the middle}} of the 5 th century introduced the first types of delict and the first forms of obligation. From these provisions the Roman law givers did not develop a general law of delict governing the delictual liability. The Roman system of delicts was in fact typical: at first, the XII Tables introduced furtum and personal injuries — delicts that immediately after, in correspondence to the change of the Roman society, the praetor modified with the development of the notion of furtum and the change of the ancient poena for the furtum manifestum into a poenae obligatio and the introduction of the edictum de iniuriis aestimandis to determine the poena for injuries —, afterwards, the enactment of the most important law on damage, the lex Aquilia de damno, deriving from the iniuria – contumelia. Finally, in the 1 st century BC, during the violent fall of the Republic, a praetorian provision introduced the actio vi bonorum raptorum, dealing with robbery. Simultaneously, during the last republican period, the increase of the international trade and reasons of public policy let emerge the need to ensure the reparation of damage in some cases in which damage originated in the lack of supervision by the person responsible for such. The praetor introduced the actio de effusis vel deiectis, the actio damni et furti adversus nautas, caupones, stabularios that Justinian will include in the <b>quasi-delict</b> category. In the following centuries, the Roman jurists developed the classic configuration of the Roman delicts: the most important changes were introduced in the notion of iniuria and damnum iniuria datum. A new subjective criterion of liability — culpa — emerged from the interpretation of the iniuria in the chapters of the lex Aquilia, linked to the subjective notion of iniuria in the actio iniuriarum; a new evaluation criterion of reparation of the damage was introduced to recover the actual damage suffered by the plaintiff; a new notion of damage extended the scope of the chapters of the lex Aquilia by considering every loss recoverable, even if without physical destruction. The Roman system of delicts, however, was too typical to ensure the total reparation of the private damages deriving from an unlawful conduct. To this end, a new type of action, actio de dolo, was introduced to repair the loss caused by dolus, in case of absence of any specific delictual action. This new type of action is a subsidiary remedy which fills the gaps left open by the typical system of actions...|$|E
