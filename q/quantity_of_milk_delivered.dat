40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{empirical}} analysis of farmers' contracting {{choice in the}} Hungarian milk sector using 2005 milk producer survey data, employing transaction cost economics. We focus on analysing some key determinants of farmers' contracting choices: type of contracts, duration, number of contractors, incentives provided in the contract and business history of farmers and buyers. Some of the main results include the importance and effect of farm size, <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> <b>delivered,</b> planned short and long run or contract related investment on farm, the possibility of farmer to influence prices on the contracting choices.

40|$|ABSTRACT There is much {{disagreement}} about milk {{and its use}} in feeding programs both in the United States and internationally. A few authors suggest that milk consumption should not be encouraged in lactose intolerant populations due to adverse symptoms. Others suggest, however, that small or modest <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> can be tolerated and can be nutritionally useful to such groups. Data are {{presented in this paper}} that show that 1) the Masai regularly drink considerable <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> without apparent symptoms, 2) milk is an important constituent of the Masai diet, and 3) 62 % of 21 Masai examined were malabsorbers of lactose as measured by the lactose tolerance test. This finding of lactose malabsorption in a nomadic cattle raising and milk drinking people is interesting and is contrary to the views often expressed by anthropologists and others. An ability to drink nutritionally useful <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> does not, however, necessarily mean that milk production or imports should be encouraged in the Lesser Developed Countries.

The East Frisian ewes in the lactation period of 221 days produced an average of 364. 65 kg <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> with 5. 68 % of fat, 4. 92 % of proteins and 4. 59 % of lactose.
