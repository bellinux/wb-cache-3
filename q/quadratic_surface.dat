40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method of}} morphometric characterisation of landform from DEMs. The method is implemented by first classifying every location into morphometric classes based on the mathematical shape of a locally fitted <b>quadratic</b> <b>surface</b> and its positional relationship with the analysis window.

The algorithm has four characteristics: (1) the ideal cases of different geomorphometric features are simply and clearly defined; (2) the output is spatially continuous to reflect the inherent fuzziness of geomorphometric features; (3) the output is easily combined into a multi-scale index across a range of operational scales; and (4) the standard general morphometric parameters are quantified as the first and second order derivatives of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>surface.</b> An additional benefit of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>surface</b> is the derivation of the R 2 goodness of fit statistic, which allows an assessment of both the reliability of the results and the complexity of the terrain.
