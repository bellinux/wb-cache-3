Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, John Paul Stevens, and Anthony Kennedy.

With a cost of nearly £20,000 (£ at today's prices), it was the longest and most detailed court of inquiry in British history up to that time. Those testifying included surviving passengers and crew members, as well as captains and crew members of other ships in the vicinity, expert witnesses, government officials, and White Star Line officials and ship designers.|$|E

25|$|Searle's thought {{experiment}} {{begins with}} this hypothetical premise: suppose that artificial intelligence research {{has succeeded in}} constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands Chinese. It takes Chinese characters as input and, by following the instructions of a computer program, produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the Turing test: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in synesthesia {{is at least}} as old as Greek philosophy. One of the <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classic philosophers asked was if color (chroia, what we now call timbre) of music was a physical quality that could be quantified (Campen 2007, Gage 1994, Ferwerda & Struycken 2001, Jewanski 1999). The first known experiment to test correspondences between sound and color was conducted by the Milanese artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century. He consulted with a musician at the court of Rudolph II in Prague to create a new experiment that sought to show the colors that accompany music. He decided to place different colored strips of painted paper on the gravicembalo, a keyboard instrument (Gage, 1994). He was also an artist who created strange portraits from unusual objects, such as Four Seasons in One Head. The problem of finding a mathematical system to explain the connection between music and color has both inspired and frustrated artists and scientists throughout the ages. The seventeenth-century physicist Isaac Newton tried to solve the problem by assuming that musical tones and color tones have frequencies in common. He attempted to link sound oscillations to respective light waves. According to Newton, the distribution of white light in a spectrum of colors is analogous to the musical distribution of tones in an octave. So, he identified seven discrete light entities, that he then matched to the seven discrete notes of an octave (Campen 2007, Peacock 1988).|$|E

In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language.

500|$|Parker {{finished}} {{writing the}} script for the film by May 1995. He then visited Lloyd Webber's home in France, and tried to bring him and Rice together for working on the film; the duo had not worked {{with each other for}} years after the musical Cricket (1986). While drafting the script, Parker had re-written the last act, removing the repetitive content of the original play. This resulted in Rice and Lloyd Webber composing new music, including the new song [...] "You Must Love Me". Parker knew that the pre-recorded playback would be the main backbone for the filming, hence was wary about the decisions he had to make in the recording studio. He pondered over the script and the music, expecting any <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> actors would have for later.|$|E

500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I thought we would ease into things.

2500|$|Some German teachers' {{representatives and}} a number of {{scientists}} disputed the PISA findings.

2500|$|The {{group of}} {{immigrants}} was deeply disturbed and unsure {{whether they were}} still a Lutheran congregation after having left the authorities and church hierarchy in Germany behind.

In April 1841, soon after his brother Otto Herman of St. Louis had died, a public debate was held between Walther and attorney Marbach, one of the lay leaders of the settlers, in {{what is known as}} the [...] "Altenburg Debate."
