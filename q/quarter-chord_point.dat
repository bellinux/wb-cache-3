40|$|The {{increasing}} globalwarming {{and climate}} change has boosted research on sustainable energy {{in the last few}} decades leading to a lot of research being carried out on wind energy. Wind turbines have {{played a major role in}} harvesting wind energy withHorizontal AxisWind Turbines (HAWTs) being the dominant design. However, for urban and offshore applications, Vertical AxisWind Turbines (VAWTs) have been under consideration for a while. VAWTs have some inherent advantages such as no need for a yawingmechanism, easy operation and maintenance, low noise emission, and better potential performance under skewed and unsteady wind conditions. But due to lack of research on VAWTs, they have not been commercialized on a scale which is equal to that of HAWTs. This study is one of such attempts for a better understanding of VAWTs. The primary aim of this study is to explore and analyse the behaviour of VAWTs under the influence of turbulent wind. This target has been achieved by analysing the loads on the turbine and their effect on its fatigue life under the influence of constant wind and turbulent wind. For this purpose, first one hour turbulent wind fields based on statistical models were generated using the turbulence simulator, ‘TURBSIM’ and two-dimensional turbulent wind fields were extracted from the generated wind fields. Next, the simulations of a two-dimensional vertical axis wind turbine using the generated turbulent wind fields were done in an aeroelastic code named ‘Unsteady Two-Dimensional Vorticity Aerodynamics (U 2 DiVA) model’. These simulationswere done between the cut-in (4 m/s) and cut-out (25 m/s) wind speeds of the turbine at intervals of 1 m/s. The results from these simulations were the streamwise force, cross-streamwise force and the moment about the <b>quarter-chord</b> <b>points</b> of the airfoils of the blades. A post-processing tool was then developed for the processing of these results. Using this tool and the results of the simulations, the equivalent tangential force, the equivalent radial force and the equivalent moment on the airfoilswere calculated. All calculationswere done for both types of wind. First the equivalent loads at each wind speed were calculated and then the total equivalent loads were calculated. The equivalent loads were calculated for various values of inverse slope (m) of the S-N curve of thematerial used to manufacture the blades of the turbine. The same procedure was repeated with constant wind. Finally,the changes in total equivalent loads under turbulent wind were calculated with respect to total equivalent loads under the constant wind. The variation in these changes with respect to the change in the value ofmwas then calculated. Additionally, the effect of phase angle (angle between the blades and the incoming windstream at the beginning of the simulation) on the equivalent loads was also calculated. The value of m used for this case was 10 as recommended in literature and the four phase angles chosen were 0 o, 45 o, 90 o and, 135 o. The equivalent loads at various wind speeds were calculated for the different values of m and various peaks were observed at various wind speeds. It was recommended that the peaks can be avoided using a suitable control scheme to control the rotational speed of the rotor. The changes in total equivalent loads under the influence of turbulent wind were found to be less than 0. 2 % which indicates that the effect of turbulence on the fatigue life of VAWTs is not so significant. The value of m at which the change was smallest was found to be around 3. Under phase effect, the variation of the radial force and the moment with wind speed seemed to follow Gaussian distribution at phase angles of 45 o, 90 o and 135 o. The total equivalent loads were found out for all the phase angles and the change in these loads were found out with respect to 0 o phase angle. These changes were quite high and indicate that the operation of a VAWT at phase with incoming wind can be detrimental for the fatigue life of the VAWT.

5000|$|The {{resultant}} {{aerodynamic force}} is resolved either into lift (L) - drag (D) components or normal (N) - tangential (T) components.

The aeronautical terms [...] "lift" [...] and [...] "drag" [...] refer to the forces across (lift) and along (drag) the approaching net relative airflow. The tangential force acts along the blade's velocity, pulling the blade around, and the normal force acts radially, pushing against the shaft bearings. The lift and the drag force are useful when dealing with the aerodynamic forces around the blade such as dynamic stall, boundary layer etc.; while when dealing with global performance, fatigue loads, etc., {{it is more convenient}} to have a normal-tangential frame. The lift and the drag coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of the relative airflow, while the normal and tangential coefficients are usually normalised by the dynamic pressure of undisturbed upstream fluid velocity.|$|E

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a wing-body-horizontal-tail configuration designed for efficient performance at transonic speeds has been investigated at Mach numbers from 0. 80 to 1. 03 in the Langley 16 -foot transonic tunnel.

40|$|A 20. 8 percent-thick {{airfoil shape}} was {{designed}} to have shockless inviscid flow at a Mach number of 0. 68 and a lift coefficient of 0. 40. In {{order to determine the}} actual airfoils which would yield this same shockless flow when viscous effects are included, boundary layer displacement thicknesses were subtracted from the inviscid shape for Reynolds numbers of 100 and 35 million. This process yielded airfoils with thicknesses of 20. 7 and 20. 6 percent, respectively. Subtraction of boundary layer displacement thicknesses for Reynolds numbers below 35 million yielded nonphysical airfoils, that is airfoils with negative thicknesses near tHe trailing edge. The pitching moment about the <b>quarter-chord</b> <b>point</b> at the design condition was - 0. 082 for the inviscid shape and, consequently, for both airfoils. Off-design calculations for the two airfoils were made using a computer program which provides for the interaction of the inviscid flow and boundary layer solutions. The pressure distributions of the airfoils were shockless for conditions from the design point to lower Mach numbers and lift coefficients.

40|$|The report {{presents}} the results of theoretical calculations of torsional flutter of unstalled cascade blades. It is shown that the position of the torsional axis is of great importance, the best position being near the <b>quarter-chord</b> <b>point,</b> and the worst position near the threequarter-chord point. An unfavourable axis position gives flutter speeds which are exceeded in normal machines. An experimental investigation in an annular cascade with twelve blades confirms the existence of this type of flutter. Good agreement with the theory is found in some cases, but in others it is thought that threedimensional effects are having a substantial influence. The effects of small differences between blades are examined theoretically in an Appendix, and it is concluded that the effects of mistuning and mechanical damping are always favourable. 1. Introduction. It has been well established that for normal designs of axial compressor and turbine blading the aerodynamic forces do not have an appreciable effect on the modes of vibration of the blades. This is because the mass of the blade is much greater than the mass of fluid in its immediate vicinity. In flutter investigations it is therefore sufficient to consider only a single degree of freedom in th...|$|E

In the region where the lift curves start to bend, the slope of the curve of pitching moment about the <b>quarter-chord</b> <b>point</b> changes from positive to negative values. There is a small but definite scale effect on the lift-curve slope at zero lift_ and the experimental values of the lift-curve slope are slightly higher than theoretical values obtained by the Weissinger method. There is a substantial increase in maximum lift coefficient with increasing Reynolds number for smooth wings, but with leading-edge roughness added most of this increase disappears. Scale effect on the section maximum lift is similar to that on the wing maximum lift, but the wing values are some-what lower because of three-dimensional effects...|$|E
