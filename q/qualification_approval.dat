5000|$|Johnson {{originally}} built a homebuilt Rocket 125 {{which first}} flew in 1942. The Rocket 125 was a low-wing cabin monoplane {{powered by a}} Lycoming O-290 engine. He developed the design into the Rocket 185 with a 185 hp (138 kW) Lycoming O-435-A engine and retractable landing gear. It was a high performance aircraft for the late 1940s with {{a top speed of}} 180 mph (290 km/h). In August 1945, Fred Pittera who had been an Advanced Military Pilot Training instructor on the four-engine B-24 Bomber at the nearby Fort Worth Army Air Field, joined the Johnson Rocket Aircraft as a test pilot, flying the P-39 aircraft look-alike through its various test regimens and finally in late 1945 flew the Johnson Rocket 185 with an FAA flight examiner for its first production <b>qualification</b> <b>approval.</b> A Federal Aviation Authority Type Certificate was issued on 10 September 1946. Introduced in August 1945, the Rocket 185 was pitched with the phrase [...] "get a super-performing airplane for only $5,000 - order your 'Rocket' now!". A sales tour began in June 1946. However, because of its high performance and limited seating (two, sometimes three), the market was limited to experienced pilots and only 18 were built.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnplanned {{engineering}} changes {{represent a}} major field of disturbance during production ramp-up. They require time-consuming <b>qualification</b> and <b>approval</b> procedures for product- or process-related redesign. Numerous engineering changes during production ramp-up {{can be traced}} back to lack of product maturity, not sufficiently increased during the precedent stage of product development. By applying effective and efficient product testing processes, product maturity can be measured and enhanced at an early stage. As a consequence, unplanned engineering changes can be avoided. Nevertheless, contemporary test management procedures lack of methodological support, especially in the field of test planning. To date, the successful evaluation of testing demand and selection of necessary test specifications mainly depends on the expert knowledge of the test management team. The present paper focuses on the development of optimized test planning procedures in order to accelerate early product maturity enhancement for stabilizing production ramp-up processes. Following design science research methodology, the relevance of the problem statement in the application environment of production ramp-up will be assessed. Furthermore, approaches of the knowledge base related to test management will be analyzed in order to constitute rigor of the applied research approach. Based on the evaluation of business needs from the relevant environment as well as the investigation of application knowledge, a research framework for deriving optimized test planning procedures is presented...|$|R
60|$|Saton {{deliberately}} {{turned into}} the Park, and sauntered along under {{the trees in the}} wake of a throng of fashionable promenaders. He exchanged greetings with many acquaintances, and here and there he stopped to say a few words. He noted, as usual, and with a recurrence of his constant discontent, the extraordinary difference in the demeanor of the women and the men of his acquaintance. The former, gracious and smiling, accepted him without reservation. Their murmured words and smiles were even more than gracious. On the other hand, there was scarcely a man whose manner did not denote a certain tolerance, not unmixed with contempt, as though, indeed, they were willing to accept the fact that he was of their acquaintance, but desired at the same time to emphasize the fact that he was outside the freemasonry of their class--a freak, whom they acknowledged on sufferance, as they might have done a wonderful lion-tamer, or a music-hall singer, or a steeplejack. He knew very well that there was not one of them who accepted his <b>qualifications,</b> notwithstanding the <b>approval</b> of their womankind, and the knowledge stung him bitterly.|$|R
40|$|It {{is clear}} from the 30 Collaborative {{provision}} audit reports published between May 2005 and March 2007 that awarding institutions were fully aware of the requirement for careful monitoring of collaborative provision in the intervals between formal approval and periodic review/revalidation events. All had in place systems for annual monitoring of the quality and standards of collaborative programmes. These systems were generally similar to those for monitoring of internal provision; however, in some cases they were tailored to accommodate different forms of collaborative provision or modes of delivery, or to reflect the particular risks involved in such provision. In most cases monitoring systems were found to be robust; where recommendations for improvement were made, these concerned the need to achieve consistency across provision and to involve staff of partner institutions in the monitoring process. Procedures for reporting and acting upon the outcomes of annual monitoring were sometimes found to be protracted and cumbersome, whereas the efforts of some awarding institutions to achieve effective oversight of their collaborative provision and to involve partner staff in that oversight were singled out as features of good practice. The role of the primary contact within the awarding institution was found to be of crucial importance to the effective operation of collaborative arrangements, and numerous features of good practice were identified in this area. The variety of terms used for this primary contact reflects the different functions involved: liaising, managing, monitoring and supporting. 'Link tutor' is probably the most widely used term, and will be adopted in the remainder of this paper to denote the role. Link tutors played both a formal and an informal part in annual monitoring. Some had assessment responsibilities and were involved in the appointment of and support for external examiners. In some cases their monitoring responsibilities extended to scrutiny of the information produced by partner organisations about collaborative programmes. As the main point of contact with the awarding institution, the link tutor also monitored aspects of the student learning experience, such as the provision of adequate academic and personal support, the adequacy of learning resources, and the opportunities provided to students for feedback and representation. The audit reports confirm that most awarding institutions fulfilled their obligation to ensure that staff directly involved in the delivery of collaborative programmes were properly qualified by scrutinising staffing arrangements and staff <b>qualifications</b> at initial <b>approval</b> and during periodic review. In the interim, the quality of teaching and any changes in staffing were monitored both formally as part of annual monitoring and informally by link tutors. Staff support and development needs were identified during appraisal or annual monitoring, and were met by awarding institutions in a variety of ways. The large number of features of good practice identified in the area of staff support and development indicates the care taken by awarding institutions to ensure that staff delivering collaborative programmes were appropriately trained and provided with the necessary development opportunities...|$|R
