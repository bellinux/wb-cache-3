5|$|Schubert's famous String <b>Quintet</b> {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the <b>quintet</b> and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other voices, in the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere of complete stillness, of arrest of all motion and time. String <b>quintet</b> textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E

50|$|All of Peter's known {{compositions}} are sacred concerted vocal {{works or}} anthems composed for worship services {{with the exception}} of the string <b>quintets.</b> His six string <b>quintets</b> for two violins, two violas, and a violoncello are among the earliest examples of chamber music known by a North American composer. The six string <b>quintets,</b> performed by the American Moravian Chamber Ensemble, were recorded and published in 1997 on New World Records 80507-2.|$|R

5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles. He {{played in the}} violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great {{experience}} was to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind <b>quintet,</b> alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the <b>quintet,</b> honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s Miller joined bassist Dave Holland's band, {{changing}} {{it from a}} <b>quintet</b> to a sextet, and adding gospel and soul elements to the group's sound. Around this time, Miller had two regular bands of his own: a piano trio, and a <b>quintet</b> featuring saxophone and vibraphone. He also became heavily involved in music education: Miller was the Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and was the Artist in Residence at Lafayette College in 2008, which was two years after it had awarded him an honorary doctorate in Performing Arts.|$|E

5|$|In 1952 Tristano's band {{performed}} occasionally, including as a <b>quintet</b> in Canada. In {{the summer}} of that year, Konitz joined Stan Kenton's band, breaking up the core of Tristano's long-standing quintet/sextet, although the saxophonist did on occasion play with Tristano again.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Hattner {{moved to}} New York City {{and became the}} {{principal}} clarinetist of the Princeton Symphony Orchestra. His Lincoln Center debut took place at Alice Tully Hall in November 1996 with the American premiere of Isang Yun's <b>Quintet</b> No. 2 for Clarinet and Strings. He also performed with the Garden State Philharmonic, Long Island Philharmonic, New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and the <b>Quintet</b> of the Americas. Hattner guest conducted the Oklahoma Chamber Ensemble and Garden State Philharmonic and organized benefit concerts at St. Ignatius of Antioch Church in Manhattan to feed local residents. In 2001, he released The Clarinetist Composer with Albert Tiu. By 2002 Hattner was the music director and clarinetist of Camerata Atlantica, an ensemble he co-founded with Mark Sloss.|$|E
50|$|Boccherini’s {{first set}} of string <b>quintets,</b> his Opus 10, were also {{composed}} in 1771. His second set, Opus 11, consisted of six <b>quintets,</b> most notably No. 5 in E Major. This became Boccherini’s most famous work even though, when published, it received no special recognition.|$|R

50|$|Out {{of lack of}} {{literature}} for flute <b>quintets</b> “Quintessenz” began to arrange their own musical pieces. For {{that they did not}} only use music for <b>quintets</b> of different kinds but also adapted symphonic pieces, piano literature, or completely different music. Thus they began to compile their own programmes.|$|R
40|$|The field galaxy {{contamination}} of galaxy <b>quintets</b> in Hickson's catalog of compact groups is estimated by computing {{the probability of}} the random projection of field galaxies on or near quartets in the catalog. This is done by Monte Carlo simulations based on galaxy counts in fields surrounding the quartets. Thirty-five percent of all <b>quintets</b> are predicted to contain a single discordant redshift due to a projected field galaxy. This agrees with the observed number of four discordant <b>quintets</b> in 10. These {{results are consistent with}} the cosmological interpretation of galaxy redshifts...|$|R
5|$|After Holiday died, Waldron {{played with}} vocalist Abbey Lincoln and her husband, drummer Max Roach. Around this time, Waldron's playing {{on his own}} {{recordings}} became darker, featuring emotional shifts and variations in minor keys. In 1961, Waldron played in Eric Dolphy and Booker Little's <b>quintet,</b> a promising combination that ended when Little died that year, aged 23.|$|E
5|$|After {{early work}} around Philadelphia and New York City, Richie Powell {{played in the}} bands of Paul Williams (1951–52) and Johnny Hodges (1952–54).

This band toured extensively across the U.S. for two years, and released both studio and concert recordings, including the Grammy Hall of Fame inductee Clifford Brown & Max Roach.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1958, Kelly {{recorded}} his second album as leader, the quartet Piano, {{more than six}} years after his first. In the same year, he played for recordings led by, among others, vocalist Betty Carter, and made the first of several appearances on albums led by Cannonball Adderley, Blue Mitchell, and Hank Mobley. Kelly also played organ on one track of Pepper Adams and Jimmy Knepper's The Pepper-Knepper <b>Quintet,</b> an unusual departure from his usual instrument.|$|E

5|$|In June 1961 Hope {{was part}} of Jones' <b>quintet,</b> which {{included}} trumpeter Freddie Hubbard.

The pianist recorded four albums in New York around 1961, including Hope-Full, which contained his only solo tracks and some piano duets with his wife.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano <b>Quintet.</b> An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E
