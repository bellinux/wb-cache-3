25|$|In the {{telecommunications}} field, a unique impediment to {{development in the}} central Allegheny region is the United States National Radio <b>Quiet</b> <b>Zone</b> (NRQZ), a large rectangle of land—about —that straddles the border area of Virginia and West Virginia.

25|$|About 15–20 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train begins ringing its bell and sounding its horn in accordance with NORAC rule 14L or GCOR rule 5.8.2(7): two longs, one short, and one long. These are prolonged or repeated until the engine occupies the crossing. If the AWD {{is equipped with a}} wayside horn in accordance with FRA <b>Quiet</b> <b>Zone</b> rules, the AWD may provide the whistle signal instead of the train; however, the train is required to ring its bell regardless.|$|E
25|$|To this day, WHSV is {{the only}} full-power {{commercial}} station in the Shenandoah Valley. This {{is due to the}} area's small population, as well as the fact that virtually all of the market is located in the United States National Radio <b>Quiet</b> <b>Zone.</b> The market's only other commercial station is low-power sister station WSVF-CD, which launched with Fox and CBS subchannels in October 2012 after Gray purchased former WAZT-CA repeater WAZM-CA several months earlier. The only over-the-air competition to WHSV and WSVF comes from WVIR, which operates translators in Harrisonburg and Bridgewater. The area's DirecTV and Dish Network's local feeds supplement the area with stations from Washington, D.C.

25|$|In June 2001, units 357 025 and 357 027 had vinyl {{stickers}} {{applied with}} two prototype variants {{of the proposed}} purplish blue and magenta c2c livery at Bombardier's Derby Litchurch Lane Works. They were delivered to East Ham EMU Depot for evaluation. Each set of vinyl stickers cost about £40,000.

Hence, although the underlying paintwork and interiors of the two sub-classes were different when delivered, their exterior appearance is identical, {{and the only way to}} distinguish them externally is by their numbering.

25|$|In 2014, on April 14, a {{southbound}} Rail Runner train {{struck and}} killed a 67-year-old woman in southern Albuquerque, {{just south of the}} Bernalillo County/International Sunport station.

Santa Fe Trails, the local transit agency in Santa Fe, provided bus service to all stations south for stranded passengers. Although the Santa Fe area is a <b>quiet</b> <b>zone,</b> witnesses reported that the train was sounding its horn prior to the crossing.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} design of <b>quiet</b> <b>zones</b> in {{broadband}} diffuse fields has been present {{by using the}} method of acoustic pressure minimization over various spaces and frequencies. The technique is squared acoustic pressure minimization. The theory and simulations of pressure minimization over space and frequency using one-channel and two-channel systems are presented. The work {{presented in this paper}} focus on diffuse primary fields with one and two secondary sources. It is shown that larger <b>zones</b> of <b>quiet</b> are obtained using two secondary sources, with better control over the shape and location of the <b>quiet</b> <b>zones.</b> The main contributions of the paper are that a design method of active systems to generate larger <b>zones</b> of <b>quiet</b> in broadband diffuse fields is proposed and the performance of the active systems is analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{effectiveness}} of active sound transmission control inside an enclosure using a purely acoustic source under the potential energy, squared pressure, and energy density control algorithms. Full coupling between a flexible boundary wall and the interior acoustic cavity is considered. Formulas based on the impedance-mobility approach are developed for the active control of sound transmission with the energy density control algorithm. The resultant total acoustic potential energy attenuation and sound fields under the three control algorithms are compared. Global amplification of the sound level with localized <b>quiet</b> <b>zones</b> under the squared pressure control is observed. This adverse effect can be removed by using the energy density control. It is also shown that the energy density control provides a more uniform control of sound field. Better performance of global and local control of sound field using the squared pressure and energy density controls {{can be achieved by}} locating the error sensors at the peak <b>quiet</b> <b>zones</b> and the areas of peak energy density attenuation, respectively, obtained under potential energy control.

40|$|Laboratory experiments, each lasting several weeks, {{have been}} {{conducted}} to establish the characteristics of viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) in oceanic basalts from many sites of the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP). VRM is most pronounced in low-coercivity basalts whose natural remanences (NRM) have low median destructive fields, less than 100 Oe. A simple logarithmic acquisition law is rarely obeyed, but two or three distinct stages are instead observed, in each of which a logarithmic dependence of VRM intensity on acquisition time may be assumed. This observation leads to a simple interpretational model for the nature of VRM in DSDP basalts, but also implies that extrapolation of laboratory observations to geological times is not meaningful. Instead, the ratio of laboratory VRM (acquired in a 1 Oe field during 1000 h) to NRM {{is used as a}} minimum indicator of the potential seriousness of VRM. Experiments show that VRM acquired in the presence of NRM is more serious than VR M acquired in alternating field (AF) demagnetized samples. As most published VRM data in DSDP basalts were obtained after AF demagnetization, these are regarded also as minimum estimates of the significance of VRM acquired by oceanic basalts in situ. The consequences of the common occurrence of such an unstable component of magnetization in the oceanic basalt layer are considered in relation to the nature and distribution of oceanic magnetic <b>quiet</b> <b>zones.</b> The Cretaceous, and possibly the Jurassic, magnetic <b>quiet</b> <b>zones</b> are considered adequately explained by constant paleomagnetic field polarity. However, if VRM is a substantial and widespread magnetization component in the oceanic crust, it may not always be appropriate to interpret oceanic magnetic anomalies (or their absence) as an exact record of paleomagnetic field behavior. Remagnetization of the oceanic crust by VRM acquisition may be a viable alternative explanation of the origin of the marginal magnetic <b>quiet</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
