The performance of quantum logic gates is shown to depend only on universal symmetry properties of a SP phase rather than any fine tuning of the Hamiltonian, and it is possible to implement a universal set of logic gates in this way by combining several different types of SP matter.

While previous <b>quantum</b> <b>transistors</b> have typically required tiny laterally-defined features, by contrast the DELTT is entirely planar and can be reliably fabricated in large numbers. We use a novel epoxy-bond-and-stop-etch (EBASE) flip-chip process, whereby submicron gating {{on opposite sides of}} semiconductor epitaxial layers as thin as 0. 24 microns can be achieved. Because both electron layers in the DELTT are 2 D, the resonant tunneling features are unusually sharp, and can be easily modulated with one or more surface gates.
