25|$|At {{some point}} around William McVickar's death in 1868 the Picturesque detail {{was added to}} the {{original}} design. This was in keeping with trends of the time, particularly in the Hudson Valley, where the influence of Andrew Jackson Downing remained strong even after his death around the time John McVickar had taken up residence. As a result of the combination of Greek Revival form and plan with the Picturesque decoration, the house has a unique and distinct Victorian <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Particularly in {{the early}} years, comedic {{sketches}} overtook all segments on the show, occasionally even interrupting guest interviews and O'Brien's monologue. Frequently sketches would randomly begin without introduction, such as during banter between Richter and O'Brien. A lot of the humor had a fantasy-like <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> where inanimate objects would talk or silly characters would disrupt the show. Sometimes a short story would emerge in these sketches with a resolution culminating in a song. Generally, throughout the later years, original sketches, ideas and characters were constantly being introduced, rather than relying heavily on a few recurring segments like other past and current talk shows. There still were {{quite a number of}} recurring segments, but again, a much higher quantity than a typical talk show.|$|E

Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks."

Affleck commented that the scene has [...] "a touch of music-hall" [...] in it, as it turns, from a scene in church, to a [...] "courtroom scene". He also noted that Ned's journey to Las Vegas can be compared to a Christian's travel to the temple of Mammon, a figure that in the Bible is characterized as the personification of wealth and greed.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} {{gave the}} style of the work a positive reception. A review in the online science fiction magazine Tor.com compared Gifts to an old fairytale, stating that it had the [...] "power of something told and retold". Reviewers wrote that Le Guin's description of Orrec's blindness was [...] "fiercely real", and that her prose had a poetic or lyrical <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The exploration of the consequences of power and the coming of age themes has been described as insightful and provocative, while the construction of the story, and the Orrec and Gry's gradual understanding of the consequences of their choices, were also praised.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene is}} thought to have been painted near the Lac pour le patinage (Skating Lake), an {{artificial}} lake. Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds. The painting has an unfinished, sketch-like <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> in the style of a pochade, but the brushwork is bold and the composition fully realized. [...] The scene represents {{the western part of the}} park, using an elevated perspective. The theme evokes older Dutch ice skating landscapes made popular by painters like Hendrick Avercamp (1585–1634). Several dogs can be seen in the work, reflecting Renoir's thematic interest in the lives of the Parisian bourgeoisie. The motif of social leisure depicted in the piece would come to define Renoir's subsequent work.|$|E

After the mix is prepared, it is encased in banana leaves, synthetic sausage casings or tubular plastic bags and left to ferment for three to five days.

He praised the Cerwyn cheese soufflé and the pheasant pithiviers starters, as well as three of the mains; a roast duck dish, the pork belly dish, and a venison dish. Around the same time, Sally Williams reviewed the restaurant for the Western Mail, who also praised the soufflé. She called the atmosphere [...] "comfortable" [...] and stated {{that it had a}} home-like <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In 2013, the restaurant was ranked as the second best in Wales, behind The Walnut Tree in Abergavenny, in the Sunday Times list of the 100 best restaurants in the UK.|$|E

Philippa Irvine of Crash praised the [...] "all-action" [...] theme of the game, and heralded the campaign as [...] "impressive" [...] in both terms of content and length. Gary Rook of Sinclair User similarly praised the gameplay, suggesting {{that it had a}} [...] "workmanship" [...] <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> however he noted that it lacked a [...] "certain sparkle".

[...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E

[...] The review also praised [...] "her reverberant chest voice [...] her head voice, hitting the highest register with intonation and purity" [...] and echoed Janis: [...] "That she continues to be greeted with skepticism is unfair. ... Yes, the concert showed that Jackie is a young girl, yet one with artistry to be appreciated now without debating about what her future might hold." [...] Antony Walker, Pittsburgh Opera's music director, said: [...] "she has a very sincere way of singing. ... Her voice has a lovely <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It's very simple singing but it comes from the heart. You rarely hear someone so young with such a beautiful voice". Nekesa Mumbi Moody, writing for Associated Press, commented that, although [...] "there is a youthful quality in Jackie's voice, it's hardly childlike: It's a soprano that deftly traverses the musical scales". Mark Kanny, in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, called her voice [...] "beautifully in tune and well supported. ... Evancho's sincerity of delivery was affecting".|$|E
500|$|... "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{was planned}} {{as the third}} episode in the 2011 series but the order was changed during the {{production}} process. Initial production occurred in September, with Gaiman visiting the set during the production period and filming for the associated Confidential. Additional filming took place in October 2010, with guest star Suranne Jones having been filmed for green screen special effects. The scenes where Amy and Rory are on the run allowed the audience to explore the TARDIS outside the control room, something the producers had wanted {{to do for a}} while. A series of corridors was constructed and retained for future use. The episode also featured the return of the older TARDIS control room from the Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant era. Gaiman had originally wanted to reconstruct a console room from the original series, but the cost proved prohibitive. The set was retained after filming for [...] "The Eleventh Hour", but has since been removed {{to become part of the}} Doctor Who Experience exhibit. Arthur Darvill noted the floor of the older set had a cheese grater-like <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> so when the scene called for the cast to fall on it, they found it uncomfortable to stay down for a long period of time.|$|E

While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. I like that with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome. It had this — I hope she won't mind me saying this, but her voice has this kind of yodely <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> the way that she does things and the way that she ends words.

Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.'

500|$|Hawley's {{first thought}} when [...] "looking at the genre {{is if we}} remove the genre, is there a {{compelling}} show {{you want to watch}} there?" [...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was in part due to Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience should have the same experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal voice-over, to give the sense that we are not rooted in a physical time and place." [...] The intent was to put audiences [...] "in the state of mind to watch Legion." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had that odd <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)"

500|$|Space-Whale was {{originally}} pitched by Pat Mills and his writing partner John Wagner in 1980 as a Fourth Doctor adventure. When the production office showed {{some signs of}} interest, Wagner left the project and the script was commissioned as a four-part Fifth Doctor story for a scene breakdown on 7 September 1981 and full scripts on 2 December 1981. The new drafts reduced the humor and the renamed Song of the Space Whale was now planned as the third series of Season 20 and intended to introduce new companion Vislor Turlough. The story concerned {{a group of people}} living in the belly of a giant whale in space. The Doctor would find this out while attempting to protect the creature from being slaughtered by a rusting factory ship. The castaways living in the whale, as well as the ship's captain, would be working class characters, with the former's dialogue being based on that of a working-class Northern Irish family that Mills knew. During the writing, Mills and script editor Eric Saward [...] "fundamentally disagreed" [...] on the character of the captain (Saward wanting a more Star Trek-type figure) and the dialogue for the castaways. Mills has said that [...] "there was a Coronation Street <b>quality</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> that Eric felt didn't work in space. He thought the future would be classless, and I didn't." [...] Mills' disagreements with Saward led to the script being delayed {{until it was too late}} to serve as Turlough's introductory story. The script was then considered for Season 21 and later still Season 22. By this point the script had been revised as two 45-minute episodes, but although it was still listed in July 1985 as an ongoing script, by November 1985 Nathan-Turner confirmed at a convention that the script had been dropped. The [...] "Space Whale" [...] concept was eventually revised and realised in the 2010 episode The Beast Below. The rejected script was later adapted as The Song of Megaptera by Mills for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in May 2010.|$|E
