DWI was performed within 1 day before and after CEA in 88 patients. Postoperative lesions were analyzed by their <b>quantity,</b> <b>volume</b> and distribution. To differentiate temporary ischemia from definite cerebral infarction (blood brain barrier disruption) all patients with a positive postoperative DWI were reexamined with contrast-enhanced T 1 -MRI 7 – 10 days after the procedure. All patients were examined by a neurologist within 2 days before and after CEA. Results. Two patients showed a postoperative neurological deficit. Postoperative DWI revealed ipsilateral ischemic lesions in 15 patients. In seven of these patients a brain infarction was diagnosed on the T 1 -MRI during follow-up. A significant correlation between the number of DWI lesions (p= 0. 031) as well as the volume of DWI lesions (p= 0. 023) and definite infarction was found. Symptomatic patients preoperatively showed significantly more DWI lesions (p= 0. 036) and cerebral infarcts (p= 0. 003). Conclusion.

A multiscale approach {{was taken to}} investigate differences between contralateral femurs, tibias and fibulas, at body-level (total-body CT-scans, anatomical dissection), organ-level (volume and moments of areas; structural stiffness and strain distribution in bending and torsions) and tissue-level (mineral density, elastic modulus, hardness). Because of {{the large amount of}} measurements taken, the study was limited to two donors. However, high statistical power within the same donor was achieved thanks to a large number of highly-repeatable measurements. Muscle cross-sections suggested that both donors were right-legged. The right bones had higher structural stiffness (up to + 115 %, statistically significant, except for the tibia). The right bones also experienced generally lower strain than the contralateral ones (up to- 25 %, statistically significant). The right bones had larger volume (up to + 16 %) and moments of area (up to + 116 %, statistically significant in most cases) than the left ones. Difference in tissue density between contralateral bones (< 7 %) was not statistically significant in most cases. Also the differences found in elastic modulus of the femur cortical tissue (2 - 5 %) were not statistically significant. Similarly, tissue hardness in the right bones was only marginally higher than in the contralateral ones (+ 1 % to + 4 %, not statistically significant). Therefore, it seems that structural differences between contralateral bones associated with laterality are mainly explained by differences in bone <b>quantity</b> (<b>volume)</b> and organization (area moments). Bone tissue quality (density, hardness) seems to give a marginal contribution to structural side asymmetry. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.

40|$|Historically, {{suspended}} footbridges {{have been}} built from ropes (i. e. cables) constructed {{of a variety of}} materials including iron and natural fibers. However, contemporary suspended footbridges are typically constructed with steel rope. One exception, a 64. m span polyester-rope footbridge completed in 2013, demonstrates the potential for alternative rope materials in contemporary footbridge design and construction. The first goal {{of this paper is to}} support the idea that polyester rope has promise in future footbridge applications by comparing minimum rope volume and self-weight results for polyester-rope and steel-rope footbridges with spans ranging from 15 to 64. m in two multi-objective optimization problems. In both problems the competitive objective functions are span which is maximized and rope volume which is minimized. The results are minimum volume systems for spans in the defined range. Minimizing volume reduces rope cost and eases material transport and handling. To provide an alternative measure of rope <b>quantity,</b> <b>volume</b> results are scaled to find the equivalent self-weights. This study focuses on in-plane structural behavior and investigates two-dimensional rope systems with or without prestress and with or without under-deck stays. A combination of static and natural frequency constraints is considered in the optimization problems. The second goal of this paper is to describe the novel methodology developed to evaluate these optimization problems. This methodology combines a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm for searching the design space with dynamic relaxation and eigenanalysis algorithms for the structural analysis. Results indicate that polyester-rope systems have higher volumes, but lower self-weights than steel-rope systems. This observation supports the premise that polyester-rope footbridges are potential alternatives to steel-rope footbridges. The presented methodology can be adapted to evaluate how other unconventional materials compare to more conventional counterparts that are well established in bridge applications.

40|$|Instream wood is {{recognized}} as an important feature linked to channel processes that benefit salmonids. Stream channel assessments and restoration/enhancement efforts often associate salmon habitat quality with the quantity and volume of woody debris. Existing wood targets used to assist resource managers do not adequately account for variations in quantity or volume {{due to differences in}} geomorphology, ecoregions, or disturbance regimes. To address this issue, field data on instream wood quantities and volumes from 150 stream segments draining unmanaged basins within Washington State (without logging, roads, dams, or other human-induced condition that may influence natural wood loading and retention rates) are used to develop target suggestions for management. Based on the assumption that streams draining unmanaged forest basins incorporate the range of conditions to which salmonids and other species have adapted, wood loads in these systems provide a defensible reference for management. Surveyed sites represent a wide array of geomorphic channel types, channel origins, natural disturbances, and climate regions where the process of wood input and distribution has most likely evolved under a natural rate of disturbance, with the exception of potential fire suppression. Analyses of these data imply that the most consistent predictor of wood volumes and quantities is bankfull width (as a function of basin size) and ecoregion. Wood <b>quantity,</b> <b>volume,</b> and mean piece size increased with channel size due to the increased proclivity for fluvial transport and spatial accretion, along with greater lateral area for wood to accumulate. Forest stand characteristics such as stem density and diameter are influenced by distinctive climates particular to each ecoregion, which in turn influence the size and quantity of instream wood. Percentile distributions describe the range of wood quantities and volumes in streams draining unmanaged basins by discrete bankfull width classes for three distinguishable ecoregion groups. The data also support expanded definitions for minimum volumes of "Key Pieces. " Due to both favorable and adverse conditions comprising wood loading ranges; we suggest that the 75 th percentiles in each bankfull width class and ecoregion should be used to represent the lower limit for optimum wood quantities and volumes as an index of habitat quality.

On the territory of the Ovruch-Slovechno mountain ridge entire regions, sites, settlements and workshops that once specialized in slate industry have been discovered. Also, the medieval open-cast mines have been found and investigated. The exploitation of the main varieties of pyrophyllitic slate used to be practiced in those places. The unique complex of natural resources, on the one hand, and favourable social, political, religious and economic conditions, on the other hand, made the start of the Ovruch slate industry possible. The very mineral, i. e. pyrophyllitic slate, has many useful natural qualities. The slate industry is distinguished by the high degree of the development of the manufacture process, the high level of standartization and good quality of the manufactured products. The volume of the manufactured products and used material was outstandingly enormous. At the same time, the products manufactured from pyrophyllitic slate were associated with a high status and high price. One of the main fields {{in the structure of the}} Ovruch pyrophyllitic industry was supply for the construction of monumental churches and palaces.

Georgia State University Introduction: Previous {{research}} has indicated that hunger is associated with the <b>quantity,</b> <b>volume,</b> and macronutrient composition of food intake. Hunger has never been assessed from the viewpoint of real time energy balance, although there is limited research on hunger and eating frequency. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the relationships between real time energy balance, hunger, and body composition in college students between the ages of 18 - 30. Methods: Participants were assessed for body composition using a Tanita scale and energy balance was determined on an hourly basis using NutriTiming® software. A hunger scale was used to assess participant hunger every hour. Results: There is a statistically significant relationship for the entire population between energy balance average and body fat percent (R= - 0. 376; P= 0. 037). Hours spent in energy deficient is positively associated with body fat percent (R= 0. 467; P= 0. 008), while hours spent in an optimal energy balance is negatively associated with body fat percent (R= - 0. 465; P= 0. 009). Hours spent in an energy balance surplus (+ 400 kcals) were not significantly associated with body fat percent. However, hours spent in an anabolic state (3 ̆e 0 kcals) was negatively associated with body fat percent (R=-. 457; P=. 010). Conversely, hours spent in a catabolic state (3 ̆c 0 kcals) were positively associated with body fat percent (R=. 457; P= 0. 10). Using linear regression analysis with body fat percentage as the dependent variables and age, height, weight, gender, and hours in optimal energy balance, we determined that we could predict a large amount of variance in body fat percentage (R=. 931; P= 3 ̆c. 001). The only time during the day that there was a significant correlation between body fat percent and hunger was at 5 pm (R= - 0. 391, P = 0. 029). Conclusions: These data suggest that that the more time spent in energy deficit is associated with a higher body fat percent. This should encourage college students between the age of 18 - 30 to avoid restrictive eating patterns and strive to maintain optimal energy balance in order to achieve a low body fat percent...|$|E
