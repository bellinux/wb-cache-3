In the three decades following World War II that department made notable contributions to the understanding of investment appraisal and the formulation of British - and later European - trade policy.

The economics department then influenced the early stages of the subsequent extensive restructuring of the company, a process that culminated in the demerging of its textile activities as a separately <b>quoted</b> <b>company</b> in March 1990 ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} capital {{structure}} in <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> has received much {{attention in the}} academic literature. Using panel data from quoted as well as non <b>quoted</b> Belgian <b>companies,</b> this paper investigates not only the determinants of capital structure, but also {{the influence of a}} stock listing on the relationship between these determinants and leverage. Overall our empirical results are in line with previous studies and support mainly the Pecking Order theory. Also in line with the predictions of the Pecking Order theory, <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> are less levered, even when controlling for other determinants of capital structure. Furthermore we find that the determinants of capital structure differ to some extend between quoted and non <b>quoted</b> <b>companies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This paper focuses upon {{differences}} in the valuation of UK <b>quoted</b> and unquoted <b>companies.</b> It draws on empirical evidence over the period from 1991 to 1997. It commences with {{an overview of the}} published literature. This suggests a broad spectrum of valuation statistics ranging from very minor discounts for non-listed companies relative to their quoted brethren, up to a discount as high as 40 %. The empirical analysis uses PE ratios, derived from the publication Acquisitions Monthly, in respect of non-listed, private companies selling out in takeover deals. These are compared with average PE ratios for <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Britain. A raw statistic of approximately 40 % was found as the discount for non-listed firms relative to <b>quoted</b> <b>companies.</b> However, this is dramatically different when corrected for size. For size varying from less than GBP 0. 5 million to about GBP 55 million, the discount ranges, respectively, from 16 % to 6 % with an average of around 10 %. Regression equations relating size and PE ratio are presented. Valuation, <b>Quoted</b> <b>Companies,</b> Non-quoted Companies, Discount, Pe Ratios,...|$|R
40|$|With the {{implementation}} of the Transparency Directive, a period of European reform of the regulation of <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> may be coming to a close. In the meantime the Government has become concerned that a possible NASDAQ takeover of the Stock Exchange in London might lead to US style regulation being added to the European and has passed an emergency Investment Exchanges and Clearing Houses Act 2006. This seems a good time to look back at the principal changes to the regulation of UK <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> over the third of century since the UK joined the European Union, in an attempt to see where such regulation has been heading and whether that has been a sensible course.

40|$|This paper scrutinizes {{financial}} leverage behaviour and firm performance of publicly <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Nigeria. Data of Leverage, Profitability and Firm Size were sourced from the Nigerian Stock Exchange Fact-book and Annual Report and Accounts of 120 publicly <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Nigeria {{during the period}} 1990 through 2013. Findings suggest that profitability and firm size had {{a negative effect on}} {{financial leverage}} behaviour of publicly <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Nigeria. Thus, it was recommended that firms should carry out projects that would help enhance size and profitability in all aspect of the firm. Size in terms of assets would help increase the internal funding. This in turn will {{have a positive impact on}} the financial structure of firm as more of internally generated funds will be used instead of external borrowings. Firms should not assume that making of profit shows good application of leverage as this was not found to be true from the analysis. This implies that the result can be relied upon for policy direction...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccounting {{estimates}} {{occur because}} {{a large number}} of items in financial statements cannot be measured precisely but can only be estimated. Significant accounting estimates are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. The aim of the paper was to identify whether Croatian <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> disclose all information about accounting estimates related to the Investment property, as required by IAS 40. The research included 132 <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Croatia that apply IFRSs. The research results showed that investment property has a relatively small share in the structure of total assets of <b>quoted</b> <b>companies</b> in Croatia, which {{is probably one of the}} reasons why related accounting estimates published in the notes are brief and incomplete. The general conclusion is that the notes regarding accounting estimates on investment property are composed of definitions set in the standard, instead of providing more transparent information for investors and other interested users of financial statements. As expected, the companies with the higher share of investment property have shown greater level of transparency, providing additional information which is not required by the standards...|$|R
