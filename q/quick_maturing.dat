40|$|Monepantel (MPTL) {{is one of}} two new {{anthelmintic}} compounds introduced {{onto the}} sheep market to control gastro-intestinal nematodes. Resistance to this compound is rare but has been reported. In order to preserve the efficacy of this and other anthelmintics, it is essential to understand both (a) the mechanisms involved in the selection of resistance and (b) how the parasites evolve to deal with these compounds. To address these questions three MPTL-resistant Teladorsagia circumcincta isolates (MTci 2 - 11, MTci 5 - 13 and MTci 7 - 12) have been artificially selected in vivo from phenotypically characterised parent isolates (MTci 2, MTci 5, MTci 7 respectively). The selection process involved collecting and culturing eggs from surviving worms from sheep administered sub-optimal dosages of MPTL (Zolvix®) to provide infective larvae to infect further sheep until resistant isolates were generated (between 9 and 13 rounds of selection). A controlled efficacy test was conducted using the original parental isolates and the newly generated MPTL resistant isolates (n[*]=[*] 5 per group). Selected isolates were assessed both under anthelmintic stress (Zolvix®, 2. 5 [*]mg/kg bodyweight; MTci-MPTL) and at rest (untreated, MTci-CON). A number of life-history traits were assessed, namely, worm establishment rates, time to patency, faecal egg output, body length of adults and eggs in utero. The estimated resistance status of the selected isolates was confirmed with 48 %, 28 % and 9 % reductions in worm burden at 7 -days post Zolvix® administration for MTci 2 - 11 -MPTL, MTci 5 - 13 -MPTL and MTci 7 - 12 -MPTL, respectively, compared with untreated controls. One of the selected isolates MTci 7 - 12 -CON showed significantly greater total worm burden (p[*]=[*] 0. 025), greater establishment rate (p[*]=[*] 0. 033), decreased time to patency (p[*]=[*] 0. 048), higher cumulative egg outputs (p[*]=[*] 0. 002) compared with its parental derivative MTci 7.

The objectives were (i) {{to ascertain the}} suitability of the climate for growing teff (Eragrostis tef) and barley (Hordeum vulgare); (ii) to determine the onset and length of the growing period (LGP), (iii) to evaluate the traditional method of climate classification, and (iv) to produce comprehensive agro-climatic zones of the Giba catchment. The Ethiopian traditional method of climate classification based on temperature and altitude {{was found to be}} less relevant to crop suitability zoning in semi-arid regions of Northern Ethiopia because within this semi-arid drought-prone environment the rainfall is more important for crop growth than temperature. The LGP ranges from 60 to 100 days over the catchment, increasing from north-east to south-west.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the socio-economic characteristics of participating seed farmers in a community-based seed production scheme organized by the project, Promoting Sustainable Agriculture in Borno State (PROSAB). In addition, it determined the technical efficiency of resource use in PROSAB seed farms. Farm level survey data from 396 seed producers who cultivated maize, cowpea, soybean, rice, groundnut and sorghum were obtained using well structured questionnaires. The production parameters were estimated simultaneously {{with those of the}} models of inefficiency effects. Using the maximum likelihood estimation technique, asymptotic parameter estimates were evaluated to describe production inputs and efficiency determinants. Based on the results of gross margin analysis, the observed profit margins across the seed types conclusively revealed that every one naira spent in cultivating the seeds, some levels of financial benefits were derived as indicated by the output/input indices. Results further revealed that labour, farm size, seed and fertilizer were the most important inputs across the six crops. Inefficiency model analysis further revealed that the duration of the crop grown and ecological region predominantly affected the seed farm level of technical efficiency in input use. A mean technical efficiency of between 55 % and 58 % was identified, meaning that seed production under the scheme can still be increase by about 45 % and 42 % using available technology. The study recommends that, given the significance of seeds that have a shorter duration to maturity, <b>quick</b> <b>maturing</b> varieties of seeds should be promoted among farmers in the study area.

5000|$|Small organisms {{generally}} have shorter generation times and are <b>quick</b> to <b>mature</b> and reproduce (May, 1978; Denney et al. 2002; Savage et al. 2004).

40|$|The cheilostome bryozoan Fenestrulina rugula {{is a major}} {{component}} of the encrusting fauna of physically disturbed shallow water habitats in Antarctica. On rocks collected from Rothera Point, Adelaide Island, F. rugula was the dominant occupier of space (88 % of all bryozoans, 76 % of all fauna), though spirorbid polychaetes showed more colonisation events per unit area. Growth rate was relatively rapid in comparison with other polar bryozoans, but slower than temperate or tropical species. In fully reproductive colonies almost 80 % of zooids carried ovicells. Colonies whose growth brought them into contact with other encrusting fauna (usually another colony of F. rugula) produced smaller zooids and initiated ovicell production earlier than unrestrained colonies. Analysis of overgrowth interactions showed that F. rugula was a relatively poor competitor compared with other encrusting bryozoans, and most within-species interactions were indeterminate. Population mortality was relatively high, averaging 89 % per annum, although not as high as in some other species from ephemeral habitats.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} in drylands suffers from drought and in sub-Saharan Africa, only about 15 % of the terrestrial rainwater {{is used by}} plants for food, fodder and fiber. Drought was the major cause of crop failure and food insecurity {{for the last three}} decades in the semi-arid northern Ethiopia. Information from field experiments, farmers and FAO’s AquaCrop model were used to understand and evaluate characteristics of the local climate in relation to drought and its mitigation. Farmers often have a different perception of drought than scientists. This gap was solved with an improved analysis of rainfall data that focuses on drought. Drought in semi-arid north Ethiopia can be due to (1) a too short growing season due to late start and/or early cessation of rains, (2) a too long dry spell at critical growth stage or (3) due to total failure of rain. Different types of drought have different coping strategies. Coping strategies for drought are adaption of sowing date, in-situ water conservation and water harvesting for deficient irrigation. Physical water conservation structures need to account for extreme variations in rainfall typical for most drylands. Ridging is most promising while mulching is no longer promoted. Agronomic measures {{such as the use of}} <b>quick</b> <b>maturing</b> and drought resistant crops are often more attainable than adoption of water conservation practices. Crop failure is often more due to water scarcity than to lack of fertility. However, when agricultural {{production in}}creases, water and nutrients often alternate as production limiting factors. The strong water-nutrient synergy in drylands requires precision fertilization and plant density adjustment. Farmers also have a different opinion about climate change; farmers’ climate change has more to do with desertification.

40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the contribution of Practical Action Organization(NGOs) to the conservation and rehabilitation of natural resources in Kassala state, particularly forests resources, on sustainable basis. Two types of data were used in this research, namely; primary data and secondary data. The primary data were collected using different methods of the social survey, while the secondary data were collected from the archives of the Forest National Corporation (annual reports and files) and Practical Action Organization's documents (baseline survey and quarterly reports). The main findings of the research were; the initiatives of the local people {{to be involved in the}} project activities came from the staff of the Practical Action organization. Few respondents were consulted during the planning phase of the project. Fluctuation of rainfall was the main climatic factor that affected resilience of the local communities followed by frequent drought cycles. The main impacts of climate change were the prevalence of acute poverty in the study area. Moreover, agricultural production and animal rearing, which represents the main sources of income, were highly affected by climate change. Adaptation of the local communities to climate change is represented in adoption of new crops (<b>quick</b> <b>maturing</b> varieties) and adoption of terraces intervention. Different designs of terraces were introduced by Practical Action Organization as a modification of the traditional terrace which is autonomous (locally driven). Different factors attributed to the low level of adoption of the new terraces designs. To enhance resilience of local communities, the project provided the local communities with the necessary inputs (equipment and simple tools for the construction of the terrace) besides intensive awareness campaign. Despite the potential assistance provided by the organization, still the participation of the iv local communities in the project activities lag far behind expectations. The local people perceive the interventions of the Organization as sustainable due to intensive training and continuous flow of inputs. The Organization attempted to tackle forestry issues in its activities, but limited success was achieved. The main forestry activities included; agroforestry, afforestation program (animal routes and around water depressions), homestead plantations, energy substitutes and mesquite eradication. The main conclusions drawn from this research are; (i) Practical Action Organization improved the adaptation measures in the study area. (ii) the individual extension method is the best among other methods for the sensitization and mobilization of local communities.

40|$|The recent {{recurrent}} droughts {{and famine}} {{in parts of}} Africa have revived iriterest in an ancient technology, that of water harvesting. This system of water conservation, involving the collection and storage of run-off from infrequent storms and flash floods, {{is known to have}} supported a flourishing agriculture in the Negev Desert more than 5, 000 years ago. Modern experimental systems suggest there is considerable scope for extending the traditional schemes still in limited use in arid areas {{all over the world to}} this day. Aerial photographs and careful fieldwork have allowed researchers to piece together and, in some cases, reconstruct the ancient water harvesting systems of the Negev Desert. The simplest system involved the building of low stone walls across the dry desert valleys, or wadis. In this way a series of terraces was formed, so that during the occasional flash floods water was retained for long enough behind each wall to allow it to soak into the terrace soil. This infrequent soaking provided a sufficient reserve of water in the root zone for a variety of crops to be grown. In larger valleys,. where torrential floodwater would have destroyed the terrace walls, a dam was built part of the way across the valley to divert some of the stormwater onto the adjoining terraced fields. In small tributary valleys, elaborate systems of stone barriers and channels were used to check sheet runoff from the hills surrounding the farmsteads and direct it onto the terraced fields below. Complex systems of gates and stone steps, or spillways, between terraces allowed the farmer considerable control over how much water each terraced plot received Trapping water and silt Although the ancient systems of the Negev Desert are the best known and most researched examples of water harvesting, similar systems are known to have existed in arid areas elsewhere. There is evidence that the Mexican Indians created garden plots by building loose rock dams across gullies and valleys more than 1, 000 years ago. These not only trapped water but silt as well so that over a period of time a deep and fertile alluvial soil accumulated behind each stone barrier. The North American Indians in Arizona and Colorado were also familiar with water harvesting techniques over 500 years ago. The ancient Persians dug pits in gently sloping land to trap water for their crops, and water harvesting techniques have a long tradition in many other parts of the Middle East and in parts of North Africa such as Algeria and Tunisia as well. Limited use is still made of traditional water harvesting methods in many areas to this day. The Bedouin exploit the ancient terraced wadis in the Negev by sowing a crop of barley as the floodwaters retreat. A similarly opportunistic form of water harvesting is practised in north-west Kenya, where sorghum is grown in naturally occurring depress~ons where the rain water collects. In Sudan, high retaining walls are built on the gentle slopes to the east of the Nile to hold back floodwater for long enough to saturate the soil and allow a <b>quick</b> <b>maturing</b> crop such as millet to be grown as the soil water recedes. Floodwater from the mounts in North and South Yemen is diverted and trapped in ponds made by building up high earth banks, and similar methods of water harvesting are to be found in India and Pakistan. Impervious surfaces The two features common to all water harvesting systems, whether ancient, traditional or modern, are the catchment area and the storage area, or reservoir. Ideally the surface of the catchment area should be impervious to water to allow maximum run-off to occur. In some cases such catchments occur naturally, but in others the catchment surface is treated to improve run-off or an artificial surface mav be used. Granite or sandstone rock outcrops, and soils such as the loess of the Negev Desert which crust over as soon as rain falls, need little modification, although clearing rubble, filling cracks and removing vegetation can all help improve run-off. In less favourable situations run-off can be increased by smoothing and compacting the soil surface. An example is the roaded catchment system, widely used to collect water for livestock in Western Australia. Here road construction equipment is used to compact and camber the soil surface, to form a series of parallel roads measuring between 5 and 12 m from crest to crest, on a stretch of sloping ground between 50 and 300 m long. Storm water collects in the furrows between the roads and flows into a channel at the lower end of the catchment, from where it is led into a reservoir. Soil surfaces which have been compacted for other reasons, such as roads, airstrips and school playgrounds, can sometimes be exploited to provide run-off water for crops or livestock. Careful design and regular maintenance is necessary to avoid soil erosion with compacted catchments, although in some systems the washing down of soil can be beneficial by filling up small depressions in the catchment surface and building up soil fertility in the area where the crop is grown. Chemical treatment has also been used to improve surface run-off mainly in experimental systems. In Arizona, clay soils have been treated with sodium salts; these cause the clay particles to disperse so blocking the pores in between. Treatment with water repellents such as paraffin and silicon wax has also been tried. Surface sprays of asphalt have been tested on the sand dunes of Rajasthan in India and the Sahara in Libya and might be a feasible option for wealthy countries with oil. Other examples of high tech water harvesting have been tried in Arizona, Utah and Hawaii, where butyl rubber sheeting has been used to line both the catchment and the reservoir to provide water for livestock or domestic purposes. Although there have been problems as the rubber deteriorates and as a result of rodent damage, these schemes have generally been succesful Run-off water once collected has to be stored. In most of the traditional systems described, where the water is used for growing crops, the storage area is the soil itself. Deep water-retentive soils are therefore ideal. But if the soil is very freedraining, evaporative losses are high, run-off is excessive or if the water is to be used for cattle or domestic purposes, then a surface reservoir is needed for storage. Such reservoirs may range from simple pits dug in the ground, sealed by puddling with clay, to more substantial tanks and cisterns. Water losses as a result of evaporation can be reduced by covering the surface of the reservoir with materials such as wax, polystyrene or foamed rubber sheeting. Ensuring minimum yields At the Desert Runoff Farm Unit in the Negev Desert, some of the ancient run-off farming systems have been carefully re-created and now serve as experimental farms. Here, where the scanty and unpredictable rainfall is less than 200 mm a year, a tremendous range of crops has been successfully grown using harvested water alone. These include grasses and cereals (such as wheat, barley, sorghum and millet), legumes (lentils, chickpeas and novel varieties of beans), grape vines, soft fruit (logan berries and fruit, nut and fuelwood trees plums, apricots, peaches, pomegranates, cherries apples, figs, olives, carobs, pistachios, Acacia, Prosopis, Leucaena and Eucalyptus). In good years yields are comparable with crops grown in irrigated conditions but even in drought years there is usually some yield. Cereals, almonds, pistachios and olives do particularly well. Annual crops which are <b>quick</b> <b>maturing</b> (such as millet) or deep rooting (such as sorghum) and perennials which can tolerate both drought and occasional inundation are those which do best. Dr Pedro Berliner, head of the Desert Farms Research Unit, says 'We believe this type of agriculture can help solve some of the more urgent needs of the sub-Saharan belt and other similarly drought-stricken parts of the world'. Others are more guarded in their optimism. Kutsch, a German researcher who has identified a number of areas in Africa likely to be suitable for run-off farming, points out that only in northern Africa, where rain occurs in the cooler winter months. are conditions directly comparable with those in the Negev Desert. In the dry areas of tropical Africa, where temperatures are higher and any rain usually falls in the hot summer months, rapid water loss from the crop and the soil may mean that only schemes where the annual rainfall exceeds 300 mm will succeed. Mathematical models which take account of weather data and soil conditions can now help in the selection of areas suitable for rainwater harvesting and in the design of appropriate systems. But where few records exist site selection is likely to depend, as in the past, on local knowledge and intuition, with schemes being modified or abandoned in the light of experience. Farmers in the Turkana District of northern Kenya use the growth of native plants to guide their choice of suitable sites. The dwarf shrub Duosperma indicates a deep loamy soil, whereas a particular Acacia indicates a site liable to waterlogging. For pasture improvement, semi-circular barriers of earth or stone can be constructed at intervals down sloping land. Grass seed is then broadcast and as rainwater washes over the surface, both water and seed collect behind each barrier allowing clumps of grass to establish which then soon spread. To be successful, new schemes need to take account not only of physical conditions but of local social and cultural traditions as well. For example nomadic people such as the Turkana may be reluctant to be tied to one area in order to keep elaborate systems maintained. However existing schemes show that water harvesting can do much to improve conditions in drought stricken areas. They not only provide people with water but also help control the soil erosion which occurs during sudden heavy storms. Harvesting relies only on local water and systems can be constructed using locally available materials and skills. Micro-catchments are particularly simple to lay out and maintain. In relatively wet areas water harvesting can allow crops to be planted or provide extra water for small irrigation schemes. In arid areas it can allow other sources of water to be reserved for emergencies, and so make the difference between life and death. The recent recurrent droughts and famine in parts of Africa have revived iriterest in an ancient technology, that of water harvesting. This system of water conservation, involving the collection and storage of run-off from infrequent storms and [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Thirty six {{short staple}} {{varieties}} and thirteen long staple varieties were grown in a replicated field trial on the Safford Agricultural Center in Graham county. Stoneville 324 {{was the highest}} yielding short staple variety in the trial with a yield of 4733 pounds per acre of seed cotton. The average yields of short staple varieties was greater than in 1991. Long staple cotton did not fare {{as well with the}} weather as did the short staple. The yield of S- 6 was about 100 pounds of seed cotton less than in 1991. The good news is that other long staple varieties are being developed that can out yield S - 6 in the high desert area. O & A Pima was the highest yielding variety with a yield that exceeded S- 6 by about 500 pounds of seed cotton per acre. S- 7 followed closely behind O & A Pima 4 and both <b>matured</b> <b>quicker</b> than S- 6. Heat unit data from {{the past couple of years}} are given in this report along with the average heat unit accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of complex genotype-by-environment-by-management {{interactions}} is crucial to identify risks and opportunities for increasing maize yield and profitability in rainfed production systems. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) define the conditions where hybrids of different maturity and plant densities are viable options in terms of improving productivity, and (ii) quantify the risk levels associated with different genotype-by-management combinations in relation to target environments. Responses to plant density were analysed on field experimentation with different genotypes representing early, medium and late maturity types and 2, 4 and 6 plant/m 2 plant densities at three major or potential dryland maize production environments in Queensland, Australia. Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) -Maize module was employed to simulate yield responses and compute the cumulative probability distribution. APSIM simulations suggested that the risk of expecting a yield level less than 2 t/ha increased up to about 17 and 27 % for <b>quick</b> and late <b>maturing</b> types, respectively, when density increased to 10 plants/m 2 in marginal environments such as Emerald. In relatively better environments, however the risk increased only up to 10 % for late hybrids, and 7 % for a quick hybrid at 10 plants/m 2. In both high and low potential environments, choice of hybrids and plant densities should be based on seasonal weather forecasts to minimize risks and maximize opportunities for higher yields...|$|R
40|$|Tectonic {{inheritance}} {{acquired from}} past geological events {{can control the}} formation of new plate boundaries. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore the role of inherited NE and NW trending fabrics and their rheological influence on the propagation of Oligocene-Miocene strike-slip faulting that matured to become the Australian-Pacific plate boundary fault in southern New Zealand. Strain weakening plays a significant role in controlling the formation, growth and evolution of strain localization. In this study, three-dimensional thermo-mechanical models have been used to explore the effect of strain weakening on the Oligocene-Miocene self-organization of strain localization. Strain weakening is simulated through decreasing either the coefficient of friction of upper crust, its cohesion, or the rheological viscosity contrast between the inherited structures and their surrounding wall rocks. Viscosity contrast is obtained by varying the viscosity of inherited structures. Softening coefficient (a) is a measure of strain weakening. Our experiments robustly demonstrate that a primary boundary shear zone becomes <b>mature</b> <b>quicker</b> when softening coefficients are increased. Deformation is focused along narrow high-strain shear zones in the centre of the model when the softening coefficients are high, whereas the strain is more diffuse with many shear zones spread over the model and possibly some high-strain shear zones focused near one border at lower softening coefficients. Varying the viscosity contrast has less effect on the distribution of maximum finite strain. Under simple-shear boundary conditions, NW trending inherited structures make a major contribution to forming early zones of highly focused strain, up to a shear strain of about gamma = 3. 7. During this process, most NE-trending structures move and rotate passively, accommodate less strain, or even be abandoned through time...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{studies on}} {{elasmobranchs}} are challenging {{due to the}} difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of animals of different age cohorts. The brown banded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum is a good model in this regard as it is abundant and readily available in the wild, is <b>quick</b> to <b>mature,</b> is frequently housed and bred in captivity and is a relatively small species of shark. Whilst there are important factors that must be considered when comparing the retinal development of animals raised in captivity to those caught from the wild, the use of C. punctatum represents an outstanding opportunity to study {{the development of the}} elasmobranch visual system from pre-hatching embryonic to adult life stages. In this study, the developing eye and retina of C. punctatum were studied using light and electron microscopy, electroretinography (ERG) and microspectrophotometry (MSP). To provide a source of early-stage animals, and to investigate the effects of environmental factors (such as temperature) on physical development, a captive breeding program was established at the University of Queensland. Sharks sourced from this facility were supplemented with animals bred at UnderWater World, Sea World and caught from the wild. Monitoring the fecundity, embryonic development, growth and viability of captive C. punctatum showed that females lay an average of 115. 3 eggs, 38 of which were viable and 21. 4 % of which hatched. Embryos have an average gestation of 153 days post deposition (dpd; temp: 21 - 25 º C) and embryonic growth is most rapid from 99 dpd until hatching. The eye of C. punctatum develops early in embryogenesis, with visible optic vesicles bulging at 27 dpd. Recent advances in fixation and processing techniques for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have yielded improved levels of ultrastructural detail in a variety of tissue types. Consequently, in addition to conventional chemical fixation (CF) methods, the retina of C. punctatum was also processed using microwave chemical fixation (MCF) and high pressure freezing (HPF), and the resulting ultrastructure compared. Both MCF and HPF produced superior retinal ultrastructure compared to conventional CF, evidenced by higher resolution of ultrastructural detail and fewer artefacts. MCF provided the best, consistent ultrastrucutral results. By examining the time-course of retinal cell differentiation, it was found that ganglion and Müller cells are the first to differentiate, at approximately 81 dpd. The interneurons differentiate next, beginning with the amacrine cells (81 dpd), followed by the bipolar cells (101 dpd) and horizontal cells (124 dpd). The adult retina is duplex and rod and cone photoreceptors are differentiated and synaptic connections are formed by 124 dpd. Topographic analysis of retinal neuron sub-types reveals that C. punctatum undergoes rapid changes in ganglion cell distribution during embryogenesis. High levels of apoptosis, especially around the retinal periphery, result in relatively higher cell densities in the central retina, which progressively extend nasally and temporally to form a meridional band. C. punctatum develops a horizontal streak and shows only minor changes in topography during growth. Only basal levels of apoptosis are seen post-hatching. In the adult shark, the total ganglion cell number reaches 547, 881. The mean and highest retinal ganglion cell densities reach a peak around hatching (3, 228 cells mm- 2 and 4, 983 cells mm- 2, respectively). Using measurements of lens focal length and ganglion cell density, the calculated maximum spatial resolving power (assuming a hexagonal mosaic) increases from 1. 47 cycles degree- 1 during embryogenesis to 4. 29 cycles degree- 1 in adults. The addition of a high ganglion cell density area within the visual streak and an increasing spatial resolving power over post-hatching development suggest an increased prey targeting and capture ability for this species. Using ERG, it is shown that C. punctatum becomes responsive to light at 127 dpd and light sensitivity peaks around the time of hatching, with a slight decrease post-hatching. C. punctatum maintains a flicker fusion frequency (FFF; an indicator for temporal resolution) at 7 - 22 Hz through juvenile stages), which is relatively low compared to other marine predators. ERG results suggest that this species is adapted to low light vision with low temporal resolution. The early differentiation, development and functionality of the visual system in C. punctatum allows for a period of synaptic maturation and potentially the ability of embryonic predator avoidance. The retina of C. punctatum contains a rod visual pigment with a wavelength of maximum absorbance (λmax) at 500 nm and cone visual pigment with a λmax at 532 nm; the max values of these pigments do not change during development. Rod and cone outer segments differentiate at 113 days post deposition (dpd), lengthen during embryogenesis and accumulate pigment throughout life. Although the photoreceptors develop and differentiate well in advance of hatching, there is considerable variation in outer segment length and pigment density during embryogenesis, which suggests that these cells are developing up until hatching. C. punctatum {{does not appear to have}} the potential for colour vision based on the lack of two cone photoreceptor types each containing a visual pigment maximally sensitive to different parts of the visual spectrum, but appears specialised for dim-light contrast vision...|$|R
