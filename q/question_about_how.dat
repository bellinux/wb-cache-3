We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|Syntactic {{dependencies}} are {{the focus}} of most work in dependency grammar, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many dependency grammars can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of dependency grammars is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of constituency grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic constituency tests being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis constituency tests. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.|$|E

500|$|Following the setback in Vienna and Berlin Crisis of 1961, {{as well as}} the Soviet {{decision}} to resume testing in August (attributed by Moscow to a changed international situation and French nuclear tests), Kennedy faced mounting pressure from the Department of Defense and nuclear laboratories to set aside the dream of a test ban. In June 1961, following stalled talks in Geneva, Kennedy had argued that Soviet negotiating behavior raised [...] "a serious <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> long we can safely continue on a voluntary basis a refusal to undertake tests in this country without any assurance that the Russians are not testing." [...] Whether or not the Soviet Union had actually conducted secret tests was a matter of debate within the Kennedy administration. A team led by physicist Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky reported that while the Soviet Union could have secretly tested weapons, there was no evidence indicating that it actually had. Panofsky's findings were dismissed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as [...] "assertive, ambiguous, semiliterate and generally unimpressive." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to pluralize acronyms. Often {{a writer}} will add an 's' {{following}} an apostrophe, as in [...] "PC's".

The Modern Language Association and American Psychological Association prohibit apostrophes from {{being used to}} pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so [...] "compact discs" [...] would be [...] "CDs" [...] or [...] "C.D.s"), whereas the New York Times style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring [...] "PC's, TV's and VCR's").|$|E

Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including online banking, online shopping, and other now commonplace things. Responding to a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: [...] "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, , but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need {{in the course of}} living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{there is}} a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> {{separate}} {{from the idea of}} -genes birth and begetting the cited uses of monogenes in the sense of [...] "unique" [...] truly are. For example, the ending -genes is arguably not redundant even in the sense of [...] "only" [...] as per when Clement of Rome (96 AD), and later Origen, Cyril and others, employ monogenes to describe the rebirth of the phoenix. At issue is whether Clement is merely stressing monos unique, or using monogenes to indicate unique in its method of rebirth, or possibly {{that there is only one}} single bird born and reborn. Likewise in Plato's Timaeus, the [...] "only-begotten and created Heaven", is still unique in how it is begotten, in comparison to the begetting of animals and men, just as Earth and Heaven give birth to Ocean and Tethys. Of the Liddell Scott references for [...] "unique" [...] (monogenes being used purely as monos) that leaves only Parmenides, which (as above) is no longer considered a likely reading of the Greek text.|$|E
