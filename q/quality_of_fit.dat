30|$|This {{study showed}} that [11 C]flumazenil {{kinetics}} is different between rats and humans, and indicate that kinetic models used in clinical studies are not necessarily suited in the pre-clinical setting. For high-density regions, both 1 TCM and 2 TCM estimated comparable VT values and resulted in similar <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits</b> (AIC). However, {{the application of the}} 2 TCM in low-density regions resulted in higher <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits,</b> both from visual inspection and AIC values. Moreover, the clinically applied 1 TCM was not able to satisfactorily fit the data (visual inspection) of those regions, nor in the case of pre-saturation with cold flumazenil. Therefore, the 2 TCM is the preferred plasma input model for the quantification of [11 C]flumazenil in the rat brain. Among the various reference tissue models tested, SRTM was preferred providing BPND estimates in good agreement with plasma input 2 TCM based DVR– 1 values.|$|R

We start with two simple model input I^ 2 χ(ω), calculate the optical scattering rates at selected temperatures using the model input spectral density functions and a generalized Allen's formula, then extract back I^ 2 χ(ω) at each temperature from the calculated optical scattering rate using the maximum entropy method (MEM) which {{has been used for}} analysis of optical data of high-temperature superconductors including cuprates, and finally compare the resulting I^ 2 χ(ω) with the input ones. From this approach we find that the inversion process can recover the input I^ 2 χ(ω) almost perfectly when the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits</b> is good enough and also temperature smearing (or thermal broadening) effects appear in the I^ 2 χ(ω) when the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits</b> is not good enough. We found that the coupling constant and the logarithmically averaged frequency are robust to the temperature smearing effects and/or the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fits.</b> We use these robust properties of the two quantities as criterions to check whether experimental data have intrinsic temperature-dependent evolutions or not. We carefully apply the MEM to two material systems (one optimally doped and the other underdoped cuprates) and conclude that the I^ 2 χ(ω) extracted from the optical data contain intrinsic temperature-dependent evolutions.

A total of 1,007 Panteras reached the United States that first year.

Subsequently, Ford increased their involvement in the production of the later cars with the introduction of precision stampings for body panels which resulted in improved overall quality. Several modifications were made for the 1972 model year Panteras. A new 4 Bolt Main Cleveland Engine, also 351 cu in, was used with lower compression ratio (from 11:1 to 8.6:1, chiefly to meet US emissions standards and run on lower octane standard fuel) but with the more aggressive [...] "Cobra Jet" [...] camshaft (featuring the same lift and duration as the 428 Cobra Jet's factory performance cam) in an effort to reclaim some of the power lost through the reduction in compression along with a dual point distributor.

We intend to alter the calibration techniques and parameter values to examine which method is the most consistent with the market.

Nevertheless, research on the body shapes of South African women is ongoing (Makhanya, 2012). According to the preliminary findings of Makhanya’s (2012) research, 59. 26 % of South African female students of African descent have a triangular body shape. The triangular body shape differs from the ideal body shape that ready-to-wear apparel sizing is presently based on, and is a contributing factor to the problems experienced with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>fit</b> of ready-to-wear apparel by South African women of African descent. Therefore, the aim of this exploratory study was to develop experimental size specifications for the body measurements required for a basic sheath dress for South African female students of African descent with a triangular body shape. The students were of medium height, aged between 18 and 25 years, in the size 6 / 30 to size 14 / 38 size range, and enrolled at the University of Pretoria. The experimental size specifications were developed by statistically analysing an anthropometric database of female students of the University of Pretoria using regression analysis.
