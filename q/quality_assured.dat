Foundation training focusses on the seven principles of the MMC training ethos: trainee centred, competency assessed, service based, <b>quality</b> <b>assured,</b> flexible, coached, and structured & streamlined. Graduates are still a year away from obtaining full registration with the General Medical Council. During this year trainees are legally only able to work in certain supervised jobs, as a Foundation House Officer 1 (FHO1), and cannot legally practise independently, and {{it is the responsibility of}} the medical school they attended to supervise this year until they are fully registered with the General Medical Council. [...] Therefore, the first year of the Foundation Programme forms the final year of medical school.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s American and European governments and {{business}} leaders had become increasingly concerned about competition from Japan. [...] Many decided to adopt some Japanese industrial practices, including quality management, which was thought to have played a large part in the Japanese economic miracle. Beginning in the early 1980s, the quality standard BS 5750 (1979) became widely adopted by British companies. Yarsley Technical Centre already had a strong background in standards and accreditation and, in 1985, Fulmer established Yarsley <b>Quality</b> <b>Assured</b> Firms (YQAF) as an independent certification body, supported by the UK Department of Trade and Industry, which assessed conformity to BS 5750 and certified conforming companies. YQAF's certification service was overseen by an independent Certification Board under an independent chairman, thus ensuring {{that there was no}} conflict of interest with YQAF's consultancy services.|$|E

40|$|A growing {{scholarship}} links quality-assured multiple-choice {{testing to}} accountable outputs. This article {{looks at the}} use of multiple choice assessment and the <b>quality</b> <b>assuring</b> of item development through a structured process of systematic steps. A qualitative investigation was undertaken based on individual e-interviews with participants who are experts in {{the use of multiple}}choice question assessment. The investigation was conducted at the College of Education of a higher education institution. The findings confirm the potential of multiple-choice assessment to test factual knowledge and higher-order learning. The findings also show that the main components in a systematic process of <b>quality</b> <b>assuring</b> the construction of multiple-choice items include training in the skills of item development, peer reviewing of constructed items, professional editing, and the interpretation of statistical analysis of student performance and student feedback for future constructions. The findings contribute to literature that argues for credible assessment practices to ascertain relevant outputs. College of Educatio...|$|R

40|$|A new quality {{assurance}} system was developed and implemented operationally for the National Climatic Data Center’s Cooperative Summary of the Day (SOD) {{quality assurance}} process. The system uses rules-based GIS technology to fully automate spatial quality assurance of observed daily temperature values. Gridded fields are derived from quality controlled ASOS (Automated Surface Observation System) and AWOS (Automated Weather Observing System) hourly and daily temperature values as “ground truth ” to <b>quality</b> <b>assure</b> the Cooperative Observers Network (COOP) daily temperature data. This automated temperature validation (TempVal) system replaces the interactive Graphical Edit Analysis (GEA) temperature validation system. Parallel tests {{of the old and}} new systems were made using regression analysis. Manual comparisons between the systems using outliers exceeding a pre-described threshold were performed. The results of the tests will be shown. Higher confidence in TempVal is attributed to a change in methodology (using grid fields) and access to higher quality data for use as “ground truth”. The GEA methodology derives and uses three climatological best neighbors to <b>quality</b> <b>assure</b> a flagged data value. Additionally, TempVal is able to estimate daily replacement temperatures for any number of missing days whereas the GEA system can only generate temperature values under certain conditions...|$|R
