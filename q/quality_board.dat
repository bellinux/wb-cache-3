25|$|The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) {{has made}} many changes since 2008, {{including}} doubling {{the number of}} oil and gas inspection staff and implementing new water quality standards. In 2010, amendments to Pennsylvania law regarding casing and cementing requirements for wells were revised and routine inspections of existing wells are now required. Gas companies are also required to submit pre-drilling water test results to the PA DEP and to water supply owners under these new amendments. Also in 2010, the Pennsylvania Environmental <b>Quality</b> <b>Board</b> revised regulations regarding wastewater treatment and disposal. Only wastewater that is treated at a centralized wastewater treatment facility and that meets certain quality standards can be disposed of in surface waters.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relation}} between comprehensive measures of <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> and the cost {{as well as the}} non-price terms of bank loans. We show that firms with higher <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> and even a single (non-insider) advisory board member borrow at lower interest rates. This relation exists even after controlling for ownership structure, CEO compensation policy, and shareholder protection as well as the size and financial characteristics of the borrower. We also show that <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> and other governance characteristics influence the likelihood that loans will have covenant requirements, but the relations differ by covenant type. Firms with high <b>quality</b> <b>boards</b> are less likely to have loans with financial ratio restrictions or collateral requirements, though these covenants are more likely when CEO cash compensation is high or when the percentage of incentive-based pay is low. Overall, the <b>quality</b> of the <b>board</b> {{plays an important role in}} lowering the cost of debt. ...|$|R

2500|$|In July 1972 the Environmental <b>Quality</b> <b>Board</b> of Puerto Rico, {{because of}} growing {{interest}} {{in the development of}} the islands, made a full scientific assessment of Mona and Monita using a local team of volunteer scientists. A two-volume report with maps of natural and historic features was produced. [...] It evaluated the climate, geology and mineral resources, soils, water resources, archaeology, vegetation, animals and insects, and pelagic life around the island. Shortly thereafter geotechnical and bathymetry studies were conducted by engineering firms to determine the feasibility of using Mona as a deepwater terminal for transferring oil from supertankers to smaller tankers which would continue to the mainland US; this plan was never implemented.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{frontier}} in manatee research pivots on population health assessment and habitat use {{through the use}} of radio-telemetry. Thus, in the coming years, the PRMCC will focus its research on manatees through a cooperative project titled [...] "Puerto Rico Manatee Health Assessment and Telemetry Project". This research will be led by the PRMCC together with the Inter American University, PRDNER, USFWS, USGS Sirenia Project, Puerto Rico’s Environmental <b>Quality</b> <b>Board</b> (PREQB), San Juan Bay Estuary Program (SJBEP), University of Florida’s Veterinary School, and the Georgia Aquarium. Since detrimental activities that have led to the manatee endangerment include habitat degradation, which in turn influences manatee health and the particular use of specific habitats, the PRMCC seeks to ascertain the effects of these two factors in the survival of the manatee in Puerto Rico. The study will be conducted in two important estuarine habitats for the species: Jobos Bay and San Juan Bay. Health assessments are a valuable tool to determine the fitness, specifically related to environmental and medical issues of any population of wildlife. Telemetry studies provide hard evidence on the preference and use of any wildlife to a specific habitat and its use of the resources (food, water, shelter, etc.) needed for survival. Wild manatees will be medically examined and tested for signs of health issues. Once examined and samples are collected for analysis, the manatees will be fitted with a satellite tag to monitor their movement and habitat preference for a year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the impact of fund <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> on (a) the fund flow-performance relation, (b) persistence in fund performance, and (c) a fund‘s potential change of strategy following a period of underperformance. We use Morningstar‘s <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> ratings as a proxy for the quality of the fund‘s board and document three main results. One, we show that funds that rank in the bottom quintile of rankings based on past performance, experience significantly lower flows at the margin when their <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> rating is poor compared to when the <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> is rated as good. Two, we document a significant relationship between <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> and short-term performance persistence. For funds with bad boards, a negative past alpha predicts future negative alpha but the evidence of positive performance persistence is much weaker than for funds with good boards. Three, we show that a change in fund strategy following poor performance is more likely for funds with good boards compared to funds with bad boards. Our results suggest that measures of fund <b>board</b> <b>quality</b> contain valuable information with regard to a fund’s incentives and strategy choice and hence are potentially useful for investor decision making...|$|R
