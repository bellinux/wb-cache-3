5|$|Brand {{was taken}} to Cairo, where he was <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> the British for weeks. On 22 June he was interviewed by Ira Hirschmann of the American War Refugee Board; Hirschmann wrote a {{positive}} report about Brand, but his influence was limited.

5|$|In 1997 Briggs and Nedin {{reported}} from South Australia a new specimen of Myoscolex {{that was much}} better preserved than previous specimens, leading them to conclude {{that it was a}} close relative of Opabinia—although this interpretation was later <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> Dzik, who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, its {{identification}} as a Roman road has been <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> academics, and alternative interpretations suggested for its purpose and date of construction.

5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|Little Red Riding Hood {{discovers that}} the Big Bad Wolf has {{disguised}} himself as Granny. Red's grandma {{jumps out of}} the closet tied up just as the axe-wielding woodsman bursts through the window, startling everyone. The police quickly arrive, and Red, Wolf, Granny, and the Woodsman are <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> Detective Nicky Flippers about the events leading up to the incident.|$|E

5|$|The siege left several traces in {{the legends}} of the nascent Muslim world, {{although}} it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously, led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result, the veracity of Theophanes's account has been <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> recent scholarship, which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{fair use}} issue, Combs and Bad Boy never raised the legal {{concept of the}} fair use {{doctrine}} in their defense. This decision was <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> some legal experts: Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project at Stanford Law School criticized Combs and Bad Boy for not defending the legality of sampling and suggested {{that they might have}} refused to raise such a defense because they feared it could later imperil their control over their own music.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the poet}} was {{moving away from}} Surrealism, his {{adherence}} to strict Marxism-Leninism was reportedly <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> both the PCF and the Soviet Union. Semiotician Philip Beitchman places their attitude in connection with Tzara's own vision of Utopia, which combined communist messages with Freudo-Marxist psychoanalysis and made use of particularly violent imagery. Reportedly, Tzara refused to be enlisted in supporting the party line, maintaining his independence and refusing to take the forefront at public rallies.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam were <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They {{admitted}} {{they had taken}} the boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|Cooley was {{appointed}} as an appraiser {{of property and}} slaves for Union Bank of Florida.

Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for Monroe County to the Territorial Legislative Council. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> the Key West Inquirer. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret balloting. In Key West, Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.|$|E

5|$|Edmontosaurin {{specimens}} {{from the}} Prince Creek Formation of Alaska formerly assigned to Edmontosaurus sp. {{have been given}} their own genus and species name, Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis. However, the identification of Ugrunaaluk as a separate genus was <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> a 2017 study from Hai Xing and colleagues, who regarded it as a nomen dubium indistinguishable from other Edmontosaurus. Edmontosaurus was also reported from the Javelina Formation of Big Bend National Park, western Texas based on TMM 41442-1, but was later referred to Kritosaurus cf. navajovius by Wagner (2001), before being assigned to Kritosaurus sp. by Lehman et al.

In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere on the train, the Red-Haired Man intercepts and strangles Zama.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, wildcat {{action was}} taken by union members over a {{decision}} by Gate Gourmet not to renew the contracts of 670 workers {{and replace them with}} agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers. In October 2006, BA became involved in a civil rights dispute when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace bearing the cross, a religious symbol. BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> British politicians such as the former Home Secretary John Reid and the former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934 the Black Hawks {{were on a}} train back to Chicago when Gardiner felt {{an intense}} pain in his throat that spread {{to the rest of}} his body, notably his kidneys. When <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> Tommy Gorman about his issue, Gardiner lied to Gorman and insisted it was only a minor headache. However, when Gardiner woke up on the train in the morning, he had trouble seeing, as black spots {{obscured}} his vision. This was Gardiner's first uremic convulsion.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the petition, the council set up a commission that proposed a city synod. For this gathering, Bucer provided a draft document of sixteen articles on church doctrine. The synod convened on 3 June 1533 at the Church of the Penitent Magdalens to debate Bucer's text, eventually accepting it in full. Sectarian leaders were brought before the synod and <b>questioned</b> <b>by</b> Bucer. Ziegler was dismissed and allowed to stay in Strasbourg; Hoffmann was imprisoned as {{a danger to the}} state; and Schwenckfeld left Strasbourg of his own accord.|$|E
