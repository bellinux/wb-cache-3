40|$|The {{developing}} vertebrate gut tube forms a reproducible looped pattern as {{it grows}} {{into the body}} cavity. Here we use developmental experiments to eliminate alternative models and show that gut looping morphogenesis {{is driven by the}} homogeneous and isotropic forces that arise from the relative growth between the gut tube and the anchoring dorsal mesenteric sheet, tissues that grow at different rates. A simple physical mimic, using a differentially strained composite of a pliable rubber tube and a soft latex sheet is consistent with this mechanism and produces similar patterns. We devise a mathematical theory and a computational model for the number, size and shape of intestinal loops based solely on the measurable geometry, elasticity and relative growth of the tissues. The predictions of our theory are quantitatively consistent with observations of intestinal loops at different stages of development in the chick embryo. Our model also accounts for the qualitative and quantitative variation in the distinct gut looping patterns seen in a variety of species including <b>quail,</b> <b>finch</b> and mouse, illuminating how the simple macroscopic mechanics of differential growth drives the morphology of the developing gut. Understanding morphogenesis, the origin of shape in anatomical structures, organs and organisms, has always been a central goal of developmental biology. Historically, the subject focused on the morphology and dynamics of embryonic growth 1, with many analogies t...|$|E
5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, <b>quails,</b> <b>finches,</b> and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|R

These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the plains of the park area and its vicinity were the Australian Aboriginal Woiworung people of the Kulin nation in the Yarra and Maribyrnong River valleys. Jackson Creek formed part of the boundary between two clan estates, Marin-Bulluk and Wurundjeri-Willam. They were farmers and hunters {{who lived on the}} forest products and harvested grass species and spear grass (Stipa spp.) that were grown and regrown {{in the area of the}} Keilor Plains after burning every year' The climate and rainfall also favoured growth of native grasses in the rolling plains. Animal species such as kangaroos, dingoes, tiger, bandicoots, gliders and platypuses were common. Bird species of cockatoos, kookaburras, <b>quails,</b> <b>finches</b> and hawks also flourished. The vegetation was lush with grass lands and plenty of plants with flowering blooms. Their habitation of the area is established by archaeological findings in the area in the form of their campsites and isolated artefacts within the park. The environment along Jackson Creek environment facilitated shelter, water and plentiful food for their original settlement.|$|R

40|$|Many central {{actions of}} {{testosterone}} (T) require {{the transformation of}} T into several metabolites including 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5 alpha-DHT) and estradiol (E 2). In birds as in mammals, 5 alpha-DHT and E 2, alone or in combination, mimic most behavioral effects of T. The avian brain is, in addition, able to transform T into 5 beta-DHT, a metabolite {{which seems to be}} devoid of any behavioral or physiological effects, at least in the context of reproduction. By in vitro product-formation assays, we have analyzed the distribution, sex differences and regulation by steroids of the 3 main T metabolizing enzymes (aromatase, 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reductases) in the brain of the Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica) and the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis). In the hypothalamus of <b>quail</b> and <b>finches,</b> aromatase activity is higher in males than in females. It is also decreased by castration and increased by T. The activity of the 5 alpha-reductase is not sexually differentiated nor controlled by T. The 5 beta-reductase activity is often higher in females than in males but this difference disappears in gonadectomized birds and no clear effect of T can be observed at this level. The zebra finch brain also contains a number of steroid-sensitive telencephalic nuclei [e. g. hyperstriatum ventrale, pars caudale (HVc) and robustus archistriatalis (RA) ] which {{play a key role in}} the control of vocalizations. These nuclei also contain T-metabolizing enzymes but the regulation of their activity is substantially different from what has been observed in the hypothalamus. Aromatase activity is for example higher in females than in males in HVc and RA and the enzyme in these nuclei is not affected by castration nor T treatment. In these nuclei, the 5 alpha-reductase activity is higher in males than in females and the reverse is true for the 5 beta-reductase. These sex differences in activity are not sensitive to gonadectomy and T treatment and might therefore be organized by neonatal steroids. We have been recently able to localize aromatase-immunoreactive (AR-ir) neurons by ICC in the brain of the <b>quail</b> and zebra <b>finch.</b> Positive cells are found in the preoptic area, ventromedial and tuberal hypothalamus. AR-ir material is found in the perikarya of cells and fills the entire cellular processes including axons. At the electron microscope level, immunoreactive material can clearly be observed in the synaptic boutons. This observation raises questions concerning the mode of action of estrogens produced by central aromatization of T. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Stem Cell Factor (SCF) {{also called}} Steel Factor (SF), Mast cell Growth Factor (MGF) and KIT {{tyrosine}} Kinase receptor Ligand (KL) is a hematopoietic growth factor and ligand for the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor. In this study, the partial complementary DNA (cDNA) of SCF was cloned from {{the eye of}} duck by homology cloning and Rapid Amplification of Cdna Ends (RACE) approaches. Comparing with zebra <b>finch,</b> <b>quail,</b> chicken and mammalian SCF cDNA sequence, the phylogenetic tree displayed that duck SCF is highly conserved, it shares 63. 8 - 94. 3 % similarity with the above species cDNA sequence. The rooted phylogenetic neighbor-Joining tree with bootstrap was done using SCF CDS sequences from duck and other species by DNAMAN software. The results showed that duck has close relationship with chicken, <b>quail</b> and zebro <b>finch.</b> The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that SCF was a universally expressed gene, it was detected in heart, liver, spleen, kidney, brain, back skin, muscle, eye, glandular stomach, belly skin. Q-PCR was employed to analyze the SCF gene expression in six type duck hair bulbs. The results showed that its expression had significant difference between W-W which is white hair bulb taken from white plumage with yellow beak and other types (BL-Bl which is black feather hair bulb taken from black plumage with black beak, W-L which is white feather hair bulb taken from white plumage with black beak ducks, W-WB which is white feather taken from white-black plumage with black beak, B-WB which is black feather taken from white-black plumage with black beak), p< 0. 001). The expression of SCF in BR (brown feather hair bulb taken from brown plumages with black beak ducks) has significant difference comparing with the above 5 hair bulb types (p< 0. 05). There is {{no significant difference between}} any of the following types which including BL-BL, W-L, W-WB and B-WB. The results indicated that SCF may be a critical gene on regulation gene expression for duck plumage diversity...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{assessing}} {{rates of}} avian nest predation often find that nests near forest edges {{are at high}} risk of predation, suggesting the importance of forest fragmentation in recent population declines of ground-nesting passerines. However, the use of quail (Coturnix spp.) eggs in nest predation experiments may confound conclusions about edge effects because only large-mouthed predators are able to consume these relatively large eggs, but both large and small-mouthed predators consume smaller passerine eggs. We directly compared predation rates on artificial nests baited with quail eggs or with zebra finch (Poephila guttata) eggs; the latter are similar in size to the eggs of many neotropical passerines. In 1998 and 1999 we placed 392 artificial ground nests at edge and interior locations in two east-central Iowa forest fragments. Predation on these nests varied with egg type (<b>quail</b> or <b>finch)</b> and location (edge or interior) and there was a significant interaction between egg type and location: predation on quail eggs was greater at edges than in the interior, whereas finch egg predation was high in both edge and interior locations. Based on tooth imprints in clay eggs, we determined that large-mouthed predators were six times more active at edges, whereas activity of small-mouthed nest predators was evenly distributed between edge and interior locations. We suggest that the use of only quail eggs can exaggerate edge effects and that finch eggs or clay eggs used in conjunction with quail eggs in artificial nests can be used to estimate relative predation rates by large- and small-mouthed predators...|$|R
40|$|Dopaminergic and {{adrenergic}} receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors {{considered to}} be different based on their pharmacology and signaling pathways. Some receptor subtypes that are members of one family are actually closer in phylogenetic terms to some subtypes belonging to the other family, suggesting that the pharmacological specificity among these receptors from different families is not perfect. Indeed, evidence is accumulating that one amine can cross-talk with receptors belonging to the other system. However, most of these observations were collected in vitro using artificial cell models transfected with cloned receptors, so that the occurrence of this phenomenon in vivo {{as well as its}} distribution in the central nervous system is not known. In this study the pharmacological basis of possible in vivo interactions between dopamine and alpha(2) -adrenergic receptors was investigated in <b>quail,</b> zebra <b>finches,</b> and rats. Binding competitions showed that dopamine displaces the binding of the selective alpha(2) -adrenergic ligand, [(3) H]RX 821002, in the brain of the three species with an affinity approximately 10 - 28 -fold lower than that of norepinephrine. Dopamine also displaces with an affinity 3 -fold lower than norepinephrine the binding of [(3) H]RX 821002 to human alpha(h 2 A) -adrenergic receptors expressed in Sf 9 cells. The anatomical distribution of this interaction was assessed in brain slices of quail and rat based on autoradiographic methods. Both norepinephrine and dopamine significantly displace [(3) H]RX 821002 binding in all brain nuclei considered. Together, these data provide evidence for an interaction between the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems in the vertebrate brain, albeit with species variations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta), {{a species}} with temperature-dependent sex {{determination}} (TSD), {{the expression of}} the aromatase gene during gonad development is strictly limited to the female-producing temperature. The underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this study, we identified the upstream 5 '-flanking region of the aromatase gene, gonad-specific promoter, and the temperature-dependent DNA methylation signatures during gonad development in the red-eared slider turtle. The 5 '-flanking region of the slider aromatase exhibited sequence similarities to the aromatase genes of the American alligator, chicken, <b>quail,</b> and zebra <b>finch.</b> A putative TATA box was located 31 bp upstream of the gonad-specific transcription start site. DNA methylation at the CpG sites between the putative binding sites of the fork head domain factor (FOX) and vertebrate steroidogenic factor 1 (SF 1) and adjacent TATA box in the promoter region were significantly lower in embryonic gonads at the female-producing temperature compared the male-producing temperature. A shift from male- to female-, but not from female- to male-, producing temperature changed the level of DNA methylation in gonads. Taken together these results indicate that the temperature, particularly female-producing temperature, allows demethylation at the specific CpG sites of the promoter region which leads the temperature-specific expression of aromatase during gonad development...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of mitochondria from the ventricular myocardium of canaries, sparrows, zebra <b>finches,</b> <b>quail,</b> and geese has been studied. The first {{three of these}} birds have very fast heart rates, the quail being intermediate, and the goose has a relatively slow rate. The canary heart has a unique form of mitochondrion containing large, parallel arrays of zigzag or angled cristae. Other cristae, continuous with the zigzag ones and also occupying {{large parts of the}} mitochondrial volume, are named retiform because of the hexagonal network which they form, sometimes in a single plane and sometimes three dimensional. These two types of cristae appear to be interconnectible. It is possible that there is a direct functional significance in these peculiar forms, but, in any case, the relative constancy of dimensions in these arrays is probably related to specific properties of the molecules of which the cristal membrane is composed. It is also demonstrated that this membrane is composed in part of approximately 30 -A particles which are believed to be protein molecules. This unusual mitochondrial morphology is not seen either in the other fast bird hearts or in the slower ones, so that there is neither a simple correlation with heart rate nor probably with th...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fenitrothion}} exposure on birds was examined by measuring aerobic metabolism, blood hemoglobin content, plasma cholinesterases, and body weight {{for up to}} 21 d postdose. Peak metabolic rate was measured in a flight chamber in three-dose groups of house sparrows (Passer domesticus; 100 mg/kg = high, 60 mg/kg = medium, 30 mg/kg = low) and one-dose groups of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata; 3 mg/kg) and king quails (Coturnix chinensis; 26 mg/kg). Aerobic metabolism was measured during 1 h of exposure to subfreezing thermal conditions in low-dose house sparrows and king quails (26 mg/kg). Fenitrothion {{had no effect on}} metabolic rate during cold exposure or on blood hemoglobin at any time. By contrast, aerobic performance during exercise in sparrows was reduced by 58 % (high), 18 % (medium), and 20 % (low), respectively, 2 d postdose. House sparrows (high) had the longest recovery period for peak metabolic rate (21 d) and plasma cholinesterase activity (14 d). House sparrows (high) and treated king quails had significantly lower myoglobin at 48 h postdose, whereas myoglobin was invariant in zebra finches and house sparrows (medium and low). Cholinesterase was maximally inhibited at 6 h postdose, and had recovered within 24 h, in house sparrows (low), king <b>quails,</b> and zebra <b>finches.</b> Exercise peak metabolic rate in zebra <b>finches</b> and king <b>quails</b> was reduced by 23 % at 2 d and 3 d, respectively, despite these birds being asymptomatic in both behavior and plasma cholinesterase activities. <br /...|$|R
60|$|The {{aspect of}} these Ghauts is picturesque. The {{primitive}} base consists of micaceous granite, with veins of porphyry and dykes of the purest white quartz: above lie strata of sandstone and lime, here dun, there yellow, or of a dull grey, often curiously contorted and washed clear of vegetable soil by the heavy monsoon. On these heights, which are mostly conoid with rounded tops, joined by ridges and saddlebacks, {{various kinds of}} Acacia cast a pallid and sickly green, like the olive tree upon the hills of Provence. They are barren in the cold season, and the Nomads migrate to the plains: when the monsoon covers them with rich pastures, the people revisit their deserted kraals. The Kloofs or ravines are the most remarkable features of this country: in some places the sides rise perpendicularly, like gigantic walls, the breadth varying from one hundred yards to half a mile; in others cliffs and scaurs, sapped at their foundations, encumber the bed, and not unfrequently a broad band of white sand stretches between two fringes of emerald green, delightful to look upon after the bare and ghastly basalt of Southern Arabia. The Jujube grows to a height already betraying signs of African luxuriance: through its foliage flit birds, gaudy-coloured as kingfishers, of vivid red, yellow, and changing-green. I remarked a long-tailed jay called Gobiyan or Fat [2], russet-hued ringdoves, the modest honey-bird, corn <b>quails,</b> canary-coloured <b>finches,</b> sparrows gay as those of Surinam, humming-birds with a plume of metallic lustre, and especially a white-eyed kind of maina, called by the Somal, Shimbir Load or the cow-bird. The Armo-creeper [3], with large fleshy leaves, pale green, red, or crimson, and clusters of bright berries like purple grapes, forms a conspicuous ornament in the valleys. There is {{a great variety of}} the Cactus tribe, some growing to the height of thirty and thirty-five feet: of these one was particularly pointed out to me. The vulgar Somal call it Guraato, the more learned Shajarat el Zakkum: it is the mandrake of these regions, and the round excrescences upon the summits of its fleshy arms are supposed to resemble men's heads and faces. On Tuesday the 5th December we arose at 6 A.M., after a night so dewy that our clothes were drenched, and we began to ascend the Wady Darkaynlay, which winds from east to south. After an hour's march appeared a small cairn of rough stones, called Siyaro, or Mazar [4], to which each person, in token of honor, added his quotum. The Abban opined that Auliya or holy men had sat there, but the End of Time more sagaciously conjectured that it was the site of some Galla idol or superstitious rite. Presently we came upon the hills of the White Ant [5], a characteristic feature in this part of Africa. Here the land has the appearance of a Turkish cemetery on a grand scale: there it seems like a city in ruins: in some places the pillars are truncated into a resemblance to bee-hives, in others they cluster together, suggesting the idea of a portico; whilst many of them, veiled by trees, and overrun with gay creepers, look like the remains of sylvan altars. Generally the hills are conical, and vary in height from four to twelve feet: they are counted by hundreds, and the Somal account for the number by declaring that the insects abandon their home when dry, and commence building another. The older erections are worn away, by wind and rain, to a thin tapering spire, and are frequently hollowed and arched beneath by rats and ground squirrels. The substance, fine yellow mud, glued by the secretions of the ant, is hard to break: it is pierced, sieve-like, by a network of tiny shafts. I saw these hills {{for the first time in}} the Wady Darkaynlay: in the interior they are larger and longer than near the maritime regions.|$|R
