5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of {{the data from the}} 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable <b>quartz</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a <b>quartz</b> <b>oscillator,</b> was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and time signals, an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable <b>quartz</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E

Conversely, <b>quartz</b> <b>oscillator</b> factories are single-function in nature, so that ramping production requires installing custom equipment, which is more costly and time consuming than allocating standard equipment.|$|E

50|$|A {{major reason}} for the wide use of crystal {{oscillators}} is their high Q factor.

50|$|Quartz {{exists in}} several phases. At 573 Â°C at 1 {{atmosphere}} (and at higher temperatures and higher pressures) the Î±-quartz undergoes quartz inversion, transforms reversibly to Î²-quartz. The reverse process however is not entirely homogeneous and crystal twinning occurs. Care must be taken during manufacturing and processing to avoid phase transformation. Other phases, e.g. the higher-temperature phases tridymite and cristobalite, are not significant for oscillators. All <b>quartz</b> <b>oscillator</b> crystals are the Î±-quartz type.|$|E
