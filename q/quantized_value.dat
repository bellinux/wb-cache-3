When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we can see in the flow diagram on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a <b>quantized</b> <b>value.</b> If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the flow diagram, we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E

The effect is that the quantization error is low-pass filtered by a 2-sample rectangular filter (also known as an averaging filter). As a result, compared to before, the quantization error has lower power at higher frequencies and higher power at lower frequencies.|$|E
50|$|A {{very recent}} work {{considers}} {{the role of}} interactions in the stirring of Bose condensed particles. Otherwise {{the rest of the}} literature concerns primarily electronic devices. Typically the pump is modeled as a quantum dot. The effect of electron-electron interactions within the dot region is taken into account in the Coulomb blockade regime or in the Kondo regime. In the former case charge transport is quantized even in the case of small backscattering. Deviation from the exact <b>quantized</b> <b>value</b> is related to dissipation. In the Kondo regime, as the temperature is lowered, the pumping effect is modified. There are also works that consider interactions over the whole system (including the leads) using the Luttinger liquid model.|$|E

The charge numbers for ions (and also subatomic particles) are written in superscript, e.g. Na+ is a sodium ion with charge number positive one (an electric charge of one elementary charge). Atomic numbers (Z) are a special case of charge numbers, referring to the charge number of an atomic nucleus, {{as opposed to the}} net charge of an atom or ion. All particles of ordinary matter have integer-value charge numbers, with the exception of quarks, which cannot exist in isolation under ordinary circumstances (the strong force keeps them bound into hadrons of integer charge numbers).|$|E

At zero magnetic field, the gate-tuned anomalous Hall resistance reaches the predicted <b>quantized</b> <b>value</b> of h/e^ 2,accompanied by a considerable drop of the longitudinal resistance.

This is only the case when the inversion axis {{is at the center}} of the unit cell. When the inversion axis is not at the center, the modified inversion operator within the unit cell gains a k-dependence in some of its matrix elements which adds a correction term to the usual Zak's phase expression 1, making it in general deviate from its <b>quantized</b> <b>value.</b> A general expression that recovers a quantized Zak's phase in a lattice model with a unit cell of arbitrary size and arbitrarily positioned inversion axis is provided in this paper, which relates the <b>quantized</b> <b>value</b> with the eigenvalues of a modified parity operator at the inversion invariant momenta.
