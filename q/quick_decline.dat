500|$|Daily was {{successful}} {{as a starting}} pitcher early in his major league career. [...] In 1883 and 1884, he won 20 or more games each season, while finishing in the top ten among league leaders in major pitching categories such as earned run average (as calculated retroactively, since E.R.A. was not an official statistic at the time), innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts. [...] Daily established the pitching record for strikeouts in a season (later surpassed), tied a record by tossing two consecutive one-hitters, broke the record for one-hitters in a season, and threw a no-hitter.

[...] In the United States, many Yankee radicals, former abolitionists and other progressive activists, became involved in the organization, which had been founded in England. German-American and ethnic Irish nearly lost control of the organization, and feared its goals were going to be lost in the broad-based, democratic egalitarianism promoted by the Americans. In 1871, the Germans expelled most of the English-speaking members of the First International's U.S. sections, leading to the <b>quick</b> <b>decline</b> of the organization, as it failed to attract the ethnic working class in America. Karl Marx commented disparagingly on Woodhull in 1872, and expressed approval of the expulsions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{longevity}} treatments themselves {{begin to}} show weaknesses once those receiving them reach the two-century mark in age. The treatments reduce most aging processes to a negligible rate, [...] but {{are much less}} effective {{when it comes to}} brain function, and in particular memory. Maya in particular suffers extreme lapses in memory, although she remains high functioning most of the time. Further, as people age, they begin to show susceptibility to strange, fatal conditions which have no apparent explanation and are resistant to any treatment. Most common is the event that comes {{to be known as the}} [...] "quick decline", where a person of extremely advanced age and in apparently good health suffers a sudden fatal heart arrythmia and dies abruptly. The exact mechanism is never explained. Michel dies of the <b>quick</b> <b>decline,</b> while attending the wake of another First Hundred member. Russell speculates that Michel's <b>quick</b> <b>decline</b> was brought on by the shock of seeing Maya fail to remember Frank Chalmers (who was killed while escaping security forces in the first revolution) upon looking at a treasured photo of him on her refrigerator. As a result of this and Russell's own problems with memory, he organizes a team of scientists to develop medicine that will restore memory. The remaining members of the First Hundred, of which there are only 12, congregate in Underhill, and take the medicine. It works so well that Russell remembers his own birth. He and Ann Clayborne finally recall that they had been in love prior to leaving Earth the very first time, but both had been too socially inept and nervous about their chances for selection for the Mars voyage to reveal this to each other. Their famous argument over terraforming had been a mere continuation of a running conversation they had been having since they still lived on Earth. Through the memory treatment it is also revealed that Phyllis had been lobbying to free Sax from his torturers when she was murdered by Maya. Maya herself declines the treatment. Sax also distinctly recalls Hiroko assisting him in finding his rover in a storm before he nearly froze to death before disappearing once again and is convinced she remains alive, although the question of whether she is actually alive is never resolved.|$|E
60|$|Who can {{describe}} the pleasure and delight, {{the peace of}} mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts! Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, {{have been known to}} yearn at last for one short glimpse of Nature's face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their <b>quick</b> <b>decline,</b> and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Traditional {{chemotherapy}} {{is often}} limited by a poor intracellular drug uptake combined with relevant side effects. Electrochemotherapy allows a high intracellular uptake at low local dosage. On {{our search for}} a new cytotoxic electroporation agent we examined the efficiancy of the green tea ingredient epigallocatechingallat (EGCG). Methods: 48 nude mice with implanted oral scquamous cell cancer. Treatment in 6 groups (8 animals) with EGCG, Bleomycin, Buffer solution or in combination with electrochemotherapy. After four weeks documantation of tumor growth and pathological evaluation. Results: As known from clinical results the electroporation with bleomycin led to a significant reduction of tumor volume. However the electroporation with EGCG showed no effect on the tumor growth. The pathological report (HE, MIB- 1) confirmed our findings. Discussion: Contrary to our in vitro findings the in vivo chemotherapy with epigallocatechingallat did not reduce the tumor growth. After discussing different parameters we identified three possible reasons: 1) due to high redox potential quick inactivation of EGCG, 2) possible extracellular mediated cytotoxic effect would not profit from electroporation, 3) <b>quick</b> <b>declining</b> interstitial EGCG concentration...|$|R

Mice were injected i. p. with a single dose of 200 mg/kg body weight of CY and then exposed to PEMF 24 h per day. In an initial series of experiments immediately after CY injection mice were exposed to PEMF until sacrifice. WBC counts in the peripheral blood demonstrated a <b>quicker</b> <b>decline</b> in WBC at days 1 and 2 in mice exposed to PEMF. Groups of mice were sacrificed at days 1, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after CY injection. In mice exposed to PEMF the spleen weight was less than in controls at days 6, 8, and 10. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that the labeling index of bone marrow smears did not significantly differ between controls and experimental mice exposed to PEMF, whereas the spleen labeling index proved to be higher among control mice versus mice exposed to PEMF at day 6, and higher among mice exposed to PEMF versus controls at day 8. In a second series of experiments mice were exposed to PEMF only over the 24 h following CY injection. We found that the spleens of mice exposed to PEMF weighed less than those of controls at days 6 and 8. The labeling index of bone marrow did evidence a slight decrease among mice exposed to PEMF at days 8 and 10 after CY injection versus control mice. The spleen labeling index proved to be lower in experimental mice exposed to PEMF than in controls at days 4, 6, and 8. Mice were then injected with CY, half were exposed to PEMF, and 24 h later bone marrow was recovered from both groups of animals. The same number of bone marrow cells was injected via the tail vein into recipient mice irradiated to 8. 5 Gy. The grafting efficiency of the bone marrow was evaluated by examining the number of spleen colonies and the spleen and bone marrow labeling indices at day 8; all parameters proved to be significantly lower among mice grafted with the bone marrow of mice injected with CY and exposed to PEMF than among controls injected with CY only. Finally, we found that the effect of PEMF is evident only if mice are exposed during the 24 h following CY injection. The data reported here indicates that PEMF exposure after CY injection increases the damage induced in mice by CY...|$|R
40|$|One lone mill in Rhode Island {{stands as}} a {{reminder}} of a once prosperous machine-made lace industry in the United States. The leavers lace industry saw a rapid growth and an even <b>quicker</b> <b>decline</b> in the twentieth century. If this mill closes, the knowhow in the United States to produce excellent imitations of hand-made lace disappears. This study gives a brief history of the leavers lace industry along with a detailed account of how this lace was used in women 2 ̆ 7 s fashions from 1940 to 1969, the period of greatest domestic production. An additional manuscript addresses repairing damage in leavers laces, a topic virtually ignored in the literature. ^ The first manuscript entitled 2 ̆ 2 History of Leavers Lace and Its Incorporation in American Fashion: 1940 – 19692 ̆ 2 explores the development of the most complicated machinery in the textile industry, its introduction into the United States, and domestic lace production, particularly in Rhode Island. City directories yielded the names and locations of Rhode Island lace manufacturers. In addition, advertisements from the Providence Journal, dress patterns, and actual garments reflect how American designers and seamstresses incorporated lace yardage and trimmings in garments. ^ Before World War II, lace was a popular fabric choice in women 2 ̆ 7 s fashion. During the war, the use of lace dwindled, but did not entirely disappear because production of rayon lace was not regulated. The post-war era into the 1950 s saw a growth in the popularity of lace not only as decorative trims, but also as lace yardage for women 2 ̆ 7 s evening and social attire. With the heightened demand, mills expanded, and investors built new mills with more leavers machines than ever before in America. Major fashion changes and a growing youth market in the 1960 s caused a sharp decrease in demand for lace yardage, and many mills closed. Lace lost its prestige and became a fabric reserved almost exclusively for women and wedding attire. ^ The second manuscript 2 ̆ 2 Repair of Twentieth-Century Leavers Lace 2 ̆ 2 details a procedure for repairing this machine-made lace. A microscopic examination of twentieth-century leavers laces in garments and yardage from the University of Rhode Island Historic Textile and Costume Collection plus garments found in local vintage clothing stores revealed how yarns in the manufactured laces interact and facilitated reproducing their movements. Drawings and photocopies of both large- and small-scale laces aided in developing repair techniques that incorporate an adhesive to stabilize broken yarns and stitches to replace missing connections. This process is very time intensive, and practice is essential, although the time required for an effective repair shortens with experience. Finding suitable yarns for repairs is a major hurdle, but with patience, time, and a steady hand, the mesh and patterns in damaged machine-made lace can be stabilized and repaired. ...|$|R
