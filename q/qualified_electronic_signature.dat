40|$|Abstract. A {{legal basis}} {{for the use of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> exists since the {{introduction}} of <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in EU Directive 1999 / 93 /EC. Although considered as key enablers for e-Government and e-Commerce, <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> are still not widely used. Introducing a mo-bile component addresses most of the shortcomings of existing qualified signature approaches but poses certain difficulties in the security rea-soning. The proposed server based mobile signature approach authenti-cates the signatory over trusted channels and assists the protection of the signature-creation data with organizational measures. As with tra-ditional qualified signature approaches, strong authentication of the sig-natory to the system is ensured by two factors. Knowledge of a PIN and possession of a valid subscriber identity module card is verified over two separate communication channels. The qualified mobil server signature fulfills the requirements on secure signature-creation devices defined by the EU directive and in particular its Austrian implementation...|$|R
30|$|The {{integrity}} and authenticity of electronic documents can be ensured by <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> {{according to the}} German digital <b>signature</b> law. These <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> are almost equivalent to handwritten signatures. According to § 292 a of the code of civil procedure, <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> appear to be authentic. Due to open questions regarding secure long-term archiving and quality of evidence, the legal equality of the <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> with the handwritten signature has not been achieved in Germany so far [11 – 15].|$|R
50|$|A CAdES-based {{electronic}} signature is accepted {{in a court}} proceeding as evidence; as advanced {{electronic signature}}s are legally binding.8 But it gets he higher probative value when enhanced to a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature.</b> To receive that legal standing, {{it needs to be}} doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device ("qualified electronic signature"). The authorship of a statement with a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> cannot be challenged - the statement is non-repudiable.|$|E
50|$|A <b>{{qualified}}</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> is an Advanced Electronic Signature with {{a qualified}} digital certificate {{that has been}} created by a qualified signature creation device (QSCD).For an electronic signature to {{be considered as a}} <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature,</b> it must meet three main requirements: First, the signatory must be linked and uniquely identified to the signature. The second point is that data used to create the signature must be under the sole control of the signatory. And last it must have the ability to identify if the data that accompanies the signature has been tampered with since the signing of the message.|$|E
5000|$|... eIDAS {{requires}} that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence {{solely on the}} grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures. The <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high. All EU member states are required to recognize a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signature</b> as valid, as long as it has been created with a qualified certificate that has been issued by another Member state.|$|E

These recognitions entitle SwissSign to issue qualified certificates and products for <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in Switzerland and in the European Union (EU) and worldwide trustworthy certificates.|$|R
50|$|ZertES {{is similar}} to eIDAS in assuring the legal bindingness of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> and a tiered {{approach}} to legal value in court with <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> having a higher probative value than Advanced <b>Electronic</b> <b>Signatures.</b> Cross-border communications between Switzerland and the Member state of the European Union occur on a daily basis, as the country is home to many internationally active banks and companies. Therefore, ZertES and eiDAS are comparable in technical design and carry similar legal implications.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite a legal {{framework}} being {{in place for}} several years, the market share of <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> is disappointingly low. Mobile Signatures provide a new and promising opportunity for the deployment of an infrastructure for <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures.</b> We analyzed two possible signing approaches (server based and client based signatures) and conclude that SIM-based signatures are the most secure and convenient solution. However, using the SIM-card as a secure signature creation device (SSCD) raises new challenges, because it would contain the user’s private key {{as well as the}} subscriber identification. Combining both functions in one card raises the question who will have the control over the keys and certificates. We propose a protocol called Certification on Demand (COD) that separates certification services from subscriber identification information and allows consumers to choose their appropriate certification services and service providers based on their needs. We also present some of the constraints that still have to be addressed before qualified mobile signatures are possible. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In 1999 the {{directive}} 1999 / 93 /EC of the European Parliament {{and of the}} Council was enacted, providing a legal framework for a common introduc-tion of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> in Europe. So far the signature market has failed miserably. Mobile <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> could be a potential and promising way to increase the market acceptance of <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures.</b> In this contribution we used an infrastructure for <b>qualified</b> mobile <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> proposed in [Ross 2004] {{as the basis of}} our assumptions. This infrastructure does not require the mobile operator to act as a certificate service provider (CSP). Instead the user can freely choose a CSP and add the signature functionality along with the required certificates later on demand. The mobile operator would act as the card issuer and would only profit from traffic caused by signature applications. However, mobile operators will only enter the signature market if they expect a profit in return. Therefore, {{we take a look at}} the economic feasibility of mobile <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> from the viewpoint of a mobile operator (MO) and try to predict the return on investment. Also, the CSP will only accept this infrastructure, by giving up the control over the signature card, if profits can be expected. Therefore, we examine potential revenue sources for CSPs, using new business models proposed in [LiRo 2005] that have the potential to be far more successful than the current ones. Our prediction shows that mobile quali-fied <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures</b> can be quite profitable for both parties. ...|$|R
50|$|Previously, a {{signatory}} {{would sign}} a document or message {{and then return}} it to the intended recipient via the postal service, facsimile service, by hand or by scanning and then attaching it to an email. The issue with these methods is that they are not always secure or timely. Delays in delivery could occur, and there exists the possibility that signatures could be forged or the enclosed documents may be altered. The risk increases as multiple signatures are required from different people who may be located in different locations. These problems are alleviated by using <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>signatures,</b> which save time, are legally binding, and provide a higher level of technical security.|$|R
