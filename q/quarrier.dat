2500|$|Charleston {{possesses}} {{a number of}} older buildings which represent a variety of historical architectural styles. [...] About fifty places in Charleston are included on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] A segment of the East End consisting of several blocks of both Virginia and <b>Quarrier</b> Streets, encompassing an area of nearly a full square mile, has been officially designated as a historical neighborhood.

2500|$|In 1983, the Charleston Town Center {{opened its}} doors downtown. It was the largest urban-based mall east of the Mississippi River, {{featuring}} three stories of shops and eateries. Downtown revitalization began in earnest in the late 1980s as well. Funds were set aside for streetscaping as Capitol and <b>Quarrier</b> Streets saw new building facades, trees along the streets, and brick walkways installed. For a time, {{the opening of the}} Charleston Town Center Mall had a somewhat negative impact on the main streets of downtown Charleston, as many businesses closed and relocated into the mall. [...] For a while, the downtown business district (outside of the mall) had a [...] "ghost town" [...] feel to it which took several years to turn around. [...] Today, Capitol Street, Hale Street, and other bordering streets are an eclectic mixture of restaurants, shops, businesses and services that many call the centerpiece of downtown.|$|E
60|$|The truant <b>quarrier</b> seemed rather {{inclined}} {{to stay where}} he was and finish the mug of ale, but Pierston quickened him, and he ascended the staircase. As soon as the lower room was empty Pierston leant with {{his elbows on the}} table, and covered his face with his hands.|$|E
50|$|More than 800 {{children}} at a time lived at <b>Quarrier's</b> Village during the 1890s and as the charity expanded, up to 1500 children were accommodated at a time. In total more than 30,000 children have been cared for at <b>Quarrier's</b> Village.|$|R
25|$|Kilmacolm is {{the name}} of a wider civil parish, {{including}} the village of Kilmacolm, <b>Quarrier's</b> Village and a large rural hinterland. Civil parishes have been largely superseded in local government by modern community council areas, with Kilmacolm, <b>Quarrier's</b> Village and the surrounding area falling within the Kilmacolm community council area.|$|R

60|$|Knollsea was a seaside village lying snug {{within two}} {{headlands}} as between a finger and thumb. Everybody {{in the parish}} {{who was not a}} boatman was a <b>quarrier,</b> unless he were the gentleman who owned half the property and had been a quarryman, or the other gentleman who owned the other half, and had been to sea.|$|E
60|$|Somers {{had gone}} back to town. It was a wet day on the little peninsula: but Pierston walked out as far as the garden-house of his hired castle, where he sat down and smoked. This {{erection}} being on the boundary-wall of his property his ear could now and then catch the tones of Avice's voice from her open-doored cottage in the lane which skirted his fence; and he noticed that there were no modulations in it. He knew why that was. She wished to go out, and could not. He had observed before that when she was planning an outing a particular note would come into her voice during the preceding hours: a dove's roundness of sound; no doubt the effect upon her voice of her thoughts of her lover, or lovers. Yet the latter it could not be. She was pure and singlehearted: half an eye could see that. Whence, then, the two men? Possibly the <b>quarrier</b> was a relation.|$|E
6000|$|When as many {{stones were}} built as {{comprised}} this day’s work, {{the demand for}} mortar was proportionally increased, and {{the task of the}} mortar-makers on these occasions was both laborious and severe. This operation was chiefly performed by John Watt—a strong, active <b>quarrier</b> by profession,—who was a perfect character in his way, and extremely zealous in his department. While the operations of the mortar-makers continued, the forge upon the gallery was not generally in use; but, as the working hours of the builders extended with the height of the building, the forge could not be so long wanted, and then a sad confusion often ensued upon the circumscribed floor of the mortar gallery, as the operations of Watt and his assistants trenched greatly upon those of the smiths. Under these circumstances the boundary of the smiths was much circumscribed, and they were personally annoyed, especially in blowy weather, with the dust of the lime in its powdered state. The mortar-makers, on the other hand, were often not a little distressed with the heat of the fire and the sparks elicited on the anvil, and not unaptly complained that they were placed between the ‘devil and the deep sea.’ ...|$|E

50|$|The {{village was}} founded as the Orphan Homes of Scotland in 1876 by Glasgow shoe-maker and philanthropist William <b>Quarrier</b> {{on the site}} of the former Nittingshill Farm. <b>Quarrier</b> had a vision of a {{community}} allowing the young people in his care to thrive, set in a countryside environment and housed in a number of grand residences under a house-mother and father.

25|$|Kilmacolm {{expanded}} at {{an unprecedented}} speed {{and many of}} the large Victorian and Edwardian villas which characterise the village today were constructed, as well as such attractions as the Hydropathic Hotel and facilities such as banks and plumbed water. Combined with the dramatic expansion of the village and gentrification of the area, the traditional importance of agriculture to the parish economy declined significantly. Slightly further east on the railway line, William <b>Quarrier's</b> Orphans' Homes were opened in the 1870s and remained as a residential children's community until the late 1970s. Since then, what has become known as <b>Quarrier's</b> Village has become largely residential.|$|R
