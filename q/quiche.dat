5|$|The five Mew Mews {{battle the}} Chimera Animas and their alien {{controllers}} <b>Quiche,</b> Pie and Tart. <b>Quiche</b> {{falls in love}} with Ichigo where he tries to gain her love {{despite the fact that he}} is trying to eliminate the other Mew Mews. Pie and Tart later join <b>Quiche</b> in trying to destroy the Mew Mews.|$|E
5|$|Within the Quichean sub-branch K'iche' (<b>Quiché),</b> the Mayan {{language}} {{with the largest}} number of speakers, is spoken by around 1,000,000 K'iche' Maya in the Guatemalan highlands, around the towns of Chichicastenango and Quetzaltenango and in the Cuchumatán mountains, as well as by urban emigrants in Guatemala City. The famous Maya mythological document, Popol Vuh, is written in an antiquated K'iche' often called Classical K'iche' (or <b>Quiché).</b> The K'iche' culture was at its pinnacle {{at the time of the}} Spanish conquest. Q'umarkaj, near the present-day city of Santa Cruz del <b>Quiché,</b> was its economic and ceremonial center. Achi is spoken by 85,000 people in Cubulco and Rabinal, two municipios of Baja Verapaz. In some classifications, e.g. the one by Campbell, Achi is counted as a form of K'iche'. However, owing to a historical division between the two ethnic groups, the Achi Maya do not regard themselves as K'iche'. The Kaqchikel language is spoken by about 400,000 people in an area stretching from Guatemala City westward to the northern shore of Lake Atitlán. Tz'utujil has about 90,000 speakers in the vicinity of Lake Atitlán. Other members of the K'ichean branch are Sakapultek, spoken by about 15,000 people mostly in El <b>Quiché</b> department, and Sipakapense, which is spoken by 8,000 people in Sipacapa, San Marcos.|$|E

5|$|The Uspantek language, {{which also}} springs {{directly}} from the Quichean–Mamean node, is native only to the Uspantán municipio {{in the department of}} El <b>Quiché,</b> and has 3,000 speakers.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} known of the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del <b>Quiché.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deep Blue is {{the first}} alien to return, taking {{the form of a}} human boy and going to sleep within him. <b>Quiche,</b> Pie, and Tart arrive later to remove humans from Earth and allow the {{remaining}} aliens to return. After Deep Blue is destroyed, and they are defeated, the aliens return to their own planet with the remaining mew aqua to change their world into a place as beautiful as Earth.|$|E
5|$|Masaya's {{personality}} briefly reappears and he {{uses the}} Mew Aqua inside Deep Blue to save Ichigo and tokyo, killing himself in the process. Crying over his body, Ichigo pours her power into Masaya to save his life, losing her own in the process. Masaya kisses her, changing her back to a human and revives her. Ryou gives Pie the remaining Mew Aqua to save the aliens' world, after which <b>Quiche,</b> Pie, and Tart say their goodbyes and return to their own world.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Spanish conquest, the Mayan {{languages}} {{began to be}} written with Latin letters. Colonial-era literature in Mayan languages include the famous Popol Vuh, a mythico-historical narrative written in 17th century Classical <b>Quiché</b> but believed {{to be based on}} an earlier work written in the 1550s, now lost. The Título de Totonicapán and the 17th century theatrical work the Rabinal Achí are other notable early works in K'iche', the latter in the Achí dialect. The Annals of the Cakchiquels from the late 16th century, which provides a historical narrative of the Kaqchikel, contains elements paralleling some of the accounts appearing in the Popol Vuh. The historical and prophetical accounts in the several variations known collectively as the books of Chilam Balam are primary sources of early Yucatec Maya traditions. The only surviving book of early lyric poetry, the Songs of Dzitbalche by Ah Bam, comes from this same period.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when <b>Quiche</b> brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a question mark until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{interpretation of}} potbelly monuments {{is that they}} were representations of rulership. This is suggested by the body position represented in the sculptures, the type of adornment sometimes depicted on them, the pedestals on which they sometimes sit and the ceremonial sites where they are found as well as their locations within such sites. The potbelly body position is symbolic of rulership; the figures are seated cross-legged and with the arms wrapping the body or holding an object. Twenty-five potbelly monuments are known to display a collar as neck jewellery, again suggestive of rulership. Pedestal bases are known from potbelly sculptures from Sin Cabezas, Antigua Guatemala, Kaminaljuyu, Santa Cruz del <b>Quiché,</b> Takalik Abaj, Tikal, Ujuxte, El Balsamo, Los Cerritos and La Nueva in Guatemala, Chalchuapa in El Salvador, and Copán in Honduras. This represents 42% of sites with potbelly sculptures. If pedestals are equivalent to thrones then Bilbao Monument 58 is also relevant, which was found associated with a four-legged stone altar or throne and may originally have been positioned on top of it.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the series, Ichigo has a crush on Masaya Aoyama. Although she {{believes}} that he is oblivious to her feelings, he later returns them and they begin dating. Midway through the series, Ichigo gains a mysterious protector, the Blue Knight. Throughout the series, Ichigo repeatedly rejects repeated advances by <b>Quiche</b> and although she can not accept his final declaration of love, she cries over his death and holds him as he dies. Ichigo dies after transferring her own life force into Masaya after Masaya kills himself and Deep Blue. She is subsequently revived by the last of the mew aqua which was housed within Masaya. Before Masaya goes off to study abroad in England {{at the end of the}} series, Ichigo participates in a mock wedding with Masaya. Tokyo Mew Mew a La Mode reveals that Ichigo lost all of her Mew Mew powers because of the Mew Aqua's influence and joined Masaya in England, but returned to Japan when her powers began to manifest again to aid in the battle against the Saint Rose Crusaders.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, <b>Quiche,</b> Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities with a desire to create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E
5|$|By 1537 {{the area}} {{immediately}} {{north of the}} new colony of Guatemala was being {{referred to as the}} Tierra de Guerra ("Land of War"). Paradoxically, it was simultaneously known as Verapaz ("True Peace"). The Land of War described an area that was undergoing conquest; it was a region of dense forest that was difficult for the Spanish to penetrate militarily. Whenever the Spanish located a centre of population in this region, the inhabitants were moved and concentrated in a new colonial settlement {{near the edge of the}} jungle where the Spanish could more easily control them. This strategy resulted in the gradual depopulation of the forest, simultaneously converting it into a wilderness refuge for those fleeing Spanish domination, both for individual refugees and for entire communities, especially those congregaciones that were remote from centres of colonial authority. The Land of War, from the 16th century through to the start of the 18th century, included a vast area from Sacapulas in the west to Nito on the Caribbean coast and extended northwards from Rabinal and Salamá, and was an intermediate area between the highlands and the northern lowlands. It includes the modern departments of Baja Verapaz and Alta Verapaz, Izabal and Petén, as well as the eastern part of El <b>Quiché</b> and a part of the Mexican state of Chiapas. The western portion of this area was the territory of the Q'eqchi' Maya.|$|E

CARE is still supporting the rehabilitation of water systems and sanitation in the departments of San Marcos and Sololá from Hurricane Stan with a diverse funding base.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the {{repression}} against the Indian farming cooperatives {{began to spread}} beyond the department of <b>Quiche</b> and into other areas comprising the Northern Transversal Strip (FTN). In Panzos, Alta Verapaz Indian peasants began to suffer human rights abuses accompanying evictions from their land by farmers and local authorities {{in favor of the}} economic interests of Izabal Mining Operations Company (EXMIBAL) and Transmetales.|$|E
25|$|Pre-Columbian {{cultures}} {{were primarily}} oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate codices. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after {{the arrival of}} European colonizers, {{as was the case}} with the Popol Vuh. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the Quechua-speaking population of Peru and the <b>Quiché</b> (K'iche') of Guatemala.|$|E
25|$|The K'iche' kingdom {{reached its}} height under the king K'iq'ab who ruled from the {{fortified}} town of Q'umarkaj (also called by its Nahuatl name Utatlán) near the modern town of Santa Cruz del <b>Quiché.</b> During his rule the K'iche' ruled {{large areas of}} highland Guatemala extending into Mexico, and they subdued other Maya peoples such as the Tz'utujil, Kaqchikel and Mam, {{as well as the}} Nahuan Pipil people.|$|E
25|$|The first {{evidence}} of human habitation in Guatemala {{dates back to}} 12,000 BC. Evidence, such as obsidian arrowheads found {{in various parts of}} the country, suggests a human presence as early as 18,000 BC. There is archaeological proof that early Guatemalan settlers were hunters and gatherers. Pollen samples from Petén and the Pacific coast indicate that maize cultivation had been developed by 3500 BC. Sites dating back to 6500 BC have been found in the <b>Quiché</b> region in the Highlands, and Sipacate and Escuintla on the central Pacific coast.|$|E
25|$|After {{they arrived}} in the New World, the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, {{beginning}} in 1519. Before long, Spanish contact resulted in an epidemic that devastated native populations. Hernán Cortés, who had led the Spanish conquest of Mexico, granted a permit to Captains Gonzalo de Alvarado and his brother, Pedro de Alvarado, to conquer this land. Alvarado at first allied himself with the Kaqchikel nation to fight against their traditional rivals the K'iche' (<b>Quiché)</b> nation. Alvarado later turned against the Kaqchikel, and eventually brought the entire region under Spanish domination.|$|E
25|$|Maya prayer almost {{invariably}} accompanies acts of offering and sacrifice. It often {{takes the form}} of long litanies, in which the names of personified days, saints, angels (rain and lightning deities), features of the landscape connected with historical or mythical events, and mountains are particularly prominent. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that Maya communities in the northwestern highlands of Guatemala have a specialized group of 'Prayermakers'. Prayers, with their hypnotizing scansion, often show a dyadic couplet structure which has also been recognized in Classic period texts. The earliest prayers recorded in European script are in <b>Quiché,</b> and are embedded in the creation myths of the Popol Vuh.|$|E
25|$|French cuisine {{is renowned}} for {{being one of}} the finest in the world. According to the regions, {{traditional}} recipes are different, the North of the country prefers to use butter as the preferred fat for cooking, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South. Moreover, each region of France has iconic traditional specialities: Cassoulet in the Southwest, Choucroute in Alsace, <b>Quiche</b> in the Lorraine region, Beef bourguignon in the Bourgogne, provençal Tapenade, etc. France's most renowned products are wines, including Champagne, Bordeaux, Bourgogne, and Beaujolais as well as a large variety of different cheeses, such as Camembert, Roquefort and Brie. There are more than 400 different varieties.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the <b>Quiché</b> Kingdom is {{described}} {{in a number of}} documents written in postcolonial times both in Spanish and in indigenous languages such as Classical K'iche' and Kaqchikel. Important sources include the Popol Vuh which, apart from the well-known mythology, also contains a history and genealogy of the Kaweq lineage such as the Título de Totonicapán. Information from these can be crosschecked with the Annals of the Cakchiquels recounting the {{history of the}} Kaqchikel vassals and later enemies of the K'iche'. A number of other títulos such as those of Sacapulas, the C'oyoi, Nijaib and Tamub titles each recount K'iche' history from the viewpoint of a specific K'iche' lineage. Other sources include those written by conquistadors and ecclesiastics, and administrative documents of the colonial administration.|$|E
25|$|Asplenium resiliens {{is found}} in the {{southern}} United States, Mexico, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Guatemala, and South America from Colombia and Venezuela south to northern Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. Within the United States, it is found from Florida west to Arizona and southern Nevada and north to south-central Pennsylvania. It is found throughout most of Mexico, but is most abundant in the northeast, in Nuevo León and Coahuila. In Guatemala, it is known from the western departments of Huehuetenango, El <b>Quiché,</b> and Sololá. In Argentina, its distribution follows the arc of the mountains from Jujuy Province southward to the Sierra de la Ventana in Buenos Aires Province; it is also known from Mendoza Province, in the west of the country, from the departments of Las Heras and Luján de Cuyo.|$|E
