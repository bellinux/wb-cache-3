Moreover, we find that non-affine motion is essentially diffusive, with a clearly size-dependent diffusion constant. These results, supplemented by close inspection of the evolving patterns of the non-affine tangent displacement field, lead us to propose a phenomenology of plasticity in such amorphous media.

Using a 2. 5 -dimensional time-dependent ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in Cartesian coordinates, we carry out numerical simulations to investigate the evolution of a magnetic system consisting of a flux rope embedded in a fully-closed <b>quadrupolar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> with different photospheric flux distributions. It is found that, when the photospheric flux is not concentrated too much towards the polarity inversion line (PIL) and the constraint exerted by the background field is not too weak, the equilibrium states of the system are divided into two branches: the rope sticks to the photosphere for the lower branch and levitates in the corona for the upper branch. These two branches are connected by an upward catastrophe (from the lower branch to the upper) and a downward catastrophe (from the upper branch to the lower). Our simulations reveal that there exist both upward and downward catastrophes in <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>fields,</b> which may be either force-free or non-force-free. The existence and the properties of these two catastrophes are influenced by the photospheric flux distribution, and a downward catastrophe is always paired with an upward catastrophe.

40|$|Some {{types of}} solar flares are {{observed}} in X-shaped <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>field</b> configuration. To understand the {{magnetic energy storage}} in such a region, we studied non-potential field formation in an X-shaped <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>field</b> region formed in the active region NOAA 11967, which produced three X-shaped M-class flares on February 2, 2014. Nonlinear force-free field modeling was applied to a time series of vector magnetic field maps from the Solar Optical Telescope on board Hinode and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board Solar Dynamics Observatory. Our analysis of the temporal three-dimensional magnetic field evolution shows that the sufficient free energy had already been stored more than 10 hours before the occurrence of the first M-class flare and that the storage was observed in a localized region. In this localized region, quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) started to develop gradually from 9 hours before the first M-class flare. One of the flare ribbons {{that appeared in the}} first M-class flare was co-spatial with the location of the QSLs, suggesting that the formation of the QSLs is important in the process of energy release. These QSLs do not appear in the potential field calculation, indicating that they were created by the non-potential field. The formation of the QSLs was associated with the transverse photospheric motion of the pre-emerged flux and {{the emergence of a new}} flux. This observation indicates that the occurrence of the flares requires the formation of QSLs in the non-potential field in which free magnetic energy is stored in advance.

Using Maxwell's equations, we calculate the magnetic and electric fields associated with a free charge in a bulk uniaxial magnetoelectric, as well as in a finite sphere of magnetoelectric material. We show that a charge in the prototypical magnetoelectric Cr$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $, which is uniaxial with a diagonal magnetoelectric response, induces an internal magnetic field with both monopolar and quadrupolar components, but that only the quadrupolar contribution extends beyond the sample surface.

40|$|Cool {{stars with}} outer {{convective}} envelopes are observed to have magnetic fields {{with a variety}} of geometries, which on large scales are dominated by a combination of the lowest order fields such as the dipole, quadrupole and octupole modes. Magnetised stellar wind outflows are primarily responsible for the loss of angular momentum from these objects during the main sequence. Previous works have shown the reduced effectiveness of the stellar wind braking mechanism with increasingly complex, but singular, magnetic field geometries. In this paper, we quantify the impact of mixed dipolar and <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>fields</b> on the spin-down torque using 50 MHD simulations with mixed field, along with 10 of each pure geometries. The simulated winds include a wide range of magnetic field strength and reside in the slow-rotator regime. We find that the stellar wind braking torque from our combined geometry cases are well described by a broken power law behaviour, where the torque scaling with field strength can be predicted by the dipole component alone or the quadrupolar scaling utilising the total field strength. The simulation results can be scaled and apply to all main-sequence cool stars. For Solar parameters, the lowest order component of the field (dipole in this paper) is the most significant in determining the angular momentum loss.

40|$|With Fourier {{transform}} ion {{cyclotron resonance}} (FTICR) mass spectrometry one determines the mass-to-charge ratio of an ion by measuring its cyclotron frequency. However, the need to confine ions to the trapping region of the {{ion cyclotron resonance}} (ICR) cell with electric fields induces deviations from the unperturbed cyclotron frequency. Additional perturbations to the observed cyclotron frequency are often attributed to changes in space charge conditions. This study presents a detailed investigation of the observed ion cyclotron frequency {{as a function of}} ion z-axis kinetic energy. In a perfect three-dimensional <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>field,</b> cyclotron frequency is independent of position within the trap. However, in most ICR cell designs, this ideality is approximated only near the trap center and deviations arise from this ideal <b>quadrupolar</b> <b>field</b> as the ion moves both radially and axially {{from the center of the}} trap. To allow differentiation between deviations in observed cyclotron frequency caused from changes in space charge conditions or differences in oscillation amplitude, ions with identical molecular weights but different axial kinetic energy, and thus amplitude of z-axis motion, were simultaneously trapped within the ICR cell. This allows one to attribute deviations in observed cyclotron frequency to differences in the average force from the radial electric field experienced by ions of different axial amplitude. Experimentally derived magnetron frequency is compared with the magnetron frequency calculated using SIMION 7. 0 for ions of different axial amplitude. Electron promoted ion coherence, or EPIC, is used to reduce the differences in radial electric fields at different axial positions. Thus with the application of EPIC, the differences in observed cyclotron frequencies are minimized for ions of different axial oscillation amplitudes...|$|E

We make use of the ZEUS- 3 D code integrating the MHD equations and added magnetic diffusivity. We measure the efficiency of the angular-momentum transport. Various model simulations delivered transport parameters of alpha_SS= 0. 01 to 0. 05 which are consistent with several local numerical investigations. Two of the models reach a highly turbulent state at which alpha_SS is of the order of 0. 1. After a certain stage of saturating of the turbulence, Reynolds stress is found to be negative (inward transport) in many of the models, whereas Maxwell stresses dominate and deliver a positive (outward) total transport. Several of the models yield strongly fluctuating Reynolds stresses, while Maxwell stresses are smooth and always transport outwards. Dynamo action is found in the accretion disk simulations. A positive dynamo-alpha is indicated in the northern hemisphere of the most prominent run, coming along with negative kinetic and current helicities (all having the opposite sign on the southern side). The dipolar structure of the magnetic field is maintained throughout the simulations, although indication for a decay of antisymmetry is found.
