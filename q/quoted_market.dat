40|$|We {{develop a}} model of trading in {{securities}} markets with two specialized sides: traders posting <b>quotes</b> (<b>market</b> makers) and traders hitting <b>quotes</b> (<b>market</b> takers). Liquidity cycles emerge naturally, as the market moves from phases with high liquidity to phases with low liquidity. Traders monitor the market to seize pro 8 ̆ 5 t opportunities. Complementarities in monitoring decisions generate multiplicity of equilibria: one with high liquidity and another with no liquidity. The trading rate depends on the allocation of the trading fee between each side and the maximal trading rate is achieved with asymmetric fees. The di¤erence in the fee charged on market-makers and the fee charged on market-takers ("the make-take spread") increases in (i) the tick-size, (ii) {{the ratio of the}} size of the market-making side to the size of the market-taking side, and (iii) the ratio of monitoring cost for market-takers to monitoring cost for market-makers. The model yields several empirical implications regarding the trading rate, the dura-tion between quotes and trades, the bid-ask spread, and the e¤ect of algorithmic trading on these variables...|$|R

50|$|Level One: The {{preferred}} inputs to valuation {{efforts are}} “quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities,” with the caveat that the reporting entity must {{have access to}} that market. An example would be a stock trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions involving the identical assets or liabilities being valued, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items, especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets. If available, a <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> price in an active market for identical assets or liabilities should be used. To use this level, the entity must have access to an active market for the item being valued. In many circumstances, <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> prices are unavailable. If a <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> price is not available, preparers should make an estimate of fair value using the best information available in the circumstances. The resulting fair value estimate would then be classified in Level Two or Level Three.|$|E

50|$|For example, Citibank detects that Deutsche Bank is quoting {{dollars at}} a bid price of 0.8171 €/$, and that Barclays is quoting pounds at a bid price of 1.4650 $/£ (Deutsche Bank and Barclays are {{in other words}} willing to buy those {{currencies}} at those prices). Citibank itself is quoting the same prices for these two exchange rates. A trader at Citibank then sees that Crédit Agricole is quoting pounds at an ask price of 1.1910 €/£ (in other words {{it is willing to}} sell pounds at that price). While the <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> cross exchange rate is 1.1910 €/£, Citibank's trader realizes that the implicit cross exchange rate is 1.1971 €/£ (by calculating 1.4650 × 0.8171 = 1.1971), meaning that Crédit Agricole has narrowed its bid-ask spread to serve as a market maker between the euro and the pound. Although the market suggests the implicit cross exchange rate should be 1.1971 euros per pound, Crédit Agricole is selling pounds at a lower price of 1.1910 euros. Citibank's trader can hastily exercise triangular arbitrage by exchanging dollars for euros with Deutsche Bank, then exchanging euros for pounds with Crédit Agricole, and finally exchanging pounds for dollars with Barclays. The following steps illustrate the triangular arbitrage transaction.|$|E

40|$|Research Paper and Powerpoint PresentationLake Chad is an {{important}} fish supply centre in the semi-arid zone of West Africa. Processed Fish Trade (PFT) has catered neighbouring countries for a long time. However, Fresh Fish Trade (FFT) boomed due to severe droughts between 1970 and 1994, by which the PFT main fish species were replaced by species suited to FFT, and {{to the introduction of}} modern technology. As migrant fishermen increased, FFT also raised. In PFT the relationship between fishermen and middlemen is usually explained as Patron-Client Relationship (PCR), characterized by reciprocal agreement and exclusivity. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe FFT at Lake Chad, which has hardly been surveyed yet, and to compare the PCR in FFT and PFT. Field survey was conducted at Commune of Darak in Cameroon on March 2011. In the case of FFT, most of middlemen dealt with fishermen who got their fishing gears by themselves and <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> price of major species was stable, but there were some cases in which fishermen paying back the gears borrowed from middlemen resulted in a deviation from the market price. Since trade was mostly occasional, interaction between middlemen and fishermen was mostly temporary, not long-term relations based on trust, so that middlemen had to keep the <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> price in order not to lose their client. Therefore, fishermen are less constricted by and more equal to middlemen than in regular PFT. Because of this kind of PRC, FFT does not fit the ‘economy of affection’ model, but rather resembles ‘market economy’...|$|E

A purchaser needs an estimation of a usual market price of the real estate in order to obtain a mortgage loan. A seller needs an expert’s opinion (the administrative price) for quoting the property tax. The Diploma Theses has been divided into two parts. The first part is theoretical and the second is practical. The theoretical part deals with <b>quoting</b> a <b>market</b> price of real estate. I have focused on <b>quoting</b> <b>market</b> prices for the needs of banks to grant loans and credits. Valuating, which has been described in the theoretical part, has been applied on some concrete real estate from 2008 and 2009.

Based on the generalised results of the investigation from years 2008 and 2009, I have tried to describe some possible development of the prices...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to find a}} pricing model for weather derivatives based on temperature. A general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with seasonal mean and volatility is proposed to model the time-dynamics of daily average temperatures. The model is fitted to almost 54 years of daily observations recorded in Chicago, Philadelphia, Portland and Tucson. The unequivocal evidence of fat tails and negative skewness observed for the city of Tucson is modelled by introducing Lèvy processes. Since weather derivatives is an incomplete market, unique prices are derived using the market price of risk. Finally, an estimate of the market price of risk is provided by calibrating theoretical prices to the actual <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> prices...|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} interest-rate models were built on a single yield curve used both for {{discounting}} and forwarding. However, the crisis that has affected financial markets {{in the last years}} led market players to revise this assumption and accommodate basis-swap spreads, whose remarkable widening can no longer be neglected. In recent literature we find many proposals of multi-curve interest-rate models, whose calibration would typically require market quotes for all yield curves. At present this is not possible since most of the quotes are missing or extremely illiquid. Thanks to a suitable extension of the HJM framework, we propose a parsimonious model based on observed rates that deduces yield-curve dynamics from a single family of Markov processes. Furthermore, we detail a specification of the model reporting numerical examples of calibration to <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> data. ...|$|E

As aresult, several empirical models based on price time–series statistical properties have been developed in order to estimate them. Recent greater financial data availability has allowed the development of models that focus on price discovery and use more statistical complex methodologies like GMM or VAR. This paper analyses this set of models that allows the estimation of the bid–ask spread components from price dynamics, specifically, the estimation of the adverse selection component in time series. Actually, this sort of models are a powerful tool to investigate how information is incorporated into <b>quotes.</b> <b>Market</b> microstructure, insider trading, spread, adverse selection component, transaction cost. ...|$|R

The data set is unusual, in that all forecasts are in the form of probabilities. Bets are made "on paper"Â against <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> betting odds according to the (fractional) Kelly criterion. To identify expertise, individual forecasters are scored using conventional probability scoring rules, a "Kelly score"Â representing the forecaster's historical paper profits from Kelly-betting, and the more simplistic "categorical score"Â (number of misclassifications). Despite implicitly truncating all probabilities to either 0 or 1 before evaluation, and thus losing a lot of information, the categorical scoring rule appears to be a propitious way of ranking probability forecasters. Bootstrap significance tests indicate that this improvement is not attributable to chance.

40|$|This study {{examines}} how US companies used the Level 3 provisions of fair value accounting to value their financial assets during the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC) when relevant accounting rules regarding fair value measurements were relaxed. It {{contributes to the}} literature by providing evidence about non-financial companies’ reporting of Level 3 financial assets during the 2008 GFC. Substantially large amounts of potentially manipulable toxic assets, classified as Level 3 by US companies, are of significant importance to the US and global economy. Results of the study indicate that financially distressed companies were holding significantly larger amounts of Level 3 financial assets, which are those based on management’s own modeling of inputs. Level 3 assets are thought to be more subjectively manipulable than Level 1 or 2 inputs that are based on <b>quoted</b> <b>market</b> prices. Further, the results lend additional support to the growing belief that avoidance of toxic asset impairments has contributed centrally to the way the global financial crisis has unfolded. 37 page(s...|$|E
