The evaluation relies strongly on the <b>quantitative</b> deployment <b>status</b> and policy effectiveness indicators. European RES deployment and policy has progressed strongly in recent years, but the growth here has been mainly driven by effective policies in a small or medium number of top runner countries. Across Europe, the highest average policy effectiveness over six years was reached for onshore wind (4. 2 %), biofuels (3. 6 %) and biomass electricity (2. 7 %), while in the heat sector, all technologies score below 2 %. Comparing the recent progress to the required growth for meeting the 2020 target, it appears that some countries largely exceed the interim targets of the RES Directive 2009 / 28 /EC. Despite this, Europe will need additional policy effort to reach the 2020 target. Critical success factors include imple menting effective and efficient policies that attract sufficient investments, reducing administrative and grid related barriers, especially in currently less advanced countries, upgrading the power grid infrastructure, dismantling financial barriers in the heat sector, realising sustainability standards for biomass, and lowering energy demand through increased energy efficiency efforts...|$|R

40|$|The {{framework}} for the integrated water management of the entire EU area has been set, when the European Parliament and Council passed the Directive 2000 / 60 /EC in 2000. According to the directive, the evaluation of meeting the environmental objectives is based also upon the assessment of quantitative and chemical status of individual groundwater body. The assessment of <b>quantitative</b> <b>status</b> of groundwater bodies under the Groundwater Directive of EU {{is based on the}} definition of the available groundwater quantity. Thisisalong period mean annual renewable quantity of water in the groundwater body, reduced by the quantity of the long period annual groundwater discharge, which is required for sustaining ecological objectives concerning surface water bodies and preservation of the ecosistems, connected with the groundwater bodies.

40|$|Female {{reproductive}} ageing is {{a complex}} trait mostly explained {{by a combination of}} genetic and non-genetic factors. It compromises the {{decline in the number of}} oocytes (quantity) and the decrease of oocyte quality. It has been postulated that BRCA 1 / 2 gene mutation carriers have a lower <b>quantitative</b> ovarian reserve <b>status.</b> However, data from adequately powered clinical studies are lacking. The aim of the first part of this thesis is therefore to explore whether women with a BRCA gene mutation actually have a diminished <b>quantitative</b> ovarian reserve <b>status.</b> The putative role of BRCA genes on ovarian reserve decline was evaluated by the following outcomes: age at natural menopause, serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels and number of mature oocytes in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. Based on this thesis and previous research, there is no sound evidence that BRCA mutation carriers have a reduced <b>quantitative</b> ovarian reserve <b>status</b> as compared to proven non-carriers or controls. However, various types of selection bias that go along with the study population complicate such comparison. At this moment, counselling of healthy mutation carriers should not be extended with information regarding fertility issues. The second part of this thesis focusses on the (cost) -effectiveness of individualised follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) dosing based on ovarian reserve testing (ORT) in IVF and intracystoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) treatment. The ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation is an expression of the quantitative ovarian reserve. A large proportion of women show a poor or hyper response, which both have been shown to negatively affect live birth rates. As the antral follicle count (AFC) and AMH level are currently the best tests to predict such an inappropriate response, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) dose individualisation based on one of these tests seems promising in order to improve the proportion of normal responses. It has been hypothesised that an increase in the proportion of normal responders may improve live birth rates. Nowadays, individualised FSH dosing is implemented in standard clinical care in many centres. However, it is still unclear whether such an approach indeed leads to better IVF/ICSI results and whether it is cost-effective. This thesis demonstrates that individualised FSH dosing based on AFC in women with a regular cycle does not increase live birth rates or improve treatment costs as compared to a standard FSH dose. This result was also found in predicted poor responders only. So, a standard dose of 150 IU/day is suitable for all women, with a regular menstrual cycle, starting their first IVF/ICSI treatment as it is less expensive and gives comparable live birth rates. In predicted hyper responders, individualised FSH dosing might have a positive effect on safety outcomes, but further adequately powered research is needed...|$|R

Little is known about how screening results impact perceptions of AYA health. MethodsWe recruited 37 AYAs and 35 parents of AYAs with differing risk for abnormal cholesterol results: (1) familial hypercholesterolemia; (2) obesity; and (3) generally healthy. Participants completed <b>quantitative</b> health <b>status</b> ratings using visual analog scales (VASs) and semistructured interviews regarding three hypothetical cholesterol screening scenarios: (1) high likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) before age 40 years (“high risk”); (2) some risk of CVD before age 70 years (“moderate risk”); and (3) low risk for CVD despite a strong family history of CVD (“low risk”). We analyzed VAS data with logistic regression and qualitative data with a priori and emergent coding using multiple coders. ResultsEach group perceived all three cholesterol screening scenarios as comparatively less than perfect health; the high-risk result fell furthest from perfect health. Although {{there was no significant difference}} between AYAs and parents in VAS ratings, qualitative analyses revealed AYAs were more likely than parents to discount the impact of moderate-risk results because of longer length of time before predicted CVD. ConclusionsAYAs' and parents' perceptions of the impact of cholesterol screening results on AYA health varied by presented scenario, ranging from mild to significant decreases in perceptions of AYA health.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to assess the future spatial and {{temporal}} distribution of precipitation and temperature, and relate the corresponding change to water resources’ <b>quantitative</b> <b>status</b> in Pinios River Basin (PRB), Thessaly, Greece. For this purpose, data from four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) for the periods 2021 – 2100 driven by several General Circulation Models (GCMs) were collected and bias-correction was performed based on linear scaling method. The bias-correction was made based on monthly precipitation and temperature data collected for the period 1981 – 2000 from 57 meteorological stations in total. The results indicate a general trend according to which precipitation is decreasing whilst temperature is increasing to an extent that varies depending on each particular RCM–GCM output. On the average, annual precipitation change for the period 2021 – 2100 was about −  80  mm, ranging between −  149 and +  35  mm, while the corresponding change for temperature was 2.81  °C, ranging between 1.48 and 3.72  °C. The investigation of potential impacts to the water resources demonstrates that water availability is expected to be significantly decreased in the already water-stressed PRB. The water stresses identified are related to the potential decreasing trend in groundwater recharge and the increasing trend in irrigation demand, which constitutes the major water consumer in PRB.|$|E

To verify this generalized statement behavior patterns of overweight and nonoverweight children needs to be understood. Therefore, we investigated the distribution of sedentary and activity levels in a quantitative and qualitative way. Methods. Data was collected from 37 randomly selected nonoverweight and 55 overweight children. They were 8 to 11 years of age. Height and weight were measured and weight status was characterized by BMI (BMI-percentile, BMI-SDS). Daily PA (physical activity) was measured by direct accelerometry. Spare time and screen time entertainment were obtained by questionnaires. Results.
