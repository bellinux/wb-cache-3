40|$|The <b>queueing</b> <b>problem</b> with a Poisson arrival {{stream and}} two {{identical}} Erlang servers is analysed for the queueing discipline based on shortest expected delay. This <b>queueing</b> <b>problem</b> may be {{represented as a}} random walk on the integer grid in the first quadrant of the plane. In the paper it is shown that the equilibrium distribution of this random walk can be written as a countable linear combination of product forms. This linear combination is constructed in a compensation procedure. In this case the compensation procedure is essentially more complicated than in other cases where the same idea was exploited. The reason for the complications is {{that in this case}} the boundary consists of several layers which in turn is caused by the fact that transitions starting in inner states are not restricted to end in neighbouring states. Good starting solutions for the compensation procedure are found by solving the shortest expected delay problem with the same service distributions but with instantaneous jockeying. It is also shown that the results can be used for an efficient computation of relevant performance criteria...|$|E

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In {{this study we}} are working on <b>queuing</b> <b>problems.</b> In our model a {{solution}} to a <b>queuing</b> <b>problem</b> is an ordering of agents and a transfer vector where the sum of the transfers of agents is equal to zero. Hence a <b>queuing</b> <b>problem</b> is a double, where we have a finite set of agents and a profile of payoff functions of agents which represent their preferences on their orderings and transfers. We are assuming that the payoff functions of agents are quasi-linear on transfers. Our main aim is to find envy free solutions for <b>queuing</b> <b>problems.</b> Since payoff functions of agents are quasi-linear envy freeness implies Pareto efficiency. For problems where there are less than five agents, we show that the set of envy free solutions is not empty and we are able to characterize the envy free solutions. We conjecture that our results may be extended to general case similar to our extension from three person case to four person case. When we assume that a <b>queuing</b> <b>problem</b> satisfies order preservation property we are able to characterize envy free solutions with a solution concept that we introduce in this study.

Finally, we present counter examples that show the non-monotone structure of the optimal policy when the constant batch size assumption is relaxed. ...|$|E

For a fixed control policy, the span semi-norm {{of the so-called}} Bellman residual is shown to be convex in the Banach space of candidate solutions to the DP problem. This fact motivates the introduction of an AVI algorithm with local search that seeks to minimize the span semi-norm of the Bellman residual in a convex value function approximation space.

The procedure employs the classical AVI algorithm direction (Bellman residual) combined with a set of independent search directions, to improve the convergence rate. It has guaranteed convergence and satisfies, at least, the necessary optimality conditions over a prescribed set of directions.
