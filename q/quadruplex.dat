With two signals in each direction, <b>quadruplex</b> telegraphy thus implements a form of multiplexing. The <b>quadruplex</b> telegraph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1874, which enabled Western Union to save money by greatly increasing the number of messages the company could send without building new lines. It also allowed the company to use its existing lines more efficiently to meet seasonal increases in message traffic and to lease excess capacity for private lines.|$|E
40|$|International audienceGuanine-rich DNA or RNA {{sequences}} can fold into higher-order, four-stranded structures termed <b>quadruplexes</b> {{that are}} suspected to play pivotal roles in cellular mechanisms including {{the control of}} the genome integrity and gene expression. However, the biological relevance of <b>quadruplexes</b> is still a matter of debate owing to the paucity of unbiased evidences of their existence in cells. Recent reports on quadruplex-specific antibodies and small-molecule fluorescent probes help dispel reservations and accumulating evidences now pointing towards the cellular relevance of <b>quadruplexes.</b> To better assess and comprehend their biology, developing new versatile tools to detect both DNA and RNA <b>quadruplexes</b> in cells is essential. We report here a smart fluorescent probe that allows for the simple detection of <b>quadruplexes</b> thanks to an uncommon spectroscopic mechanism known as the red-edge effect (REE).

G-rich sequences are known to adopt stable four-stranded structures, and such <b>quadruplexes</b> have been suspected to play important roles in key functions such as the control of gene expression. Here we demonstrate that RNA <b>quadruplexes</b> readily form in vivo. We have constructed mRNA-based G-rich elements that mask the ribosome binding site by folding into four-stranded structures. The suppression of gene expression correlates with the stability of inserted G <b>quadruplexes.</b> Moreover, <b>quadruplexes</b> with moderate stability respond to changes in temperature, thus behaving as artificial RNA thermometers. In conclusion, we introduce tuneable mRNA-based devices that enable modulation of gene expression by a predictable but thus far unknown mechanism...|$|R

After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The <b>quadruplex</b> telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction.

The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities.

The Super Hornet has a <b>quadruplex</b> digital fly-by-wire system, as well as a digital flight-control system that detects and corrects for battle damage. Initial production models used the APG-73 radar, later replaced by the AN/APG-79 active electronically scanned array (AESA). The AN/ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward Looking InfraRed), is the main electro-optical sensor and laser designator pod for the Super Hornet.

Two piece flaperons occupied most of the trailing edge, which was blended into the fuselage with long fillets. A total of nine flight control surfaces were actuated by a <b>quadruplex</b> fly-by-wire (FBW) system, which lacked any mechanical backup counterpart, providing a factor of aerodynamic instability of between 10 and 12 per cent. The wingtips were cropped and fitted with missile rails to carry Rafael Python 3 air-to-air missile. At 38.5 square meters, the wing area was 38 per cent greater than the F-16, while the aspect ratio was 2.10, barely two-thirds that of the F-16. Development of the wing and fin were the responsibility of Grumman, who were contracted to initially manufacture the first 20 of each.|$|E
40|$|Truncated {{sequences}} of human telomeric DNA can readily assemble to form parallel stranded <b>quadruplexes</b> containing A- and G-tetrads. The {{formation of an}} A-tetrad is highly context-dependent {{and the relationship between}} the formation of an A-tetrad and the glycosidic torsion angle of the adenosine residues implicated has not been completely clarified so far. In order to give a further insight in this issue we synthesized the modified oligomers d(ABrGGGT) and d(TABrGGGT), two different truncations of the human telomeric sequence containing a 8 -bromoadenosine residue, named ABr. NMR data show that both the modified oligomers are able to perfectly fold into highly symmetric <b>quadruplexes</b> with all strands parallel to each other. Molecular modeling studies were performed on both [d(ABrGGGT) ] 4 and [d(TABrGGGT) ] 4, indicating that a bulky substituent, such as a bromine atom at the C 8 position of adenines, can force the glycosidic bond to adopt a syn conformation, stabilizing the resulting <b>quadruplexes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The protein RAP 1 is {{essential}} for the maintenance of the telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and binds in vitro to multiple sites found within the TG 1 - 3 telomeric repeats. We show here that, in addition to its known binding activity for double-stranded DNA, RAP 1 binds sequence-specifically to the GT-strands. This indicates that RAP 1 is the protein that binds to the telomeric terminal GT-tails. Furthermore, we have found that RAP 1 binds to and promotes the formation of G-tetrads, i. e. DNA <b>quadruplexes,</b> in GT-strand oligonucleotides at nanomolar concentrations. The formation of DNA <b>quadruplexes</b> appears to involve the intermolecular association of GT-strands. The minimal DNA-binding domain of RAP 1 (DBD) binds only to double-stranded DNA, so that the novel DNA-binding activity we have found involves regions of the protein located outside of the DBD. The finding that a telomeric protein promotes the formation of G-tetrads argues for the use of DNA <b>quadruplexes</b> in telomere association...|$|R

500|$|To {{counter the}} {{tendency}} to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a <b>quadruplex</b> (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces {{in such a way}} as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's flight attitude to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: [...] "You don't fly an F-16; it flies you." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the YF-17, {{which had}} {{hydromechanical}} controls {{serving as a}} backup to the FBW, General Dynamics took the innovative step of eliminating mechanical linkages between the control stick and rudder pedals, and the flight control surfaces.

The <b>quadruplex</b> design permits [...] "graceful degradation" [...] in flight control response in {{that the loss of}} one channel renders the FLCS a [...] "triplex" [...] system. The FLCC began as an analog system on the A/B variants, but has been supplanted by a digital computer system beginning with the F-16C/D Block 40.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{analysis}} of dual G-quadruplexes formed in the four repeats of the consensus sequence from the insulin-linked polymorphic region (ACAGGGGTGTGGGG; ILPRn= 4). Mobilities of ILPRn= 4 in nondenaturing gel and circular dichroism (CD) studies confirmed the formation of two intramolecular G-quadruplexes in the sequence. Both CD and single molecule studies using optical tweezers showed that the two <b>quadruplexes</b> in the ILPRn= 4 most likely adopt a hybrid G-quadruplex structure that was entirely different from the mixture of parallel and antiparallel conformers previously observed in the single G-quadruplex forming sequence (ILPRn= 2). These {{results indicate that the}} structural knowledge of a single G-quadruplex cannot be automatically extrapolated to predict the conformation of multiple <b>quadruplexes</b> in tandem. Furthermore, mechanical pulling of the ILPRn= 4 at the single molecule level suggests that the two <b>quadruplexes</b> are unfolded cooperatively, perhaps due to a quadruplex–quadruplex interaction (QQI) between them. Additional evidence for the QQI was provided by DMS footprinting on the ILPRn= 4 that identified specific guanines only protected {{in the presence of a}} neighboring G-quadruplex.
