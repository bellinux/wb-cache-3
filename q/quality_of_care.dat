5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females.

Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that women have to do.

40|$|Background & Aim: <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>care</b> is a {{major issue}} in nursing management. In the last year of nursing studies (internships) in Iran, nursing {{students}} are going to independently carry out responsibilities of graduated nurses. Patients' satisfaction is a main indicator for nursing care quality. This {{study was to determine the}} correlation between the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> behaviors among internship students with the patients' satisfaction with nursing care quality. Methods & Materials: In this cross-sectional study, 200 patients were selected using convenience sampling method from the hospitals affiliated to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Data were gathered using two questionnaires including: 1) <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>caring</b> behaviors; and 2) patient satisfaction with nursing care quality questionnaire (PSNCQQ). Data were analyzed using statistical tests in the SPSS- 13. Results: Regarding <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>caring</b> behaviors, the subscale scores of the knowledge and skills were good; and patient education was low. The relationship between the nurses and patients, and nursing morality were in average level. Regarding the patient satisfaction, the highest level of satisfaction was related to nursing knowledge and skills; and the lowest level was related to the patient education. Significant correlation was found between the total <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>caring</b> behaviors with the patients' satisfaction and their subscales (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Based on the findings, patients are more satisfied with the <b>caring</b> behaviors <b>of</b> the students who focus on the communication with patients, nursing ethics, and especially patient education during the care...|$|R

5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>care</b> as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E

We hypothesized that the prevalence of concordant (discordant) conditions {{would be associated with}} better (worse) <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care.</b> Methods: Cross-sectional study using practice-level data (7, 884 practices). We estimated the practice-level prevalence of diabetes and 15 other chronic conditions, which were classified as diabetes-concordant (i. e., with the same pathophysiologic risk profile and therefore more likely {{to be part of the}} same management plan) or diabetes-discordant (i. e., not directly related in either their pathogenesis or management). We measured <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care</b> with diabetes-specific indicators (8 processes and 3 intermediate outcomes <b>of</b> <b>care).</b> We used linear regression models to quantify the effect of the prevalence of the conditions on aggregate achievement rate for <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care.</b> Results: Consistent with the proposed model, prevalence rates of four out of the seven concordant conditions (obesity, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure) were positively associated with <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> diabetes <b>care.</b> Similarly, negative associations were observed as predicted for two of the eight discordant conditions (epilepsy, mental health).
