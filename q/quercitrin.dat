5000|$|<b>Quercitrin</b> is {{a yellow}} {{dyestuff}} found in Quercus velutina; it hydrolyses to rhamnose and quercetin, a dioxy-~3-phenyl-trioxybenzoy-pyrone.|$|E
50|$|Quercetin is the {{aglycone}} form of {{a number}} of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin and <b>quercitrin,</b> found in citrus fruit, buckwheat and onions. Quercetin forms the glycosides <b>quercitrin</b> and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose, respectively. Likewise guaijaverin is the 3-O-arabinoside, hyperoside is the 3-O-galactoside, isoquercitin is the 3-O-glucoside and spiraeoside is the 4′-O-glucoside. CTN-986 is a quercetin derivative found in cottonseeds and cottonseed oil. Miquelianin is the quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are <b>quercitrin</b> and H2O, whereas its two {{products are}} L-rhamnose and quercetin.|$|E

50|$|Quercitron is {{a yellow}} natural dye {{obtained}} from the bark of the Eastern Black Oak (Quercus velutina), a forest tree indigenous in North America.The name is a shortened form of quercicitron, from Latin quercus, oak, and citron, lemon, and was invented by Edward Bancroft (1744-1821), who by act of parliament in 1785 was granted special privileges {{in regard to the}} importation and use of the substance. The dyestuff is prepared by grinding the bark in mills after it has been freed from its black epidermal layer, and sifting the product to separate the fibrous matter, the fine yellow powder which remains forming the quercitron of commerce.The ruddy-orange decoction of quercitron contains quercitannic acid, whence its use in tanning, and an active dyeing principle, <b>quercitrin,</b> C21H20O11.

40|$|<b>Quercitrin</b> is a {{well-known}} flavonoid that is contained in Flos Albiziae, which {{has been used for}} the treatment of anxiety. The present study investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of <b>quercitrin</b> in experimental models of anxiety. Compared with the control group, repeated treatment with <b>quercitrin</b> (5. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg/kg/day, p. o.) for seven days significantly increased the percentage of entries into and time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus maze. In the light/dark box test, <b>quercitrin</b> exerted an anxiolytic-like effect at 5 and 10 [*]mg/kg. In the marble-burying test, <b>quercitrin</b> (5. 0 and 10. 0 [*]mg/kg) also exerted an anxiolytic-like effect. Furthermore, <b>quercitrin</b> did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity. The anxiolytic-like effects of <b>quercitrin</b> in the elevated plus maze and light/dark box test were blocked by the serotonin- 1 A (5 -hydroxytryptamine- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A)) receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 (3. 0 [*]mg/kg, i. p.) but not by the γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist flumazenil (0. 5 [*]mg/kg, i. p.). The levels of brain monoamines (5 -HT and dopamine) and their metabolites (5 -hydroxy- 3 -indoleacetic acid, 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and homovanillic acid) were decreased after <b>quercitrin</b> treatment. These data suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of <b>quercitrin</b> might be mediated by 5 -HT 1 A receptors but not by benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate hepatoprotective mechanisms of <b>quercitrin</b> isolated from Toona sinensis (Juss.) M. Roem. (syn. Cedrela sinensis Juss.), using acetaminophen (APAP) -treated HepG 2 cell and animal models. In an in vitro study, <b>quercitrin</b> suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced expression of nuclear factor E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2), activity of antioxidant response element (ARE) -reporter gene, and protein levels of NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO 1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD- 2) in APAP-treated HepG 2 cells. In an in vivo study, Balb/c mice were orally administered with 10 or 50 mg/kg of <b>quercitrin</b> for 7 days and followed by the injection with single dose of 300 mg/kg APAP. <b>Quercitrin</b> decreased APAP-caused elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, liver necrosis, the expression of pro-inflammatory factors including inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2 and inerleukin- 1 β, and phosphorylation of kinases including c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p 38. <b>Quercitrin</b> restored protein levels of Nrf 2, NQO 1 and activities and expressions of CAT, GPx, SOD- 2.

40|$|Background and Aims: <b>Quercitrin</b> (QR; quercetin- 3 -O-rhamnoside) {{has been}} used {{previously}} as an antibacterial agent and {{has been shown to}} inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins and prevent an allergic reaction. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that <b>quercitrin</b> exerts protective effects against H 2 O 2 -induced dysfunction in lung fibroblast cells. However, the mechanisms of <b>quercitrin</b> effects on cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis is not well understood. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of <b>quercitrin</b> and the molecular mechanisms of quercitrin-induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Methods: Time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of <b>quercitrin</b> determined by WST- 1 cell proliferation assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay, determination of nucleosome enrichment factor, changes in caspase- 3 activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and also the localization of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane. Changes in whole genome gene expression levels were examined by Illumina Human HT- 12 v 4 beadchip microarrays. Results: There were significant increases in caspase- 3 activity, loss of MMP, and increases in apoptotic cell population in response to <b>quercitrin</b> in A 549 and NCI-H 358 NSCLC cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that genes involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration, cell adhesion and phosphatidylinositol signaling system pathways were the most statistically significant pathways in NCI-H 358 and A 549 cells. These results revealed that <b>quercitrin</b> has antiproliferative and apoptotic effects on lung cancer cells by modulating the immune response.

40|$|The {{role of the}} 6 ″-OH (ω-OH) {{group in}} the {{antioxidant}} activity of flavonoid glycosides has been largely overlooked. Herein, we selected <b>quercitrin</b> (quercetin- 3 -O-rhamnoside) and isoquercitrin (quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside) as model compounds to investigate {{the role of the}} 6 ″-OH group in several antioxidant pathways, including Fe 2 +-binding, hydrogen-donating (H-donating), and electron-transfer (ET). The results revealed that <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin both exhibited dose-dependent antioxidant activities. However, isoquercitrin showed higher levels of activity than <b>quercitrin</b> in the Fe 2 +-binding, ET-based ferric ion reducing antioxidant power, and multi-pathways-based superoxide anion-scavenging assays. In contrast, <b>quercitrin</b> exhibited greater activity than isoquercitrin in an H-donating-based 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging assay. Finally, in a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl assay based on an oxidatively damaged mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) model, isoquercitrin performed more effectively as a cytoprotector than <b>quercitrin.</b> Based on these results, we concluded that (1) <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin can both indirectly (i. e., Fe 2 +-chelating or Fe 2 +-binding) and directly participate in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect MSCs against ROS-induced oxidative damage; (2) the 6 ″-OH group in isoquercitrin enhanced its ET and Fe 2 +-chelating abilities and lowered its H-donating abilities via steric hindrance or H-bonding compared with quercitrin; and (3) isoquercitrin exhibited higher ROS scavenging activity than <b>quercitrin,</b> allowing it to improve protect MSCs against ROS-induced oxidative damage...|$|E
40|$|<b>Quercitrin</b> is a {{flavonoid}} with antiinflammatory {{activity in}} experimental colitis, {{associated with an}} antioxidative action and amelioration of water absorption in vivo.

In the present study, different in vivo experiments were performed {{in order to}} evaluate the mechanisms of action involved in this effect, with special attention to its effects on proinflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide (NO). Experimental colitis was induced in female Wistar rats by incorporation of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water.

40|$|AbstractPolyamine {{biosynthesis}} enzymes {{are promising}} drug {{targets for the}} treatment of leishmaniasis, Chagas’ disease and African sleeping sickness. Arginase, which is a metallohydrolase, is the first enzyme involved in polyamine biosynthesis and converts arginine into ornithine and urea. Ornithine is used in the polyamine pathway that is essential for cell proliferation and ROS detoxification by trypanothione. The flavonols quercetin and <b>quercitrin</b> have been described as antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial compounds, and their ability to inhibit arginase was tested in this work. We characterized the inhibition of recombinant arginase from Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis by quercetin, <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin. The IC 50 values for quercetin, <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin were estimated to be 3. 8, 10 and 4. 3 μM, respectively. Quercetin is a mixed inhibitor, whereas <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin are uncompetitive inhibitors of L. (L.) amazonensis arginase. Quercetin interacts with the substrate l-arginine and the cofactor Mn 2 + at pH 9. 6, whereas <b>quercitrin</b> and isoquercitrin do not interact with the enzyme’s cofactor or substrate. Docking analysis of these flavonols suggests that the cathecol group of the three compounds interact with Asp 129, which is involved in metal bridge formation for the cofactors MnA 2 + and MnB 2 + in the active site of arginase.
