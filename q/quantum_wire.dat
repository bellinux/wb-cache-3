Das Sarma's work http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.1540 on graphene has led to the theoretical understanding of graphene carrier transport properties http://arxiv.org/abs/0610157 at low densities where the inhomogeneous electron-hole puddles dominate the graphene landscape. In 2006 Das Sarma with Euyheon Hwang provided the basic theory for collective modes and dielectric response in graphene and related chiral two-dimensional materials.http://arxiv.org/abs/0610561 In 2011 Das Sarma and collaborators introduced a new class of lattice tight-binding flat-band systems with nontrivial Chern numbers which belongs to the universality class of continuum quantum Hall and fractional quantum Hall systems without any external magnetic fields. Such flat-band tight-binding systems with non-trivial Chern numbers have substantially enhanced the types of possible physical systems for the realization of topological matter. Among Das Sarma's other well-known theoretical contributions http://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/images/CV/dassarma_cv.pdf to quantum condensed matter physics are: the self-consistent electronic structure calculation of semiconductor heterojunction-based high electron mobility transistor structures, electron-phonon interaction induced polaron effects in low dimensional systems, collective excitation and quasiparticle modes in semiconductor structures such as <b>quantum</b> <b>wire,</b> quantum well and superlattice, hot electron relaxation in semiconductors, quantum Anderson localization, many-body effects and electron-electron interaction in semiconductors, canted antiferromagnetic states in quantum Hall effect, various spin transistor systems, magnetic polaron theory of diluted magnetic semiconductor, coupled spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, theory of quantum decoherence of localized electron spins in solids, central spin decoherence problem, spectral diffusion of electron spins in solids, dynamical decoupling and quantum control, quantum transport theory in low dimensional semiconductors, bilayer quantum Hall systems, and realistic solid state effects in the fractional quantum Hall effect phenomena. Das Sarma also made important contributions to the classical statistical mechanics problem of dynamical growth of systems far from equilibrium where his work introduced the standard model for understanding the molecular beam epitaxy of thin film growth, both from a continuum field theory viewpoint http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v66/i18/p2348_1 in terms of the so-called Villain-Lai-Das Sarma equation and from the discrete atomistic viewpoint http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v66/i3/p325_1 in terms of the so-called Das Sarma-Tamborenea model.|$|E
