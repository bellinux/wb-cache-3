There are many types, all with different properties that make them advantageous for different applications. Some work as small metal sensors completely on their own while others must be complexed with a subunit that can chelate or bind a metal ion. Rhodamine for example undergoes a conformation change upon the binding of a metal ion. In so doing it switches between a colorless, non-fluorescent spirocyclic form to a fluorescent, pink open cyclic form. <b>Quinoline</b> <b>based</b> sensors have been developed that form luminescent complexes with Cd(II) and fluorescent ones with Zn(II). It is hypothesized to function by changing its lowest luminescent state from n-* to -* when coordinating to a metal. When the Dansyl group DNS binds to a metal, it loses a sulfonamide hydrogen, causing fluorescence quenching via a PET or reverse PET mechanism in which an electron is transferred either to or from the metal that is bound.|$|R

Despite the fact that extensive efforts have been put into the discovery of novel antifungal agents, the frequency of these fungal infections has increased drastically worldwide. In our quest for the discovery of novel antifungal compounds, we had previously synthesized and screened quinoline containing 1, 2, 3 -triazole (3 a) as a potent Candida spp inhibitor. In the present study, two structural analogues of 3 a (3 b and 3 c) have been synthesized to determine the role of quinoline and their anti-Candida activities have been evaluated. Preliminary results helped us to determine 3 a and 3 b as lead inhibitors. The IC 50 values of compound 3 a for C. albicans ATCC 90028 (standard) and C. albicans (fluconazole resistant) strains were 0. 044 and 2. 3 μg/ml, respectively while compound 3 b gave 25. 4 and 32. 8 μg/ml values for the same strains. Disk diffusion, growth and time kill curve assays showed significant inhibition of C. albicans in the presence of compounds 3 a and 3 b. Moreover, 3 a showed fungicidal nature while 3 b was fungistatic. Both the test compounds significantly lower the secretion of proteinases and phospholipases. While, 3 a inhibited proteinase secretion in C. albicans (resistant strain) by 45 %, 3 b reduced phospholipase secretion by 68 % in C. albicans ATCC 90028 at their respective MIC values.

40|$|Chapter 1. Introduction A {{variety of}} {{inorganic}} molecules and ions participate in complex biological signaling networks. Three {{of these species}} are nitric oxide (NO), nitroxyl (HNO), and mobile zinc. Maintaining the homeostasis of these signaling molecules is vital and a deeper comprehension of their roles could help in understanding the pathology of specific diseases associated with their dysregulation. One method used to monitor levels of these analytes in biological samples is fluorescence microscopy. Shifting the fluorescence emission to longer wavelengths would improve these already existing probes. Having access to red and near-infrared (NIR) sensors is particularly useful for investigating the interplay of multiple analytes using fluorescence microscopy {{in conjunction with other}} probes that emit at shorter wavelengths. Chapter 2. Synthesis and Characterization of a Fluorescent Sensor with a Dihydrothioxanthene Fluorophore and a <b>Quinoline</b> <b>Based</b> Cu(II) Binding Site A NIR probe designed to detect NO was synthesized and its photophysical properties were fully characterized. Analysis of the photophysics of this sensor revealed that the quinoline-binding site might be quenching the fluorescence of the fluorophore and preventing a turn-on response upon addition of NO. Chapter 3. Synthesis, Characterization, and Implementation of a Near-Infrared Fluorescent Sensor for Detection of Nitroxyl (HNO) A NIR sensor for the detection of HNO was synthesized, fully characterized, and used in live HeLa cells to detect exogenously applied HNO.

40|$|In {{order that}} a better {{understanding}} of the relative reactivity of α- and β-naphthalene derivatives be attained, two approaches have been made to evaluate the magnitude of steric effects associated with some α-naphthalene derivatives. The rates of reaction in nitrobenzene of methyl iodide with pyridine, quinoline, isoquinoline, 2 -methylquinoline, and 8 -methylquinoline, have been studied over the temperature range 10 - 50 °. In following the kinetics of these slow reactions, a convenient and precise conductometric method has been used. Relative heats of activation were taken as quantitative measures of steric strains present in the activated complexes in these reactions. Using evidence advanced by H. C. Brown and his co-workers in their work on strained homomorphs, kinetics results obtained from the quinoline series have been used to evaluate steric strains present in the structures: 1 -methylnaphthalene, 1, 2 -dimetlwlnaphthalene, and 1, 8 -dimethylnaphthalene [...] Steric strains associated with these structures were found to be larger than those of comparable alkyl-benzene structures. This has been attributed to the rigidity of the fused ring system as compared with an alkyl group. The rates of acid-catalysed esterification of benzoic, α-naphthoic, and β-naphthoic acids in absolute methanol, and the rates of alkaline hydrolysis in 56 % (w) acetone-water mixture of the methyl and ethyl esters of these acids have also been studied over the temperature range 15 - 60 °. Rates were followed by acid-base titrations. For the α-derivatives the methods of R. W. Taft have been adopted to separate quantitatively the effect of the fused ring into polar and nonpolar factors. A σ*value for the fused ring in the a-naphthyl system was calculated. The apparent absence of a steric strain effect in these reactions of the α-naphthyl derivatives has been explained through considerations of steric inhibition of resonance.. An estimate of the magnitude of the steric strain in the transition states of these reactions has been made. This value is of the same order as the steric strains found for the <b>quinoline</b> <b>bases</b> in their reaction with methyl iodide.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Pharmaceutical Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The world suffers {{under the}} immense threat of malaria with about 1 million people dying and a further 500 million people getting {{infected}} and debilitated by the disease each year. It {{has a negative}} effect on the economic growth in developing countries that already battles with political unrest, civil wars, famine and the effect of diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. Resistance against the first line drugs such as the quinolines and the antifolate combination drugs makes the fight against malaria increasingly difficult and has prompted studies into alternative chemotherapeutic treatments of the disease. An efficient strategy to develop an effective and cheaper antimalarial compound appears to be the re–design of existing drugs and the exploitation of known parasite–specific targets. In our search for novel drugs with improved antimalarial properties compared to the existing ones, we applied an emerging strategy in medicinal chemistry called hybridisation. This is the combination of two or more active ingredients into a single chemical entity to form a hybrid drug. The hybrid drug strategy has the potential advantage of restoring the effectiveness in antimalaria drugs such as the quinolines and the antifolate drugs. Artemisinin <b>based</b> and <b>quinoline</b> <b>based</b> hybrid drugs are demonstrative examples of the validity of such an approach. Chloroquine used to be the first–choice drug in malaria treatment and prophylaxis ever since its discovery, but drug resistance has rendered it almost completely useless in treating Plasmodium falciparum. Today, it is still widely used in treating Plasmodium vivax malaria in resistance free areas. The historical success of the aminoquinoline antimalarial drugs supported our decision to include the quinoline pharmacophore in our study. Pyrimethamine has been the most widely used antimalarial antifolate drug. It is used in malaria prophylaxis in combination with sulphonamides. Point mutations in the parasite’s dhfr domain of the dhfr gene are severely compromising its antimalarial effectiveness. The pharmacophores of chloroquine and pyrimethamine are a quinoline and a pyrimidine moiety, respectively. Through hybridisation of these two pharmacophores we hoped to bring about molecules with potent antimalarial properties and, thus restoring their antimalarial usefulness. In this study we aimed to synthesise a series of quinoline–pyrimidine hybrids, determine their physicochemical properties and evaluate their antimalarial activity in comparison to that of chloroquine and pyrimethamine. We successfully synthesised ten quinoline–pyrimidine hybrids by connecting a quinoline and a pyrimidine moiety via different linkers. The structures of the prepared hybrids were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). The experimental aqueous solubility of the compounds was determined to be higher at pH 5. 5 than at pH 7. 4 although no structure–physicochemical property could be drawn from this investigation. The quinoline–pyrimidine hybrids were screened in vitro alongside chloroquine and pyrimethamine against the chloroquine–sensitive D 10 strain of Plasmodium falciparum. The ether–linked hybrids tended to be more potent than the amine–linked ones. Compound 21, exhibited the best antimalarial activity (IC 50 = 0. 08 uM) of all, and possessed activity similar to that of pyrimethamine (IC 50 = 0. 11 uM).

40|$|Organic {{radicals}} {{have been}} of interest for several decades due to various applications in fields such as drug design, polymer science, organic materials and synthesis. While the chemical properties of many aromatic σ-type mono- and biradicals are known through theoretical and experimental research, limited experimental data are available for aromatic polyradicals due to difficulties in their generation and subsequent study in solution. This thesis focuses on the reactivities of such polyradicals in the gas phase. All gas-phase reactivity studies were performed using a Thermo Scientific linear quadrupole ion trap (LQIT) mass spectrometer equipped with a manifold for introduction of reagents. All radical precursors were introduced into the LQIT and protonated by using the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) method. Radical sites were generated by using collision-activated dissociation (CAD) of protonated radical precursors with helium collision gas to cleave C-I, C-NO 2, O-NO and/or O-CH 3 bonds. After generation, the charged polyradicals were isolated in the ion trap and their reactivities toward dimethyl disulfide, cyclohexane and allyl iodide were examined to determine reaction efficiencies and reaction products. ^ The reactivities of the tri- and tetraradicals were {{compared with those of}} corresponding mono- and biradicals. The reactivity of the studied triradicals is mainly controlled by the radicals’ electron affinity and the distortion energy of the meta-benzyne moiety in them. The triradicals with higher electron affinity and lower distortion energy reacted at higher efficiencies. All triradicals abstract three hydrogen atoms when allowed to react with cyclohexane, which demonstrates the presence of three radical sites. All triradicals formed ionized dimethyl disulfide of m/z 94 when allowed to react with dimethyl disulfide reagent, which was rationalized by initial proton transfer from the charged triradicals to neutral dimethyl disulfide, followed by hydrogen atom abstraction by the neutral triradicals from protonated dimethyl disulfide. ^ The 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraradical abstracts four hydrogen atoms from cyclohexane, which demonstrates the presence of four radical sites in this molecule, as expected. Along with hydrogen atom abstractions, the 2, 4, 6, 8 -tetraradical also reacts by hydride abstraction, for which a mechanism was proposed. Additionally, reactivity studies of three other tetraradicals, the 2, 4, 5, 7 -, 2, 4, 5, 8 - and 2, 4, 7, 8 - tetradehydroquinlinium cations, were carried out by using dimethyl disulfide and allyl iodide reagents. Preliminary data suggest that, with few exceptions, the reaction efficiencies of the all tetraradicals are lower than that of related mono- and triradicals, which may be attributed to strong radical-radical couplings present in the tetraradicals. ^ A new class of charged <b>quinoline</b> <b>based</b> oxygen peribridged quinolinium cation was generated by using LQIT. These oxygen peribridged quinolinium cation was generated by using CAD to cleave an iodine atom and NO from protonated 4 - iodo- 5 -nitroquinoline precursor. A similar approach was used to generate oxygen peribridged quinolinium mono- and biradicals from synthesized precursors. Gasphase reactivity studies of these oxygen peribridged mono- and biradicals toward dimethyl disulfide and allyl iodide reagents were carried out and the reactivities were compared with the corresponding mono- and biradicals without the oxygen ring. The reactivity data suggest that the oxygen ring significantly influences the reactivity of biradicals, while comparable reactivity was observed for monoradicals with and without the oxygen ring. ^ Mimicking the self-assembly process of natural collagen is an interesting area of research for biomedical applications. One such design, based on a metaltrigger as a promoter for self-assembly of short collagen-mimetic peptides into functional biomaterials, is an attractive approach to address the inherent issues associated with the clinical use of natural collagen. In this approach, metal ions are allowed to interact with the chelating agents (ligands) of the peptides to promote self-assembly. Part of this thesis focuses on improving the understanding of the self-assembly mechanism by altering the ligands of the peptides. The number and type of ligands involved in the assembly process were shown to significantly influence the size and the morphology of the resulting materials. Self-assembly was controlled by limiting the number of ligands present in the peptide. ...|$|R

When coupled with separation methods, such as gas chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography, analysis of minor components in complex mixtures is possible. In addition to the molecular weight information, mass spectrometers can provide structural information for the ionized analyte molecules. However, mass spectrometric analysis of complex mixtures is not without challenges, such as suitable evaporation/ionization methods are not readily available for different types of samples. For example, because of such limitations, {{little is known about the}} molecular weight or structural information of asphaltenes, which are the heaviest components of crude oil and one of the most complex mixtures in nature. Characterization of asphaltenes at the molecular level can alleviate some of the problems they cause to petroleum industry and facilitate the discovery of beneficial uses for asphaltenes. ^ Multiple-stage tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) based on collision-activated dissociation (CAD) is usually a method of choice for structural elucidation of unknown compounds. However, this method alone does not always unambiguously identify the functional groups in an unknown analyte. Therefore, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based on ion-molecule reactions was developed and implemented in a linear quadrupole ion trap (LQIT) mass spectrometer for functional group identification. This method has great potential for rapid identification of unknown drug metabolites in the pharmaceutical industry. ^ Gas-phase ion-molecule reactions are also very useful in study of reaction kinetics and mechanisms. The intrinsic chemical properties of such highly reactive molecules as radicals can be studied in the gas phase, which are otherwise difficult to access by other experimental approaches. Knowledge on the reactivity of aromatic carbon centered σ,σ-type biradical intermediates is desirable as they are associated with the biological activity of a naturally occurring enediyne antitumor agents. Of particular interest is the reactivity of 1, 3 -biradical species (meta-benzynes) because of its therapeutic importance. In this thesis, the reactivity of four meta-benzyne analogues towards eight amino acids was examined by using “distonic ion approach” in a Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. ^ The experiments described in this thesis were aimed to provide more detailed structural information of mixture components by using different mass spectrometry based methods. Chapter 2 briefly describes the theory, instrumentation, and experimental aspects of the two instruments used for these studies. Chapter 3 focuses on structural comparisons of asphaltenes of different origins by using multiple-stage tandem mass spectrometry. Chapter 4 describes structural characterization of organosulfur model compounds related to fossil fuels by using high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Chapter 5 focuses on development of gas-phase ion-molecule reactions for the identification of the sulfone functionality in drug metabolites. Chapter 6 is devoted to the study of gas-phase reactivity of pyridine, <b>quinoline,</b> and isoquinoline <b>based</b> meta-benzynes towards various amino acids. ...|$|R
40|$|The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is {{a global}} health problem as it afflicts an {{estimated}} 170 million people worldwide and is the major cause of viral hepatitis, cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV is a rapidly evolving virus, with 6 major genotypes and multiple subtypes. Over the past 20 years, HCV therapeutic efforts have focused on identifying the best-in-class direct acting antiviral (DAA) targeting crucial components of the viral lifecycle, The NS 3 / 4 A protease is responsible for processing the viral polyprotein, a crucial step in viral maturation, and for cleaving host factors involved in activating immunity. Thus targeting the NS 3 / 4 A constitutes a dual strategy of restoring the immune response and halting viral maturation. This high priority target has 4 FDA approved inhibitors {{as well as several}} others in clinical development. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity of the virus causes seriously therapeutic challenges, particularly the NS 3 / 4 A protease inhibitors (PIs), which suffer from both the rapid emergence of drug resistant mutants as well as a lack of pan-genotypic activity. My thesis research focused on filling two critical gaps in our structural understanding of inhibitor binding modes. The first gap in knowledge is the molecular basis by which macrocyclization of PIs improves antiviral activity. Macrocycles are hydrophobic chains used to link neighboring chemical moieties within an inhibitor and create a structurally pre-organized ligand. In HCV PIs, macrocycle come in two forms: a P 1 - P 3 and P 2 - P 4 strategy. I investigated the structural and thermodynamic basis of the role of macrocyclization in reducing resistance susceptibility. For a rigorous comparison, we designed and synthesized both a P 1 - P 3 and a linear analog of grazoprevir, a P 2 - P 4 inhibitor. I found that, while the P 2 - P 4 strategy is more favorable for achieving potency, it does not allow the inhibitor sufficient flexibility to accommodate resistance mutations. On the other hand, the P 1 - P 3 strategy strikes a better balance between potency and resistance barrier. The second gap my thesis addresses is elucidating the structural basis by which highly potent protease inhibitors function in genotype 1 but not in genotype 3, despite having an 87 % sequence similarity. After mapping the amino acids responsible for this differential efficacy in genotypes 1 and 3, I engineered a 1 a 3 a chimeric protease for crystallographic studies. My structural characterization of three PIs in complex with both the 1 a 3 a and genotype 1 protease revealed that the loss of inhibitor efficacy in the 1 a 3 a and GT- 3 proteases is a consequence of disrupted electrostatic interactions between amino acids 168 and 155, which is critical for potent binding of <b>quinoline</b> and isoindoline <b>based</b> PIs. Here, I have revealed details of molecular and structural basis for the lack of PI efficacy against GT- 3, which are needed for design of pan-genotypic inhibitors...|$|R
