25|$|Trials are public, and {{defendants}} {{have the}} right to legal counsel and to call defense witnesses in the federal and some provincial courts that have an accusatory system of criminal justice. If needed, a public defender is provided at public expense when defendants face serious criminal charges. During the investigative stage, defendants can submit <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> to the investigating judge. A panel of judges decides guilt or innocence. Federal and provincial courts continued the transition to trials with oral arguments in criminal cases, replacing the old system of written submissions. Although the 1994 constitution provides for trial by jury, implementing legislation had not been passed by year's end. In Cordoba Province, however, defendants accused of certain serious crimes {{have the right}} to a trial by jury. Lengthy delays in trials are a nationwide problem, with many cases taking five or more years to resolve. Defendants are presumed innocent and {{have the right to}} appeal, as do prosecutors. Minors under age 16 cannot be criminally prosecuted. By law defendants and attorneys have access to government held evidence, but they may experience significant obstacles or delays in obtaining such evidence. In 2008, the human rights organization Fundacion Sur noted that the country lacked a separate juvenile justice system that affords adolescents due process protections and the right to a legal defense in criminal cases and expressed concern that the broad discretion judges have in such cases increased the possibility of arbitrary rulings. The age of legal liability is 16, and Fundacion Sur asserted that 16- and 17-year-old offenders frequently were transferred to adult criminal courts or held in juvenile detention centers for longer periods than warranted by their offenses. A December 2008 Supreme Court decision found that the country's juvenile justice system did not comply with international conventions and highlighted the need for the legislative branch to remedy the situation.|$|E

40|$|Background: The forest-dwelling Amerindian {{peoples of}} Guyana are among that nation’s most impoverished, {{vulnerable}} and least served. Health promotion messaging has been informed {{in large part}} by nation-level health indicators that may not be well targeted to this group.

Methods: As part of medical missions to the interior, we asked patients waiting for care to anonymously submit their health <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing.</b> Conventional content analysis was employed to identify prevalent themes in their responses. Findings: Sexual health (63. 6 %) and nutrition (17. 4 %) were the most popular themes asked about. Within the former, the science of sexual maturation and reproduction (31. 4 %) and HIV/AIDS (28. 8 %) were the most common sub-themes, with the pathophysiology and etiology of HIV/AIDS being the most common sub-theme within the latter.
