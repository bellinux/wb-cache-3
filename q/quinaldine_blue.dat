40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a {{significant}} threat for effective treatment of several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. To identify potential new treatment options for MRSA infections, we screened a clinical compound library consisting of 1524 compounds using a growth inhibition assay in 96 -well plates. We identified 34 agents which are either bacteriostatic or bactericidal against log-phase clinical MRSA strain USA 300. Among them, 9 candidates (thonzonium, cetylpyridinium, trilocarban, benzododecinium, bithionol, brilliant green, chlorquinaldol, methylbenzethonium and green violet) are known antiseptics, 11 candidates are known antibiotics currently recommended {{for the treatment}} of MRSA. We identified 9 new drug candidates, 5 of which (thiostrepton, carbomycin, spiramycin, clofazimine and chloroxine) are antibiotics used for treating other infections than S. aureus infections; 4 of which (<b>quinaldine</b> <b>blue,</b> closantel, dithiazanine iodide and pyrvinium pamoate) are drugs used for treating parasitic diseases or cancer. We ranked these new drug candidates according to their MICs against the MRSA strain USA 300. Our findings may have implications for more effective treatment of MRSA infections...|$|E
