The purpose of this work was to validate the DN 4 questionnaire in the Portuguese language in order to allow its use in clinical and research settings. A double-blind, accuracy study was conducted, consisting of translation, back-translation, literal evaluation, semantic equivalence, and communication with the target population. The Portuguese version of the {{questionnaire was}} applied in a sample of 101 patients with neuropathic (N = 42) or nociceptive pain (N = 59), ranked according to medical diagnosis. The reproducibility, reliability and validity of the instrument were analyzed, and showed a high diagnostic power for this version of the DN 4 questionnaire. The Portuguese version of the DN 4 questionnaire presented good validity and reliability, allowing it to identify neuropathic pain and neuropathic characteristics of mixed pain syndromes. Perspective: This article presents the first validated neuropathic pain questionnaire in the Portuguese language and represents a useful tool in the assessment of neuropathic pain both in the clinical setting and in population-based studies. The sensible and <b>quick</b> <b>format</b> of this instrument are key factors that will contribute to its widespread use, permitting a true recognition of patients with neuropathic pain...|$|E
2500|$|Disk {{formatting}} {{is usually}} {{done by a}} utility program supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had <b>quick</b> <b>formatting</b> which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|R

40|$|Alpha {{emissivity}} {{measurements are}} important in the semiconductor industry for assessing the suitability of materials for use in production processes. A recently published round-robin study that circulated the same samples to several alpha counting centers showed wide center-to-center variations in measured alpha emissivity. A separate analysis of these results hypothesized {{that much of the}} variation might arise from differences in sample-to-entrance window separations. XIA recently introduced an ultra low background counter, the UltraLo- 1800 (UltraLo), that operates in a fundamentally different manner from the proportional counters used at most of the centers in the original study. In particular, by placing the sample within the counting volume, it eliminates the sample-to-entrance window separation issue noted above, and so offers an opportunity to test this hypothesis. In this work we briefly review how the UltraLo operates and describe a new round-robin study conducted entirely on UltraLo instruments using a set of standard samples that included two samples used in the original study. This study shows that, for LA (Low Alpha between 2 and 50 alpha/khr-cm$^ 2 $) sample measurements, the only remaining site-to-site variations were due to counting statistics. Variations in ULA (Ultra-Low Alpha < 2 alpha/khr-cm$^ 2 $) sample measurements were reduced three-fold, compared to the earlier study, with the measurements suggesting that residual activity variations now primarily arise from site-to-site differences in the cosmogenic background.

40|$|Purpose: The {{difficulty}} of attracting attendance for in-person events {{is a problem}} common to all faculty development efforts. Social media holds the potential to disseminate information asynchronously while building a community through <b>quick,</b> easy-to-use <b>formats.</b> The authors sought to document creative uses of social media for faculty development in academic medical centers. Method: In December 2011, the first author (P. S. C.) examined the websites of all 154 accredited medical schools in the United States and Canada for pages relevant to faculty development. The most popular social media sites and searched for accounts maintained by faculty developers in academic medicine were also visited. Several months later, in February 2012, a second investigator (C. W. S.) validated these data via an independent review. Results: Twenty-two (22) medical schools (14. 3 %) employed at least one social media technology in support of faculty development. In total, 40 instances of social media tools were identified &#x 2013; the most popular platforms being Facebook (nine institutions), Twitter (eight institutions), and blogs (eight institutions). Four medical schools, in particular, have developed integrated strategies to engage faculty in online communities. Conclusions: Although relatively few medical schools have embraced social media to promote faculty development, the present range of such uses demonstrates the flexibility and affordability of the tools. The most popular tools incorporate well into faculty members&#x 2019; existing use of technology and require minimal additional effort.

40|$|Executive Summary: Information {{found in}} this report covers the years 1986 through 2005. Mussel Watch began {{monitoring}} a suite of trace metals and organic contaminants such as DDT, PCBs and PAHs. Through time additional chemicals were added, and today approximately 140 analytes are monitored. The Mussel Watch Program is the longest running estuarine and coastal pollutant monitoring effort conducted in the United States that is national in scope each year. Hundreds of scientific journal articles and technical reports based on Mussel Watch data have been written; however, this report is the first that presents local, regional and national findings across all years in a <b>Quick</b> Reference <b>format,</b> suitable for use by policy makers, scientists, resource managers and the general public. Pollution often starts at the local scale where high concentrations point to a specific source of contamination, yet some contaminants such as PCBs are atmospherically transported across regional and national scales, resulting in contamination far from their origin. Findings presented here showed few national trends for trace metals and decreasing trends for most organic contaminants; however, {{a wide variety of}} trends, both increasing and decreasing, emerge at regional and local levels. For most organic contaminants, trends have resulted from state and federal regulation. The highest concentrations for both metal and organic contaminants are found near urban and industrial areas. In addition to monitoring throughout the nation’s coastal shores and Great Lakes, Mussel Watch samples are stored in a specimen bank so that trends can be determined retrospectively for new and emerging contaminants of concern. For example, there is heightened awareness of a group of flame retardants that are finding their way into the marine environment. These compounds, known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), are now being studied using historic samples from the specimen bank and current samples to determine their spatial distribution. We will continue to use this kind of investigation to assess new contaminant threats. We hope you find this document to be valuable, and that you continue to look towards the Mussel Watch Program for information on the condition of your coastal waters. (PDF contains 118 pages...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{developed}} a new life-of-field, goal orientated process of analysis called Holistic Environmental Assessment (HEA). HEA assesses the total environmental risk associated with a proposed oil and gas field development. It prioritises environmental risks and identifies cost effective strategies to reduce them. For {{the first time the}} process was applied to a real 'case study' field development programme to test its effectiveness. The application identified that it is a useful tool to help design eco-efficient and costeffective oil and gas field developments. Furthermore, it was discovered that much of the information required by HEA could be obtained in a <b>quick</b> and user-friendly <b>format.</b> The new assessment process was developed after a review of the interaction of the offshore oil and gas industry with the environment, and techniques employed to evaluate this interaction. The review identified that the industry interacts with the environment {{in a number of different}} ways, and that the level of interaction transgresses the boundaries of sea, air and land locally, regionally and internationally. Legislation and public concern demand no damage to the environment from offshore oil and gas field exploration and development. UK environmental legislation and people's expectations for environmental performance are in a state of change. This change, coupled with the uncertainty over how resilient the environment is to perturbation, and the increasing risk of environmental liability presents a need for operators to clearly manage environmental information and assess total environmental risk. It was discovered that Environmental Assessment, Lifecycle Analysis and Cost Benefit Analysis, when used separately, failed to assess total environmental risk, but when used in combination under the HEA process could. Many organisations, such as the British Medical Association, European Oilfield Speciality Chemicals Association, the Royal Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (Norway) and Shell Expro, now recognise that a holistic approach is essential to assess total environmental risk. The author proposes that HEA would be effective as a software tool to analyse different environmental risk mitigation systems. This would facilitate the identification of a system that steers an operator towards the triple bottom line of Sustainable Development.

40|$|Onchocerciasis, an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, is a major public health concern. Given the debilitating symptoms associated with onchocerciasis and concerns about recrudescence in areas of previous onchocerciasis control, more efficient tools are needed for diagnosis and monitoring of control measures. We investigated whether luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) {{may be used as}} a more rapid, specific, and standardized diagnostic assay for Onchocerca volvulus infection. Four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR- 1, Ov-API- 1, Ov-MSA- 1 and Ov-CPI- 1) were tested by LIPS on a large cohort of blinded sera comprised of both uninfected controls and patients with a proven parasitic infection including Onchocerca volvulus (Ov), Wuchereria bancrofti (Wb), Loa loa (Ll), Strongyloides stercoralis (Ss), and with other potentially cross-reactive infections. In addition to testing all four Ov antigens separately, a mixture that tested all four antigens simultaneously was evaluated in the standard 2 -hour incubation format as well as in a 15 -minute rapid LIPS format. Antibody responses to the four different Ov antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Ov-infected and uninfected control sera with 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Analysis of the antibody titers to each of these four antigens in individual Ov-infected sera revealed that they were markedly different and did not correlate (r(S) = - 0. 11 to 0. 58; P = 0. 001 to 0. 89) to each other. Compared to Ov-infected sera, patients infected with Wb, Ll, Ss, and other conditions had markedly lower geometric mean antibody titers to each of the Ov 4 antigens (P< 0. 0002 for each antigen). The simplified method of using a mixture of the 4 Ov antigens simultaneously in the standard <b>format</b> or a <b>quick</b> 15 -minute <b>format</b> (QLIPS) showed 100 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity in distinguishing the Ov-infected sera from the uninfected control sera. Finally, the QLIPS format had the best performance with 100 % sensitivity and specificity values of 76 %, 84 % and 93 % for distinguishing Ov from Wb, Ll and Ss-infected sera. The multi-antigen LIPS assay {{can be used as a}} rapid, high throughput, and specific tool to not only to diagnose individual Ov infections but also as a sensitive and potentially point-of-care method for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Ov infection...|$|R
40|$|Mastery of the {{physical}} examination is a universal requirement in medical education. This exam requires performance of maneuvers and techniques that can be taught only through physical demonstration using real or simulated patients. The need for visual presentation is particularly crucial in teaching the neurological exam in which use of precise technique and observation of movement abnormalities are essential for physical diagnosis. Most neuroscience curricula routinely use real patients or videoclips to demonstrate neurologic disorders. Use of video in day-to-day communication has increased tremendously within the last five years. Digital video capture hardware, increasingly sophisticated compression-decompression (codec) software, and high performance playback computers have made web distribution of large video files possible for many internet users. In view {{of the importance of}} visual instruction in medical education, and recent advancements in video delivery, the question before us now is how to use present technology to make this form of instruction available to students. We have investigated the potential of digital recording and advanced variable bit rate (VBR) compression schemes for use in preparing video for distribution through the internet at different bandwidths, as well as on CD-ROM. Our specific purpose has been to identify hardware and software parameters necessary to create digital source video of the neurological exam, and process it for effective on-demand delivery using existing internet transfer modes (ie., T 1 -LAN). In the present project, video was recorded using a SONY DSR- 200 A digital video camcorder. Files were transferred via IEEE 1394 connection (FireWire) and Radius MotoDV (1. 1) software from a SONY DSR- 30 digital tape deck to a Power Macintosh 8600 with a Seagate Cheetah 18 GB hard drive. Sorenson and Qualcomm codecs were used for video and audio, respectively, as within Media Cleaner Pro (v 3. 1. 2). A PowerMac 9500 / 200 within the WSU Anatomy department was used as a server. The latest <b>Quick</b> Time streaming <b>formats</b> were tested within the WSU School of Medicine local network (T 1 -LAN) and at several T 1 -extranet sites. Data rates suitable for transfer over 56 K and 28. 8 K dial-up modems were also tested. Our results corroborate the general conclusions that the final video quality {{is directly related to the}} cinemagraphic quality of the source video and the processor speed of the playback machine. Specifically, at a data transfer rate of 50 KiloBytes/sec (KBS), digitally recorded and VBR compressed movies of up to 640 X 480 pixels in size could be delivered over T 1 -extranet lines with excellent movement quality when played by medium-to-high end machines (233 -MHz Pentium II PC; 233 -MHz Macintosh G 3). Delivery at a rate suitable for 56 K modems (approx 6 KBS) appears promising, under ideal conditions. However, attempts to deliver video at data rates suitable for 28. 8 K modems (approx 3 KBS) resulted in significant, and unacceptable, deterioration of movement in the video playback. The present findings suggest that on-demand distribution of video suitable for basic and clinical medical instruction is possible when appropriate source, compression, and playback parameters are used...|$|R
