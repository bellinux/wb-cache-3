Further modification of this drug by inclusion of a quaternary ammonium cation gives a compound suitable for parenteral administration by increasing water solubility. The acid in cefotaxime is first protected as its silyl ester (2) by derivatization with N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). Treatment of this intermediate with trimethylsilyl iodide gives the allylic iodide (3). Displacement of halogen with 5,6,7,8-Tetrahydroquinoline (2,3-Cyclohexenopyridine) gives the corresponding <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt.</b> Hydrolysis of the silyl ester followed by adjustments of the pH leads to the betaine cefquinome (4).|$|E

Reaction of that product with 4-picoline under phase-transfer conditions catalyzed by a <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt</b> affords the carbinol (4) from addition of the transient anion on the methyl group of the picoline to the more electrophilic carbonyl group. The alcohol is then dehydrated by means of acetic anhydride and the resulting olefin hydrogenated to afford the indolone (5).

Alkylation with α-chloropicoline proceeds with hydroxide as the base to afford Linopirdine (6).|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is {{that the effect of}} acceleration by a <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt</b> is greater on the development rate of the divalent ion than on the rate of development of the monovalent ion of hydroquinone. The gross rate of development of a hydroquinone-sulfite developer was determined with and without a <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt</b> for a range of pH values. Comparison of the acceleration of catechol which is active as a monovalent ion with the acceleration of hydroquinone which is active mainly as a divalent ion was hoped to allow the separation of the hydroquinone gross rate into the contributions by the monovalent ion and the divalent ion. The <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt</b> complexed with catechol to form an insoluble salt making comparison of the acceleration effect not possible. Chlorohydroquinone was chosen and the rate of development with and without the <b>quaternary</b> <b>salt</b> was determined for a range of pH values. Separation of the contributions proved not to be possible so the hypothesis could not be tested. Over the pH ranges (9. 25 - 10. 35 for hydroquinone and 8. 33 - 9. 16 for chlorohydroquinone) the gross rate of development showed linearity (on log-log scale) with the monovalent ion and the divalent ion concentrations but was determined to be dependent only upon the divalent ion concentration for both developing agents whether unaccelerated or accelerated developers. Diffusion effects were important with the accelerated developers because of the high rate of development.
