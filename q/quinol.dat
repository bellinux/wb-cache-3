25|$|There {{are three}} redox states of CoQ10: fully {{oxidized}} (ubiquinone), semiquinone (ubisemiquinone), and fully reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule {{to act as}} a two-electron carrier (moving between the quinone and <b>quinol</b> form) and a one-electron carrier (moving between the semiquinone and one of these other forms) is central to its role in the electron transport chain due to the iron–sulfur clusters that can only accept one electron at a time, and as a free radical-scavenging antioxidant.|$|E
25|$|In aerobic {{cells with}} {{sufficient}} oxygen, {{as in most}} human cells, the pyruvate is further metabolized. It is irreversibly converted to acetyl-CoA, giving off one carbon atom as the waste product carbon dioxide, generating another reducing equivalent as NADH. The two molecules acetyl-CoA (from one molecule of glucose) then enter the citric acid cycle, producing two more molecules of ATP, six more NADH molecules and two reduced (ubi)quinones (via FADH2 as enzyme-bound cofactor), and releasing the remaining carbon atoms as carbon dioxide. The produced NADH and <b>quinol</b> molecules then feed into the enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain, an electron transport system transferring the electrons ultimately to oxygen and conserving the released {{energy in the form}} of a proton gradient over a membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane in eukaryotes). Thus, oxygen is reduced to water and the original electron acceptors NAD+ and quinone are regenerated. This is why humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. The energy released from transferring the electrons from high-energy states in NADH and <b>quinol</b> is conserved first as proton gradient and converted to ATP via ATP synthase. This generates an additional 28 molecules of ATP (24 from the 8 NADH + 4 from the 2 quinols), totaling to 32 molecules of ATP conserved per degraded glucose (two from glycolysis + two from the citrate cycle). It is clear that using oxygen to completely oxidize glucose provides an organism with far more energy than any oxygen-independent metabolic feature, and this is thought to be the reason why complex life appeared only after Earth's atmosphere accumulated large amounts of oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|In Complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex or CoQH2-cytochrome c reductase; [...] ), the Q-cycle {{contributes}} to the proton gradient by an asymmetric absorption/release of protons. Two electrons are removed from QH2 at the QO site and sequentially transferred to two molecules of cytochrome c, a water-soluble electron carrier located within the intermembrane space. The two other electrons sequentially pass across the protein to the Qi site where the quinone part of ubiquinone is reduced to <b>quinol.</b> A proton gradient is formed by one <b>quinol</b> (2H+2e-) oxidations at the Qo site to form one quinone (2H+2e-) at the Qi site.

40|$|NapC is a tetra-haem {{member of}} a family of {{bacterial}} membrane-anchored multi-haem c -type cytochromes implicated in electron transfer between membrane <b>quinols</b> and periplasmic enzymes. The water-soluble tetra-haem fragment of Paracoccus pantotrophus NapC has been expressed as a periplasmic protein (NapC(sol)) in Paracoccus denitrificans, P. pantotrophus and Escherichia coli. Site-specific mutagenesis of NapC(sol), combined with spectroscopic studies, suggests that each haem iron centre has bis -histidinyl co-ordination. Four proximal ligands arise from each of four Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys-His haem-binding motifs; candidates for the four distal ligands are His(81), His(99), His(174) and His(194). NapC(H 81 A), NapC(H 99 A), NapC(H 174 A) and NapC(H 194 A) mutants (with alanine substituted {{for each of the four}} candidate residues) have all been purified from E. coli. In each case, one of the haems has become high-spin, as judged by the presence of a broad absorption band between 620 nm and 650 nm for the oxidized cytochrome; this feature is absent for wild-type protein and presumably arises because of the absence of the distal histidine ligand from one of the haems. NapC(H 81 A) and NapC(H 174 A) are less well expressed in E. coli than NapC(H 99 A) and NapC(H 194 A) and cannot be detected when expressed in P. denitrificans or P. pantotrophus. In vitro and in vivo complementation studies demonstrate that the soluble periplasmic NapC can mediate electron transfer from <b>quinols</b> to the periplasmic nitrate reductase. This capacity was retained in vitro with the NapC(H 99 A) and NapC(H 194 A) mutants but was lost in vivo. A model for the structural organization of NapC(sol) into two domains, each containing a di-haem pair, is proposed. In this model, each haem pair obtains one distal haem ligand from its own domain and a second from the other domain. The suggestion of two domains is supported by observations that the 24 kDa NapC(sol) cleaves to yield a 12 kDa haem-staining band. Determination of the cleavage site showed it was between two equally sized di-haem domains predicted from sequence analysis...|$|R

40|$|Membrane bound, {{respiratory}} {{nitrate reductase}} in Escherichia coli {{is composed of}} three subunits, αβγ. The active complex is anchored to the membrane by membrane-integrated γ subunit and can reduce nitrate to nitrite with membrane quinones, (ubiquinone or menaquinone) as physiological electron donors. The transfer of electrons through the complex is thought to involve the sequence: membrane <b>quinols</b> → b-type hemes (γ subunit) → Fe-S centers (β subunit) → molybdopterin (α subunit) → nitrate. The enzyme can be assayed with the artificial electron donor reduced methyl viologen (MVH) which transfers electrons directly to the molybdopterin cofactor. These {{studies have focused on}} the possible role of protein-bound menaquinone in the structure and function of this multisubunit complex. ^ Nitrate reductase was purified as two distinct forms; after solubilization of membrane proteins with detergents, purification rendered an αβγ complex (holoenzyme) which catalyzes nitrate reduction with MVH or the <b>quinols</b> analogs, menadiol and duroquinol, as electron donors. Alternatively, heat-treatment of the membranes in the absence of detergents and subsequent purification of the active enzyme produced an αβ complex, which reduces nitrate only with MVH as electron donor. The active αβ dimer was also separated from γ subunit by heat treatment of the holoenzyme. ^ Menaquinone- 9 was isolated directly from the purified αβ complex, and identified by mass spectrometry. Based on the composition of the membrane quinone pool, it was concluded that menaquinone- 9 is sequestered from the membrane pool in a specifically protein-bound form. ^ The role of the bound menaquinone in the structure-function of nitrate reductase was also investigated, along with its participation in UV-light inactivation of the enzyme. Menaquinone-depleted nitrate reductase from a menaquinone deficient mutant retained activity with all electron donors and it remained sensitive to UV inactivation. However, the MVH-nitrate reductase activity and the rate of UV inactivation of the enzyme were significantly reduced and the optical properties of the enzyme were modified by the absence of the bound menaquinone- 9. ^ Menaquinone- 9 is not absolutely required for electron transfer in nitrate reductase but it appears to be specifically-bound during assembly of the complex and to enhance the transfer of electrons through the complex. The possible plasticity of the functional electron transfer pathway in nitrate reductase is discussed. ...|$|R
