On the other hand, various parameters {{such as the}} quantization table coefficients, and side information, which are necessary to decode the picture, are recorded in the frame header. Quantized DCT coefficients are stored in the DCT tables (8 × 8) by zigzag scanning, where the DC coefficient {{is the value of}} the top-left corner ((0, 0) coefficient). The remaining 63 coefficients are called the AC coefficients. The quantized DCT coefficients, which are neighborhood of the DC coefficient, are low-frequency coefficients, and the others correspond to the high-frequency coefficients. Because the high-frequency coefficients in 8 × 8 block often become “ 0 ” after quantization, the spectrum of picture tends to be constructed with low-frequency coefficients.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The JPEG {{image is}} the most popular file format in {{relation}} to digital images. However, up to the present time, there seems to have been very few data hiding techniques taking the JPEG image into account. In this paper, we shall propose a novel high capacity data hiding method based on JPEG. The proposed method employs a capacity table to estimate the number of bits that can be hidden in each DCT component so that significant distortions in the stego-image can be avoided. The capacity table is derived from the JPEG default quantization table and the Human Visual System (HVS). Then, the adaptive least-significant bit (LSB) substitution technique is employed to process each <b>quantized</b> <b>DCT</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The proposed data hiding method enables us to control the level of embedding capacity by using a capacity factor. According to our experimental results, our new scheme can achieve an impressively high embedding capacity of around 20 % of the compressed image size with little noticeable degradation of image quality. Key words: JPEG, data hiding, steganography, HVS, Jpeg–Jsteg, LSB substitution. 1...|$|E

[23] {{shifted the}} <b>quantized</b> <b>DCT</b> <b>coefficient</b> histogram with an optimum searching strategy. This optimum strategy helped the technique to achieve good performance. In {{order to make}} data embedding unperceivable and the visual quality of marked image high, when {{a certain amount of}} data is embedded, only lower and middle frequency DCT coefficients are chosen to embed data in the embedding process. Sakai et al. [24] improved this scheme, producing better image quality with a new block selection strategy. Li et al. [25] proposed a reversible data hiding scheme on JPEG images based on the smaller DCT value selection method and three slight modifications of the quantization table. Using the HS analogy, Lin et al. [26] discussed high-capacity reversible data hiding for JPEG images. They used different block sizes and got high embedding capacity. Celik et al. [27] also proposed lossless data hiding in the least significant bit (LSB) of the JPEG DCT coefficients. Those DCT values, which have high distortion, are padded as side information in the payload. Huang et al. [19] proposed a histogram shifting technique on AC coefficients valued + 1 or − 1 and employ a block ordering based on the statistical properties of the number of zero AC coefficients in the blocks. The method is quite fresh and achieves huge improvements compared to the past work.|$|E
40|$|Video encoder {{complexity}} {{reduction is}} a very active research area in the past 20 years. Many researchers have developed fast algorithms to reduce the com-putation complexity of video encoder in every aspects. In this thesis, we inves-tigated the reduction of video encoder computational complexity by exploiting relationship between different modules in the video encoder. We will explain the correlations between each modules and three algorithms are proposed to tackle the video encoder complexity problem. The first algorithm proposed to embed the quantization into discrete cosine transform (DCT) such that the DCT output {{do not need to}} be explicitly quantized at run time. The algorithm is called "New Quantized Discrete Cosine Transform" (NQDCT). Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can achieve a noticeable computational reduction with negligible visual quality degradation. The second proposed algorithm is the "Zero Value Quantized Discrete Cosine Transform" (ZQDCT). We derived the relationship between Sum Absolute Dif-ference (SAD) and quantized coefficients. Based on the value of the SAD, we can accurately predict the zero value <b>quantized</b> <b>DCT</b> <b>coefficient.</b> If the coeffi-cient is predicted to be zero, the computations on DCT, quantization, inverse-quantization and inverse-DCT can be skipped. Simulation results showed that a large reduction in computational complexity can be achieved without any loss in visual quality. Based on ZQDCT and QDCT, we improved the zero-valued coefficients predic-tion such that it is performed at an earlier stage, that allows more computations to be saved. The proposed algorithm is called " 1 D-Zero Quantized Discrete Co-sine Transform" (1 DZQDCT). 1 DZQDCT has higher threshold than ZQDCT at high bit rate which can help to detect more zero block, hence more computations can be skipped...|$|E
