40|$|BACKGROUND: A major {{objective}} of the IFCC Task Force on Implementation of HbA 1 c Standardization {{is to develop a}} model to define <b>quality</b> <b>targets</b> for glycated hemoglobin (Hb A 1 c). METHODS: Two generic models, biological variation and sigma-metrics, are investigated. We selected variables in the models for Hb A 1 c and used data of external quality assurance/proficiency testing programs to evaluate the suitability of the models to set and evaluate <b>quality</b> <b>targets</b> within and between laboratories. RESULTS: In the biological variation model, 48 % of individual laboratories and none of the 26 instrument groups met the minimum performance criterion. In the sigma-metrics model, with a total allowable error (TAE) set at 5 mmol/mol (0. 46 % NGSP), 77 % of the individual laboratories and 12 of 26 instrument groups met the 2 σ criterion. CONCLUSIONS: The biological variation and sigma-metrics models were demonstrated to be suitable for setting and evaluating <b>quality</b> <b>targets</b> within and between laboratories. The sigma-metrics model is more flexible, as both the TAE and the risk of failure can be adjusted to the situation—for example, requirements related to diagnosis/monitoring or international authorities. With the aim of reaching (inter) national consensus on advice regarding <b>quality</b> <b>targets</b> for Hb A 1 c, the Task Force suggests the sigma-metrics model as the model of choice, with default values of 5 mmol/mol (0. 46 %) for TAE and risk levels of 2 σ and 4 σ for routine laboratories and laboratories performing clinical trials, respectively.

The regions to be preserved which will be masked out based on an improved graph cuts algorithm.
