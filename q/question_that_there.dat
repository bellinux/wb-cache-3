[...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so there is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

I hardly know whether it will interest any one to learn that something under half a million yards of calico are here printed annually. At the Lowell Bleachery fifteen million yards are dyed annually. The Merrimack Cotton Mills were stopped, and so had the other mills at Lowell been stopped, till some short time before my visit. Trade had been bad, and there had of course been a lack of cotton. I was assured that no severe suffering had been created by this stoppage. The greater number of hands had returned into the country--to the farms from whence they had come; and though a discontinuance of work and wages had of course produced hardship, {{there had been no}} actual privation--no hunger and want. Those of the work-people who had no homes out of Lowell to which to betake themselves, and no means at Lowell of living, had received relief before real suffering had begun. I was assured, with something of a smile of contempt at the <b>question,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> had been nothing like hunger.

60|$|In {{the last}} {{edition of his}} Outlines of Astronomy, Sir John Herschel recognizes this as an element in {{geological}} processes; regarding it as possibly a part-cause of those climatic changes indicated by {{the records of the}} Earth's past. That it has {{had much to do with}} those larger changes of climate of which we have evidence, seems unlikely, since there is reason to think that these have been far slower and more lasting; but that it must have entailed a rhythmical exaggeration and mitigation of the climates otherwise produced, seems beyond question. And it seems also beyond <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> must have been a consequent rhythmical change in the distribution of organisms--a rhythmical change to which we here wish to draw attention, as one cause of minor breaks in the succession of fossil remains. Each species of plant and animal has certain limits of heat and cold within which only it can exist; and these limits in a great degree determine its geographical position. It will not spread north of a certain latitude, because it cannot bear a more northern winter, nor south of a certain latitude, because the summer heat is too great; or else it is indirectly restrained from spreading further by the effect of temperature on the humidity of the air, or on the distribution of the organisms it lives upon. But now, what will result from a slow alteration of climate, produced as above described? Supposing the period we set out from is that in which the contrast of seasons is least marked, it is manifest that during the progress towards the period of most violent contrast, each species of plant and animal will gradually change its limits of distribution--will be driven back, here by the winter's increasing cold, and there by the summer's increasing heat--will retire into those localities that are still fit for it. Thus during 10,000 years, each species will ebb away from certain regions it was inhabiting; and during the succeeding 10,000 years will flow back into those regions. From the strata there forming, its remains will disappear; they will be absent from some of the superposed strata; and will be found in strata higher up. But in what shapes will they re-appear? Exposed during the 21,000 years of their slow recession and their slow return, to changing conditions of life, they are likely to have undergone modifications; and will probably re-appear with slight differences of constitution and perhaps of form--will be new varieties or perhaps new sub-species.|$|E

She has also criticized some mental health professionals, including Singer, for accepting expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs. Her 1984 book, The Making of a Moonie: Choice or Brainwashing? describes the religious conversion process to the Unification Church (whose members are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "Moonies") which {{had been one of}} the best known groups said to practice brainwashing. Barker spent close to seven years studying Unification Church members. She interviewed in depth or gave probing questionnaires to church members, ex-members, [...] "non-joiners," [...] and control groups of uninvolved people from similar backgrounds, as well as parents, spouses, and friends of members. She also attended numerous church workshops and communal facilities. Barker writes that she rejects the [...] "brainwashing" [...] theory, because it explains neither the many people who attended a recruitment meeting and did not become members, nor the voluntary disaffiliation of members. [...] In 2003 forensic psychologist Dick Anthony said that [...] "no reasonable person would <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are situations where people can be influenced against their best interests, but those arguments are evaluated on the basis of fact, not bogus expert testimony." ...|$|E
