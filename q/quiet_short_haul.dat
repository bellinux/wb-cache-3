40|$|The {{acoustic}} suppression {{capability of}} bulk absorber material {{designed for use}} in the fan exhaust duct walls of the <b>quiet</b> clean <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> experiment engine (OCSEE UTW) was evaluated. The acoustic suppression to the original design for the engine fan duct which consisted of phased single degree-of-freedom wall treatment was tested with a splitter and also with the splitter removed.

The original <b>quiet,</b> clean, <b>short</b> <b>haul,</b> experimental engine four segment variable fan nozzle was retested in reverse and {{compared with a}} continuous, 30 deg half angle conical exlet. Data indicated that the significantly more stable, higher pressure recovery flow with the fixed 30 deg exlet resulted in lower engine vibrations, lower fan blade stress, and approximately a 20 percent improvement in reverse thrust.

40|$|Full scale static {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on the <b>Quiet</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Research Aircraft (QSRA) to determine the thrust deflecting capabilities of the circulation control wing/upper surface blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This scheme, which combines favorable characteristics of both the A- 6 /CCW and QSRA, employs the flow entrainment properties of CCW to pneumatically deflect engine thrust {{in lieu of the}} mechanical USB flap system. Results show that the no moving parts blown system produced static thrust deflections in the range of 40 deg to 97 deg (depending on thrust level) with a CCW pressure of 208, 900 Pa (30. 3 psig). In addition, the ability to vary horizontal forces from thrust to drag while maintaining a constant vertical (or lift) value was demonstrated by varying the blowing pressure. The versatility of the CCW/USB system, if applied to a STOL aircraft, was confirmed, where rapid conversion from a high drag approach mode to a thrust recovering waveoff or takeoff configuration could be achieved by nearly instantaneous blowing pressure variation...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} {{data base}} for powered lift aircraft design has advanced {{over the last}} 15 years. NASA's <b>Quiet</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Research Aircraft (QSRA) has provided a flight verification of upper surface blowing (USB) technology. The A- 6 Circulation Control Wing flight demonstration aricraft has provide data for circulation control wing (CCW) technology. Recent small scale wind tunnel model tests and full scale static flow turning test have shown the potential of combining USB with CCW technology. A flight research program is deemed necessary to fully explore the performance and control aspects of CCW jet substitution for the mechanical USB Coanda flap. The required hardware design would also address questions {{about the development of}} flight weight ducts and CCW jets and the engine bleed-air capabilities vs requirements. NASA's QSRA would be an optimum flight research vehicle for modification to the USB/CCW configuration. The existing QSRA data base, the design simplicity of the QSRA wing trailing edge controls, availability of engine bleed-air, and the low risk, low cost potential of the suggested program is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{performance}} logic algorithm (PSL) {{was developed}} to optimize the performance of propulsion systems for component and sensor degradations by monitoring {{the performance of the}} engine system and minimizing thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) while retaining a constant engine net thrust. Engine constraints such as surge margin, speed, pressure, and temperature are observed. The PSL algorithm was applied to the <b>quiet,</b> clean, <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> experimental engine. Engine control set points were modified for component degradations in order to restore the nominal net thrust. Results show convergence to the optimum value can be obtained within 60 to 90 seconds, which makes the program acceptable to on line operation with present state of the art minicomputers. Tests indicate that in most cases the PSL algorithm offers some improvement in thrust specific fuel consumption over the manual throttle...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} <b>quiet</b> {{turbofan}} <b>short</b> takeoff aircraft for <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> air transportation was conducted.

40|$|A new sensor/actuator failure {{analysis}} technique for turbofan jet engines was developed. Three phases of {{failure analysis}}, namely detection, isolation, and accommodation are considered. Failure detection and isolation techniques are developed by utilizing {{the concept of}} Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) tests. These techniques are applicable to both time varying and time invariant systems. Three GLR detectors are developed for: (1) hard-over sensor failure; (2) hard-over actuator failure; and (3) brief disturbances in the actuators. The probability distribution of the GLR detectors and the detectability of sensor/actuator failures are established. Failure type {{is determined by the}} maximum of the GLR detectors. Failure accommodation is accomplished by extending the Multivariable Nyquest Array (MNA) control design techniques to nonsquare system designs. The performance and effectiveness of the failure analysis technique are studied by applying the technique to a turbofan jet engine, namely the <b>Quiet</b> Clean <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Experimental Engine (QCSEE). Single and multiple sensor/actuator failures in the QCSEE are simulated and analyzed and the effects of model degradation are studied...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from wind}} tunnel and flight tests {{investigations}} for V/STOL aircraft are reviewed. Primary emphasis {{is given to}} technical results relating to three types of subsonic aircraft: a quiet STOL aircraft; a tilt rotor aircraft; and a turbofan V/STOL aircraft. Comparison and correlation between theoretical and experimental results and between wind tunnel and flight test results, is made. The quiet STOL aircraft technology results are primarily those derived from the NASA/Boeing <b>Quiet</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Technology (QSRA) program. The QSRA aircraft uses an upper surface blown flap and develops a usable engine-out landing approach lift coefficient of 5. 5 and landing distances less than 1, 000 ft. The tilt rotor aircraft technology results are those obtained from the NASA/Army/Navy/Bell (XV- 15 -TRRA) aircraft flight investigations. The TRRA is a twin rotor research aircraft capable of vertical takeoff and landing and cruise speeds of 300 knots. The turbofan V/STOL aircraft technology results are from static ground facility and wind tunnel investigations of a NASA/NAVY/Grumman full scale lift/cruise fan aircraft model, which features two tilting nacelles with TF- 34 engines...|$|E
40|$|Progress in {{vertical}} and short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) aircraft technology, in particular, during the 1970 to 1980 period at Ames Research Center is discussed. Although only {{two kinds of}} V/STOL aircraft (the helicopter and the British direct lift Harrier) have achieved operational maturity, understanding of the technology has vastly improved during this 10 year period. To pursue an aggressive R and D program at a reasonable cost, {{it was decided to}} conduct extensive large scale testing in wind tunnel and flight simulation facilities, to develop low cost research aircraft using modified airframes or engines, and to involve other agencies and industry contractors in joint technical and funding arrangements. The STOL investigations include exploring STOL performance using the rotating cylinder flap concept, the augmentor wing, upon initiation of the <b>Quiet</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Research Aircraft program, the upper surface blown flap concept. The VTOL investigations were conducted using a tilt rotor aircraft, resulting in the XV- 15 tilt rotor research aircraft. Direct jet lift is now being considered for application to future supersonic fighter aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{circulation}} control to deflect turbofan engine thrust beyond 90 deg. has been proven in full-scale static ground tests of the circulation-control-wing/upper-surface-blowing (CCW/USB) concept. This powered high-lift system employs a circular, blown trailing edge to replace the USB mechanical flaps to entrain engine-exhaust flow, and to obtain both a vertical-thrust component and an augmented circulation lift for short takeoff and landing (STOL) applications. Previous tests (Phase 1), done in 1982, of a basic configuration installed on the <b>Quiet</b> <b>Short</b> <b>Haul</b> Research Aircraft confirmed these CCW/USB systems capabilities. A second phase (Phase 2) of full-scale, static, thrust-deflection investigations has reconfirmed the ability to deflect engine thrust from 40 to 102 deg., depending on thrust level. Five new configurations were evaluated and performance improvements noted for those configurations with larger blown span, fences or favorable engine interactions, smaller slot height, and larger radii with less than 180 deg. of CCW surface arc. In general, a 90 deg. circular arc with a smaller slot height provided the best performance, demonstrating that adequate thrust turning can be produced by a trailing-edge shape which may have minimal cruise-performance penalty. Thrust deflections were achieved at considerably lower blowing momentum than was required for the baseline case of Phase 1. Improved performance and versatility were thus confirmed for the CCW/USB system applied to STOL aircraft, where the potential for developing a non-moving-parts pneumatic thrust deflector to rapidly vary horizontal force from thrust to drag, while maintaining constant vertical force, appears quite promising. The conversion from high-lift to lower-drag cruise mode by merely terminating the blowing provides an effective STOL aircraft system...|$|E

40|$|The fan {{aerodynamic}} and aeromechanical {{performance tests}} of the <b>quiet</b> clean <b>short</b> <b>haul</b> experimental engine under the wing fan and inlet with a simulated core flow are described. Overall forward mode fan performance is presented at each rotor pitch angle setting with conventional flow pressure ratio efficiency fan maps, distinguishing the performance characteristics of the fan bypass and fan core regions. Effects of off design bypass ratio, hybrid inlet geometry, and tip radial inlet distortion on fan performance are determined. The nonaxisymmetric bypass OGV and pylon configuration is assessed relative to both total pressure loss and induced circumferential flow distortion. Reverse mode performance, obtained by resetting the rotor blades through both the stall pitch and flat pitch directions, is {{discussed in terms of}} the conventional flow pressure ratio relationship and its implications upon achievable reverse thrust. Core performance in reverse mode operation is presented in terms of overall recovery levels and radial profiles existing at the simulated core inlet plane. Observations of the starting phenomena associated with the initiation of stable rotor flow during acceleration in the reverse mode are briefly discussed.
