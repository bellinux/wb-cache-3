40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a yes-no {{referendum in}} which its outcome is valid {{only if the}} voter turnout is greater than a predetermined level. Such a participation quorum is argued to induce the minority group of voters to abstain strategically with the intention to spoil the outcome by achieving a low voter turnout. We first construct a game-theoretic model to derive a theoretical prediction about the relationship be-tween <b>quorums</b> <b>and</b> <b>voting</b> outcomes. It is shown that there exist multiple equilibria, and that strategic abstention can happen if such a participation quorum is imposed. To examine which type of outcome {{is more likely to}} be realized, we then conduct a laboratory experiment. We observe that (i) if the quorum is small, all voters go to the poll, and (ii) if the quorum is large, voters in the ex-ante majority group go to the poll whereas voters in the ex-ante minority group tend to abstain. As a result, it is less likely that the ex-post minority group wins the referendum, but it frequently happens that the voting outcome is made invalid due to low voter turnout when the quorum is large...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Replication is {{a useful}} {{technique}} for distributed database systems and can be implemented in a grid computation environment to provide a high availability, fault tolerant, and enhance {{the performance of the}} system. This paper discusses a new protocol named Diagonal Data Replication in 2 D Mesh structure (DR 2 M) protocol where the performance addressed are data availability which is compared with the previous replication protocols, Read-One Write-All (ROWA), Voting (VT), Tree Quorum (TQ), Grid Configuration (GC), and Neighbor Replication on Grid (NRG). DR 2 M protocol is organized in a logical 2 D mesh structure <b>and</b> by using <b>quorums</b> <b>and</b> <b>voting</b> techniques to improve the performance and availability of the replication protocol where it reduce the number of copies of data replication for read or write operations. The data file is copied at the selected node of the diagonal site in a quorum. The selection of a replica depends on the diagonal location of the structured 2 D mesh network where the middle node is selected because it is the best location to get a copy of the data if every node has the equal number of request and data accessing in the network. The algorithm in this paper also calculates the best number of nodes in each <b>quorum</b> <b>and</b> how many <b>quorums</b> are needed for N number of nodes in a network. DR 2 M protocol also ensures that the data for read and write operations is consistency, by proofing the quorum must not have a nonempty intersection quorum.

40|$|Replication is {{a useful}} {{technique}} for distributed database systems and has been implemented in EU data grid and HEP in CERN for handling huge data access. Replica selection in their prototypes still can be enhanced to provide high availability, fault tolerant and low in communication cost. This paper introduces a new replica control protocol, named Diagonal Replication in 2 D Mesh (DR 2 M) for grid environment and compares its performance with the previous protocols. The performance in this paper is data availability for read and write operation, which are compared to the Read-One Write-All (ROWA), Voting (VT), Tree Quorum (TQ), Grid Configuration (GC), Three Dimensional Grid Structure (TDGS), and Diagonal Replication on Grid (DRG). This paper discusses the protocol of replicating data for grid environment, putting the protocol in a logical 2 D mesh structure by employing the <b>quorums</b> <b>and</b> <b>voting</b> techniques. The data file is copied in a selected replica from the diagonal sites in each quorum. The selection of a replica depends on the diagonal location of the structured 2 D mesh network where the middle replica is selected {{because it is the}} shortest path to get a copy of the data from most of the direction in the quorum. The algorithm in this paper also calculates the optimized number of nodes to be grouped in each <b>quorum</b> <b>and</b> how many <b>quorums</b> are needed for the number of nodes, N in a network. DR 2 M protocol also ensures that the data for read and write operations are consistent, by ensuring the quorum must not have a nonempty intersection quorum. To evaluate the DR 2 M protocol, we developed a simulation model in Java. Our results prove that our protocol improves the performance of data availability compared to the previous data replication protocol, namely Read-One Write-All (ROWA), Voting (VT), Tree Quorum (TQ), Grid Configuration (GC), Three Dimensional Grid Structure (TDGS), and Diagonal Replication on Grid (DRG). </p...|$|R

5000|$|In {{legislative}} bodies, dilatory motions {{can take}} the form of demanding <b>quorum</b> calls <b>and</b> <b>votes</b> at every opportunity. Another dilatory tactic is for members to not answer when their name is called during the quorum roll call. The problem of dilatory tactics in such bodies dates back to the beginnings of parliamentary procedure in England and the United States. Jefferson's Manual, for instance, only requires the Speaker to direct a bill to be read upon the desire of any member [...] "if the request is really for information and not for delay." [...] In the US Senate, there are no formal rules against dilatory tactics except under cloture. Between 1831 <b>and</b> 1900, dilatory <b>votes</b> to adjourn composed more than 10 percent of all Senate <b>votes,</b> <b>and</b> successfully delayed recognition of Louisiana's Reconstruction government until 1865. According to Sarah Binder, in the 46th United States Congress, motions to adjourn consumed 23 percent of all floor votes. Speaker Thomas Brackett Reed famously took countermeasures against dilatory tactics, such as ruling dilatory motions out of order, and was sustained by the house. Some legislatures impose quotas on dilatory motions. For instance, the Nova Scotia House of Assembly imposes a maximum of one motion to hoist, one motion to refer to a committee, and one reasoned amendment per reading. The Rules of the U.S. Congress as revised in 1911 declare that no dilatory motion shall be entertained by the Speaker.|$|R

The optimal <b>vote</b> <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments depend not only on the system parameters such as node availability and operation mix, but also on the performance measure. We present an enumeration algorithm {{that can be used to}} find the <b>vote</b> <b>and</b> <b>quorum</b> assignments that need to be considered for achieving optimal performance.
