40|$|<b>Information</b> <b>quality</b> {{has become}} a {{critical}} concern {{to the success of}} organisations. Numerous business initiatives have been delayed or even cancelled, citing poor-quality information as the main reason. Previous research indicated that under-standing the effects of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> is {{critical to the success of}} organisations. However, little research has been done to analyse the effects of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> in an organisational context. In order to address this drawback, the objective of this thesis is to systematically analyse the effects of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> on decision-making. In order to achieve this objective, we propose a practical assessment framework that allows us to measure <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> dimensions and categories. This framework was validated using a real-world database. With the help of this assessment framework we gained in-depth insights into the effects of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> on decision quality. Our results showed that the categories of intrinsic and contextual <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> are positively related to decision quality. However decision quality is not significantly affected by representational <b>information</b> <b>quality.</b> It is also found that in contrast to consistency, increasing information accuracy and completeness can significantly improve decision quality. From our results we concluded that not all the aspects of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> are equally effective for the improvement of decision quality. Decision-makers could decide to pay little or no attention to the improvement of representational <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>information</b> consistency. This finding will directly reduce the cost of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> improvement. For practical implementations, our results concluded a validated framework that allows software engineers to implement assessment. Comparing our framework with other common frameworks that require soft-ware engineers to understand <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> theory, our framework helps soft-ware engineers to follow a step-by-step procedure to build an application of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> assessment.

Although more mechanized processes are being used to prepare pieces of information to be fit-for-use for information consumers, how information consumers perceive the <b>quality</b> of <b>information</b> and its difference with the actual <b>quality</b> of <b>information</b> gets more important as information consumers are at the position to judge the quality. Motivated by the notion of Perceived <b>Information</b> <b>Quality</b> (PIQ), this study explains the role of adoption and implementation of Information Technology (IT) in the process of perceiving <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> by <b>information</b> consumers. For the purpose of this research, seven Iranian organizations were studied. Due to lack of proper communication and institutional link between these organizations and the technology developers, it has been challenging for the studied organizations to implement the adopted technologies in the context of use.

Poor <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> presents significant costs to an organisation, financially and non-financially. However, the issue of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> has not been explored in depth {{in the field of}} facilities management. Thus, within the context of facilities management, this has led to failures in asset management programs undertaken by facilities management organisations and present a significant challenge in the decision-making process by facility managers. Achieving improved asset <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> in facility management operations is thus of immense importance to stakeholders in facilities management. To this end, various methods and frameworks have been developed to assess and improve <b>information</b> <b>quality,</b> but these have very limited scope and not applicable in facilities management organisation undertaking asset management. To this end, this research aims to evaluate the <b>quality</b> of <b>information</b> and determine what factors impact <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> of asset management programs in the facilities management domain. The research adopts an exploratory mixed-method methodology, which allows data to be collected and analysed using qualitative and quantitative techniques to provide greater insight of the phenomenon in facility management operations. The qualitative approach uses thematic analysis to determine what factors affect the <b>quality</b> of <b>information</b> from the information, organisation, and people domain respectively. The results from this analysis show that factors affecting <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> of asset management programs is multidimensional. In addition, 71 <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> attributes has been identified from the qualitative analysis. In the quantitative phase, principal component analysis (PCA) with direct oblimin rotation, ANOVA, and measure of central tendency (MCT) techniques were adopted to identify the specific dimensions of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> in asset management, the effect {{of the structure of the}} organisation on <b>information</b> <b>quality,</b> and the prevalence of <b>information</b> <b>quality</b> issue in asset management respectively.
