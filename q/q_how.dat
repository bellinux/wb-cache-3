40|$|By "folk {{psychology}} " I {{mean the}} commonsense understanding and deployment of mentalistic concepts, especially the propositional attitudes. Three (or four) principal questions {{are of interest}} in the study of folk psychology: (<b>Q</b> 1) <b>How</b> do ordinary people understand, or represent to themselves, the various mental states? That is, what are the contents of their concepts of the mental states? (<b>Q</b> 2) <b>How</b> do they go about attributing these states? This question decomposes into two subquestions: (<b>Q</b> 2) (A) <b>how</b> do people attribute such states to others, and (<b>Q</b> 2) (B) <b>how</b> do they attribute such states to themselves? (3) How do people acquire their concepts of mental states and their skill at applying these concepts? The study of folk psychology is the attempt to answer these questions, an attempt which should be (and is) a combined effort among philosophers and cognitive scientists. Large literatures on the topic already exist in both philosophy and developmental psychology, and other branches of cognitive and neuroscience also have much to contribute. The study of folk psychology might profitably be viewed as a branch of "descriptive epistemology", since epistemology is (partly) concerned with how beliefs are formed (Goldman 1986) and folk psychology involves the formation of beliefs about a special subject-matter...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cooperative {{communication}} techniques promise {{the advantages}} of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communications for wireless scenarios with single-antenna terminals. A main assumption in majority of the research work on cooperative communications is the availability of channel state information at the receiver. In practice, knowledge of the channel is obtained by sending known training (pilot) symbols to the receiver. In this paper, we study the effect of training {{on the performance of}} an amplify-and-forward cooperative relaying system with pilot-assisted channel estimator over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. We consider average received signal-to-noise ratio at the destination node as the objective function and formulate optimization problems for a single-relay scenario under total network power (TNP) and individual node power (INP) constraints. We aim to answer the following fundamental questions: <b>Q</b> 1) <b>How</b> should overall transmit power be shared between training and data transmission periods?; <b>Q</b> 2) <b>How</b> should training power be allocated to broadcasting and relaying phases?; <b>Q</b> 3) <b>How</b> should data power be allocated to broadcasting and relaying phases? Our simulation results demonstrate that optimized schemes significantly outperform the original schemes with equal power allocation. Depending on the relay location, performance gains up to 5. 5 dB and 2. 8 dB are observed, respectively, under TNP and INP constraints. Index Terms—Cooperative transmission, channel estimation, power allocation. I...|$|R
