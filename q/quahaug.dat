5000|$|The {{hard clam}} (Mercenaria mercenaria), {{also known as}} a quahog (or <b>quahaug),</b> round clam, or {{hard-shell}} (or hard-shelled) clam, is an edible marine bivalve mollusc that is native to the eastern shores of North America and Central America, from Prince Edward Island to the Yucat√°n Peninsula. It is one of many unrelated edible bivalves that in the United States are frequently referred to simply as clams, as in the expression [...] "clam digging". Older literature sources may use the systematic name Venus mercenaria; this species is in the family Veneridae, the venus clams.|$|E
40|$|The uptake of Escherichia coli by the <b>quahaug,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, was {{studied to}} obtain an insight into the {{environmental}} parameters significant to the accumulation of bacterial pathogens by shellfish growing in polluted waters and into the kinetics of the uptake process. Experimental uptake was achieved by placing the animals in a flowing water {{system in which the}} contamination level of the water and its temperature and salinity could be controlled. Data from periodic assays of individual animals suggested that accumulation of the bacteria by the <b>quahaug</b> proceeds to an equilibrium level which is a function of E. coli content of the water and its overall particulate matter. Accumulation takes place in the digestive gland and, to a lesser extent, in the siphon of the animal...|$|E

The Micmac {{came to the}} island in the summer months to dig clams, mussels and <b>quahaugs.</b> The first full-time inhabitants of the island were settlers from Scotland, {{the first of which}} {{is believed to have been}} Andrew MacDonald and his family in 1805. The Panmure Island Cemetery was established in 1813.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{potential}} for transmission of Perkinsus karlssoni, an apicomplexan parasite, among bivalve hosts, a long-term laboratory-scale, closed, artificial seawater system for shellfish was designed. Species of shellfish utilised were as follows: bay scallops, Argopecten irradians; blue mussels, Mytilus edulis; eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica; European oysters, Ostrea edulis; sea scallops, Placopecten megallanicus; softshell clams, Mya arenaria; and <b>quahaugs,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria. All shellfish used were juveniles with shell heights of 10 - 25 mm. The design was duplicated for control and experimental systems with a combined population of 1600 individual shellfish. The maximum biomass in each system was estimated at < 1 kg/m super(3). Each system included six, 400 litre rectangular fibreglass tanks, a modular pump and filter unit (particle and activated carbon filters and ultra-violet sterilisers), a biological filter and a refrigeration unit. The total volume of water for each system was 2300 litres of artificial seawater (Instant Ocean super(")). The mean water temperature of 22 degree C was achieved by thermostat-controlled room temperature. Salinity was maintained between 27 and 31 ppt by addition of either freshwater or artificial seawater. Shellfish were fed daily a mixed diet of carboy-cultured algae and spray-dried algae. Mean values for water quality parameters in both systems were as follows: NH sub(3) < 0. 004 mg/litre; NO sub(2) super(-) < 0. 01 mg/litre; NO sub(3) super(-) < 19 - 16 mg/litre; and pH 8. 0 - 8. 4. The system design was adequate in maintaining healthy bivalves {{for a period of}} 22 months, {{with the exception of the}} sea scallops which succumbed to warm water. Mean monthly shellfish survival rates were 79. 9 - 100 % in the control and 74. 8 - 98. 9 % in the experimental system. A method of controlling water temperature other than via room temperature should reduce slight seasonal temperature fluctuations...|$|R
40|$|In 1989, an {{unidentified}} protistan parasite, QPX (<b>Quahaug</b> Parasite X), {{was found in}} quahaugs Mercenaria mercenaria (Linnaeus, 1758) from a hatchery on Prince Edward Island, Canada, which was suffering extensive mortalities. The parasite was identical to one reported from mass mortalities of wild populations of quahaugs in the late 1960 's. QPX elicits a massive inflammatory response characterized by extensive infiltration of haemocytes with necrosis of the connective tissues in the digestive gland and within the musculature of the foot. Light microscopy revealed a range of parasite stages including thick-walled cyst-like stages. The majority of QPX tissue stages were enclosed within a translucent 'halo' indicative of possible host tissue lysis. The same feature was observed in QPX isolated from <b>quahaug</b> tissue cultured on potato dextrose agar. Culture in sterile artificial seawater and on potato dextrose agar resulted in production of a biflagellate stage. Features of all developmental stages observed are described and {{compared with those of}} the Thraustochytriales and Labyrinthulales. TR: CS 941689...|$|E

40|$|The in situ {{microbiota}} {{from several}} aquaculture facilities with active nitrification was examined by {{transmission electron microscopy}} of thin sections {{for the presence of}} bacteria that contained intracytoplasmic membranes characteristic of the nitrifying bacteria. Colonies of bacteria with the cellular morphology of a species of Nitrosomonas were found to be present in both the culture water and in the biological filter slime of a freshwater chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) culture system. bacteria in the water possessed the normal nitrosomonas type of ultrastructure, whereas similar bacteria in the slime had an aberrant morphology due to multiple invaginations of the cell wall and cyto-membranes and a significantly greater number of ribosomes. These nitrosomonas-like bacteria lysed during enrichment in commonly used media. Bacteria with the morphology of species of Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus were also observed in colonies in the surface slimes of marine culture systems for striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and <b>quahaug</b> (Mercenaria mercenaria) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate critically the feasibility of using the self-cleansing mechanism as a practical means to obtain virus-free shellfish. Two systems supplied with fresh running seawater, three strains of human enterovirus and the Northern <b>quahaug,</b> were used as working models. Preliminary experiments in the experimental system under arbitrarily selected conditions showed that depuration of poliovirus-polluted quahaugs could be achieved by the method used for the Eastern oyster. The factors affecting viral depuration studied so far included: (i) initial concentration of shellfish pollution; (ii) temperature of seawater; and (iii) salinity of seawater. It was shown that purification of the lightly polluted shellfish was achieved sooner than of the heavily polluted ones. The efficiency of viral depuration was roughly a function of the water temperature within the range tested (5 to 20 C). Reduction of salinity to 50 to 60 % of the original level stopped this process completely, but 25 % reduction in salinity did not affect significantly the rate of depuration. Preliminary study in the pilot system showed that viral depuration in the large tank appeared to be equally as efficient as that in the small experimental tanks under the particular conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to further {{evaluate}} the practicability of viral depuration by assaying individual shellfish. The Northern <b>quahaug</b> and a strain of the type 1 attenuated poliovirus were used as the working model. Two types of depuration systems were employed: the small experimental tanks and a pilot-size tank with a capacity of approximately 24 bushels (836 liters) of shellfish. Volumes of the individual shellfish samples were found uniform throughout the experiments when a prior selection for {{the weight of the}} shellfish was made. There was also no significant difference in volumes of the individual samples during the course of depuration (24 to 96 hr). Under controlled hydrographic conditions, however, the uptake of virus in individual shellfish varied considerably. In general, the individual variability reached 10 - to 100 -fold. This wide variation would explain the variability of viral contents obtained in pooled samples during depuration as reported previously. During a later phase of depuration, although a great majority of shellfish were free of the virus, a few still harbored minimal amounts of contaminants. The presence of virus in some of the shellfish after various periods of depuration would, theoretically, be obscured by the pooling of the sampled shellfish. Further examination of the negative samples by assaying larger quantities than those routinely used revealed that a few still contained virus. To simulate naturally polluted shellfish as closely as technically possible, shellfish were polluted with minimal amounts of virus. The shellfish were cleansed more rapidly by the depuration process than were those polluted with more virus. Since the naturally polluted shellfish were shown to contain less virus than those studied in the laboratory, it is anticipated that the former type of shellfish may be cleansed more readily by this process within a reasonable period of time. Justification for a field trial of depuration in this country is presented...|$|E
