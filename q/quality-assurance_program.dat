40|$|Using Shewhart p {{control charts}} of {{external}} <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> data to monitor analytical {{performance of a}} clinical chemistry laboratory DOUG CHESHER and LESLIE BURNETT* We have investigated the application of Shewhart’s p con-trol charts in our external <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> to monitor the long-term performance of our laboratory’s analytical quality. The p control charts {{have been able to}} detect long-term changes in our laboratory’s analytical performance that would have been difficult to detect by more-conventional techniques. We have explored methods for interpreting these charts {{as well as some of}} their limitations, which include minimum subgroup size and dependence on constant specification limits. These charts may be not only a simple method for the long-term moni-toring of analytical performance of a laboratory, but also of use to the organizers of external quality-assurance pro-grams. INDEXING TERMS: quality control #{ 149 }statistical process control. laboratory management Techniques of statistical process control are widely used by the manufacturing industry to detect and eliminate defects during production [1, 2]. More recently, these techniques have been applied to a variety of processes within the clinical laboratory [3, 4]. In statistical process control, samples of product are made from a production process and analyzed statistically, usually with the assistance of various types of control charts [5]. We have assessed the use of Shewhart p control charts [2] to measure and control the overall analytical performance of our clinical chem-istry laboratory, applying the charts to the results of analyses of external <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> (QAP) samples already rou-tinely performed by our laboratory. ...|$|E

40|$|Background Colonoscopy is the {{diagnostic}} evaluation {{of choice in}} cases of rectal bleeding (RB). Colonoscopy in children {{is different from that}} in adults, but the technique of the examination is similar. Colonoscopy is a technically demanding procedure with the potential for harm if performance is unsatisfactory, and thus assurance of quality is pivotal. A colonoscopy <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> was instituted in 2003. Aim The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the quality of colonoscopy in children with RB after introducing a colonoscopy <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program.</b> Patients and methods The study was cross-sectional and hospital-based. It was undertaken between 2010 and 2013 on 107 children who underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of RB. Results A total of 112 colonoscopies were assessed. A diagnosis was established in 69 (62 %) colonoscopies and polyps were detected in 52 %. Cecal intubation was achieved in 107 (90 %). The main reason for an unsuccessful cecal intubation was poor bowel preparation. The adjusted completion rate was 97 %. The mean time to reach the cecum was 16 min. The mean time for completion of the procedure was 31 min. Colon preparation was rated adequate in 63 (56 %) colonoscopies. A total of 119 polyps were detected in 58 colonoscopies, with an average of two polyps per colonoscopy (range 1 - 7). In all, 113 polyps were excised. All polyps were judged to be completely removed in 52 (95 %) colonoscopies. Polypectomy was not performed in three colonic examinations with solitary polyps. Five (4 %) patients had postprocedural vomiting. There was one (1 %) sedation-related complication (respiratory distress), but no procedure-related complications or mortality.

Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, and Rotterdam Eye Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Methods: Cataract patients (N = 540) who had cataract surgery 2 to 8 months previously rated 31 quality-of-care aspects in terms of importance (range 0, not important, to 10, extremely important) and performance (0 = yes, 1 = no). An arithmetic combination of the 2 parameters was used to generate quality-impact factors (Q) (range 0, best quality of care, to 10, this aspect needs improvement according to every respondent). The goal was to identify bottlenecks in the quality of care. Results: Patients scored aspects concerning patient education as the most important quality aspects. The top 3 quality-impact factors were to inform patients what to do in emergency situations (Q = 3. 39), inform patients about the risks of treatment (Q = 3. 00), and minimize the number of ophthalmologists to 1 per patient (Q = 2. 79).

The purpose of this memo is to describe the variability, discuss NWQL actions {{to compensate for the}} blank variability, and to report the possible effects on the data base. Background NWQL Technical Memorandum 99. 03 (Brenton, 1998) announced that beginning October 15, 1998, the NWQL would analyze water samples for Total Recoverable Phenols by using method 5530 (American Public Health Association, 1998). Memorandum 99. 03 stated that the method was only applicable to samples that contained more than 4 ug/L (micrograms per liter) of phenol because of excessive bias and variability at concentrations less than 4 ug/L. The Minimum Reporting Level (MRL) was set at 4 ug/L. The Organic Blind Sample Project, operated by the Branch of Quality Systems, produced results suggesting that the bias of the analytical results, for samples spiked near 4 ug/L, was unacceptable.

Discussion of the spirometry results with current smokers should be accompanied by strong advice to quit smoking and referral to local smoking cessation resources. Spirometry also is recommended for patients with respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough, episodic wheezing, and exertional dyspnea in order to detect airways obstruction due to asthma or COPD.

40|$|Issue: From {{the time}} wood waste arrives for {{processing}} until its processed materials are {{shipped to the}} end-user, processors should have complete knowledge {{and control of the}} expected quantity and quality of the recovered wood waste. The quantity of available feedstock and the size, shape, contamination level, and all other business-related issues are, for the most part, {{under the control of the}} processor. The only possible exception is during transportation of the feedstock from the generator or processor to the enduser. Only when a product is shipped to an end-user and unloaded, does the end-user actually examine the actual feedstock properties of the wood waste for comparison to what was expected and described in their contract with the supplier (the processor, in this case). Often, the words, technical descriptions, and even the specifications contained in the purchase agreement or contract between the end-user and the processor, do not fully convey to the extreme importance that the end-user attaches to the high and consistent quality of the feedstock.

Bolak Eldakror Hospital is a secondary-care governmental hospital in Egypt in which we set up an endoscopy <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> in 2003. Aim The aim of this study was specifically to evaluate the quality of colonoscopy practice in our endoscopy unit and by publishing our experience to encourage others to develop a quality-improvement program. Patients and methods Predetermined international quality indicators for colonoscopy were employed to monitor the standard of endoscopic procedures between 2010 and 2014. Recorded information included all medical and technical details. Results A total of 286 colonoscopies were assessed. The main indication of colonoscopy was hematochezia (58. 7 %). Polyps were the main endoscopic findings (34. 6 %). Conscious sedation was used in 56. 6 %. Cecal intubation was achieved in 77. 6 %. The adjusted cecal intubation was 94 %. Image documentation of cecal intubation was achieved in 92. 3 % examinations reaching the cecum. Mean cecal intubation time was 17. 4 ± 10 [*]min. Mean withdrawal time was 6. 6 ± 4 [*]min. The main reasons for unsuccessful cecal intubation were impassable mass or stricture in 23 (8 %) colonoscopies and poor bowel preparation in 23 (8 %). Colon preparation was rated adequate in 66. 4 %.

A colonoscopy <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> (CQAP) was instituted in 2003. AimThe aim {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of instituting a CQAP on the quality of endoscopic polypectomy (EP) in our patients. Patients and methodsAn Initial assessment of EP practice in 2003 showed that four patients had polyps. Cecal intubation had been achieved in only two patients and a complete polyp description (CPD) had not been documented. Polypectomy was performed in two patients but the completeness of removal and retrieval of the polyps had not been assessed and histology had not been recorded. A quality improvement process was therefore instituted. This required full colonoscopy to the cecum, CPD and polypectomy to be performed for every polyp. There should be a 90 % retrieval rate of all excised polyps and follow up of all histology reports. Seventy-six patients were assessed prospectively over the period 2004 – 2011. ResultsCecal intubation rates increased from 65 % in years 2004 – 2007 to 90 % in years 2008 – 2011 (t-proportion = 2. 4 & CI = 4. 7, highly significant). CPD rates increased from 35 % to 100 % (t-proportion = 6. 5 & CI = 12. 7, highly significant). EP rates increased from 59 % to 100 % (t-proportion = 3. 5 & CI = 6. 9, highly significant). Percentage of procedures in which all polyps were judged completely removed increased from 41 % to 86 % (t-proportion = 3. 6 & CI = 7, highly significant).

The species-specific values for the exposure factors presented in Chapter 2 of the Handbook of are a subset of the data included in the tables of this Appendix. Most values identified in the literature reviewed for the Handbook are included in this Appendix. For some exposure factors for some species, large quantities of data are available. For these factors and species, we tried to select data that represented a range of values and geographic locations for the Appendix, and did not include the other reviewed data. All data obtained from secondary sources are so identified in the 2 ̆ 2 Notes 2 ̆ 2 column of the tables. Appropriate data identified in primary sources were included in the Appendix unless the results were inadequately reported (e. g., no methods, units of measure unclear). The references for this Appendix are in Chapter 2 of the Handbook. We caution users of this Appendix that some values or studies included may be inaccurate. We have not attempted to evaluate the quality of the original studies and associated data. When potential difficulties were obvious (e. g., method of estimating home range not reported), we have tried to indicate the limitation in the 2 ̆ 2 Notes 2 ̆ 2 column. Also in the notes column, we have tried to identify potential confounding factors (e. g., low reproductive success due to DDT or other pollutant). Due to resource limitations, our <b>quality-assurance</b> <b>program</b> consisted of reviewing all data for consistency with other reported values, reviewing any unusual values against the original reference, and verifying values that were included in Chapter 2 of the Handbook. Many of the data presented in the Appendix required conversion to metric units (e. g., density reported as N/acre to density as N/hectare), and we have not verified that all such conversions were performed correctly for the Appendix. For several factor values, we computed a mean and standard deviation (SD) from original data provided in the reference (e. g., mean ± SD of 10 density values representing 10 different years of study in the same location). Again, we have only verified a subset of these data as part of our quality assurance procedures.
