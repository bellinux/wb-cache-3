40|$|White {{cast irons}} perform much less favourably in {{industrial}} service environments such as ball mills {{than would be}} predicted by standard laboratory abrasion tests. Pin abrasive tests are widely thought to simulate high stress abrasion, but in reality they grossly over-estimate service lives of white iron mill liners compared to pearlitic steel liners. The 2 ̆ 7 impact-abrasion 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis {{has suggested that the}} key difference between laboratory and service conditions is impact. However, we have found no evidence of such a phenomenon in ball mills, and instead the observed behaviour is attributed to high stress abrasion in the service environment. The defining characteristics of high stress abrasion are re-stated in a way that emphasises the load able to be transmitted to the wearing surface through the abrasive particle. Data are presented which indicate that abrasive wear mode can be identified from quantitative performance comparisons between key classes of wear-resistant alloys. Three useful diagnostics are proposed. Using these diagnostics it is shown that pin abrasive tests do not represent high stress abrasion in any industrially-relevant sense. Appropriately modest performance of white irons can be reproduced in various laboratory apparatus having zero or negligible impact energy: RWAT-analogues using solid metal wheels (xWAT), the Abex block-on-track apparatus, and a simple laboratory ball mill abrasion test (BMAT). Of these, the BMAT most closely reproduces the contact and particle mechanics of service conditions, and can give <b>quantitative</b> <b>alloy</b> performance comparisons closely matching those in service. This paper discusses some features of the BMAT and presents preliminary data for white cast irons. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA set of unified {{constitutive}} equations {{is presented}} that predict the asymmetric tension and compression creep behaviour and recently observed double primary creep of pre-stretched/naturally aged aluminium-cooper-lithium alloy AA 2050 -T 34. The {{evolution of the}} primary micro- and macro-variables related to the precipitation hardening and creep deformation of the alloy during creep age forming (CAF) are analysed and modelled. Equations for the yield strength evolution of the alloy, including an initial reversion and subsequent strengthening, are proposed based on a theory of concurrent dissolution, re-nucleation and growth of precipitates during artificial ageing. We present new observations of so-called double primary creep during the CAF process. This phenomenon is then predicted by introducing effects of interacting microstructures, including evolving precipitates, diffusing solutes and dislocations, into the sinh-law creep model.

40|$|Nickel and {{nitrogen}} {{are the two}} most widely used alloying ele-ments which can impart the face-centered-cubic crystal lattice to stainless steels. With the recent price increases and the price vola-tility of nickel, nitrogen is ever more important as an alloying ele-ment for a number of reasons. First, nitrogen is easily available everywhere and thus is not subject to speculation at the Metal Ex-change. Second, in addition to making stainless steels austenitic, nitrogen can also make them stronger and more corrosion resistant It is also a well and clearly established fact since many years, that nitrogen in solid solution makes austenitic stainless steels more wear resistant and more fatigue resistant. Austenitic stainless steel alloy design with nitrogen has for many years now taken account of the role of carbon. This is not only be-cause carbon is just a useful austenite former, but also because ni-trogen reduces the temperature where carbides begin to form. Thus there is always an optimum carbon to nitrogen ratio. Finally it is now well established that carbon in solid solution helps to increase the strength, the corrosion resistance and the wear resistance of aus-tenitic stainless steels.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels are finding increasing use in seawater applications, but {{are prone to}} attack by crevice corrosion. A mechanism of deaeration and acidification is thought to produce locally aggressive conditions within the crevice. A variety of experimental techniques were therefore used to investigate the crevice corrosion resistance of some commercial duplex {{stainless steels}} in seawater and other, more aggressive Cr-containing environments. The established marine grade 316 L austenitic stainless steel was used for reference purposes. The investigations provided both <b>quantitative</b> data regarding <b>alloy</b> performance, and qualitative observations regarding the attack mechanism. The crevice corrosion resistance of the duplex stainless steels was shown to be superior to that of 316 L, and to increase with (Cr + N) content. Electrochemical polarisation scans demonstrated the importance of dissolved 02 in the seawater in maintaining a protective passive film on these alloys. Active peak current density, {{a measure of the}} severity of attack, was shown to increase with decreasing pH. In a simulated crevice solution, the duplex alloys were shown to exhibit both a narrower active range and lower peak current density than 316 L. Potentiostatic tests showed weight loss to be an order of magnitude lower for the duplex alloys. Measured weight losses were in agreement with those predicted from polarisation data. The technique suggested that cathodic protection potentials as noble as - 600 mV (SCE) may be sufficient to protect duplex stainless steels in seawater. Metallographic observation and electron beam analysis showed that the attack mode is potential dependent, with ferrite and austenite preferentially attacked at more active and noble potentials respectively. Real time tests showed that the internal crevice pH of austenitic stainless steel could fall to as low as 1. 3. The rise in corrosion current was found to be a reliable indicator of attack, and was consistent with measured weight loss. Potential shifts were found to be relatively insensitive indicators of breakdown...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a research into properties of nickel-based single crystal super- <b>alloys.</b> The underlying <b>quantitative</b> relationship between <b>alloy</b> chemistry {{and the important}} properties have been studied. To design new grade of single crystal su- peralloys, computational modelling methods have been proposed which build {{on the findings of}} composition-microstructure-property relationships. A physical model for the creep deformation of single crystal superalloys is presented, in which the dependence of the kinetics of creep deformation on alloy chemistry is rationalised. The rate-controlling step is considered to be climb of dislocations at the matrix/particle interfaces and their rate of escape from trapped configurations. The effects of microstructural scale precipitate size, geometry and spacing are also studied. A first order estimate for the rate of creep deformation emerges from the model, which is useful for the purposes of alloy design. Three new single crystal superalloys have been isolated using theory-based com- putational modelling approaches, termed Alloys-By-Design methods. They are (i) an oxidation-resistant low Re-containing alloy with balanced properties, intended for general-purpose gas turbine applications; (ii) an alloy containing 5. 6 wt. % Re and 2. 6 wt. % Ru suitable for high performance jet engine applications, and (iii) a cheap, corrosion-resistant alloy for power generation applications. The new alloys have been manufactured using investment casting techniques, and their creep and oxidation behaviour evaluated. The multicomponent composition space pertinent to the single crystal nickel-based superalloys has been mapped and searched, by using newly developed numerical al- gorithms. This allowed compositions of alloys conferring the microstructures needed for optimal properties to be identified, at a resolution of 0. 1 wt. %. Databases have been constructed which contain all appropriate compositions available in these systems. When coupled with composition- and microstructure-dependent property models, the databases can be searched to identify new alloys predicted to exhibit the very best properties or combinations of them.

40|$|Amorphous metals, or bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs), {{based on the}} Mg-Zn-Ca ternary alloy system, are an emerging class of material that offer many improvements over conventional crystalline magnesium alloys. These materials present a very real possibility of replacing current metallic and polymeric implant materials {{in a variety of}} roles. However, there is a general lack of understanding in these alloys, particularly in regard to their degradation processes. The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential of these newly discovered amorphous Mg-Zn-Ca alloys {{to be used as a}} bioresorbable biomaterial. The thesis began by focusing on a promising BMG composition, Mg 65 Zn 30 Ca 5. The evaluation of its degradation and associated effects on cell viability provided a quantitative baseline for the subsequent work. However, its poor thermoplastic formability prompted the exploration of other BMG compositions within the Mg-Zn-Ca ternary system. A range of Mg-rich and Ca-rich BMG compositions were systematically explored. Although Ca-rich BMGs exhibited superior thermoplastic formability compared to the Mg-rich BMGs, they underwent rapid dissolution in biocorrosion environments. By enriching Ca-rich BMGs with Zn, their corrosion potential was enobled, but the corrosion rate remained high. Nevertheless, the amount of hydrogen evolved was low considering the degree of corrosion. Mg-rich BMGs on the other hand contain significantly less Ca, the most reactive element within the alloy. As such, Mg-rich BMGs exhibited superior corrosion resistance, and signs of passive corrosion kinetics. The interaction between the elements Mg, Zn, Ca was found to be very complex. The monotonic increase in Zn content in both Ca-rich and Mg-rich BMGs did not guarantee an improvement in their corrosion resistance. This suggested that the corrosion rate was not solely determined by the Zn content but, rather, the combination of Mg:Zn:Ca ratio. Overall, the results and findings from this research furthered our understanding on the amorphous Mg-Zn-Ca <b>alloys.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> data on the in-vitro performance of a range of amorphous alloy were amongst the first to be reported.

The effects of modification and/or heat treatment on the microstructure and the mechanical properties of 356 alloy have been investigated on both permanent mold and sand cast samples. Strontium (0. 02 %) and sodium (0. 01 %) were used to produce well modified microstructures. The importance of the amount of modifier used was also examined in producing castings with 0. 002 % Sr and 0. 08 % Sr. Production parameters such as solution heat treatment time and artificial aging time were examined. Microstructural assessment was done by quantitative metallography using image analysis coupled to SEM while mechanical testing comprised tensile testing, hardness and microhardness measurements as well as impact tests. The greatest improvement in mechanical properties obtained with modification was observed for the lower rates of solidification, i. e sand casting. The effect of modification on the heat treatment response of 356 alloy was investigated. The differences between unmodified and modified microstructures were more important in sand cast samples than in permanent mold cast samples. After one hour of solution heat treatment at 540 $ sp circ$C, both permanent mold unmodified and modified microstructures became similar in terms of silicon particle size and sphericity. The processes which led to this were different. Silicon platelets in the unmodified structures segmented while silicon particles in the modified alloy coarsened. The final result was however the same. In sand cast alloy, the initial microstructural differences persisted after up to 12 hours of solution treatment. The coarser the initial as-cast microstructure, the greater the improvements associated with modification and heat treatment. It was also found that porosity caused by modification can negate many of the microstructural benefits by decreasing tensile strength and percent elongation. It was demonstrated that modification also has an influence on the aluminum matrix. The hardness of modified alloy was found to be less after the T 6 temper than in unmodified alloy. This was reflected in a lower yield strength of modified 356 <b>alloy.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> microstructure-mechanical property relationships were established for the permanent mold samples. The best silicon-structure characteristics to predict the tensile properties were found to be the particle count per unit area and the particle area. It was also determined that hardness can be a simple and inexpensive means whereby ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of 356 alloy in the T 4 condition or T 6 condition can be estimated...|$|R
