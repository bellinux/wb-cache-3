25|$|QUIET had {{arrays of}} {{detectors}} at two frequencies: 43nbsp&GHz (<b>Q</b> <b>band)</b> and 95nbsp&GHz (W band). It used four telescopes, {{three of which}} were purpose-built 2nbsp&m ones with the other being the 7nbsp&m Crawford Hill telescope used for CAPMAP. As a result, it will have angular resolutions between a few arcminutes and several degrees. The detectors are mass-produced coherent correlation polarimeters.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{absorption}} of a photon causes an electron to be excited into a singlet state of the <b>Q</b> <b>band.</b> The excited state undergoes an intersystem crossing from the singlet state to a triplet state {{in which there are}} two electrons with parallel spin. This species is, in effect, a free radical, and is very reactive and allows an electron to be transferred to acceptors that are adjacent to the chlorophyll in the chloroplast. In the process chlorophyll is oxidized. Later in the photosynthetic cycle, chlorophyll is reduced back again. This reduction ultimately draws electrons from water, yielding molecular oxygen as a final oxidation product.|$|E
2500|$|EPR {{experiments}} {{often are}} conducted at X and, less commonly, Q bands, mainly {{due to the}} ready availability of the necessary microwave components (which originally were developed for radar applications). A second reason for widespread X and <b>Q</b> <b>band</b> measurements is that electromagnets can reliably generate fields up to about 1 tesla. However, the low spectral resolution over g-factor at these wavebands limits the study of paramagnetic centers with comparatively low anisotropic magnetic parameters. Measurements at [...] > 40GHz, in the millimeter wavelength region, offer the following advantages: ...|$|E

2500|$|Vandross was {{originally}} intended to perform on their second and highly successful album Miracles in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn't pay enough money. Vandross' decision led to a recording contract with Epic Records that same year, but he also provided background vocals on [...] "Miracles" [...] and on the new Petrus-created act, the B. B. & <b>Q.</b> <b>Band</b> in 1981. During that hectic year Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, Never Too Much.

40|$|Porphyrins {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} as sensitizers {{owing to the}} large absorption coefficients of their Soret and <b>Q</b> <b>bands</b> in the visible region. In a donor and acceptor zinc porphyrin we applied a new strategy of introducing 2, 1, 3 -benzothiadiazole (BTD) as a π-conjugated linker between the anchoring group and the porphyrin chromophore to broaden the absorption spectra to fill the valley between the Soret and <b>Q</b> <b>bands.</b> With this novel approach, we observed 12. 75 % power-conversion efficiency under simulated one-sun illumination (AM 1. 5 G, 100  mW[*]cm(- 2)). In this study, we showed the importance of introducing the phenyl group as a spacer between the BTD and the zinc porphyrin in achieving high power-conversion efficiencies. Time-resolved fluorescence, transient-photocurrent-decay, and transient-photovoltage-decay measurements were employed to determine the electron-injection dynamics and the lifetime of the photogenerated charge carriers...|$|R

50|$|Porphyrin's highly {{conjugated}} skeleton {{produces a}} characteristic ultra-violet visible (UV-VIS) spectrum. The spectrum typically {{consists of an}} intense, narrow absorption band (ε > 200000 l mol−1 cm−1) at around 400 nm, known as the Soret or B band, followed by four longer wavelength (450-700 nm), weaker absorptions (ε > 20000 l mol−1 cm−1 (free-base porphyrins)) {{referred to as the}} <b>Q</b> <b>bands.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two novel porphyrin-perylene dyads 1 and 2 for DSSC {{applications}} {{have been}} synthesized. The absorption {{band of the}} perylene fills up the trough between the Soret and <b>Q</b> <b>bands</b> of the porphyrin, leading {{to an increase in}} the absorption efficiency of the dye. The highly conjugated acetylenic bridge mediates strong electronic coupling between the porphyrin and perylene units and results in the extension of it-conjugation of the porphyrin ring. The Soret and <b>Q</b> <b>bands</b> are broadened and red-shifted and the light-harvesting effect is thus improved. We propose that energy transfer occurs from the photoexcited perylene to porphyrin for dyad 1 whereas energy transfer proceeds from the excited porphyrin to perylene for dyad 2. Our studies show that multichromophoric dyes used for DSSC can be designed in a rational manner with predictable photophysical behavior and efficient light-harvesting properties, but the efficiency of the energy transfer process in a consecutive model needs to be controlled for a significant improvement of the cell performance using perylene-porphyrin sensitizers...|$|R
30|$|Amniocytes were cultured and <b>Q</b> <b>banding</b> was {{performed}} {{for most of}} the cases. Routine evaluation of each case involved analysis of 20 random metaphase spread from two independent cultures. Four metaphase spreads were photographed for karyotyping using imaging system. When mosaicism was suspected more than 50 metaphase spreads were analyzed. Karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (2005) (ISCN 2005).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Q</b> <b>band</b> is a {{range of}} {{frequencies}} contained in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

5000|$|By 1985 Petrus had fixed a {{contract}} with Elektra Records, and B. B. & <b>Q.</b> <b>Band</b> was back on track with their last album Genie, including minor hits like the title track [...] "Genie" [...] and [...] "Dreamer". Kae Williams, a former Breakwater member hired by Petrus, wrote all tracks and co-produced the LP in conjunction with Petrus.

Petrus and his troupe of Italian studio musicians and writers also co-wrote and produced parts of The Ritchie Family's 1982 album [...] "I'll do my Best". The title track became a club hit, and was penned by Malavasi. Of {{all these new}} projects the B. B. & <b>Q.</b> <b>band</b> {{was by far the}} most successful concept.
