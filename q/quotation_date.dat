40|$|International audienceDue to {{the lack}} of {{reliable}} market information, building financial term-structures may be associated with a significant degree of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new term-structure interpolation method that extends classical spline techniques by additionally allowing for quantification of uncertainty. The proposed method is based on a generalization of kriging models with linear equality constraints (market-fit conditions) and shape-preserving conditions such as monotonicity or positivity (no-arbitrage conditions). We define the most likely curve and show how to build confidence bands. The Gaussian process covariance hyper-parameters under the construction constraints are estimated using cross-validation techniques. Based on observed market quotes at different dates, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by building curves together with confidence intervals for term-structures of OIS discount rates, of zero-coupon swaps rates and of CDS implied default probabilities. We also show how to construct interest-rate surfaces or default probability surfaces by considering time (<b>quotation</b> <b>dates)</b> as an additional dimension...|$|R

These businesses are the main entities of a network called dual channel supply chain. Improving customer service {{as one of the}} main performance measures has got a growing interest in recent years from all entities of supply chain specifically manufacturing/service providers. In this context, we can express customer service as 2 ̆ 2 being able to satisfy customer demands as soon as possible 2 ̆ 2 and from the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, it is potentially achievable by coordination of scheduling and reliable due <b>date</b> <b>quotation.</b> In this dissertation, we consider due <b>date</b> <b>quotation</b> problem coordinated with scheduling in a two-echelon dual channel supply chain from the manufacturer point of view.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel model for due <b>date</b> <b>quotation.</b> Jobs {{arrive at a}} single server or m-machine flow shop over time. Upon arrival, the {{processing}} times on each machine of the job are known, and due dates must be quoted for each job. The jobs are sequenced on the machines without preemption. Associated with each job, there are three measures of disadvantages to the inventory cost and the service level: quoted lead time cost, earliness penalties (holding cost), and lateness (or tardiness) penalties. The objective of this problem is to minimize the sum of weighted quoted lead times, weighted earliness, and weighted lateness of all jobs. We propose an on-line heuristic, partially characterize its performance relative to a first come, first served policy, and computationally test its performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Many multi-project {{organizations}} are capacity driven, {{which means that}} their operations are constrained by various scarce resources. An important planning aspect in a capacity driven multi-project organization is capacity planning. By capacity planning, we mean the problem of matching demand for resources and availability of resources for the medium term. Capacity planning is a very useful method to support important tactical decisions such as due <b>date</b> <b>quotation</b> and price quotation for new projects, and to gain an insight into capacity requirements for the medium term. We present a capacity planning model in which aspects such as capacity flexibility, precedence relations between work packages, and maximum work content per period can be taken into account. For this model, we discuss several linear-programming-based heuristics. Using a large set of test instances, we compare these heuristics with some results from the literature. It turns out {{that some of these}} heuristics are very powerful for solving capacity planning problem...|$|R

The proof now went to the printers for correction; they sent it again to the head reader, who carefully revised it and returned it again to me. I read it a second time, and it was again corrected. After this it was revised in the office and sent to the stereotyper, from whom it came to the head reader for a last revision in the plates.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{job shop}} {{scheduling}} research has previously {{assumed that the}} probability of the customer placing an order is always one, implying that customers will place orders regardless of lead times quoted from the producer and customer lead time expectations. As firms increasingly compete {{on the basis of}} the delivery speed and reputation, the relative performance of quoted versus actual realized lead times will have a strong effect on whether the customer will place future orders or not. Previous research has not considered differing customer requirements or the impact on the customer’s subjective assessment of the overall purchase performance and subsequently on customer satisfaction and repurchases intentions. This paper formally integrates concepts from operations management, marketing, and consumer decision theory into a single due date scheduling framework in order to model the antecedents and consequences of customer satisfaction. We use the results on dynamic priority queues to propose the new way of quoting due dates by explicitly considering the customers lead time requirements. Simulation experiments reveal that job shop policies and machine capacities have significant impact on customer satisfaction and subsequently, on net profit. Finally, we show that dynamic due <b>date</b> <b>quotation</b> policy performs significantly better than several other policies previously tested in the literature...|$|R

"In today's {{competitive}} market, {{companies that}} offer a high quality service at a reasonable cost, survive the competition. A major factor contributing to high service quality {{is the ability to}} meet customers’ demand with a short lead time. Short lead time and on time delivery are two conflicting objectives. A reasonable balance between these objectives is necessary. The published research works on due <b>date</b> <b>quotation</b> make restrictive assumptions regarding the production process, considering only the production lead time, ignoring suppliers lead times, and/or rejecting some orders. No model {{can be found in the}} literature that considers all of these characteristics simultaneously. The proposed research considers a system to which orders arrive over time. Every order has a desired range of delivery date as defined by the customer. We consider order cost of delay that represents the cost of quoting due dates greater than requested. A two phase model is considered that assumes that production is constrained by a supply process. At arrival, each order is to be assigned a due date based on the status of the system. The system status is affected by internal factors including the level of WIP as well as external factors such as the supplier process. The due dates are to be assigned so that company’s objectives, defined by customer satisfaction and retention are achieved. It is desired to accept all orders, and to maximize on-time delivery of orders without placing any restriction on the behavior of the production process. The comparative results indicate that the proposed procedure is effective in quoting minimum lead times to achieve a given level of customer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Increasing cost {{pressures}} {{have led}} supply chain managers {{to focus on}} running increasingly lean and efficient supply chains, with minimal inventory. Indeed, more and more firms are relying on pull or make-toorder (MTO) supply chains to minimize cost and waste. At the same time, increasing competitive pressures are leading to an increased emphasis on customer service. An important element of customer service, of course, is having make-to-stock (MTS) items in stock, and delivering make-to-order (MTO) products quickly and by the promised due date. In this project, we consider a variety of models designed to {{provide insight into the}} operation of combined MTS-MTO supply chains. We primarily focus on a simple stylized model of a two facility supply chain featuring a manufacturer served by a single supplier. Initially, we model a pure MTO supply, in which customers arrive at the manufacturer and place orders. The manufacturer needs to quote a due date to the customer when the order is placed, and the manufacturer needs to receive a component from the supplier before completing the manufacturing process. We design effective algorithms for production sequencing and due <b>date</b> <b>quotation</b> in both centralized and decentralized versions of this supply chain, characterize the theoretical properties of these algorithms, and compare the performance of the centralized and decentralized versions of the supply chain under various conditions. We also consider combined MTS-MTO versions of this supply chain. In these models, the manufacturer and supplier have to decide which items to produce to order, and which items to produce to stock. Inventory levels must be set for the MTS items, and due dates need to be quoted for the MTO items. In addition, sequencing decisions must be made. We consider several versions of these models, design effective algorithms to find inventory levels, to quote due dates, and to make sequencing decisions in both centralized and decentralized settings, and use these algorithms to assess the value of joint MTS-MTO systems, as well as the value of centralization under various conditions. Finally, we consider more complex supply networks...|$|R
6000|$|Herr Stahr's {{desire to}} make a hero of his subject, and his love for sonorous {{sentences}} like those we have quoted above, are apt to stand somewhat {{in the way of}} our chance at taking a fair measure of the man, and seeing in what his heroism really lay. He furnishes little material for a comparative estimate of Lessing, or for judging of the foreign influences which helped {{from time to time in}} making him what he was. Nothing is harder than to worry out a date from Herr Stahr's haystacks of praise and <b>quotation.</b> Yet <b>dates</b> are of special value in tracing the progress of an intellect like Lessing's, which, little actuated by an inward creative energy, was commonly stirred to motion by the impulse of other minds, and struck out its brightest flashes by collision with them. He himself tells us that a critic should [...] "first seek out some one with whom he can contend," [...] and quotes in justification from one of Aristotle's commentators, Solet Aristoteles quaerere pugnam in suis libris. This Lessing was always wont to do. He could only feel his own strength, and make others feel it,--could only call it into full play in an intellectual wrestling-bout. He was always anointed and ready for the ring, but with this distinction, that he was no mere prize-fighter, or bully for the side that would pay him best, nor even a contender for mere sentiment, but a self-forgetful champion for the truth as he saw it. Nor is this true of him only as a critic. His more purely imaginative works--his Minna, his Emilia, his Nathan--were all written, not to satisfy the craving of a poetic instinct, nor to rid head and heart of troublous guests by building them a lodging outside himself, as Goethe used to do, but to prove some thesis of criticism or morals by which Truth could be served. His zeal for her was perfectly unselfish. [...] "Does one write, then, for the sake of being always in the right? I think I have been as serviceable to Truth," [...] he says, [...] "when I miss her, and my failure is the occasion of another's discovering her, as if I had discovered her myself."[150] One would almost be inclined to think, from Herr Stahr's account of the matter, that Lessing had been an autochthonous birth of the German soil, without intellectual ancestry or helpful kindred. That this is the sufficient natural history of no original mind we need hardly say, since originality consists quite as much in the power of using to purpose what it finds ready to its hand, as in that of producing what is absolutely new. Perhaps we might say that it was nothing more than the faculty of combining the separate, and therefore ineffectual, conceptions of others, and making them into living thought by the breath of its own organizing spirit. A great man without a past, if he be not an impossibility, will certainly have no future. He would be like those conjectural Miltons and Cromwells of Gray's imaginary Hamlet. The only privilege of the original man is, that, like other sovereign princes, he has the right to call in the current coin and reissue it stamped with his own image, as was the practice of Lessing.|$|R
