50|$|The {{pressure}} release valve is often one {{of a variety of}} commercially available types such as a plumbing ball valve, an irrigation sprinkler valve or a <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to a single larger valve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Valve</b> (QEV): a {{commercial}} piston or diaphragm valve {{in a metal}} body intended for the quick venting of pneumatic cylinders. In spudgunning they are ideal barrel sealing valves with faster opening times than custom piston valves and high flow rates. They can be commonly found in sizes from ⅛ inch to 1½ inches (3-40 mm) and sometimes even larger models. It provides an easy option for inexperienced spud-gun builders but the cost is usually greater than for any other valve type.|$|E
50|$|When the Ion is fired, the air {{in front}} of the bolt that holds it back is drained back through the solenoid, which causes {{the air in}} the rear of the firing chamber to blow the bolt forward. In order to {{expedite}} the draining of air from the front of the bolt, many users add a <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (QEV) to their marker. The QEV replaces a fitting on the Ion's body and allows the draining air to vent into the body cavity instead of passing all the way back through the solenoid. By allowing the air to vent faster, this allows the bolt to close faster and with more force, which permits lower operating pressure and dwell (the time the solenoid valve is open). The QEV also acts as a trap for excess grease that might otherwise enter the solenoid and cause problems.|$|E
50|$|A {{piston valve}} can also {{refer to a}} 2-way 2-position, {{pilot-operated}} spool valve. The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back {{by the force of}} the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Furthermore, the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a <b>Quick</b> <b>Exhaust</b> <b>Valve,</b> or QEV and hose barb. The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R

50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{manufacturing}} {{process of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> in large marine diesel engines consists of an upset forging and final forming process. In the past, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in large marine diesel engines have been made through free forging by using the stretch forming method. This method has used the ingot and the billet as a preliminary forming process. Nimonic 80 A, a superalloy, is presently used for the material of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> For the forming method of the valve, the electric upset method is used. Solid bar is raised up to the forming temperature by using electric energy and is continually deformed by upset pressure. The electric upsetting processing is a useful method for the high quality of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in large marine diesel engines. It can keep the continuous grain flow, excellent mechanical property, and corrosion resistance because of the elaborate macrostructure of the valve face. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to predict the optimum process condition through simulation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> with a diameter of 73 mm.
