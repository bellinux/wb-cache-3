5|$|Generally {{grown as}} a hardy annual, lettuce is easily cultivated, {{although}} it requires relatively low temperatures {{to prevent it}} from flowering <b>quickly.</b> <b>It</b> can be plagued by numerous nutrient deficiencies, as well as insect and mammal pests, and fungal and bacterial diseases. L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus. Although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds, biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move <b>quickly,</b> <b>it</b> is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may be accompanied by audible hissing.|$|E

The route would help develop the waterfront areas in Staten Island and Jamaica Bay.

5|$|The most {{important}} form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing stelae erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and sunken relief. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone {{and when the}} builders wanted to finish <b>quickly.</b> <b>It</b> was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors. In some cases, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or faience substituted for paint.|$|E

5|$|The new {{island was}} named after Surtr, a fire jötunn or giant from Norse mythology. It was intensively studied by volcanologists during its eruption, and {{afterwards}} by botanists and other biologists as life forms gradually colonised the originally barren island. The undersea vents that produced Surtsey {{are part of the}} Vestmannaeyjar submarine volcanic system, part of the fissure of the sea floor called the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Vestmannaeyjar also produced the famous eruption of Eldfell on the island of Heimaey in 1973. The eruption that created Surtsey also created a few other small islands along this volcanic chain, such as Jólnir and unnamed other peaks. Most of these eroded away fairly <b>quickly.</b> <b>It</b> is estimated that Surtsey will remain above sea level for another 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, the {{weakening}} trend stopped, as the steering winds {{came from the}} same direction behind the hurricane. It slowed down slightly, and on September 26 the eye of the hurricane became much more distinct. Humberto quickly re-intensified and reached peak winds of 105mph (170km/h), while located about 200 miles (320km) south-southeast of Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia. Just as <b>quickly</b> <b>it</b> strengthened, the hurricane began weakening again. The eye became distorted as the convection became asymmetrical, due to the cooler waters and stronger westerlies. Initially, the NHC forecast Humberto to become extratropical. On September 27, it turned more eastward and later to the east-southeast, and Humberto weakening to tropical storm status about 400 miles (645km) southeast of Newfoundland. The cloud pattern became increasingly elongated and removed from the center, and late on the 27th, the circulation of Humberto degenerated into an open trough in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. The remnants were expected to be absorbed quickly by a larger extratropical storm to its north.|$|E
5|$|While {{some aspects}} of {{cooperation}} resumed <b>quickly,</b> <b>it</b> took longer to finalize the details {{with respect to the}} Montreal Laboratory. Brigadier General Leslie Groves (the director of the Manhattan Project), Chadwick (now the head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project), and Mackenzie negotiated recommendations, which were approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 13 April 1944. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium or plutonium chemistry, although irradiated uranium slugs would be made available for the British to work it out for themselves. The Americans had already built their own heavy water reactor, Chicago Pile-3, which went critical in May 1944. The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.|$|E
