This paper investigates the impact of electoral manipulation of the level and composition of fiscal policy on incumbent’s re-election prospects.

40|$|As {{theoretical}} and empirical studies show, {{the size of the}} public sector in itself has little effect on growth and employment. Of greater relevance is the structure of government revenue and spending. Taxes and charges on labour are distinctly more detrimental to growth and employment than those levied on capital gains and property. The tax burden on labour well exceeds the EU average and keeps increasing. Shifting taxes away from labour and more towards environmentally harmful activities and capital stock would promote growth and employment. Spending on education, investments and R&D is particularly liable to strengthen economic growth. In order to increase the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> in its effect on growth, the emphasis should be on strengthening spending on the above future-proof sectors as well as a more efficient allocation of public funds by way of structural reforms in the public sector.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{elections}} on the level and composition of fiscal instruments using a sample of 19 high-income OECD countries that {{can be characterized as}} developed, established democracies during the period 1972 - 1999. We find that elections shift public spending towards current and away from capital expenditures. Moreover, although we find no evidence for an electoral cycle for government deficit and expenditures, we do find a negative effect of elections on revenue. Our results indicate that the fall in revenue in election periods is attributed to a fall in direct taxation. The decomposition of our electoral dummy suggests that fiscal manipulation seems to be concentrated shortly before the elections. Finally, when we distinguish among predetermined and endogenous elections we find that the above results apply only for the predetermined electoral periods while endogenous elections seem to increase the budget deficit and to leave the composition of fiscal policy unaffected. political budget cycles, elections, composition of fiscal policy, <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure...</b>|$|E

Our empirical method is based on a consistent treatment of the government budget constraint, and we try to disentangle the effects of different spending and taxation items. As far as public spending is concerned, our results strongly suggest that capital expenditures are associated with higher profits, while expenditures on wages and salaries deteriorate profits. At the same time our results indicate that transport and communication expenditures increase profits, while the opposite holds for defense expenditures. On the revenue side, both direct and indirect taxation tend to decrease profits. However, a more detailed sub-division of direct taxation indicates that social security contributions have a neutral effect on profits. fiscal policy, profits, <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure...</b>|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify key factors that explain the observed wide variation in patterns of inclusiveness of economic growth - defined here as gross domestic product (GDP) growth that leads to significant poverty reduction - in Asia. In exploring this relationship, this study goes beyond defining poverty by the income or expenditure yardstick alone, but examines a more holistic measure of poverty that considers its multidimensional nature. Factors that influence the degree of poverty reduction that accompanies economic growth (herein referred to as the poverty elasticity of growth or PEG) include the sectoral composition of the economy and its growth; the nature, size, and pattern <b>of</b> <b>public</b> investments (particularly on social services and agriculture); and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> governance. As construction of a consistent panel data set was beyond the time constraints for the study, PEG is calculated for Asian countries as an arc elasticity over the 1990 - 1996 and 2000 - 2006 periods, and analyzed against available measures of the above-named factors from statistics compiled by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Pairwise analyses using scatterplots, simple regressions, and multiple regressions were employed to determine systematic relationships between the PEG and its likely determinants. Results affirmed the significant impact <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> governance, <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> on social services, and contribution of agriculture to GDP growth, in that order of importance. There is likewise evidence that manufacturing growth has had a bearing on the inclusiveness of growth, especially in Southeast Asia in recent years. Results of the analysis also showed how dramatic differences in characterization of countries can result when a multidimensional poverty measure is employed rather than a unidimensional one based only on income or expenditure.

40|$|The need {{to achieve}} the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has raised the profile of social sector {{investments}} in Africa and other developing countries. As a result, many African countries are pressured to emphasize short-term concerns related to the symptoms of poverty {{at the expense of}} the longer-term needs to raise productivity and incomes, and thereby tackle the real roots of poverty. Because of scarce budget resources, there is a major challenge for African governments in terms of ensuring the necessary consistency of policies and strategies to promote long-term economic growth, raise smallholder productivity, achieve food security, and reduce poverty, while providing the social services that respond to immediate welfare requirements. The main objective of the convergence agenda exposed in this paper is to identify strategies that would allow developing countries to improve the management <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> so as to raise the chances of meeting the income growth and social needs of their populations under tight budget constraints. In this paper we have (1) discussed the terminology used in describing the problem being studied and formulated the assumptions and hypotheses underlying the research; (2) defined a typology of growth–poverty pathways; (3) developed metrics to measure the strength of the relationship between growth and poverty reduction; (4) laid out the theory for the measurement of the degree <b>of</b> convergence <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> on social services, that is, the extent to which they are optimized with respect to their impact on labor productivity and growth; and (5) outlined models for (a) the quantification of social services availability at the local level using a single-score concept, (b) the evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>quality</b> and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> in social services sectors in rural areas, and (c) the optimization <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> allocation to maximize the impact on growth and poverty reduction; as well as (6) provided initial evidence proving the validity of the theory of convergence.

In the quest to attain this aim the paper empirically focuses on the significance of mapping {{the performance}} of the sector in the form of trends against the baseline sectoral performance targets enlisted in the ASWAP, CAADP Framework and SADC RISDP. The consistent and concerted efforts by the Government of Malawi and development partners to meet the ASWAP, CAADP framework and SADC RISDP targets have resulted in the country making commendable economic growth and poverty alleviation. The country has been able to attain the 6 % agricultural growth target despite the questionable <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>expenditure.</b> It is also interesting to note that changes in the agriculture sector appear to have had influence on incomes, poverty and malnourishment. The trend analysis led to the following findings; the growth in agricultural GDP and the annual GDP growth of the country surpassed the CAADP target of 6 % annual growth and this culminated to an increase in production (cereal and livestock production) and productivity (land productivity) {{despite the fact that the}} country has not met the irrigation and fertiliser used targets. This increase in production and productivity may be earnestly attributed substantially public invested in the agriculture sector to meet the CAADP 10 % target of the total budget to agriculture. However, this increase in agricultural GDP annual growth has not had a significant bearing on the country’s battle to offset poverty; the country’s GHI is still serious and the proportion of the population below the minimum dietary energy consumption is still high (23 % on average) whilst the MDG I target stands at 20 %.
