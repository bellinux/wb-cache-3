Intercritical treatments were performed on samples with composition A by 1) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour cooling in air, then treating at 770 °C for 30 minutes before oil quenching; 2) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil,</b> then treating at 770 °C for 30 minutes before quenching in oil; and 3) austenitizing at 860 °C for 1 hour, super-cooling to 770 °C and then <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil.</b> Samples of composition B were subjected to intercritical treatment at temperatures of 740, 760, and 780 °C for 30 minutes, followed by quenching rapidly in oil. Tensile testing was then performed on specimens without notches and the CNT specimens. It was observed that the dual phase steel produced from procedure (2) yielded a fine distribution of ferrite and martensite which gave the best combination of tensile properties and fracture toughness for composition A while the dual phase structure produced by treating at 760 °C yielded the best combination of tensile properties and fracture toughness for composition B.

Design/methodology/approach - Specimens, quenched on air, <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> and <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> and then tempered, were tested during exposure in 0. 1 ?M H 2 SO 4 at 30, 40 and 50 °C. The results were interpreted on the base of potentiodynamic and impedance measurements. Findings - From the impedance spectra a reaction mechanism can be determined: after samples had reached and passed the active peak, expressed as the highestpeak on the potentiodynamic curve, corrosion products at interfaces, which were adsorbed at metal surface, led to an increase in the charge transfer resistance. Elevated temperature of immersion media has had appreciable influence on the corrosion rate and adsorption of products, but atthis temperature level did not affect the principle of corrosion reactions. Activation energies were calculated to exhibit temperature dependence of current density, which was the highest for the oil- and the lowest for the air-quenched sample.

40|$|Mild steels {{are often}} {{employed}} in high volume of screw machine parts such as shafts, spindles, pins, rods and varieties of component parts where high hardness is required. Although mild steel provides various advantages such as ease of formability, machinability and weldability {{but it is}} unimpressive {{in terms of strength}} and hardness. The most common problem encountered is the short tool life. Hence, the ability to make mild steels hard enough to be the tools that shape all other material is important. Mild steel ability to be hardened is produced in heat treatment and quenching process.

Creep-rupture testing at 593 C and 207 MPa shows that FA- 180 has a rupture life of approximately 100 h in the warm-rolled and stress relieved (1 h at 700 - 750 C) condition as compared to about 20 h for the FA- 129 base alloy (Fe- 28 Al- 5 Cr- 0. 5 Nb- 0. 2 C). This report summarizes studies conducted {{in the last several years}} to determine the creep-rupture resistance of FA- 180 as a function of the microstructures produced by varying the heat treatment temperature and cooling procedures. Solution-annealing for 1 h at 1150 C (air cooled) dramatically improved the creep-rupture life of FA- 180 to about 2000 h. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed that this strengthening was due to the precipitation of fine ZrC in the matrix and along grain boundaries. A further improvement in creep-rupture life to over 6000 h resulted from increasing the cooling rate (by <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> or water) after solution annealing at 1150 C.

50|$|To harden by quenching, a metal (usually {{steel or}} cast iron) must be heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature {{and then quickly}} cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why high-tensile steels such as AISI 4140 should be <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil,</b> tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 {{hot work tool steel}} should be <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> brine.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{austenitising}} and tempering {{practice on the}} microstructure and mechanical properties of two martensitic stainless steels was examined {{with the aim of}} supplying heat treatment guidelines to the consumer or fabricator that, if followed, would result in a martensitic structure with minimal retained austenite, evenly dispersed carbides and a hardness of between 610 HV and 740 HV (hardness on the Vickers scale) after quenching and tempering. The steels examined {{during the course of this}} examination conform in composition to medium-carbon AISI type 420 martensitic stainless steel, except for the addition of 0. 13 % vanadium and 0. 62 % molybdenum to one of the alloys. The effect of various austenitising and tempering heat treatments was examined. Steel samples were austenitised at temperatures between 1000 °C and 1200 °C, followed by <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil.</b> The as-quenched microstructures were found to range from almost fully martensitic structures to martensite with up to 35 % retained austenite after quenching, with varying amounts of carbide precipitates. The influence of tempering, double tempering, and sub-zero treatment was investigated. Optical and scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the as-quenched microstructures, and X-ray diffraction analysis was employed to identify the carbide present in the as-quenched structures and to quantify the retained austenite contents. Hardness tests were performed to determine the effect of heat treatment on mechanical properties. As-quenched hardness values ranged from 700 HV to 270 HV, depending on the amount of retained austenite. Thermodynamic predictions (using the CALPHAD™ model) were used to explain these microstructures based on the solubility of the carbide particles in the matrix at various austenitising temperatures. The carbide particles were found to be mainly in the form of M 7 C 3 at elevated temperatures, transforming to M 23 C 6 on cooling. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of {{high strength}} {{ductile cast iron}} produced by a quenching and partitioning process (Q&P) is evaluated. The Q&P process is receiving increased attention as {{a new way to}} produce ultra-high strength steels with multiphase microstructures composed of a martensite matrix and substantial amounts of carbon-stabilized retained austenite. Currently, the mechanical properties arising from applying the Q&P process in ductile cast irons have not been investigated. Thermal treatments consisted of heating the material to 880 °C for a 2 hour soaking time followed by <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> at 140 °C and 170 °C, intermediate temperatures between Ms and Mf allowing the formation of a controlled amount of athermal martensite. The material was reheated to 300 °C and 375 °C (the partition treatment) for different times between 15 and 120 minutes and subsequently air-cooled to room temperature. Microstructural evolution and carbon partitioning was investigated by in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. With a microstructure composed of tempered martensite, bainitic ferrite and carbon-enriched stabilized austenite, a new class of properties was obtained, with an enhanced strength when compared to ADI (austempered ductile iron) while still maintaining reasonable elongation. Fatigue testing was undertaken using polished plain bend bars (no stress concentration features) assessed under four-point bending. Uninterrupted tests at varying loads show that the higher partitioning temperature is beneficial for fatigue life. Fracture initiation sites are primarily from pores and a number of decohered graphite nodules. A strong influence of the microstructure on subsequent fatigue crack growth is observed from interrupted testing with replica records and SEM examination of tested samples, with cracks exhibiting significant tortuosity, at times even appearing to grow approximately parallel to the tensile axis. Using these results, the effects of the Q&P treatment, particularly the role of the partitioning time and temperature, on the fatigue properties of ductile cast iron are assessed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{practice}} of tempering for stress relief before cryogenic thermal treatment in an AISI D 2 tool steel {{has been shown}} to stabilize the retained austenite, nullifying the effect of cryogenic treatment The practice simultaneously enhances the wear resistance of the steel after complete thermal cycling (quench + stress relief + cryogenic treatment + double temper). Cryogenic treatment {{has been shown to}} have a large effect on the properties of heat treated steels, especially tool steels. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of some parts it is necessary to do a prior stress relief heat treatment to avoid cracks and catastrophic failures. In previous work [1] it was verified that the stress relief treatment stabilizes the austenite even when the sample is submerged in liquid nitrogen. The literature [2] suggests that there is a C-curve kinetic behavior for the austenite to martensite transformation at temperatures lower than Ms. In order to confirm those previous work results[1] and test the hypothesis of a C-curve behavior, samples from an AISI D 2 tool steel bar were austenitized at 1040 °C for 40 minutes and then <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>oil.</b> Half of the samples were submitted to a stress relief treatment at 130 °C for 90 minutes in order to enable comparison between samples with and without stress relief.

40|$|Abstract:- Heat flux densities {{and heat}} {{transfer}} coefficients {{on the basis}} of solving inverse problem of Tikhonov method have been investigated. It is established that the less diameter of cylindrical sample the higher heat flux density during nucleate boiling and higher heat transfer coefficient. During nucleate boiling and convection one can use average values of heat transfer coefficients. It is established that Kondratjev numbers including average heat transfer coefficients during nucleate boiling are changing very slowly with the changing diameter of samples. Using this regularities one can propose express method of calculations. A new technology of <b>quenching</b> steel parts <b>in</b> <b>oils</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The high {{requirements}} {{in terms of}} thermal and structural stresses for the modern technological applications pointed out {{the need for a}} detailed knowledge of the manufacturing processes utilized to produce more durable materials. The quenching process is one of these treatments, a rapid cooling utilized to obtain harder metal components. In the last years, research efforts about this process have allowed to develop methods to predict the heat transfer coefficients. The first part of the present work consists into the application of literature correlations, with water and oil as quenching mediums, to different geometries. The objective is to estimate the heat transfer behavior during the thermal process. Then, a numerical model with these thermal transient features has been implemented to simulate the <b>quenching</b> process <b>in</b> <b>oil</b> for a cylinder made of INCONEL 600. Finally, mesh sensitivity has been carried out, in order to evaluate how cell thickness influences the accuracy of the cooling rate curve...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The {{mechanical}} properties of a {{medium carbon steel}} of known composition after been subjected to various quenching media at various inter- critical temperatures were evaluated. The microstructures obtained were used to explain the results. Tensile test specimens were produced from the medium carbon steel, {{which was in the}} as- rolled condition. Samples were <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> water, distilled water and palm kernel oil respectively after been allowed to attain the following inter- critical temperatures 7600 c, 7700 c, 7800 c, 7900 c, 8000 c. After each treatment, the {{mechanical properties}} and microstructures of each specimen were evaluated. Samples <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> water and distilled water were observed to produce martensitic structures in ferrite matrix, just that the grains observed in the distilled water quenched samples were fine and hence responsible for the higher strength and hardness values. While the samples <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> palm kernel <b>oil</b> were observed to produce higher level of bainite in ferrite at the grain boundaries. These results therefore implies that for higher strength and hardness value, samples are recommended to be <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> distilled water, while for strength and toughness palm kernel oil will be the best...|$|R
50|$|After casting, the cores {{are broken}} up by rods or shot and {{removed from the}} casting. The metal from the sprue and risers is cut from the rough casting. Various heat {{treatments}} may be applied to relieve stresses from the initial cooling and to add hardness - {{in the case of}} steel or iron, by <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> water or <b>oil.</b> The casting may be further strengthened by surface compression treatment - like shot peening - that adds resistance to tensile cracking and smooths the rough surface. And when high precision is required, various machining operations (such as milling or boring) are made to finish critical areas of the casting. Examples of this would include the boring of cylinders and milling of the deck on a cast engine block.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A hollow {{cylinder}} of a chromium–molybdenum steel composed of 0. 20 mass % C {{was used as}} a model that simplified a motorcycle transmission gear. The cylinder was carburized in a carrier gas and <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> an <b>oil</b> bath. After quenching, the internal residual strain and peak width distributions in the radial, hoop, and axial directions were nondestructively mapped by neutron strain scanning, and were compared to the results of an elastoplastic finite element analysis. The carbon content and hardness gradients were also measured to determine the case depth. The residual strain was evaluated from the lattice spacing change. The lattice spacing change was obtained from the peak shift from an unstressed peak position. In this study, the unstressed peak position was determined using coupons that were cut from the interior of the same quenched cylinder. As a result, the carbon content, hardness, and internal residual strain distributions almost accorded with the results of finite element analysis. Although the measured residual hoop strains near the hardened layer partially deviated from the analyzed weighted average strains, the validity of the internal strain field measured by neutron strain scanning was confirmed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{results of}} {{experiments}} {{to monitor the}} build up of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) <b>in</b> <b>quench</b> <b>oils</b> during use are presented. Oils from four quenching baths at three heat treatment companies were sampled at intervals over periods of 6 - 18 months.

The oils were analysed quantitatively for PAH to observe any changes in concentrations during use and to relate operating conditions to PAH levels. The expected increase of PAH over time was not observed and possible explanations for this are discussed. Crown copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
50|$|Woodturning tools must be {{sharpened}} {{more frequently}} than other edged woodworking tools to maintain a clean cut because the wood passes at great speed. Sharpening is usually accomplished {{with the aid of}} mechanical devices such as powered sharpening wheels and abrasives. This sharpening process requires either skill of the craftsman, or one of the many available sharpening jigs, which facilitate maintaining a specific bevel on the tool. As with any mechanical sharpening method, overheating or blueing is a danger to be avoided as it will ruin the steel's temper, rendering the steel too soft to maintain a sharp edge. When this happens, the blued area must then be ground away to expose fresh steel and the tool must then have the bevel reestablished and the edge re-honed. High speed steel is not prone to blueing (overheating) whereas carbon steel blues easily, requiring frequent <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> water or <b>oil</b> to avoid losing temper.|$|R
40|$|The dual matrix {{structured}} {{ductile iron}} {{consists of a}} soft phase(ferrite) and a hard phase(martensite). The combination of soft and hard phase increases the toughness and strength significantly and meets the requirement of automotive industries for their application in suspension parts. This investigation relates the variation of mechanical properties of dual matrix structured ductile iron with different ferrite and martensite volume fraction as the microstructure and amount of distribution of these phases control the mechanical properties. The DMS ductile iron was obtained by heating the as cast ductile iron to intercritical austenizing temperature of 800 °C then holding for 2 mins and followed by <b>quenching</b> <b>in</b> mineral <b>oil.</b> The ferrite and martensite volume fraction was calculated by image analysing software. The effect of ferrite and martensite volume fraction on tensile strength,yield strength and percentage elongation was studied. In this investigation {{it was found that}} the Ultimate tensile strength increases and ductility decreases with the increase in martensite volume fraction and decrease in ferrite volume fraction. The dual matrix structured ductile iron with higher volume fraction of martensite results in higher tensile strength and hardness and reduction in ductility. And subsequently the DMS ductile iron with higher ferrite volume fraction results increase of ductility and decrease of hardness and tensile strength. The ultimate tensile stress of DMS ductile iron is much higher than ferritic grades and ductility is somewhat lower than ferritic grade of ductile iron...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} cooling rate of cane {{molasses}} as quenching medium for 0. 61 % C {{high carbon steels}} was investigated. Samples of high carbon steel were spheroidized annealed and then machined prior to the hardening process. Molasses solution of viscosity equals to that of engine oil was prepared by adding water. The samples were normalized and then austenitised at 800 oC and soaked for 40 minutes and then <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> water, engine <b>oil,</b> raw molasses and the prepared molasses solution. Cooling rate curves of all the quenching media used were developed. The highest cooling rate of 60 oC/s was attained by the prepared molasses solution. Hardness of the test samples was evaluated. The test results obtained show that the highest hardness value (525 HVN) {{was obtained from the}} sample <b>quenched</b> <b>in</b> the prepared molasses solution. Microstructures of the various samples were analyzed using OM and SEM. In all the tests samples martensite structure was observed. It was observed that the prepared molasses solution has higher severity of quenching than that of engine oil but lower than that of water. The research showed that cane molasses can harden high carbon steel without cracking the component {{in the same way as}} engine oil, hence, molasses could be a very good alternative to engine oil for use as quenching medium...|$|R
