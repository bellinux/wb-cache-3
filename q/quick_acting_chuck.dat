40|$|Modern {{breeding}} has focussed on producing {{plants that}} perform {{well in a}} monoculture; {{they are designed to}} interfere minimally with their neighbours under high fertility conditions, where all ameliorable factors are controlled. The aim of this design is to provide a crop community that makes best use of light supply to the best advantage of grain production. Wheat is the most developed example of this approach - with a high proportion of seminal roots, erect leaves, large ears and a relatively dwarf structure - but all other cereal breeding follows it. This 'pedigree line for monoculture' approach is highly successful but it has delivered crop communities that do best where light is the only, or the main, limiting factor for productivity.

METHODS: repeat, in-depth interviews with 30 {{type 1 diabetes}} patients converted to FIIT recruited from Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) courses in the UK. Data were analysed using an inductive, thematic approach. RESULTS: despite the potential of FIIT to enable greater dietary flexibility and freedom, most patients reported food and eating practices which were remarkably resistant to change. In some cases, FIIT adoption resulted in greater dietary rigidity over time. The opportunities FIIT presented for greater dietary freedom were counterbalanced by new challenges and burdens (e. g. having to simplify food choices to make carbohydrate estimation easier).

Pre-ejection period index (PEPI) shortened significantly (P less than 0. 01) after peruvoside in normal subjects and in patients with myocardial failure, but not in constrictive pericarditis. Likewise the predicted ejection fraction was insignificantly altered in constrictive pericarditis but significantly so (P less than 0. 01) in myocardial failure and normal subjects. The response of one patient with constrictive pericarditis to parenteral peruvoside administration was similar to that seen in patients with myocardial failure. This patient had a delayed recovery after pericardiectomy. PEPI/LVETI ratio and ejection fraction were also abnormal in other patients with constrictive pericarditis when compared to normal subjects. Such abnormalities and the unusual response of some patients to administration of peruvoside may reflect underlying myocardial dysfunction in patients with constrictive pericarditis.

40|$|Background: Intravenous {{cannulation}} is {{a painful}} procedure that can provoke anxiety and stress. Injecting local anaesthetic can provide analgesia {{at the time}} of cannulation, but it is a painful procedure. Topical anaesthetic creams take between 30 and 90 minutes to produce an effect. A <b>quicker</b> <b>acting</b> analgesic allows more timely investigation and treatment. Vapocoolants have been used in this setting, but studies have reported mixed results. Objectives: To determine effects of vapocoolants on pain associated with intravenous cannulation in adults and children. To explore variables that might affect the performance of vapocoolants, including time required for application, distance from the skin when applied and time to cannulation. To look at adverse effects {{associated with the use of}} vapocoolants. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science and the [URL] [URL] and [URL] databases to 1 May 2015. We applied no language restrictions. We also scanned the reference lists of included papers. Selection criteria: We included all blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RTCs) comparing any vapocoolant with placebo or control to reduce pain during intravenous cannulation in adults and children. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, contacted study authors for additional information and assessed included studies for risk of bias. We collected and analysed data for the primary outcome of pain during cannulation, and for the secondary outcomes of pain associated with application of the vapocoolant, first attempt success rate of intravenous cannulation, adverse events and participant satisfaction. We performed subgroup analyses for the primary outcome to examine differences based on age of participant, type of vapocoolant used, application time of vapocoolant and clinical situation (emergency vs elective). We used random-effects model meta-analysis in RevMan 5. 3 and assessed heterogeneity between trial results by examining forest plots and calculating the I statistic.

40|$|Development of a {{predictive}} octane {{model is}} a potentially useful tool for designing fuel blends for meeting octane specifications. One of the approaches adopted is through chemical kinetic modelling of the autoignition properties of constituent compounds. The results obtained from models, however, are dependent on experimental data for validation. It was the intention of this thesis to provide empirical data {{that could be used}} confirm a recently proposed autoignition model based upon the results obtained from chemical kinetics modelling. Motored engines have been used extensively for the investigation of autoignition properties of fuels. They are useful in interpreting results from conventional ignition delay measuring systems as well as giving practical insight into the process of autoignition in spark ignition engines. The conditions required for autoignition reactions to take place are easily produced in a motored engine with a suitable compression ratio. A single cylinder engine was modified so that the inlet conditions could be adjusted and n-heptane was tested in the device. Fuelling was controlled with an injection system which was calibrated for n-heptane use in the engine. A range of inlet conditions were determined that would enable peak conditions in the engine to result in autoignition of the fuel. The autoignition data was then used in describing the ignition delay characteristics of the fuel and the range of interest, the so called negative temperature coefficient region. Autoignition experiments were performed in the engine and the data was analysed by the comparison of measured autoignition reactions with predicted reaction times; the predictions were calculated using the new empirical autoignition model. Direct analysis of the model resulted in good correlation of measured and predicted overall autoignition reaction times, with improved correlation of cool flame reaction times with initial temperature adjustment. Modification of initial temperature values in the indirect model application (whereby traces were generated using an engine model with autoignition prediction capabilities) resulted in similar observances. These initial results led {{to the conclusion that the}} temperature and Arrhenius parameter adjustments necessary to obtain a perfect fit in the autoignition model were indicative of errors involved in the temperature measurement or in the fuel metering. Recommendations for further work on the engine would be the investigation of a dynamometer system that would be free from noise transmission during operation and that would enable experimentation with lower engine speeds. Further work on the inlet system would be the installation of shielded thermocouples and a <b>quicker</b> <b>acting</b> heater controller. A fundamental change in fuel metering calibration is required. Further recommendation is that a variable compression ratio engine should be used to enable the attainment of a wider range of readings for fuel characterisation and possibly eradicate the problems experienced with fuelling...|$|R
40|$|A {{fluidised}} bed boiler ash, {{produced by the}} New Zealand Dairy Corporation (NZDC FBA) as a by-product resulting from the combined combustion of high S coal and limestone, was chemically characterised and evaluated as a potential liming material, soil conditioner and S source in some representative New Zealand soils. Chemical analysis showed that slaked NZDC FBA had a pHwater of 12. 4 and CaCO 3 equivalent of 51. 8 %. The "lime" in FBA is mainly Ca(OH) 2, making it a <b>quicker</b> <b>acting,</b> more caustic material than limestone. FBA contained 6. 2 % S, 25. 4 % Ca (dry weight basis) and negligible amounts of P, K and Mg. Mineralogical analysis indicated that approximately 50 % of the S in the slaked FBA is gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) with the remainder being water insoluble ettringite (Ca 6 Al 2 (SO 4) 3 (OH) 12. 26 H 2 O). A field trial was established on a permanent dairy pasture (predominantly ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens)) on peat soil, in Moanatuatua peatland, Waikato, New Zealand, to examine the effectiveness of FBA as a soil conditioner to overcome soil water repellency, a liming material and a S source. The treatments included the untreated control and three rates of FBA (1000, 6616 and 26462 kg FBA ha- 1, wet weight basis), which were surface dressed onto the pasture. Three rates of lime, which had the same CaCO 3 equivalent as the corresponding rates of FBA, were included for comparison. Using the molarity of ethanol droplet (MED) test, the air dried peat soil sampled in summer was classified as severely water repellent (MED > 2. 2). Fatty acids were identified as the fraction most responsible for the repellent character of the peat soil. Only the high rate (26462 kg ha- 1) of FBA significantly reduced water repellency of surface peat soil and increased the rate of water infiltration into the dry peat. The hydrophobic nature of the peat soil was probably modified by the high alkalinity of applied FBA, which removed or saponified fatty acids from the soil particle surface. However, normal liming and fertiliser rates (6616 kg ha- 1 or less) of FBA application, {{as well as all}} the lime treatments, had negligible effect on the water repellency of the peat soil. Therefore, it is not practical to use FBA as an amendment to minimise water repellency on peat soil. The FBA treatments significantly increased pasture yield, in the field trial during eight months of the experimental period, mainly by improving herbage S nutrition status. In spring, the S concentrations in herbage from the FBA treatments were raised from a deficient level of 0. 20 % S (the untreated control) to 0. 27 - 0. 40 % S. The ettringite-sulphate in FBA acted as a slow-release S fertiliser and high rates of FBA application maintained the raised S concentrations in the herbage for the eight month period. The presence of ettringite implies that application of FBA-sulphate has the potential to reduce the leaching loss of sulphate, a common problem in many New Zealand soils. In a laboratory incubation and leaching study using repacked peat soil cores, the effect of surface applied FBA and lime on base and solute movement in soil was investigated. The results indicated that FBA was an effective alternative to agricultural lime to neutralise the acidity of peat soil. Although surface-applied FBA had no significant effect on decreasing subsurface soil acidity as measured by pH change in the peat soil, the Ca 2 + ions released by FBA dissolution moved down to subsurface soil much faster than those released from lime. Increased Ca 2 + ion concentration in subsurface soil can alleviate the acidity constraints on pasture root growth through the antagonistic relationship between Ca 2 + and H+ ions. In contrast to the lime treatment, however, FBA caused significant leaching of native soil exchangeable K+. Therefore, K fertilisers should accompany FBA application to peat soils. In order to examine the effect of topsoil incorporated FBA on the subsurface acidity in mineral soils, six acidic topsoils (0 - 100 mm) were tested for their ability to "self-lime" through sulphate sorption from gypsum treatment. Two soils, from the yellow-brown loam, or Allophanic soil (the Patua soil) and the yellow-brown earth, or Ultic soil (the Kaawa soil) groups (orders), which contrasted strongly in their reaction to gypsum treatment, were chosen for further study. Lime, FBA and Flue gas desulphurisation gypsum (FGDG) were incorporated in the top 0 - 50 mm of repacked columns of the Patua and Kaawa soils, at rates containing Ca equivalent to 5000 kg ha- 1 of CaCO 3. Each column was leached with 400 mm of water. After leaching, one set of the columns were sliced into sections for chemical analysis, and another set was used for growing lucerne (Medicago sativa. L) as a root bioassay. In the columns of the variable charged, allophanic Patua soil, topsoil incorporated NZDC FBA ameliorated top and subsurface soil acidity through liming and the "self-liming effect" induced by sulphate sorption, respectively. The soil solution pH of the top and subsurface layers of the Patua soil were raised to pH 6. 40 and 5. 35 respectively, by the FBA treatment, compared with pH 4. 80 and 4. 65 in the control treatment. Consequently phytotoxic labile monomeric Al concentration in soil solution of the FBA treatment was reduced to less than 0. 1 µmol Al dm- 3, compared with that of 8 - 64 µmol Al dm- 3 in the untreated control. These changes were associated with greatly improved lucerne root growth in the subsurface of the Patua soil after FBA treatment. FGDG had a similar "self-liming effect" on subsurface of the Patua soil, but not the topsoil. Whereas FBA raised the pH of the Kaawa topsoil, no "self-liming effect" of subsurface soil by sulphate sorption was observed on the Kaawa soil, which is dominated by permanently charged clay minerals. Application of FBA and FGDG to both soils, however, caused significant leaching of native soil Mg 2 + and K+. These nutrients were displaced from the exchange sites by the relatively high concentration of Ca 2 + released from dissolution of gypsum. In contrast, the topsoil incorporated lime had little effect on either the subsurface soil acidity or nutrient leaching. NZDC FBA is an ideal by-product for correcting topsoil and subsurface soil acidity in yellow-brown loam (allophanic) soils, but only topsoil acidity on yellow-brown earth (Ultic) soils, dominated by clays with permanent charge. Mg and K fertiliser application would be recommended when a soil is treated with FBA or other gypsiferous materials...|$|R
