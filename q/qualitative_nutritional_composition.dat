In this study qualitative and quantitative data derived from interviews of producers and expert users are used to estimate the influence of Parkia biglobosa management practises, soumbala product processing practises, and <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of soumbala on perceived soumbala quality. Several variables on management practises correlated with high quality soumbala as revealed by binary logistic regression, with quality as the dependent variable and six management related variables as independent variables. Variables relating to product processing were examined using qualitative data from group sessions, gathering all the producers in a given village. Finally the relationship between <b>nutritional</b> <b>compositions</b> and soumbala quality was determined.

Food labelling is an important tool that provides information on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> data to consumers. However, the information on bio-accessibility values is limited; therefore, the aim of the present study is to promote the nutritional labelling by the inclusion of bio-accessibility values of micronutrients of importance along with <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> data. Commercial supplements commonly used for disease specific conditions were selected and their iron bio-accessibility was determined by equilibrium dialysis involving an in-vitro simulated digestion procedure. The formulations were also subjected to <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> analysis and functional properties by standard AOAC methods. The total iron content of the supplements ranged between 8. 66 ± 0. 5 mg / 100 g to 21. 72 ± 1. 44 mg / 100 g whereas the bio-accessibility of micronutrient iron ranged between 0. 05 ± 0. 01 mg / 100 g to 0. 32 ± 0. 20 mg / 100 g. The per cent iron bio-accessibility was also determined and ranged between 0. 23 - 2. 52 per cent. Inclusion of bio-accessibility values of vital micronutrients along with usual <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> data will serve as an effective tool to combat various micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore, prescription of supplements with higher bio availability may result in usage of lower doses of iron with fewer side effects, thus improving treatment efficacy.

40|$|AbstractFrugivorous animals play a {{major role}} in {{dispersing}} tropical, and to a lesser extent, temperate tree species. In order to attract potential seed dispersers, plants generally offer a reward of fleshy fruit pulp. Criteria for fruit choice by avian frugivores are influenced by a number of non-nutritive (e. g. fruit size and colour) factors; and <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of the fruit. There is a paucity of <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> and other fruit trait data of indigenous South African fruit. This information is necessary in order to determine which frugivores are likely to ingest which fruits and consequently act as potential seed dispersal agents. This information would provide us with an understanding of the inter-relationships between indigenous fruit and frugivores in South Africa. Consequently <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> was investigated in various indigenous fruit species that avian frugivores feed on. Fruits were collected from 38 indigenous tree species found in KwaZulu-Natal Afromontane and coastal forests. Pulp was freeze-dried to constant mass and then analysed for sugar, lipid and protein content; and for water content determination. Fruit width in this study ranged from 4 mm (Searsia rehmanniana and Trema orientalis) to 40 mm (Annona senegalensis, Ficus sur and Xylotheca kraussiana). Of the fruits examined in this study 29 % were black and 43 % were red when ripe. Most (84 %) fruit species analysed for sugar content were hexose dominant with 50 % being fructose and 34 % being glucose dominant. Only 16 % of the fruit species analysed were sucrose dominant. Fruits in this study were generally observed to be high (mean: 68. 1 ± 3. 3 %; n= 30) in water content; and low in protein and lipid content respectively (mean: 8. 2 ± 0. 5 %; 9. 3 ± 2. 2 %; n= 30) indicating that these fruit species could be considered as nutrient-dilute.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Traditional {{foods are}} an {{important}} part of the culture, history, identity and heritage of a region or country and are key elements in dietary patterns. In most countries there is limited information on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of such foods and therefore there is a need to investigate, register and promote traditional foods. One of the aims within the ‘Sustainable exploitation of bioactive components from the Black Sea Area traditional foods’ (BaSeFood) project is to generate for the first time new data on the <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition</b> of traditional foods from six Black Sea Area countries to promote their sustainable development and exploitation. RESULTS: Thirty-three traditional foods were analysed in an accredited laboratory to determine their <b>nutritional</b> <b>composition,</b> and the data were fully documented. The nutrient content varied widely because of the nature and variety of the analysed foods. The energy content ranged between 4 kcal per 100 g for kvass southern and 900 kcal per 100 g for mustard oil, with the exception of the analysed teas, which did not contribute to energy intake. CONCLUSION: The use of a common methodology for the study of traditional foods will enable countries to further investigate these foods. Moreover, a new nutritional knowledge base of traditional foods from Black Sea Area countries will contribute to promote local biodiversity and sustainable diets by maintaining healthy dietary patterns within local cultures.
