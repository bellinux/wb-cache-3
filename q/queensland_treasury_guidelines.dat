5000|$|In 1901, {{notes in}} {{circulation}} in Australia consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> notes. Bank notes circulated in all States except Queensland, but were not legal tender except {{for a brief period}} in 1893 in New South Wales. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions {{for the protection of the}} public. <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the Commonwealth Parliament passed the Australian Notes Act 1910 and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910. The Australian Notes Act 1910 prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the Bank Notes Tax Act 1910 imposed a tax of ten per cent, per annum, on [...] "all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed". These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury.</b> The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing [...] "a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation".|$|R

These Acts put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury.</b> The Reserve Bank Act 1959 expressly prohibits persons from issuing bills or notes payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation. In 1910, the Australian pound was issued and was the legal tender in Australia.|$|R

50|$|At {{the next}} meeting in November, Council {{heard that there}} were {{problems}} with the engine installation and that a start-up date was uncertain. This meeting resolved to ask <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> for a further £5,000, but a later meeting amended this figure to £6,000 undefined expenses to be paid directly by Treasury.

50|$|The Conrad Treasury Casino, {{formerly}} the State Government of <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> Building, is situated at 1-27 Queen St, right {{up at the}} top of the city near the Victoria Bridge. It was built on a site that had been earmarked for Government use since around 1825. Three stages of construction went into the completed building, starting with the William Street frontage. Completed, occupied and opened officially in 1928 at a final cost of £137,817, it provided expansive space for its Treasury Building tenants. As State Government Departments moved into the nearby Executive Building in the 1980s, the Treasury Building and adjacent Land Administration Building were sold, and consequently redeveloped as the Conrad Treasury Casino and Hotel precinct.|$|R

50|$|Despite this {{cheap and}} simple construction, {{there were to}} be long delays in {{building}} the line. Only six miles of line had been laid by April 1912. Unusually heavy rain on the blacksoil plains held up progress, and the workers struck for higher pay. The late delivery of sleepers was a constant problem throughout the project. In August the line reached the halfway point, and on 12 September the 21 miles of track to Mildura siding were officially opened to traffic. These delays meant that construction expenses had been heavier than Phillip's estimates, and in November the money ran out. Council was forced to go to the <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> for another loan of £10,000 to complete the work. The total cost of the completed tramway was £88,983, one third more than Phillips' estimate.|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} note argues that, {{despite the}} Queensland Treasurer calling for {{cost benefit analysis}} {{to be done for}} all major government projects, there has been no economic assessment for the Abbot Point expansion proposals. Key points 	Environmental risks of Abbot Point port expansion have been well publicised, but economic costs to Queensland taxpayers have not been widely reported. 	Nearly $ 2 billion has been spent on facilitating expansion of the Abbot Point coal port. 	Further spending is likely, at least hundreds of millions. 	<b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> emphasises that such spending comes at the expense of schools and hospitals. 	No cost benefit analysis or other economic assessment has been conducted, contrary to Queensland Government guidelines and statements by Treasurer Tim Nichols.

25|$|The {{new light}} at Caloundra Head had a {{relatively}} short working life, with nearby high-rise residential unit development obscuring views of the light from sea and rendering it ineffective. Downgraded, the 1968 light was transferred on a reduced area of land (868m2) to the <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> in 1974 and it continued to operate as a harbour light and signal station. A new tower, Point Cartwright Light, constructed {{at the mouth of}} the Mooloola River at Point Cartwright in 1978 took over the role of lighting the North West Channel. In 1992 the function of the Caloundra Signal Station was replaced by an automatic radar/microwave link unit on the roof of units at Wickham Point to the east, resulting in the station being de-manned. In the late 1990s the light was replaced by a beacon on Wickham Point. Some radio equipment was left in operation at the Caloundra Signal Station, which is still used by local emergency services.|$|R
50|$|After much debate, Council {{applied to}} the <b>Queensland</b> <b>Treasury</b> for a loan, but was refused as the Government {{of the day was}} {{undergoing}} a financial crisis. Undeterred, the Council and townspeople, through local member, John Payne, lobbied the Treasury and finally, in October 1919, money was made available - a sum of £16,000 as the estimates had risen considerably. Ratepayers questioned the desirability of borrowing such a large sum of money for electricity generation, citing the facts that the town still didn't have an adequate drainage system and that a proper water reticulation or sanitary scheme would be more practical. One group even lobbied vigorously for a swimming pool to be built. Council, however, went ahead and applied for an Order in Council to permit it to generate electricity as the Longreach Electric Authority. This was granted on 15 July 1920 and the Council appointed Norman White as consulting engineer and supervisor of construction.|$|R
40|$|The general {{acceptance}} afforded the national image of Australians as gamblers has given gambling a legitimacy rare in other countries.

In 2006 the author constructed a Unit of work for Queensland Senior Secondary (Years 11 and 12) Mathematics classes entitled “The mathematics of responsible gambling ” as a consultancy to the Queensland State Government. Towards the end of 2007 the “Secondary Mathematics Teaching Resources Kit ” was distributed to all secondary government schools.
