This paper presents a contrast-based quantization strategy for use in wavelet-based lossy {{image compression}}. Based {{on the results of}} recent psychophysical experiments using wavelet subband <b>quantization</b> <b>distortions</b> and natural-image backgrounds, subbands are quantized such that the distortions in the reconstructed image exhibit specific root-mean squared (RMS) contrasts, and such that edge-structure is preserved across scale-space. Within a single, unified framework, the proposed contrast-based strategy yields images which are competitive in visual quality with results from current visually lossless approaches at high bit-rates, and which demonstrate improved visual quality over current visually lossy approaches at low bit-rates. This strategy operates in the context of non-embedded and embedded quantization, the latter of which yields a highly scalable codestream which provides the best-possible visual quality at all bit-rates; a specific application of the proposed algorithm to JPEG- 2000 is presented.

The essence of PQ is to decompose the high-dimensional vector space into the Cartesian product of subspaces and then quantize these subspaces separately.

In this paper, we optimize PQ by minimizing <b>quantization</b> <b>distortions</b> w. r. t the space decomposition and the quantization codebooks. We present two novel solutions to this challenging optimization problem. The first solution iteratively solves two simpler sub-problems. The second solution is based on a Gaussian assumption and provides theoretical analysis of the optimality. We evaluate our optimized product quantizers in three applications: (i) compact encoding for exhaustive ranking [1], (ii) building inverted multi-indexing for non-exhaustive search [2], and (iii) compacting image representations for image retrieval [3].

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of reconstructing sparse or {{compressible}} signals from compressed sensing measurements that have undergone nonuniform quantization. Previous approaches to this Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS) problem based on Gaussian models (bounded l 2 -norm) for the <b>quantization</b> <b>distortion</b> yield results that, while often acceptable, may not be fully consistent: re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not necessarily match the initial observations. <b>Quantization</b> <b>distortion</b> instead more closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending on the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform quantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the "compander" formalism, <b>quantization</b> <b>distortion</b> may be better characterized as having bounded weighted lp-norm (p >= 2), for a particular weighting. We develop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise (GBPDN), which minimizes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal under this weighted lp-norm fidelity constraint. We prove that for B bits per measurement and under the oversampled QCS scenario (when the number of measurements is large compared to the signal sparsity) if the sensing matrix satisfies a proposed generalized Restricted Isometry Property, then, GBPDN provides a reconstruction error of sparse signals which decreases like O(2 ^{-B}/sqrt{p+ 1 }) : a reduction by a factor sqrt{p+ 1 } relative to that produced by using the l 2 -norm. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that GBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements corrupted by heteroscedastic Generalized Gaussian noise with provable reconstruction error reduction. Finally, we describe an efficient numerical procedure for computing GBPDN via a primal-dual convex optimization scheme, and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations...|$|E

Moreover, we apply the new upper and lower bounds to two types of sources, the discrete binary symmetric source and the continuous Gaussian source.
