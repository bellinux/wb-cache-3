Moreover, it suggests a more radical reading of Kant than the one proposed by Martin: Kant was right to identify the unity of the content <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> with the force <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> which entails that the subject matter of logic, insofar as it treats of relations <b>of</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> and psychology, insofar as it treats <b>of</b> acts <b>of</b> <b>judgment,</b> is the same...|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{two important}} {{questions regarding the}} subject matter from the litigious angle, namely whether the rulings bringing the legal proceedings to an end before the main trial are barring the way to deliver a judgement or they altogether end the proceedings regarding the given case. The author is of an opinion that the analysed rulings are barring the way to deliver a judgement i. e. they end the proceedings, still the judgement can be passed in new legal proceedings properly instituted or {{in the court of}} competent justice. The way to deliver a judgement is not barred by these decisions in an identical way. Rulings of termination, of lack of jurisdiction or <b>of</b> conditional <b>quashing</b> <b>of</b> criminal proceedings are finally barring the way to pass a judgement in the given court. While rulings returning the case to complete preparatory proceedings are barring that way only temporarily. The author observes that the rulings <b>of</b> <b>quashing</b> and <b>of</b> conditional <b>quashing</b> <b>of</b> the criminal proceeding reveal traits of decisions terminating the proceedings regarding the case in hand. The decisions end the primary proceedings {{in the sense that they}} preclude any possibility of going further through the usual channels of instances.
