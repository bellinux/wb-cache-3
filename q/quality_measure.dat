25|$|The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the Federal {{authority}} for patient safety {{and quality of}} care {{and has been a}} leader in pediatric quality and safety. AHRQ has developed Pediatric Quality Indicators (PedQIs) with the goal to highlight areas of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis. Eighteen pediatric quality indicators are included in the AHRQ <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.|$|E
500|$|Candide is {{the most}} widely read of Voltaire's many works, and it is {{considered}} one of the great achievements of Western literature. However, Candide is not necessarily considered a true [...] "classic". According to Bottiglia, [...] "The physical size of Candide, as well as Voltaire's attitude toward his fiction, precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude, autonomous '3D' vitality, emotional resonance, or poetic exaltation. Candide, then, cannot in quantity or <b>quality,</b> <b>measure</b> up to the supreme classics." [...] Bottiglia instead calls it a miniature classic, though others are more forgiving of its size. As the only work of Voltaire which has remained popular up to the present day, Candide is listed in Harold Bloom's [...] It is included in the Encyclopædia Britannica collection Great Books of the Western World. Candide has influenced modern writers of black humour such as Céline, Joseph Heller, John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, and Terry Southern. Its parody and picaresque methods have become favourites of black humorists.|$|E

2500|$|Door-to-balloon {{is a time}} {{measurement}} in emergency cardiac care (ECC), specifically {{in the treatment of}} ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (or STEMI). The interval starts with the patient's arrival in the emergency department, and ends when a catheter guidewire crosses the culprit lesion in the cardiac cath lab. Because of the adage that [...] "time is muscle", meaning that delays in treating a myocardial infarction increase the likelihood and amount of cardiac muscle damage due to localised hypoxia, ACC/AHA guidelines recommend a door-to-balloon interval of no more than 90 minutes. Currently fewer than half of STEMI patients receive reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention within the guideline-recommended timeframe.

40|$|The use of <b>quality</b> <b>measures</b> in {{biometrics}} {{is rapidly}} becoming the standard method of ensuring reliable {{performance of the}} biometric systems, especially {{in the presence of}} variable environmental conditions of signal capture. It is often necessary to integrate multiple <b>quality</b> <b>measures</b> into the classification process in order to capture the relevant aspects of signal quality. The inclusion of multiple quality features quickly increases the risks of the dimensionality curse. No mature strategy of coping with multiple <b>quality</b> <b>measures</b> has been proposed. In this paper we propose to use a scheme, where the dimensionality of the vector of <b>quality</b> <b>measures</b> is reduced using the Locality Preserving Projections.

5000|$|In his 1981 Baseball Abstract, James {{explicitly}} developed {{another of}} his formulas, called the log5 formula (which has since proven to be empirically accurate), using the notion of 2 teams having a face-to-face winning percentage {{against each other in}} proportion to a [...] "quality" [...] measure. His <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> was half the team's [...] "wins ratio" [...] (or [...] "odds of winning"). The wins ratio or odds of winning is the ratio of the team's wins against the league to its losses against the league. did not seem aware at the time that his <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> was expressible in terms of the wins ratio. Since in the quality model any constant factor in a <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> eventually cancels, the <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> is today better taken as simply the wins ratio itself, rather than half of it. He then stated that the Pythagorean formula, which he had earlier developed empirically, for predicting winning percentage from runs, was [...] "the same thing" [...] as the log5 formula, though without a convincing demonstration or proof. His purported demonstration that they were the same boiled down to showing that the two different formulas simplified to the same expression in a special case, which is itself treated vaguely, and there is no recognition that the special case is not the general one. Nor did he subsequently promulgate to the public any explicit, quality-based model for the Pythagorean formula. As of 2013, there is still little public awareness in the sabermetric community that a simple [...] "teams win in proportion to quality" [...] model, using the runs ratio as the <b>quality</b> <b>measure,</b> leads directly to James's original Pythagorean formula.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{the image}} for which quality should be {{determined}} is primarily {{not the result}} of a photographic process in a camera, but the result of storing or transmitting the image. A typical example is a digital image that has been compressed, stored or transmitted, and then decompressed again. Unless a lossless compression method has been used, the resulting image is normally not identical to the original image and the deviation from the (ideal) original image is then a measure of quality. By considering a large set of images, and determining a <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> for each of them, statistical methods can be used to determine an overall <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> of the compression method.|$|E

5000|$|More simply, the Pythagorean formula with {{exponent}} 2 follows immediately {{from two}} assumptions: that baseball teams win {{in proportion to}} their [...] "quality", and that their [...] "quality" [...] {{is measured by the}} ratio of their runs scored to their runs allowed. For example, if Team A has scored 50 runs and allowed 40, its <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> would be 50/40 or 1.25. The <b>quality</b> <b>measure</b> for its (collective) opponent team B, in the games played against A, would be 40/50 (since runs scored by A are runs allowed by B, and vice versa), or 0.8. If each team wins in proportion to its quality, A's probability of winning would be 1.25 / (1.25 + 0.8), which equals 50^2 / (50^2 + 40^2), the Pythagorean formula.
