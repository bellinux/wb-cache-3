40|$|Abstract. Writing an {{optimizing}} {{back end}} is expensive, {{in part because}} it requires mastery of both a target machine and a compiler’s internals. We separate these concerns by isolating target-machine knowledge in declarative machine descriptions. We then analyze these descriptions to automatically generate machinespecific components of the back end. In this work, we generate a recognizer; this component, which identifies register transfers that correspond to target-machine instructions, {{plays a key role in}} instruction selection in such compilers as vpo, gcc and <b>Quick</b> <b>C</b> [...] . We present analyses and transformations that address the major challenge in generating a recognizer: accounting for compile-time abstractions not present in a machine description, including variables, pseudo-registers, stack slots, and labels. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When a {{compiler}} translates a procedure, it must {{lay out the}} procedure’s stack {{frame in}} a way that respects the calling convention. Many compilers respect the convention either by restricting the order in which slots can be allocated or by using different abstractions ad hoc for allocating in different regions of a frame. Such techniques cause the implementation of the layout to be spread over much of the compiler, making it difficult to maintain and verify. We have concentrated the implementation of layout into a single, unifying abstraction: the block. The block abstraction decouples layout from slot allocation. Stack-frame layout is specified in one central place, and even complex layouts are achieved by composing blocks using only two simple operators. Our implementation is used in the <b>Quick</b> <b>C</b> [...] compiler to support multiple calling conventions on multiple architectures. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 A {{method to}} design foot {{trajectory}} in Cartesian coordinates for a six-leg walking machine {{is presented in}} this thesis. The walking machine {{is based on the}} geometry of the darkling beetle. The walking procedure developed by Y. S. Baek is introduced first to provide step length and leg swing time for foot trajectory planning. This procedure also supplies required parameters to describe the relationship between feet and body during locomotion. The trajectory of a single foot consists of the path and its temporal attributes, that is, velocity and acceleration. Several methods and constraints for path and velocity profile design are discussed. Software developed in Microsoft <b>Quick</b> <b>C</b> is used to generate and animate on the screen a single desired foot trajectory applied to each of the six legs by combining paths and velocity profiles. The generated trajectory is converted to joint coordinates to provide necessary data for leg control. Since a single foot trajectory is applied to three pairs of legs of different design, three sets of joint coordinate sequences are produced. Furthermore, each leg consists of three segments and three joints necessitating nine control sequences altogether. Half-ellipse and trochoidal paths are interpolated with 5 th and 6 th order polynomials to determine minimum required joint acceleration. All paths and their first and second derivatives are required to be smooth. The effect of body pitch are also examined...|$|E

The system consists of four microcomputers networked to provide real time control, and an image generator (IG) driving a wide angle video display inside a dome structure. The spherical display demands distortion correction. The system is currently being modified with a new graphical user interface (GUI) and a new Silicon Graphics IG.

40|$|PDW is a Microsoft Windows {{printer driver}} for the Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. It {{provides}} a previously unavailable linkage between this printer and IBM PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows. This driver supports all {{the text and}} graphics features normally found in other laser printer drivers. The user can ensure true WYSIWYG (what {{you see is what}} you get) compatibility between the on-screen display of high-end application programs and the final hardcopy image because PDW supports the unique Microsoft Windows operating system requirement that printer drivers assist in the drawing of graphical objects on the video display as well as on the hardcopier. PDW can be called upon by the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) to draw graphical objects (circles, lines, etc.) directly to the hardcopier or to render graphical objects to shared memory so that the objects can then be copied to the video screen by the screen driver. This allows Microsoft Windows, in conjunction with the screen driver, to provide maximum WYSIWYG fidelity while a document is being composed whenever PDW is selected. PDW can reside simultaneously on up to three separate PCs, each attached to a single Raytheon printer utilizing the printer's standard IEEE- 488 (GPIB) interface. PDW contains special software to check for bus contention before attempting to access the printer. PDW is written in C-language for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS v 4. 0 or later and Microsoft Windows v 3. 0 or later. It requires 8 Mb of RAM for execution. PDW also requires a National Instruments PC-compatible GPIB board and cable and a Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. If the source code needs to be modified, a Microsoft <b>Quick</b> <b>C</b> for Windows compiler is required. The Microsoft UniTool may also be required if the source code is being completely rewritten for another printer.

40|$|Objectives: Lyme borreliosis (LB) {{caused by}} Borrelia burgorferi sensulato {{is the most}} common vector-born disease in North America and Europe. According to {{guidelines}} serological diagnosis of LB should follow a two-step procedure: a screeningtest and if reactive followed by an immunoblot. A large variety of commercial assay is available for the serological diagnosis of LB. We evaluated the performance of five commercial screening assays for the detection of both IgM and IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi as well as of two commercial immunoblots used as confirmation of serological LB diagnosis in clinical cases of LB. Methods: The assays tested were <b>Quick</b> ELISA <b>C</b> 6 (Immunetics), VIDAS Lyme (BioM´erieux), Enzygnost Borreliosis IgM and IgG (Dade Behring), Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG (Dade Behring) and Euroimmun Anti-Borrelia IgM and IgG (Euroimmun). The testpanel (n = 73) included sera of patients with a documented clinical history of LB and was divided into 4 groups according to the symptoms: erythema migrans (EM), facialis parese (FP), neuroborreliosis (NB) and other symptoms (OS). All LB patients’ sera were also tested by two different immunoblot (WB) assays: the Mikrogen recomblot Borrelia (Mikrogen) and the Euroline-Western Blot (Euroimmun). Additionally, specificities of the screening assays were evaluated by using 50 possible cross-reactive sera. Results: The sensitivities obtained showed that all screening assays (total antibodies or combination of IgM and IgG assay), provided comparable results for all 4 clinical groups ranging from 94. 5 % (VIDAS Lyme) to 98. 6 % (<b>Quick</b> ELISA <b>C</b> 6). The lowest sensitivities were observed for the group EM. The specificities ranged from 66 % (VIDAS Lyme) to 96 % (<b>Quick</b> ELISA <b>C</b> 6). The lack of specificity seen with the VIDAS assay was mainly caused by cross-reactivity with samples from patients with active syphilis. The <b>Quick</b> ELISA <b>C</b> 6 provided both the best positive (97. 3 %) and negative (98. 0 %) predictive value. Considering the confirmatory tests, the Euroline WB IgG achieved the highest sensitivities for all groups, while the Mikrogen recomblot IgM showed a better sensitivity than the Euroline WB IgM. When combining WB IgG and WB IgM, however, both WB had similar sensitivities. Conclusion: The results obtained for all groups of clinical LB indicate that the Quick ELISA assay performs better than the other 4 screening assays. Sensitivities of Mikrogen and Euroimmun immunoblots were similar when combining both IgM and IgG results. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of individual He bubbles in 4 H-SiC thin foils during irradiation with 1. 5 MeV Au ions {{has been studied}} by in-situ transmission electron microscopy. During irradiation, individual He-bubbles under displacement damage were observed to gradually decrease in size at different rates due to their position within the thin foil. In the bulk, slow bubble shrinkage at a constant rate {{can be explained by}} a competition between direct displacement of He out of the bubble and re-trapping, while the bubble remains at equilibrium pressure. A 1 D-model proved that half of the ejected-He is re-trapped during the displacing irradiation. At high irradiation dose, the excess of vacancies due to bubble shrinkage and the vacancies provided by the irradiation itself leads to the formation of small satellite bubbles. The system thus evolves toward a steady state of bubble size with all the helium atoms in the matrix. In thin parts, bubbles showed a faster shrinkage rate with little or no re-trapping before <b>quick</b> disappearance. (<b>C)</b> 2015 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|R
