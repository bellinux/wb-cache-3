This difficulty, however, disappears if we take into calculation, not the forces themselves, but the mechanical work which, in any change of arrangement, is required to overcome them. The expressions for the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> are simpler than those for the corresponding forces; for the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> can be all expressed, without further secondary statements, by the numbers which, having reference to the same unit, can be added together, or subtracted from one another, however various the forces may be to which they refer.|$|R
25|$|The Research Assessment Exercises (RAE) {{were the}} UK government's {{evaluation}} of research quality in British Universities. Each subject, called {{a unit of}} assessment, was ranked by a peer review panel. The rankings {{were used in the}} allocation of government funding. The last assessment was made in 2008. The RAE provided quality ratings for research across all disciplines. Panels used a standard scale for each submission. Ratings ranged from 1 to 5, according to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> that was judged to reach national or international levels of excellence. Participating institutions receive grants from one of the four higher education funding bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The top three universities in the 2008 RAE exercise were London School of Economics, Cambridge University and Oxford University.|$|E
