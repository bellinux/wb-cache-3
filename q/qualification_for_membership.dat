It may even have had a Middlesex birth <b>qualification</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership,</b> like Yorkshire CCC so famously had until recently. Very soon, they decided to call themselves the Middlesex county team and so we have here a parallel with Hambledon Club/Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Margaret wanted time to {{consider}} his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. He, {{like many of his}} contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Freud. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted {{in a letter to his}} mother that unconscious impulses might even affect the work of a mathematician. While in Vienna, he visited Wittgenstein in Puchberg, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill's experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes's support he became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the <b>qualification</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> of which was a completed psychoanalysis.|$|E

In 1931 she {{approached}} the Manhattan Local Musicians Union for membership, but was refused, as they would not recognize the ukulele as a musical instrument. [...] In the refusal the representative told her that the ukulele was considered a [...] "fun toy which isn't allowed in orchestras, and anyone can make a noise on it {{in a matter of days}} ... it was simply a novelty contraption...". [...] While the union relented and allowed that the ukulele was an instrument, they would not accept ability with it as <b>qualification</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership.</b> They refused for many years, but eventually, under her constant pressure with the support of such notable players as Cliff Edwards and Arthur Godfrey, the individual chapters relented.|$|E

2500|$|According to the HKHRM Director Law Yuk Kai, in 2003, {{a member}} with [...] "concept {{different}} from the Monitor's" [...] tried to allow tens of people join the Monitor just before the election of its chairperson and vice-chairperson. That member hoped to change the leading group by having people on his/her side {{taking part in the}} election and voting in it. However, their application for membership was rejected. According to the current chairperson Cyd Ho, some senior members [...] "succeeded in sticking to the Monitor's regulations" [...] and claimed that those tens of people could not join the Monitor because they had not elaborately communicated with the Director Mr Law. Consequently, that member [...] "with different concept" [...] also left the Monitor. [...] Those “regulations” can neither be found in the Monitor’s homepage nor their membership application form. According to the Monitor’s homepage, to join the Monitor, a person needs only to pay $100 and complete the application form. Besides, “the one essential <b>qualification</b> <b>for</b> <b>membership</b> is a genuine commitment to human rights and the rule of law” and “members... are free to take as much or as little part in the Monitor's activities”. It does not state that people have to contact the Director before they apply for membership. Neither has it given any definition for “genuine commitment to human rights and the rule of law”.|$|E
