5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
500|$|Construction of Yamato {{began in}} secrecy at the Kure naval base in 1937. She was {{completed}} {{soon after the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, but had already been rendered obsolete by the Japanese themselves after their successful carrier-based attacks at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere. Yamato, the largest battleship in the world, with nine 18.1-inch guns {{with a range of}} over 22 miles, became, {{in the words of a}} [...] Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reviewer, a [...] "70,000-ton white elephant the Japanese did not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do with".|$|E
500|$|Although Alice in Chains {{has been}} labeled grunge by the {{mainstream}} media, Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "We're {{a lot of different}} things... I don't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to". The Edmonton Journal has stated, [...] "Living and playing in Seattle might have got them the grunge tag, but they've always pretty much been a classic metal band to the core." ...|$|E

500|$|Hughes first {{pitched the}} series {{to the network}} through Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim {{sometime}} after late 2009, after producing a video mixtape that would be projected behind musical performers for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. He compiled footage for the mixtape using the Prelinger Archives, as well as various online sources, and applied visual effects to them [...] "until you didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you were looking at." [...] He originally imagined for it to exist as a [...] "bizarre collection" [...] of Internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from Adult Swim shows, [...] "set to good music." [...] He ultimately had to omit the latter material, however, as the network {{would still have to}} acquire licenses for their own series in derivative works. He found that once they were gone, [...] "the show really opened up." ...|$|E
500|$|Daphne {{is one of}} {{the twelve}} {{original}} characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. When it came to casting, Waston had initially wanted actress Rebecca Gibney to play the role. However, she joined the cast of children's television series Zoo Family instead. Elaine Smith had previously made several small appearances in various established television series. In 1984, she came in to Neighbours to audition for a guest role and her short, spiky haircut caught the attention of the casting director. Smith told Hilary Kingsley, author of Soap Box, [...] "The casting director of Neighbours was looking some outrageous image for Daphne, this stripper – he didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what,</b> but my haircut was it!" [...] Smith revealed that the idea of playing a stripper amused her and quipped that Daphne was the only stripper who never had to take her clothes off.|$|E
500|$|Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to {{be funny}} and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One {{occasion}} in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did not like this because, according to Greno, Flynn [...] "did this reaction where [...] treated her like she's nuts". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to [...] "connect" [...] emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is [...] "at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, [...] "At his heart, he's really kind of a lost soul who doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he wants and who he is." [...] Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, [...] "are skilled but have a human side to them". Flynn is considered an antihero because [...] "He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive" [...] and [...] "he is also extremely narcissistic".|$|E

500|$|Her {{performance}} in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), {{a film about}} the Crusades where she played Sibylla of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began. Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and she liked the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter. To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance: [...] "She doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> {{to do with her}} character's stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice." [...] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character [...] "limp". Green was satisfied when her character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut. Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance: [...] "In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he's afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he's been crowned king." ...|$|E
500|$|When [...] "talkies" [...] {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films. These films included Broadway Melody, which was promoted as the first [...] "all singing, all talking, all dancing" [...] film and had music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and Berkley's 42nd Street, his first major success. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and {{the people involved in}} putting on the show. These first musicals set the standard for the genre, placing their musical numbers either {{within the context of a}} stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were [...] "a reaction against those backstage musicals." [...] Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed [...] "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to change it into, just that it had to change." [...] Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.|$|E
500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. You may not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. But one thing is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} Into the Fire was completed, {{there were only}} two songs Adams and Vallance were {{satisfied}} with: the dark [...] "Victim of Love", and the upbeat [...] "Hearts on Fire", which was written during the Reckless recording sessions, two years earlier. A possible influence to the album was Adams' involvement of the six-city [...] "Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope" [...] tour in 1986. Adams says in the [...] "Into the Fire" [...] songbook that the album's title track refers to a man who is at a crossroads and does not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do with his life, which is how Adams felt when he started recording the album after the massive success of Reckless.|$|E
