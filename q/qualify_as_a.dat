5|$|From 1925 {{until early}} 1928, the Bells lived in Britain while John {{attended}} RAF Staff College, Andover and acted as RAAF liaison officer to the Royal Air Force. Interested in aviation since her teens, Mary learnt {{to fly in}} England and in April 1927 qualified for a Grade'A' private pilot's licence. Returning to Australia, {{she was the first}} female to gain a pilot's licence in Victoria, on 20March 1928. The following year, she became the first Australian woman to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> ground engineer.|$|E
5|$|Later on May 11, {{convection}} re-fired {{over the}} center {{as the system}} drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly {{to the east of}} the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a backlog of medical theory. He did not <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
50|$|He {{was educated}} at St Columb's College and St Patrick's College, Drumcondra, where he <b>qualified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> teacher. He later {{attended}} King's Inns where he <b>qualified</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> barrister.|$|R

5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy. The President is elected by the people to act as a constitutional safeguard in protecting the national reserves and preserving the integrity of the public service. To <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> presidential candidate, stringent criteria must be satisfied.|$|E
5|$|Until recently, the SBS {{had its own}} {{independent}} selection programme in order to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Swimmer Canoeist, but its selection programme has now been integrated into a joint UKSF selection alongside candidates for the Special Air Service. All male members of the United Kingdom Armed Forces {{can be considered for}} special forces selection, but historically the majority of candidates have an airborne forces background. There are two selections a year, one in winter and the other in summer, and all the instructors are full members of the Special Air Service Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} the family's poverty, by pooling {{resources}} Zhu was chosen {{to be sent to}} a regional private school in 1892. At age nine he was adopted by his prosperous uncle, whose political influence allowed him to gain access to Yunnan Military Academy. Before the suspension of imperial examinations in 1906, he attained the rank of Xiucai, which allowed him to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> civil servant. He enrolled in a Sichuan high school around 1907 and graduated in 1908. Subsequently, he returned to Yilong's primary school as a gym instructor. An advocate of modern science and political teaching rather than the strict classical education afforded by schools, he was dismissed from his post and entered the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming. There he joined the Beiyang Army and the Tongmenghui secret political society (the forerunner of the Kuomintang).|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was close}} to the {{influential}} German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. In 1879 Stokvis was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he served as vice-president of the Academy in 1896. He was awarded received an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Edinburgh in 1884. Stokvis also chaired the 1883 International Colonial Medicine Congress in Amsterdam. He was one of the founders (in 1896) of Janus, an international journal for the history of medicine. He is regarded as an illustrious member of Holland's medical dynasty, and as a pioneer in the fields of chemical physiology and chemotherapy. Together with Samuel Siegmund Rosenstein, professor of medicine in Leiden, he was a supporter of Aletta Jacobs, the first woman to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> doctor in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The New Hospital for Women {{moved to}} No.144 Euston Road in 1888, and was rebuilt by J.M. Brydon two years later. It housed 42 beds and was staffed entirely by women, {{which made it}} a {{comfortable}} environment for patients with gynaecological problems. It was renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in 1918 {{following the death of}} the hospital's founder, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first woman in England to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> doctor of medicine. The Euston Road premises closed in 1993, its services transferred to University College Hospital. The current hospital is at No.235. The Wellcome Trust, a private medical research charity, was established in 1936 and has premises at No.183 and No.210 Euston Road. Its library holds about half a million books, including more than 6,000 Sanskrit manuscripts and the largest collection of Hindi and Punjabi medical documents in Europe. Its objects were transferred on permanent loan to the Science Museum in 1976. The University College London Hospital's archives are at No250 Euston Road.|$|E

5000|$|Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a concurrence, {{in which}} he eschewed {{the use of any}} {{specific}} test for determining who <b>qualifies</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minister, writing {{that he would like to}} [...] "defer to a religious organization’s good-faith understanding of who <b>qualifies</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minister".|$|R

5|$|With Liverpool, Liddell {{competed in}} the various {{regional}} leagues that the FA assigned the club to and scored 82 goals in 152 matches between 1940 and 1946. He debuted on 1 January 1940 against Crewe Alexandra, scoring after two minutes in a 7–3 win. In his formative years, Liddell credited Matt Busby and Berry Nieuwenhuys as significant influences. He volunteered for the Royal Air Force and, despite wanting to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pilot, was trained as a navigator because of his proficiency at mathematics. After being mobilised in December 1942, Liddell guested with Chelsea and Cambridge Town. He broke his leg in a friendly kickabout while stationed in Bridgnorth, which required admission to the RAF Remedial Centre at Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|Although still wary of one another, the Russian and Austrian commanders were {{satisfied}} with the result of their cooperation. They had outfought Frederick's army in a test of nerve, courage and military skills. Elizabeth of Russia promoted Saltykov to Generalfeldmarschall and awarded a special medal to everyone involved. She also sent a sword of honor to Laudon. The price of this rout, though, was high: 26 percent Austrian and Russian losses would not usually <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> victory. The storming of field works typically resulted in a disproportionate number of killed over wounded. The conclusion of the battle in hand-to-hand struggle also increased casualties on both sides. Finally, subsequent cavalry charges and the stampeding flight of men and horses had caused many more injuries. Regardless of the losses, though, Saltykov and Laudon remained on the field with intact armies, and with extant communications between one another. The Prussian defeat remained without consequences when the victors did not capitalize on the opportunity to march against Berlin, but retired to Saxony instead. If Saltykov had sought the coup de grâce in the last hour of the battle, he did not follow through with it.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. To <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Once Jardine left Oxford, {{he began}} to <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{solicitor}} while still playing for Surrey. He made steady progress {{over the next three}} seasons but was overshadowed by other amateur batsmen. His contemporaries at Oxford and Cambridge attracted more attention in the press, as did the next generation of amateur batsmen. He was appointed vice-captain to Fender for the 1924 season. Several professionals, such as Jack Hobbs, could have been made captain, but Jardine was preferred as an amateur. In that season, Jardine was selected for the Gentlemen v Players match {{for the first time and}} came third in the Surrey averages. In all first-class matches, he scored 1,249 runs at an average of 40.29. In the following season, Jardine was less successful, scoring fewer runs at a lower average and with a highest score of 87 (1,020 runs at 30.90). Suggestions made in the press that Jardine should captain the Gentlemen with a view towards the future of the England Test team, were ignored. In the event, owing to an injury sustained playing village cricket, he was unable to appear in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In 1926, Jardine had his most successful season to date, with 1,473 runs (average 46.03), although he was again overshadowed by other players and by the attention given to the Ashes series being played. Towards the end of the season, his batting became more attractive and his rate of scoring increased as {{he began to}} play more shots. His assurance and judgement against all bowling, even international bowlers, increased and he scored 538 runs in his final ten innings.|$|E

25|$|Any task, {{regardless}} of industry, can <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 3Ds job. These jobs can bring higher wages {{due to a}} shortage of willing qualified individuals and in many world regions are filled by migrant workers looking for higher wages.|$|E
