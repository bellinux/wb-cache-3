5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> roof. The door opening at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
25|$|The {{designers}} designed City Hall as {{divided into}} three sections, aesthetically and also by use. The lowest portion of the building, the brick-faced base, which is partially built into a hillside, consists of four levels of the departments of city government where the public has wide access. The brick largely transfers over to the exterior of this section, and it is joined by materials such as <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> inside. The use of these terra cotta products relates to the building's location {{on one of the}} original slopes of Boston—expressed in the open, brick-paved plaza—and also to historic Boston's brick architecture, seen in the adjoining Sears Crescent block and the Blackstone Block buildings across Congress Street.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quarry</b> <b>tile</b> is {{extensively}} {{used for}} floors where a very durable material is required. It {{can be used}} either indoors or outdoors, although freeze-resistant grades of tile should be used outdoors in climates where freeze-thaw action occurs. <b>Quarry</b> <b>tile</b> is used less often as a wall finish and is occasionally used for countertops, although the wide grout joints can make cleaning of countertops difficult. Most commercial kitchens require a <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> to be used because of its slip resistant and non-porous properties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{style of}} decor was also new, {{although}} owing something to 1950s coffee bars. [...] There were solid natural-coloured oak tables, hand thrown stoneware pottery, heather-brown <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles,</b> woven basket lampshades and hand-woven seat covers.|$|R
500|$|The {{floor of}} the Lady Chapel is of <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles,</b> with encaustic tiles at the {{entrance}} from the crossing. The only monument that survives in the floor is a brass plaque in memory of [...] "J J" [...] with the date 1822, superimposed over a cross patonce.|$|R
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles</b> floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered lintel under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> was {{unglazed}} {{and either}} red or gray; however, modern [...] "decorator" [...] tiles {{come in a}} variety of tints and finishes. Industrial <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> is available with abrasive frit embedded in the surface to provide a non-slip finish in wet areas such as commercial kitchens and laboratories.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Quarry</b> <b>tile</b> is a {{building}} construction material, usually [...] to [...] inch (13 to 19 mm) thick, {{made by the}} extrusion process from natural clay or shales. <b>Quarry</b> <b>tile</b> is manufactured from clay {{in a manner similar}} to bricks. It is shaped from clay, and fired at a high temperature, ~2,000 F°.|$|E
50|$|The {{laboratory}} {{at the eastern}} end of the east wing has a <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> floor which may be a later addition. Elsewhere floors are vinyl tile, some of which show signs of heavy use.|$|E
50|$|The nave has {{galleries}} at a {{first floor}} level, on the north, west and south sides. It is unusually wide for its length, and has banded iron columns with sheet copper crafted capitals. The brickwork contains elaborate patterns of buff, {{red and black}} bricks, and murals in roundels above the column capitals, and in the reveal of the chancel arch, painted by Edward Frampton. The nave has diagonally-set <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles,</b> and the chancel is Minton tiles.|$|R
5000|$|The lobbies and hallways, {{with their}} richly ornamented Gothic/Art Deco elements, were {{integral}} to the exterior scheme. Paved in <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles</b> of brown, orange, and ocher laid in a geometric pattern, the lobby is topped by plaster crown molding composed of rope and infilled with alternating roses, acorns, and thistles. These symbols of Great Britain serve to reinforce the English Gothic tenor of the building. The walls of the upper-floor hallways are covered in rough-finished stucco, lending a “sumptuous texture that is rarely found in apartment buildings.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were {{commissioned}} {{to design the}} Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is {{the roof of the}} changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles.</b> The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2½-inch thick sprayed concrete shells springing from [...] long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a cantilevered canopy.|$|R
50|$|Ceramic tile are clay {{products}} {{which are}} formed into thin tiles and fired. Ceramic tiles {{are set in}} beds of mortar or mastic with the joints between tiles grouted. Varieties of ceramic tiles include <b>quarry</b> <b>tile,</b> porcelain, terracotta.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} is of river boulders; the outside walls are red brick with sandstone accents. The interior features oak cabinetry, stairways, doors, and paneling. Floors are hardwood, {{except for the}} <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> in the hallways and marble treads on the stairs.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the lobby}} takes an L-shaped form through {{four of the}} five bays. It {{features}} orange <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> and a counter-height dado. The plaster ceiling is coved, and the original wood frames on the bulletin boards and windows, as well as iron grilles on the screenline, remain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the survey}} of Halcetor in 1609 a <b>quarry</b> of <b>tile</b> stone is {{mentioned}} in the said fforest of Corndon and {{that it should be}} let for 20 shillings a year.|$|R
50|$|In the interior, {{the walls}} are {{plastered}} and the roof trusses are whitewashed. The floor is paved with <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles.</b> The fittings date from the 19th century and are made in pine that has been painted and grained. They include box pews, open back pews, benches, and a three-decker pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal, with a single candle-holder and a reading desk. Above the pulpit is a sounding board, also octagonal, and decorated on its underside with an eight-ray sun pattern. The font is medieval and consists of a rough stone bowl on a whitewashed pier. The bell is dated 1894.|$|R
50|$|Bakestones were <b>quarried</b> as <b>tiles</b> up {{to three}} {{quarters}} of an inch thick and used to bake oatcakes and muffins. The industry was in existence well before 1330 and only died out in 1930.|$|R
50|$|On the interior, {{the central}} lobby has a marble counter with {{hallways}} to the men's and women's facilities on either side. Mirrors cover {{the walls in}} the lobby. The floor of the sun porch is covered with <b>quarry</b> <b>tile,</b> {{and most of the}} remaining floors in the building are finished with acrylic tile. Ceilings are concrete and painted plaster. Interior walls are brick and hollow tile finished with plaster.|$|E
50|$|The {{residence}} {{are single}} floors spaces with two units upstairs and two down. The upstairs units are reached {{by a common}} stairway. Residential entries are marble with terrazzo insets, general flooring is fir; and walls are plaster on wood lath. Glass French doors separate a living room from the dining room. There are 9 ft ceilings throughout and a fireplace of brick, <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> hearth and simple wood mantle.|$|E
5000|$|For floors, <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> {{is usually}} {{set in a}} thick bed of {{cementitious}} mortar. For wall applications, it can be set in either a thick bed of cementitious mortar or a thin bed of mastic. For both floors and walls, the joints between tiles are usually grouted with cementitious grout. Grout joints are traditionally about [...] inch in width. Matching trim shapes such as coves, bases, shoes, and bullnoses are available to turn corners and terminate runs of the tile.|$|E
25|$|The design {{consisted}} of two identical wings, joined by a semicircular colonnade forming {{the backdrop of the}} amphitheatre. The colonnade was terminated on either side by a tower. Each wing had a basement and three floors above ground. The interiors were created in the Cape Dutch style with carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture. Baker used indigenous materials as far as possible. The granite was quarried on site while Buiskop sandstone was used for the courtyards. Stinkwood and Rhodesian teak were used for timber and wood panelling. The roof <b>tiles</b> and <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles</b> for the floors were made in Vereeniging.|$|R
50|$|The roof {{structure}} {{was the most}} radical feature of the building. It is supported by three stone arches “thrown across the nave at intervals primarily to “avoid the creaking and straining of the timbers” that was characteristic of timber roof construction in exposed locations. The arches are two centred and chamfered. They spring at 2’6 above floor level and rise to a ridge 30’ high. They are buttressed externally, the buttresses rising through the eaves. The arches support 14 oak purlins to each side. The nave measures 50’ x 25’ with four bays. It is floored with pine blocks under the seating and 12” square <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles</b> with stone borders in the main floor.|$|R
25|$|In the interior, {{the central}} passage extends {{from front to}} rear through the open courtyard, paved in <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles.</b> On the left side {{at the front of}} the building, are two Immigration and Naturalization Service offices. On the right front are two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices. Behind the offices on the left side of the passage is a fine {{enclosed}} stair with two runs and a landing. The remaining first-floor rooms are storage rooms and a shop with concrete floors, several 8' wide masonry openings with slat fanlights (sol truncos). Storage room windows are solid vertical board shutters without sash and with outside metal grilles. Two rooms flanking the passage in the center fill in an original part of the courtyard in a manner similar to the older construction.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the first floor contains public spaces that retain many original finishes and features. The floor of the main lobby is covered with light orange <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> with green marble borders. The walls are faced with Mankato stone and feature ornamental grilles. The public lobby floor is covered with Tennessee marble with green marble borders. Mankato stone also covers these walls. The plaster ceiling has ornamental vents and brackets, and original light fixtures are found on both {{the walls and the}} ceiling.|$|E

50|$|In early 1909, the Winslow House {{was sold}} to the Baker Electric Motor Car Co. and demolished. The {{structure}} was designed by local architect Frank B. Meade in a mix of Early Commercial and Mission Revival styles. The building faced Euclid Avenue, and was 160 ft wide and 200 ft long, and set 50 ft back from the street. Between {{the street and the}} building was a grass lawn, and a red <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> terrace in front of the entrances. Over the two front entrances was a copper canopy.|$|E
50|$|The church {{dates from}} the 11th century, but is mostly 14th and 15th century. The roofs were raised in the 16th century. A {{restoration}} took place in 1871 by Robert Evans of Nottingham where the old box pews were replaced with new seating, and choir stalls were provided. The west gallery was removed. The floor was laid with boards under the seating, red <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles</b> in the aisles, and May and Co encaustic tiles laid in the chancel. The south aisle roof was re-leaded. The Rector provided a small stained glass window featuring St Michael, which was designed and installed by Heaton, Butler and Bayne. It was restored between 1895 and 1899 by Robert Evans and Son who also added a new vestry. The contractor was C Baines of Newark.|$|R
50|$|In the interior, {{the central}} passage extends {{from front to}} rear through the open courtyard, paved in <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles.</b> On the left side {{at the front of}} the building, are two Immigration and Naturalization Service offices.

50|$|Butchie's Drive-In, {{now known}} as Bailey's Dairy Treat, is a {{historic}} restaurant at 534 Park Avenue in Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is a small single-story Art Moderne structure, with sleek rounded lines, neon lighting, and a stucco finish. There are two service windows at the front, and the interior has retained much of its original form, even though the kitchen equipment has been upgraded. The floor is largely original <b>quarry</b> <b>tile,</b> and the bathroom has original fixtures. Built in 1952, {{this is one of}} the few establishments of this type to survive, of a number that once lined Park Avenue.|$|E
50|$|Freeman Estate, {{also known}} as Park Hill Farm, is a {{historic}} home located at Huntington, Cabell County, West Virginia. The estate house was built between 1912 and 1914, and is a 2 1/2 story, masonry American Craftsman-style dwelling. It measures 11,000 sq ft and has a red, clay-tile roof. It features a front porch floored with red <b>quarry</b> <b>tile,</b> that extends approximately 80 ft across the entire front {{of the home and}} wraps around its left side. Also on the property are a contributing stone wall and cobblestone path dated to the construction of the house.|$|E
50|$|Six {{months before}} the schools were ready for opening East Riding of Yorkshire Council {{appointed}} heads, each of whom incorporated their ideas into the school building at an early stage. The person appointed to lead South Holderness school was Stuart Frith a graduate teacher of chemistry and ex-British Army Major. Frith was to lead the school from 1953-1974. He stated that he wanted a minimum of plastered, and therefore painted surfaces, {{and the provision of}} <b>quarry</b> <b>tile</b> floors along corridors and in the Entrance Hall. There were to be bare brick walls and hardwearing floor surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|A {{baking stone}} is a {{portable}} cooking surface used in baking. They {{may be made}} of ceramic, stone, or more recently, salt. [...] Food is put on the baking stone, which is then placed in the oven, though sometimes the stone is heated first. Baking stones are used much like cookie sheets, but may absorb additional moisture for crispier food. Due to the thermal mass of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food {{is less likely to}} burn when using a baking stone than when using metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking {{which is one of the}} oldest cooking techniques known. Baking [...] "stones" [...] may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay <b>tiles</b> and <b>quarried</b> <b>tiles,</b> very cheaply from tile shops and hardware stores.|$|R
5000|$|Inside {{the church}} are old-fashioned box pews, {{some of which}} date from the 19th-century restoration, while others were reconstructed at that time from 17th and 18th-century box pews. The floor is tiled with red and black Victorian <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles.</b> The {{octagonal}} stone font dates from the 15th century and is in English Gothic Perpendicular style. The oak pulpit is also octagonal, simple in design, and dates from the 17th century. Also in oak is the reading desk, dated 1671. Behind the 15th-century altar is a reredos consisting of a curved beam supported by two medieval newel posts. Between the nave and the chancel is a rood screen, again in oak, with a central opening and four further openings on each side. [...] Tree-ring dating {{has shown that the}} wood used for making it came from trees felled between 1496 and 1506.|$|R
25|$|City Hall was {{constructed}} using mainly cast-in-place and precast Portland cement concrete and some masonry. About {{half of the}} concrete used in the building was precastroughly 22,000 separate componentsand the other half was poured-in-place concrete. All of the concrete used in the structure, excluding that of the columns, is mixed with a light, coarse rock. While {{the majority of the}} building is created using concrete, precast and poured-in-place concrete are distinguishable by their different colors and textures. For example, cast-in-place elements are coarse and grainy textured because the concrete was poured into fir wood frames to mold it, while precast elements, such as trusses and supports, were set in steel molds to gain smooth, clean surfaces. This distinction can also be seen {{in the fact that the}} exterior poured-in-place pieces are of type I cement, a lightly colored cement, while the exterior precast components use type II cement, a dark colored cement. The base of the building is dark with brick, Welsh <b>quarry</b> <b>tiles,</b> mahogany walls, and darker concrete. As the building ascends, the overall color lightens, as lighter concrete is used.|$|R
