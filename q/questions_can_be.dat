2500|$|Napier (1963) {{argued that}} it was very {{unlikely}} that single factor drove the evolution of Bipedalism. He stated [...] "It seems unlikely that any single factor was responsible for such a dramatic change in behaviour. In addition to the advantages of accruing from ability to carry objects - food or otherwise - the improvement of the visual range and the freeing of the hands for purposes of defence and offence must equally have played their part as catalysts.” [...] Sigmon argued that chimpanzees demonstrate bipedalism in different contexts, and one single factor should be used to explain bipedalism: preadaptation for human bipedalism. Day (1986) emphasized three major pressures that drove evolution of bipedalism 1.food acquisition 2. predator avoidance 3. Reproductive success. Ko (2015) states there are two questions regarding bipedalism 1. Why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal 2. why did hominins become more bipedal over time. He argues that these <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> answered with combination of prominent theories such as Savanna-based, Postural feeding, and Provisioning.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} only six Select Committees formed since 1970, when Parliament reconvened after the May 13 Incident. Of these, three were formed between 2002 and 2005. Although {{question}} time exists for Parliament to check {{the power of the}} executive, {{it has been argued that}} the question time allotted for MPs to question the government on its policies is insufficient or ineffective. Shad has calculated that as each question time session lasts only an hour, at the most, twelve <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> asked. Opposition Leader Lim Kit Siang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) calculated that over the space of three days (from 10 to 13 October 2005), only 32 questions were answered orally. Of these 32 questions, only nine or 28% percent were answered by the Ministers concerned. The rest were answered either by Deputy Ministers (41%) or Parliamentary Secretaries (31%). After the 2008 general election, Abdullah reshuffled his Cabinet, eliminating Parliamentary Secretaries, which The Sun greeted as a move [...] "forcing ministers and deputy ministers to answer questions in Parliament".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{field of}} archaeology, Levantine Archaeology {{encompasses}} excavations, salvage, conservation and reconstruction efforts, as well as off-site research, interpretation, and other scholarship. The geographical scope of Levantine archaeology includes Syria, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, Cyprus, and the Hatay Province of Turkey. The terminology for archaeology in the Levant has been defined in various, often competing or overlapping ways. Prior to and {{during the period of}} the British Mandate in Palestine (1920–1948), archaeology of the region was typically described as Palestinian archaeology or Biblical archaeology. Under the influence of William F. Albright (1891–1971), biblical inquiry and narratives became increasingly important; indeed, Albright conceived of Palestinian archaeology or Levantine archaeology as a sub-field of biblical archaeology. [...] "The archaeology of ancient Israel," [...] is described by Franken and Franken-Battershill as, [...] "but {{a small part of the}} far greater study of Palestinian archaeology [...] " [...] in A Primer of Old Testament Archaeology (1963). In a survey of North American dissertations, the overwhelming emphasis has been on the southern Levant. However it is only when considering the northern Levant alongside the southern that wider archaeological and historical <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> addressed.|$|E
2500|$|This {{led to a}} {{distinction}} between proximate causes and explanations - [...] "how" [...] questions dealing with the phenotype; and ultimate causes - [...] "why" [...] questions, including evolutionary causes, focused on the genotype. This clarification {{was part of the}} great reconciliation, by Ernst Mayr, among others, in the 1940s, between Darwinian evolution by natural selection and the genetic model of inheritance. A commitment to conceptual clarification has characterised many of these philosophers since. Trivially, this has reminded us of the scientific basis of all biology, while noting its diversity - from microbiology to ecology. A complete philosophy of biology would need to accommodate all these activities. Less trivially, it has unpacked the notion of [...] "teleology". Since 1859, scientists have had no need for a notion of cosmic teleology - a programme or a law that can explain and predict evolution. Darwin provided that. But teleological explanations (relating to purpose or function) have remained stubbornly useful in biology - from the structural configuration of macromolecules to the study of co-operation in social systems. By clarifying and restricting {{the use of the term}} to describe and explain systems controlled strictly scientifically by genetic programmes, or other physical systems, teleological <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> framed and investigated while remaining committed to the physical nature of all underlying organic processes.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{whether to}} choose the SAT or ACT, the {{consensus}} view is that both tests are roughly equivalent and tend to bring similar results, and that each test is equally accepted by colleges. Reporter Jacques Steinberg in the New York Times suggested that admissions deans repeatedly inform him that colleges view the ACT and SAT tests equally {{and do not have}} a preference. At the same time, small differences between the tests may translate into a slight benefit for the test-taker. One report suggested that the SAT favors [...] "white male students" [...] from upper income backgrounds. Another report suggests that the ACT has more questions geared to higher levels of high school mathematics, suggesting that students who do well in math may perform better, but that the SAT is a better choice for students with an excellent vocabulary. According to one view, the SAT is more focused on testing reasoning ability while the ACT is more of a content-based test of achievement. In addition, according to this view, some SAT <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> trickier and harder to decipher while some ACT questions may be longer; question difficulty progresses within each SAT section while difficult questions are randomly interspersed in the ACT; the SAT has a separate vocabulary section while the ACT has a separate science reasoning section. In 2016 the SAT was updated to remove the penalty for random guessing; the College Board advises that test-takers will benefit by guessing.|$|E

2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. <b>Questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, and why is the sky blue?" [...] makes more sense than the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in get dressed and go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E
2500|$|... {{coordinates}} {{for others}} having a uniform {{motion of translation}} relatively to the original system.I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena (...) agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle.Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with {{a certain degree of}} substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter. In this line of thought, it seems natural not to assume at starting that it can never make any difference whether a body moves through the ether or not, and to measure distances and lengths of time by means of rods and clocks having a fixed position relatively to the ether.It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I {{have not been able to}} obtain for the equations referred to moving axes exactly the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced. 1910 (published 1913), 1913 (published 1914),Einstein said in a nutshell, that all of those mentioned questions have no meaning. Then he arrives at the [...] "abandonment" [...] of the aether. Incidentally, the latter is to a certain extent a quarrel about words: it makes no great difference whether one speaks about the vacuum or the aether. In any case, according to Einstein it has no meaning to speak about motion relative to the aether. He also denies the existence of absolute simultaneity.It is certainly remarkable that these relativity concepts, also with respect to time, have been incorporated so quickly.The evaluation of these concepts belongs largely to epistemology to which we can left the judgment, trusting that it can consider the discussed questions with the necessary thoroughness. But it is sure that for a large part it depends on the way of thinking to which one is accustomed, whether one feels attracted to the one view or the other. Regarding to the lecturer himself, he finds a certain satisfaction in the older views, that the aether has at least some substantiality, that space and time can be strictly separated, that one can speak about simultaneity without further specification. Regarding the latter, one can probably refer to the ability that arbitrary great velocities can at least imagined by us. By that, one comes very near to the concept of absolute simultaneity. or in 1912 (published 1922).Of course, the description of natural phenomena and the testing of what the theory of relativity has to say about them can be carried out independently of what one thinks of the aether and the time. From a physical point of view these <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> left on one side, and especially the question of the true time can be handed over to the theory of knowledge.The modern physicists, as Einstein and Minkowski, speak no longer about the aether at all. This, however, is a question of taste and of words. For, whether there is an aether or not, electromagnetic fields certainly exist, and so also does the energy of the electrical oscillations. If we do not like the name of [...] "aether," [...] we must use another word as a peg to hang all these things upon. It is not certain whether [...] "space" [...] can be so extended as to take care not only of the geometrical properties but also of the electric ones.One cannot deny to the bearer of these properties a certain substantiality, and if so, then one may, in all modesty, call true time the time measured by clocks which are fixed in this medium, and consider simultaneity as a primary concept.|$|E
