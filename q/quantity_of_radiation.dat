50|$|However, it must {{be noted}} that the {{psychological}} phobia of radiation in sufferers may not coincide with an actual life-threatening exposure to an individual or their children. Radiophobia refers only to a display of anxiety disproportionate to the actual <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> one is exposed to, with, in many cases, radiation exposure values equal to, or not much higher than, that which individuals are naturally exposed to every day from background radiation. Anxiety following a response to an actual life-threatening level of exposure to radiation is not considered to be radiophobia, nor misplaced anxiety, but a normal, appropriate response.|$|E

50|$|The {{model is}} simple to apply: a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> can be {{translated}} {{into a number of}} deaths without any adjustment for the distribution of exposure, including the distribution of exposure within a single exposed individual. For example, a hot particle embedded in an organ (such as lung) results in a very high dose in the cells directly adjacent to the hot particle, but a much lower whole-organ and whole-body dose. Thus, even if a safe low dose threshold was found to exist at cellular level for radiation induced mutagenesis, the threshold would not exist for environmental pollution with hot particles, and could not be safely assumed to exist when the distribution of dose is unknown.|$|E

Furthermore, {{it is known that}} a moderate degree of iodine deficiency may be responsible for an increased prevalence of thyroid nodules, while it is suspected that radiation exposure could induce changes in thyroid autoimmunity. The iodine intake of people resident in Bari, S. Italy, is mildly deficient, which could be presumed to cause a higher prevalence of thyroid pathology. This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation, in an area of mild iodine deficiency. Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in radiation exposed workers, compared with a stratified sample of non exposed workers. After giving written consent to participate in the study, all the recruited subjects (304 exposed and 419 non exposed volunteers) were interviewed to fill in an anamnestic questionnaire, and underwent a physical examination, ultrasound thyroid scan, serum determinations of fT 3, fT 4 and TSH, fine needle aspiration biopsy. The sample was subdivided into one group exposed to a determined <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> (detected by counter), one group exposed to an undetectable <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation,</b> and the non exposed control group.

30|$|Whether {{scintigraphy}} or CTA {{should be}} the preferred imaging technique remains a controversially debated topic. Already the PIOPED I trial showed that more than 60 % of V/Q imaging is non-diagnostic and additional diagnostic studies might be pursued, as the probability of PE is still considerable. This may result in delay and more radiation exposure, which is not desirable in pregnancy [31, 42]. However, a substantial reduction {{in the proportion of}} non-diagnostic scintigraphy studies has been achieved since PIOPED [43, 44]. In a recent publication, lung scintigraphy had a lower diagnostic inadequacy rate than CTA in pregnant patients [45], probably due to a transient interruption of contrast material by unopacified blood from the inferior vena cava in the CTA studies. Still, today, the standard assumption in radiological practice remains that work-up of suspected LE in pregnant women should be performed by scintigraphy because of the lower <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> administered to the fetus.|$|E

A line quantum sensor that spatially averages the photosynthetic photon flux density provided a rapid and portable method of measuring APAR.

Results The prevalence of thyroid nodules Instead, the prevalence of thyroid nodules > 1 cm in diameter resulted statistically different in exposed and non exposed health staff: 18. 68 % in non exposed males vs exposed: 3. 76 % (determined dose) and 9. 09 % (undetectable dose) in males, and 20. 30 % in non exposed females versus 3. 23 % (detected dose) and 9. 52 % (undetectable dose) in exposed females. There was a higher proportion of healthy staff in the exposed group than in the non exposed: (80. 45 % vs 68. 68 % in males; 80. 65 % vs 57. 87 % in females). Conclusion In our study, occupational exposure to radiation combined with mild iodine deficiency did not increase the risk of developing thyroid nodules. The statistically significant higher prevalence of thyroid nodules in the non exposed group could be explained by the high percentage (22 %) of people with a familial history of, and hence a greater predisposition to, thyroid disease.

40|$|Climate {{variation}} in the New Zealand and Southwest Pacific region {{is very much a}} subset of climate variation within the global climate system. The climate in any place over a particular time period is determined by processes within the Earth-atmosphere system, as well as external components. Those regarded as external to the system include the Sun and its solar output, the Sun-Earth geometry, and the Earth's slowly changing orbit around the Sun. These features determine the mean climate, which may vary owing to natural causes within the climate system. The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly at the surface. This energy is then redistributed by the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean and radiated to space at longer wavelengths, as described in Chapter 4. On average, for the entire globe, the incoming solar energy is balanced by outgoing terrestrial radiation. Any factor that alters the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> received from the Sun or lost to space, or alters the redistribution of energy within the Earth-atmosphere system, can effect climate.
