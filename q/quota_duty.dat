40|$|Resource rents {{and models}} for {{taxation}} of these rents. Some {{references to the}} situation for Greenland. After a general introduction {{to the concept of}} rents the risk of distortion by double taxation of the normal capital income to investment is explained. Cash flow taxation or deduction in the tax base of investment times the risk free interest rate can be used to avoid this double taxation. Among other instruments to secure a part of rents for the public sector are direct participation and selling rights to exploit the resources by auction. The greater part of the paper is about taxation of rents in fisheries. The regulation is assumed to be based on professional advising and individual transferable <b>quotas.</b> <b>Duties</b> on the <b>quota</b> or a general cost increasing tariff, e. g. on fuel, are administratively simple models for taxation. Cost increasing indirect taxation has the good quality of incentive compatibility, as it supports the effort reducing aim of regulation. A concrete example illustrates a possible taxation of the prawn/shrimp fishery combining a <b>duty</b> on the <b>quota</b> with a tariff levied on the catch. Some comment are given on a recent report on the shrimp fishery (2005), and it is criticised for highlighting the theoretical qualities of Greenland’s fisheries policy, but neglecting the regulation and also to which extent incomes derived from quotas end up as income for Greenlandic households...|$|R

50|$|Action {{to reduce}} a {{substantial}} current account deficit usually involves increasing exports (goods {{going out of}} a country and entering abroad countries) or decreasing imports (goods coming from a foreign country into a country). Firstly, this is generally accomplished directly through import restrictions, <b>quotas,</b> or <b>duties</b> (though these may indirectly limit exports as well), or by promoting exports (through subsidies, custom duty exemptions etc.). Influencing the exchange rate to make exports cheaper for foreign buyers will indirectly increase the balance of payments. Also, Currency wars, a phenomenon evident in post recessionary markets is a protectionist policy, whereby countries devalue their currencies to ensure export competitiveness. Secondly, adjusting government spending to favor domestic suppliers is also effective.|$|R

40|$|While EJVs {{are still}} {{necessary}} in some regulated sectors, and foreign investment is prohibited in still others, {{there is a}} growing trend toward a new and possibly much more effective way of doing business in China [...] as a WFOE, that is, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise. For all intents and purposes, EJVs and WFOEs are substantially the same in terms of taxation and corporate liability. They also operate under similar foreign exchange rules and comparable import and export regulations for licensing, <b>quotas,</b> and <b>duties.</b> In fact, their only real differences are that WFOEs take less time to establish than EJVs, are not technically required to have a board of directors, and are currently prohibited in some sectors in which EJVs are approved.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of "Everything but Arms" (EBA) initiative on the European Union (EU) sugar production, trade and agricultural income using the regionalised agricultural sector modelling system “CAPRI”. The CAPRI model distinguishes a supply and a spatial multi-commodity market module that interact iteratively. The supply module contains 200 non-linear regional programming models, each representing production patterns of 30 crop and 15 animal activities at NUTS II level. Trade flows in the market module between 13 world regions and the EU are endogenously determined. The impact analysis shows that the EU welfare and agricultural income is negatively but moderately affected by the EBA initiative due to the small relative importance of sugar beet in agriculture as a whole. EU sugar supply, trade and regional distribution of sugar production are significantly affected while EU sugar demand remains unchanged. As expected EU sugar imports increase from the LDCs while EU sugar exports decrease. The <b>quota</b> and <b>duty</b> free access for LDCs {{plays a major role}} for the captured products...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with the USA and Canada on November 12 th 2002 on a new import regime for medium- and low-quality wheat and barley {{in the face of an}} upsurge in imports of 'Black Sea' wheat into the EU. For medium- and low-quality wheat a tariff rate quota of 2, 981, 600 tonnes will be opened from January 1 st 2003, with an in-quota duty of € 12 per tonne and an out-of-quota duty of € 95 per tonne. For barley, two quotas will be established: the first will be for 50, 000 tonnes at an in-quota rate of € 8 per tonne; the second, for 300, 000 tonnes, will face an in-quota duty of € 16 per tonne. Outside the <b>quota</b> the <b>duty</b> will remain unchanged at € 93 per tonne. Comment: This agreement highlights how even while the WTO is promoting moves away from quantitative restrictions, such quantitative restrictions continue to be applied by the EU in 'sensitive sectors'. ACP countries should bear this in mind when formulating their own tariff policies for sensitive products. The European Commission {{reached an agreement}} with [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Today {{trade policy}} and the {{politics}} of protectionism in Italy, for the most part carried out within the EEC, essentially rely on the Community system of customs duties on imported products and variable taxes on agricultural imports. However, there is also a set of domestic trade policy instruments, among which the system of quantitative import restrictions. The present article analyzes the economic, legal and practical aspects of the complex problem of the allocation of import licenses between national operators. In the first part the authors summarize the main differences between <b>quotas</b> and customs <b>duties.</b> The formulas adopted to date in Italy are then re-examined and the criteria used by the other CEE countries are referred to. Finally, the objectives identified as priorities in the field of Public Administration are specified, the main shortcomings of the current system highlighted and some changes proposed.    JEL: F 13, F 15 </p...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{bilateral}} trade {{negotiations between the}} Mercosur group and the EU since 2000 on agricultural products served as incitement to analyse the impacts of possible outcomes. The objective {{of this paper is}} to quantitatively assess impacts of bilateral liberalisation scenarios on EU 25 and Mercosur markets as well as their {{bilateral trade}} flows. For this purpose, the CAPRI model, which has already been applied to several multi- and bilateral trade liberalisation scenarios in the past, has been adopted in several ways. (1) Trading blocks in CAPRI have been expanded so that the Mercosur countries are now represented with country specific behavioural functions and explicit trade flows. (2) The parameters of these behavioural functions have been calibrated using recently estimated supply and demand elasticities (CAP, E. ET AL., 2006) as prior information in a constrained Bayesian framework (HECKELEI, T. ET AL., 2005). (3) Two different baselines scenarios varying in the assumed production potential of the Mercosur countries were defined with experts from these countries. This approach reflects that developments in Mercosur countries are very dynamic with lots of uncertainties. It also provides analysis of results dependent on baselines which is an innovation in CAPRI (technically and qualitatively). In this paper three selected scenarios are analysed. The first scenario reflects an unilateral partial liberalisation between the EU 25 and the Mercosur countries by allocating additional Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) to the Mercosur countries for certain products based on an official EU proposal (USDA, 2005). The second scenario combines the partial unilateral liberalisation with the multilateral WTO G 20 proposal. Sensitive products are defined according to JEAN, S. et al. (2006). The third comprises a bilateral full liberalisation between the EU 25 and the Mercosur countries by allowing <b>quota</b> and <b>duty</b> free access in both directions for all agricultural products. The results focus on welfare effects and the market balances of seven key commodities (wheat, maize, rice, soybeans, bovine meat, chicken and pork). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the elasticities of substitution between foreign and domestic produced goods that drive demand of trade flows is provided and shows that the choice of those elasticities is very crucial with respect to model results.

40|$|Trade, {{especially}} the international variety, rarely {{brings out the}} best in people. Competition can be savage and when economic survival is at stake, slashing prices will work better than even the most creative advertising. It s an ugly rough-and-tumble and one of the not-pretty sights is the loss of solidarity between nations. The European Union recently announced the removal of all import <b>quotas</b> and <b>duties</b> on products from the world s 48 Least-Developed Countries (most LDCs are ACP States). The measure went into effect on 9 March 2001, in an orgy of praise in Europe at least, but it seems to be far from world-shattering. Most LDCs already benefited from duty-free access on most goods, and preferential quotas on key produce such as bananas. In 1998, the total value of EU duties on goods from all LDCs amounted to a mere 7 million most of it on a handful of temperate agricultural products. These are principally maize, some cheese, beef, bananas, rice and sugar and sugar derivatives, and the current suppliers, mainly in ACP States, are none happy about competition from other LDCs, in the ACP Group or elsewhere. Whether those 7 million savings will lead to lower shop prices, more demand and eventually get back to the farmer-producer will depend on who runs the supply chain. Without a doubt, some products from some countries are now more competitive for the European market. But the not so simple minds will ask, as the World Trade Organisation is abolishing all import duties anyway, why all the fuss? Whatever. The real value of the decision is in its knock-on effects, the so-called dynamic impact. It is hoped that some LDC exports will be so energised by the new opportunities to sell on the EU market that they will produce and sell more, and spill over into the North American market which also recently lowered its tariffs for LDCs. Not, though, without some serious investment in some LDCs capacity to deliver: Madagascar s beef exporters, for example, now stand before an open door, with no herds available to sell. And not, though, before a cacophony of grumbles from pre-March 9 preferred suppliers, whether they be the ubiquitous banana growers, the sugar growers in small ACP island States or Europe, or ACP rice growers. The liberalisation of these three product groups is being taken more gently, aiming at free access by 2006, 2009 and 2009 respectively. But beyond the growls and the vicious back-biting even between ACP States, the real lesson is that in trade, you have to think ahead to get ahead. Now that was worth t 7 million of European taxpayers money; thanks, EU.
