40|$|Internal {{migration}} of Vietnamese in Czechia and its regularities Abstract: The {{purpose of this}} diploma thesis is to identify the key factors in the spatial distribution of the Vietnamese, characterize trends of their internal mobility in the Czech Republic and in two regions - Karlovarský and Ústecký. These both regions are characterized by {{a high concentration of}} Vietnamese in the Czech Republic. The thesis uses a questionnaire survey among Vietnamese migrants which took place on whole territory of the Czech Republic in 2013. Therefore we can describe their reasons for coming to our republic, trends in internal mobility and future migration plans. Part of the thesis is focused on relationship between the {{migration of}} Vietnamese and their employment or accommodation.

40|$|The {{presented}} bachelor thesis {{deals with}} map skills' development in history, mathematics and biology at lower and upper secondary schools. Map skills {{tend to be}} seen as part of geographic skills so the issue related to their development in other subjects isn't researched enough. The first part of this thesis concerns with the use of map skills in everyday life, and summarizes evidence of their importance in various subjects. Based on the research focused on chosen subjects (history, mathematics, biology) are subsequently suggested particular possibilities of map skills' development. The aim of the practical part of this work that examines the development of map skills in terms of intended and implemented curriculum is to evaluate their status in education at Czech schools and also to reflect theoretically oriented chapters. As researched methods the analysis of textbooks and the questionnaire survey are used.

40|$|Abstract—Transport {{and land}} use are two systems that are {{mutually}} influenced. Their interaction is a complex process associated with continuous feedback. The paper examines the existing land use around an under construction metro station of the new metro network of Thessaloniki, Greece, {{through the use of}} field investigations, around the station’s predefined location. Moreover, except from the analytical land use recording, a sampling questionnaire survey is addressed to several selected enterprises of the study area. The survey aims to specify the characteristics of the enterprises, the trip patterns of their employees and clients, as well as the stated preferences towards the changes the new metro station is considered to bring to the area. The interpretation of the interrelationships among selected data from the questionnaire survey takes place using the method of Principal Components Analysis for Categorical Data. The followed methodology and the survey’s results contribute to the enrichment of the relevant bibliography concerning the way {{the creation of a new}} metro station can have an impact on the land use pattern of an area, by examining the situation before the operation of the station.

On {{the grounds of}} <b>questionnaire</b> <b>surves</b> realized in the Gorzów voivodship the author analyses social attitudes towards reorganization of administration, qouting examples of local conflicts emerged on that background and establishes {{the main reasons for}} the integrational difficulties. The barriers are embeded both in the objective scope (errors in the new administrative division of the state, incorrect implementation of thereform, infringing traditional regional bonds, etc.) and in the subjective views and psychological attitudes of people (innovational stress, irrational reservations towards the new center of power, apprehensions against „selfishness of the district capital"). Partially those problems are specific for the Gorzów region, other are typical for all the new voivodships in Poland.

It draws on various fomtS of data: a 1994 <b>surve,</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> in~depth interviews, and content analysis of existing data. A total of 355 responses were received on the suTtley while 110 people were inteTtliewed on a varie ~ of church and political issues. Respondents were drawn from Catholic and Protestants denominational backgrounds. The preliminary {{results of the study}} lend support to the view that since the 1980 's, GhmuUan Christians have been more active!, inoolved in politics than ever before. These findings have important implications for the role religion plays in political development in Ghana. In the absence of viable structures of justice in many African countries that are struggling to evolve new democratic systems, the church 1 claims to speak for the silent majority. It also calls on its adherents to participate in the political process to help create just social structures. A review of the literature on religion and politics in Ghana reveals that since the 1980 s, the church has taken a more activist role in national politics {{than at any other time}} in its history (Aboagye...|$|R
40|$|In {{the summers}} of 2007 and 2008 we {{conducted}} a two week train-the-trainer initiative dealing with free and open source geomatics tools (FOSS 4 G). The total number of participants was 43 coming mainly from research, educational and government settings in developing countries. They {{were exposed to the}} concepts of spatial data modelling and analysis in the context of Land Evaluation and Land Use Planning and were introduced in the overall FOSS 4 G-domain. Theory was put in practice using the FOS-softwares QGIS and GRASS and a geospatial database covering a small wathershed in the Ecuadorian Andes. Trainees did not only work with the ready-to-use functionality of these free softwares but were also introduced to the possibilities the open source character offers for community-based code development for software customization and extension. In order to promote the further spreading of the gained knowledge and experience, all course materials (presentations, reference documents and geodatasets) were made available to the participants in an editable format under the open source creative common license. At the end of the training 96 % (2008) to 85 % (2007) of the participants stated the firm intention to incorporate FOSS in their professional practice, to re-use the distributed materials and to further spread the gained knowledge.

Methods: In this randomized crossover study patients were assigned to receive latanoprost plus either dorzolamide or brinzolamide for four weeks. Thereafter, patients underwent 24 -hour IOP monitoring while continuing to receive dorzolamide (for two successive days/nights: at first bid then tid) or brinzolamide bid (once overnight). They were then switched over to receive the other test medication for a further four weeks and subsequently reexamined for 24 -hour IOP. A questionnaire survey on treatment satisfaction was performed. Results: In 20 patients dorzolamide bid or tid or brinzolamide bid exerted significant (p &lt; 0. 001) reductions of IOP from baseline at all time-points over 24 hours; no difference was detected among the treatment regimens. Significantly (p &lt; 0. 05) more patients preferred dorzolamide (n = 9) over brinzolamide (n = 2), whereas nine patients gave a neutral answer. Conclusion: Dorzolamide bid or tid and brinzolamide bid when combined with latanoprost therapy elicited significant IOP reduction for 24 hours. It is rational to consider patients&rsquo; preference of therapeutic regimen especially long-term users such as those with glaucoma.

40|$|Objective: Management of Graves' orbitopathy (GO) {{continues}} to be a challenge to clinical endocrinologists. In the last few years, surveys on GO management have succeeded in elucidating trends in Europe and Latin America. To determine how endocrinologists in China assess and treat patients with GO and gain insight into how to make the management of this disease more uniform and standardized. Methods: Based on the questionnaire used in the European survey on GO, a questionnaire in China was drafted and circulated to the members of Chinese Society of Endocrinology (CSE) during the annual meeting. Results: A total of 124 valid responses were analysed. Almost all respondents (94. 4 %) claimed that a multidisciplinary approach for GO management was valuable. Over 80 % of the participants advocated the assessment of exophthalmometry, vision, visual fields by perimetry, eye movements, and fundoscopy. Glucocorticoids were preferred as the first-line therapy by 92. 7 % of respondents, among them, 59. 7 % choose the intravenous route. The treatment strategy for GO with intravenous glucocorticoids therapy still remains debatable. Anti-thyroid drugs (ATDs) were the most common choice (72. 6 %) for first-line therapy of coexisting hyperthyroidism. Treatment options for GO were very similar among Chinese, Latin-American and European respondents, whereas radioactive iodine and surgical treatment were more often indicated for co-existing hyperthyroidism in China. Conclusion: The appropriate treatment for patients with GO is controversial even among thyroid specialists. Further training of thyroid specialists, easier access of patients to multidisciplinary centres and establishment of practice guidelines are required for the management of this condition in China.

Methods: The UPC-Q developed in this study has three parts: 1) the aspects that patients consider the most important when receiving a relevant health care service, rating the health care services on these aspects and their prioritization, 2) the overall experiences of patients using the relevant health care service, and 3) suggestions for improvements. The UPC-Q was tested in four different patient-experience surveys in 2015, including psychiatric inpatients (n= 109), general practitioner (GP) patients (n= 1, 059), and inpatients from two hospital samples (n= 973, n= 599). The UPC-Q was tested for item completeness and ceiling effects, while the UPC-Q scale consisting of the first part of the UPC-Q was tested for internal consistency reliability and construct validity. Results: The percentage of patients rating at least one aspect was 70. 6 % for psychiatric inpatients, 77. 6 % for hospital inpatients, and 90. 6 % for GP patients, while 88. 9 % of the psychiatric inpatients, 93. 1 % of the hospital inpatients, and 95. 3 % of the GP patients were able to prioritize the aspects. The internal consistency reliability of the UPC-Q scale was acceptable in all samples (Cronbach’s alpha > 0. 7), and construct validity was supported by 20 of 21 significant associations between the UPC-Q and related variables. The UPC-Q total score was skewed toward positive evaluations, but the ceiling effect was smaller for an unbalanced response scale than for a balanced scale. Conclusion: The UPC-Q includes ratings of what is most important for individual patients, while at the same time providing data for improving the quality of health care and making it possible to monitor trends within and across patient populations. This study included psychiatric inpatients, hospital inpatients, and GP patients, and found that the UPC-Q performed well in terms of acceptance, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity.

40|$|Oyvind Bjertnaes, Hilde Hestad Iversen, Andrew M Garratt Unit for Patient-Reported Quality, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway Purpose: Surveys of patients’ {{experiences}} typically show {{results that}} are indicative of positive experiences. Unbalanced response scales have reduced positive skew for responses to items within the Universal Patient Centeredness Questionnaire (UPC-Q). The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the unbalanced response scale with another unbalanced approach to scaling to assess whether the positive skew might be further reduced. Patients and methods: The UPC-Q was included in a patient experience survey conducted at the ward level at six hospitals in Norway in 2015. The postal survey included two reminders to nonrespondents. For patients in the first month of inclusion, UPC-Q items had standard scaling: poor, fairly good, good, very good, and excellent. For patients in the second month, the scaling was more positive: poor, good, very good, exceptionally good, and excellent. The effect of scaling on UPC-Q scores was tested with independent samples t-tests and multilevel linear regression analysis, the latter controlling for the hierarchical structure of data and known predictors of patient-reported experiences. Results: The response rate was 54. 6 % (n= 4, 970). Significantly lower scores were found for all items of the more positively worded scale: UPC-Q total score difference was 7. 9 (P< 0. 001), on a scale from 0 to 100 where 100 is the best possible score. Differences between the four items of the UPC-Q ranged from 7. 1 (P< 0. 001) to 10. 4 (P< 0. 001). Multivariate multilevel regression analysis confirmed the difference between the response groups, after controlling for other background variables; UPC-Q total score difference estimate was 8. 3 (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The more positively worded scaling significantly lowered the mean scores, potentially increasing the sensitivity of the UPC-Q to identify differences over time and between providers. However, none of the groups exhibited large positive skew and ceiling effects, implying that such effects might not be a big measurement problem for either scaling format. We recommend using the standard scaling in surveys producing external indicators for inter-provider comparisons. The more positively worded scaling has greater relevance for local measurement work where the results of patient experience surveys have shown large positive skew, and intra-provider comparison is the primary goal.
