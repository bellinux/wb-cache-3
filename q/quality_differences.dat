2500|$|Real-estate {{brokerage}} {{offers an}} example of a modern American guild system. Signs of guild behavior in real-estate brokerage include: standard pricing (6% of the home price), strong affiliation among all practitioners, self-regulation (see National Association of Realtors), strong cultural identity (see realtor), little price variation with <b>quality</b> <b>differences,</b> and traditional methods in use by all practitioners. In September 2005 the U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the National Association of Realtors, challenging NAR practices that (the DOJ asserted) prevent competition from practitioners who use different methods. The DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission in 2005 advocated against state laws, supported by NAR, that disadvantage new kinds of brokers. [...] U.S. v.

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} how market shares change when a new, superior technology exhibiting network externalities is introduced {{in a market}} initially dominated by an old technology. This is done {{under the assumption that}} consumers are heterogeneous in their valuation of technology quality and network externalities and that goods are not (perfectly) durable and thus have to be bought repeatedly. When both technologies are unsponsored, the old technology dominates when the <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> is small, and it disappears when the <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> is large. When the new technology is sponsored, the relationship between the <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> and the long-run market share of the new technology is non-monotonic and the old technology always continues to exist...|$|R

2500|$|A {{water quality}} study {{published}} in 2009 compared the water <b>quality</b> <b>differences</b> of reclaimed/recycled water, surface water, and groundwater. [...] Results indicate that reclaimed water, surface water, and groundwater are more similar than dissimilar with regard to constituents. The researchers tested for 244 representative constituents typically found in water. When detected, most constituents were in the parts per billion and parts per trillion range. DEET (a bug repellant), and Caffeine were found in all water types and virtually in all samples. Triclosan (in anti-bacterial soap & toothpaste) was found in all water types, but detected in higher levels (parts per trillion) in reclaimed water than in surface or groundwater. Very few hormones/steroids were detected in samples, and when detected were at very low levels. Haloacetic acids (a disinfection by-product) were found in all types of samples, even groundwater. The largest difference between reclaimed water and the other waters appears to be that reclaimed water has been disinfected and thus has disinfection by-products (due to chlorine use).|$|E

Research on human visual perception {{has led to the}} development of perception-driven computer graphics techniques, where knowledge of the human visual system (HVS) and, in particular, its weaknesses are exploited when rendering and displaying 3 D graphics. Findings on limitations of the HVS have been used to maintain high perceived quality but reduce the computed quality of some of the image without this <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> being perceived. This article investigates the amount of time for which (if at all) such limitations could be exploited in the presence of smell. The results show that for our experiment, adaptation to smell does indeed affect participants’ ability to determine <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> in the animations.

50|$|Emergy {{is a type}} {{of energy}} (exergy) that is {{consumed}} in direct and indirect transformations needed to make a product or service. Emergy is a measure of <b>quality</b> <b>differences</b> between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of emjoules, a unit referring to the available energy consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and in human systems. The recognition of these <b>quality</b> <b>differences</b> is a key concept.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} audit {{quality in}} private firms across different European countries. Prior research (e. g. Becker et al., 1998; Francis et al., 1999) {{has shown that}} audit quality provides a constraint on earnings management for public firms. We investigate whether audit quality differentiation also holds in private firms, constituting {{the majority of the}} EU economy and the EU market for audit services. This is an empirical question given that opposing arguments for (and against) the existence of a Big 4 audit <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> between public and private firms can be given. Moreover, we question whether this audit <b>quality</b> <b>difference,</b> if any, is influenced by institutional factors. Using data on private firms of six European countries, this study provides evidence that, after controlling for self-selection, audit quality differentiation between Big 4 and non-Big 4 audit firms also exists in the private client segment market. However, we do not find support for an audit <b>quality</b> <b>difference</b> between second-tier and small audit firms. Consistent with prior research, we find that private companies domiciled in countries with a stronger investor protection engage less in earnings management. In addition, our results suggest that audit quality and investor protection are substitutes in constraining earnings management in private firms, {{in the sense that the}} Big 4 audit quality effect attenuates when investor protection is stronger...|$|R
50|$|Many {{classical}} music composers, including Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, composed for the fortepiano, a rather different instrument than the modern piano. The fortepiano was a quieter instrument with a narrower dynamic range {{and a smaller}} span of octaves. Even composers of the Romantic movement, like Liszt, Chopin, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn, and Johannes Brahms, wrote for pianos substantially different from 2010-era modern pianos. Contemporary musicians may adjust their interpretation of historical compositions from the 1600s to the 1800s to account for sound <b>quality</b> <b>differences</b> between old and new instruments or to changing performance practice.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quality</b> <b>differences</b> {{exist in}} SCART cables. While a proper SCART cable uses {{miniature}} coaxial cables for the video signals, cheap SCART cables often use plain wires for all signals, {{resulting in a}} loss of image quality and greatly reducing the maximum cable length. A common problem on a cheap SCART cable is that a TV outputs a composite video signal from its internal tuner and this is induced or cross-talked onto an incoming video signal due to inadequate or non-existent screening; the result is ghostly images or shimmering superimposed on the incoming signal. To non-destructively verify if a SCART cable uses coaxial cables, unscrew the strain relief at the SCART connector and fold open the plastic shell.|$|E
