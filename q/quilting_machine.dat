50|$|Almost 30 years later, {{the designs}} and patents for <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> had changed drastically.|$|R
50|$|Janome was {{the first}} to develop a {{computerized}} machine for home use (the Memory 7, in 1979), the first to offer professional style embroidery to the home market (the Memory Craft 8000, in 1990) and the first to offer a long-arm <b>quilting</b> <b>machine</b> for home use (the Memory Craft 6500P, in 2003).|$|E
50|$|The first {{quilting}} {{frame and}} machine consisted only of two bars {{that allowed the}} user to move the quilt and the frame beneath the machine to quilt straight, parallel lines on the fabric. By roughly 1877, the design had been modified, and began to look similar to the design quilters now know as a longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Matelassé (...) is a weaving or {{stitching}} technique {{yielding a}} pattern that appears quilted or padded.Matelassé may be achieved by hand, on a jacquard loom, or a <b>quilting</b> <b>machine.</b> It is meant to mimic the style of hand-stitched quilts made in Marseilles, France. It is a heavy, thick textile {{that appears to be}} padded, but actually has no padding within the fabric.|$|E
5000|$|The {{two major}} styles of {{quilting}} typically done by longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> are pantograph designs, including [...] "edge-to-edge" [...] and custom work.|$|R
50|$|Ten major {{companies}} in Northern America currently manufacture and sell longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines.</b> As with models of cars, longarm sewing machines come {{in different types}} and sizes, with different features and options.|$|R
50|$|It {{is thought}} that over 10,000 longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> are in use today. In the US, there are many brands {{available}} and many places to obtain training and few distributors and trainers in other countries where business quilters {{are more likely to}} travel to the States for ongoing longarm training.|$|R

50|$|The longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machine</b> comes {{equipped}} with a sewing machine head, a worktable, several fabric rollers, and a metal frame. The overall dimensions of the frame can range from 10 to 14 feet in length by two-and-a-half to four feet in depth. The machine comes {{equipped with}} a table region. The table size ranges in lengths like the machine. Larger table sizes can accommodate up to king sized quilts. Typically, the table contains a flat region on which a layer of thin, clear plastic lies, on which patterns and other designs to follow can be placed.|$|E
50|$|The {{backing of}} the quilt is {{attached}} by sewing pins, a snap system, or zippers to a third roller, known as the “take-up” roller. The take-up roller is the region onto which the quilted layers can be moved to allow the quilter {{to gain access to}} a new region of quilt top. The backing, quilt top, and batting are commonly basted together by a single-row of stitching, but can also be pinned together onto the muslin leader on the take-up roller. The stretched region of fabric that spans between the take-up roller and the feeder rollers is the area over which the fabric layers are actually sewn together into the finished product. The longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machine</b> typically comes with electronic controls that allow the user to adjust the fabric that spans the area over which the machine runs.|$|E
50|$|The Bernina Textile Group is a {{globally}} {{active group}} of 15 companies {{doing business in}} 80 countries. The company operates in the product categories such as household sewing and embroidery machines, household overlocker <b>machines,</b> longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines,</b> multi-needle embroidery machines, accessories (presser foot, embroidery hoops and other accessories for sewing, quilting and overlocking) and computer software for embroidery design.|$|R
50|$|A key {{component}} that defines a quilt is the stitches holding the three layers together--the quilting. Quilting, typically a running stitch, {{can be achieved}} by hand or by sewing <b>machine.</b> Hand <b>quilting</b> has often been a communally productive act with quilters sitting around a large quilting frame. One can also hand quilt with a hoop or other method. With the development of the sewing machine, some quilters began to use the sewing machine, and in more recent decades <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> has become quite commonplace, including with longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Heirloom <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> {{is a more}} {{advanced}} quilting technique using a sewing machine. In 1985, Harriet Hargrave coined the term heirloom <b>machine</b> <b>quilting.</b> It was Hargrave's determination to use her domestic sewing machine to replicate the look of hand quilting that compelled her to originate this art. For heirloom <b>machine</b> <b>quilting,</b> the operator uses advanced free-motion techniques. The scale {{of the work is}} refined, using smaller threads and needles that allow the use of detailed and complex patterns.|$|R
50|$|Business owners {{that have}} their own longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> may choose to quilt other people’s quilts for a fee. The price to have a quilt sewn {{together}} by a longarm quilter varies {{depending on the type}} of quilting requested, the size of the quilt, the expertise of the longarm quilter, competitive pricing in the area of quilting services, and other factors. It is usually calculated by square inch or square foot. Imperial measures are still strong in the quilting world though metric, such as in Australia, is also recognised and publications generally include both.|$|R
5000|$|Bernina International AG is {{a privately}} owned {{international}} manufacturer of sewing and embroidery systems. The company {{was founded in}} 1893 in Steckborn, Switzerland, by a Swiss inventor Fritz Gegauf. The company develops, manufactures and sells goods and services for the textile market, primarily household sewing-related products {{in the fields of}} embroidery, quilting, home textiles, garment sewing and crafting. The origins of the company lie in the invention of the hemstitch sewing machine by Karl Friedrich Gegauf in 1893. Currently, the company's products include sewing machines, embroidery machines, serger/overlocker <b>machines,</b> longarm <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> and computer software for embroidery design.|$|R

50|$|The {{speed and}} {{ease with which}} a quilter can have a quilt top {{finished}} by a longarm quilter has caused an increase in recent years for <b>quilting.</b> These <b>machines</b> allow quilters to have their quilts finished without going through the time-consuming process associated with normal <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> or hand quilting. Sewers (or sewists, piecers, or quilters) can now take their finished quilt tops to professional longarm quilting businesses and pay a fee to have their quilting done by a longarm quilter. The availability of relatively quick and reasonably affordable quilting services has helped to cause a surge in the quilting business and an overall growth in interest in quilting as an art form.|$|R
50|$|Quilting using a longarm machine {{can take}} {{significantly}} {{less time than}} hand quilting or more traditional <b>machine</b> <b>quilting.</b> This time saving is a large factor in the gain in popularity of longarm quilting.|$|R

50|$|In quilt making, {{the term}} refers to {{background}} quilting in heirloom quilts and all-over stitching in others. It is made freehand or with free-motion <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> by densely stitching through all layers {{in a relatively}} close repetitive design.|$|R
50|$|This section {{describes}} {{basic information}} about the assembly of quilts using <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> techniques. Many cultures and groups {{in different parts of}} the world have their own unique approaches, methods and styles of quilting which are not addressed below.|$|R
50|$|<b>Machine</b> <b>{{quilting}}</b> is quilting {{made using}} {{a sewing machine}} to stitch in rows or patterns using select techniques to stitch through layers of fabric and batting {{in the manner of}} old-style hand-quilting. Some machines even replicate hand stitching, for example Sashiko or running stitch quilting.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{exposes the}} {{possibility}} of machine producesers to optimize the costs of clothes assembling. Ultrasonic systems being frequently utilized have many advantages on semi products of synthetic textile and technical textile. First of all, sewing – cutting process can be accomplished under high speeds and rate of losses can be minimized. Cutting seal applications are frequently used for underwear and sportswear. Slicing and unit cutting machines, as well as portable sealing machines are available for labeling sector. Products such as bag, pocket and cover can be sewed in a seamless manner for promotion purposes. All objects in terms of accessories are obtained in same standard. Our <b>quilting</b> <b>machines</b> are preferred in worldwide due to its threadless, high quality sealing. An alternative to the classic sewing assembly, with thread and needles is ultrasonic seaming. In ultrasonic welding, there are no connective bolts, nails, soldering materials, or adhesives necessary to bind the materials together. Ultrasonic is defined as acoustic frequencies above the range audible to the human ear. Ultrasonic frequencies are administered to the fabric from the sonotrode of bonding machine. The high frequency and powerful energy produced, when is release in one special environment, the ultrasound heating this environment. The ability to ultrasonic weld textiles and films depend on their thermoplastic contents and the desired end results. The paper defines the weld ability of more common textiles and films. The welding refers to all types of bonding and sealing, as in point bonding of fabric, or continuous sealing of film. ...|$|R
50|$|Quilts with {{heirloom}} <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> usually include background quilting which {{fills the}} negative space around the designs with dense stitching. This creates {{contrast between the}} curvilinear shapes and the flattened background space using stippling, echo quilting, repeated patterns, or geometric grids. The intricate quilted designs produce three dimensions {{on the surface of}} the quilt through the play of light and shadows. Motifs puff up, appear brighter because the high areas catch the light; while low areas recede into the depth of the shadow.|$|R
50|$|To begin any <b>machine</b> <b>quilting,</b> {{the three}} {{layers of the}} quilt, the quilt top, batting and backing fabric, are {{temporarily}} basted with safety pins. Stitching {{in a straight line}} is normally accomplished by replacing the normal presser foot with an even feed walking foot attachment. This gadget was designed to avoid puckering by advancing multiple layers {{at the same rate as}} the feed dogs of the machine. With the feed dogs up, the length of the stitch is controlled by the stitch length setting of the machine.|$|R
50|$|A {{pantograph}} {{is a long}} {{design that}} spans {{the length of the}} longarm table. The longarm quilter will take the pantograph design and place it beneath the plastic layer on the table and then trace this design using the laser or stylus found on their machine head. The design typically spans the length of the quilt and can be repeated in rows to produce an all-over design on the quilt top. This method of longarm <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> is popular due to the minimal amount of work required by the longarm quilter themselves.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{many things}} are quilted using a longarm {{quilting}} system. The system {{consists of a}} frame and a sewing machine. The patchwork, batting and backing are loaded onto the frame and in some systems each layer can be tensioned independently. No basting is usually necessary. The frames can be up to 14' long which is {{big enough for a}} king-size quilt to be tensioned ready for <b>quilting.</b> The sewing <b>machine</b> known as the longarm machine has an extended throat space, up to 36", and it can be moved on a two-axis rail system—left and right, forwards and backwards, enabling a 360-degree movement over the surface of the quilt.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was one of}} {{the first}} to employ <b>machine</b> <b>quilting</b> for speed and sturdiness. She {{employed}} other professional quilters to assure the quilts would stand up to hard use and repeated washes. She created over 700 quilts in her lifetime, both hand and machine quilted. Although she always intended her quilts to be functional, her designs broke with tradition in many ways, and they remain unique today. She often used whatever fabric she had at hand, cutting up clothing as well as pieces of cloth she gathered or that others had sent to her. [...] Her quilts, complex layerings of energetic prints and bold solids, represent inner landscapes.|$|R
