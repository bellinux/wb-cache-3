5|$|The first Catholic missionaries entered {{southern}} Petén in 1596 {{to convert}} the Manche Ch'ol and the Mopan. The Q'eqchi' of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Ch'ol. The colonial Maya towns of Cobán and Cahabón, in Alta Verapaz, traded <b>quetzal</b> feathers, copal, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol neighbours, receiving cacao and achiote in exchange. Many Q'eqchi' from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and Manche Ch'ol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Ch'ol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious syncretism that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent. This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Q'eqchi' to help conquer and reduce the Manche Ch'ol.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} main trade routes {{used by the}} Manche Ch'ol; the first went north along the Mopan River to Chacchilan, then {{overland}} to Nojpetén. The second followed the Cancuén River to Yol, and there joined the Pasión River northwards, leaving the river when it turned west and continuing overland to Nojpetén. Xocmo, on the Sacapulas River, was a trading port where the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ols met to trade cacao and annatto. Xocmo had a major fair, still taking place as late as 1676, where traders arrived from various colonial and independent settlements; these included Nojpetén and the towns of Cobán, San Agustín Lanquín and Sacapulas in colonial Verapaz. The Chols traded cacao and annatto into the encomienda towns of Verapaz in exchange for metal tools (particularly axes and machetes) and salt. Other products traded to the Manche by the Q'eqchi' of colonial Verapaz included cotton textiles and <b>quetzal</b> feathers. The Q'eqchi' used this trade to supply products demanded by their Spanish overlords under the repartimiento system. The Manche produced a number of products for trade, manufactured from resources in the southern Maya Mountains of Belize; these included blowguns, bows and arrows, finely sculpted greenstone axes, hammocks, manos and metates, pottery, and cane, {{all of which were}} traded across the southern Maya region.|$|E
50|$|Eared <b>quetzals</b> feed on insects, small vertebrates, and fruit, {{including}} the warty red fruits of madrone trees. Caterpillars, moths, katydids, cicadas, small lizards, and other prey are fed to the young. Like other trogons, eared <b>quetzals</b> often pluck prey and fruit while hovering.|$|R
5000|$|The golden-headed <b>quetzal’s</b> diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fruit, {{though it has}} also been known to eat insects. Remsen et al. (1993) found that the stomach contents of P. auriceps were [...] "fruit only" [...] 87.5% of the time and [...] "arthropods and fruit" [...] 12.5% of the time. The <b>quetzal’s</b> fruit-heavy diet makes it a very important species for the dispersal of the fruits’ seeds.|$|R
30|$|Bean {{prices in}} {{northwest}} Guatemala {{vary according to}} bean color. Red and white bean varieties are the most expensive and are usually consumed on special occasions, while black varieties, which are consumed daily, are the cheapest. In July 2013, the average market price for the traditional black bean varieties was 5 <b>Quetzals</b> 1 per pound. 2 Based on previous studies (Chowdhury et al. 2011; Meenakshi et al. 2012; Banerji et al. 2013), a 15 % effect on WTP was anticipated, corresponding to 0.5 <b>Quetzals</b> {{with a standard deviation}} of 2.5 <b>Quetzals.</b> Using a significance level of 5 % and a power of 0.8, a sample size of 120 households (HH) per treatment (3 treatments) was estimated.|$|R

In 1952, 50 college males conducted a panty raid at <b>Quetzal</b> Hall, causing $1,000 in damages. Police arrested 13 {{of the students}} and the young women later retaliated by attacking the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house. In 1968, the coed dorm Zura Hall was built, and more rooms were added later. Chapultepec Hall held 580 students when first built.|$|E
25|$|From May 2014 to February 2015, this {{corruption}} ring handled {{at least}} 500 containers, which benefited from lower customs duties {{in exchange for}} very significant bribes, thanks to the ring's control of the customs offices at Puerto <b>Quetzal</b> and Santo Tomás, {{as well as at}} the central customs administration.|$|E
25|$|Commonly, {{rare and}} {{precious}} materials {{are incorporated into}} the crown, but that is only essential for the notion of crown jewels. Gold and precious jewels are common in western and oriental crowns. In the Native American civilizations of the Pre-Columbian New World, rare feathers, {{such as that of}} the <b>quetzal,</b> often decorated crowns; so too in Polynesia (e.g. Hawaii).|$|E

2500|$|Trogons and <b>quetzals</b> are {{considered}} to be [...] "among the most beautiful of birds", yet they are also often reclusive and seldom seen. Little is known about much of their biology, and much of what is known about them comes from the research of neotropical species by the ornithologist Alexander Skutch. Trogons are nevertheless popular birds with birdwatchers, and there is a modest ecotourism industry in particular to view <b>quetzals</b> in Central America.|$|R
25|$|Cobán is {{surrounded}} by mountains laden with orchids, the rare Monja blanca orchid is the departmental symbol. Nature reserves in or near Cobán include Las Victorias National Park, San José la Colonia National Park, Laguna Lachuá National Park, and Biotopo Mario Dary Rivera. There can be found multiple caves, waterfalls and forests which are home to the rare <b>Quetzal.</b> Thus, Cobán has become a popular spot for eco-tourism.|$|E
25|$|Birds {{such as the}} <b>quetzal,</b> scarlet macaw, hummingbird, woodpecker, kingfisher, toucan, and three-wattled bellbird {{are native}} to Alajuela. There are many species of bats as well, like the {{spectral}} bat, Honduran white bat, and the thumbless bat. Many species of insects, including butterflies and moths are native to Alajuela. Because of this, The Butterfly Farm in La Garita was established to further scientific research into the different species.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are {{territorial}} and monogamous. Males {{will respond}} quickly to playbacks of their calls and will repel {{other members of}} the same species and even other hole-nesting species from around their nesting sites. Males attract females by singing, and, {{in the case of the}} resplendent <b>quetzal,</b> undertaking display flights. Some species have been observed in small flocks of 3–12 individuals prior to and sometimes during the breeding season, calling and chasing each other, but the function of these flocks is unclear.|$|E

25|$|According to an {{important}} Nahua source, the Leyenda de los Soles, the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the Tlalocs, with precious stones and <b>quetzal</b> feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified {{the beginning of the}} end of the Toltec reign.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Chichen Itza {{began to}} receive an influx of {{visitors}} {{on the day of}} the spring equinox. Today several thousand show up to see the light-and-shadow effect on the Temple of Kukulcan in which the feathered serpent god appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid. Tourists are also amazed by the acoustics at Chichen Itza. For instance a handclap in front of the staircase of the El Castillo pyramid is followed by an echo that resembles the chirp of a <b>quetzal</b> as investigated by Declercq.|$|E
25|$|The Maya civilization {{participated in}} long-distance trade, and {{important}} trade routes {{ran from the}} Motagua River to the Caribbean Sea, then north up the coast to Yucatán. Another route ran from Verapaz along the Pasión River to the trading port at Cancuen; from there trade routes ran east to Belize, northwards to central and northern Petén, and onwards to the Gulf of Mexico and {{the west coast of}} the Yucatán Peninsula. Important elite-status trade goods included jade, fine ceramics, and <b>quetzal</b> feathers. More basic trade goods may have included obsidian, salt and cacao.|$|E

25|$|Pérez Molina's {{government}} had {{faced with a}} constant fiscal deficit since 2012 and missed SAT's collection goals every single quarter; customs taxes dropped in 2013 from 15,800million to 15,300millon <b>quetzals</b> -Guatemalan currency, and was even lower in 2014; the same happened with sales taxes over imports. The fiscal gap in those years was as high as 7,000millon of <b>quetzals,</b> which was covered by treasure bonds and international loans, increasing public debt. The financial crisis forced the Government to create new phone, cement and mining taxes to balance its budget for 2015.|$|R
25|$|Perez Molina {{was elected}} {{president}} in the 2011 general elections and shortly after his inauguration privatized the Empresa Portuaria <b>Quetzal</b> (English:Quetzal Harbor Enterprise) in Escuintla, on Holy Wednesday of the first Holy Week under his tenure; the Holy Week is a highly respected holiday in Guatemala and his move prompted several complaints about its legality. Later, Baldetti appointed Claudia Méndez Asencio -a close friend of hers—as SAT Customs Chief. Only two months later, Perez Molina intervened in the Superintendencia de Administración Tributaria and placed military personnel in key points in customs, allegedly to increase tax collection and prevent smuggling.|$|E
25|$|Feathers were valued {{similarly}} to jade and turquoise in Mesoamerica. They {{were considered to}} have magical properties as symbols of fertility, abundance, riches and power and those who used them were associated with divine powers. Evidence of use goes back {{at least as far}} as the Mayas, with depictions of them on the murals at Bonampak. The Mayans also raised birds in part for feathers. Toltec groups were making feathered items from black and white feathers of local origin. The most developed use of feathers in Mesoamerica was among the Aztecs, Tlaxcaltecs and Purepecha. Feathers were used to make many types of objects from arrows, fly whisks, fans, complicated headdresses and fine clothing. By the reign of the Aztec ruler Ahuizotl, richer feathers from tropical areas came to the Aztec Empire with <b>quetzal</b> and the finest feathers used by Moctezuma's reign. Feathers were used for ceremonial shields, and the garments of Aztec eagle warriors were completely covered in feathers. Feather work dressed idols and priests as well. Moctezuma asked the Purépecha for help against the Spanish by sending gifts that included <b>quetzal</b> feathers. Among the Purépecha, feathers were used similarly, for ceremonial shields, bucklers, doublets for the cazonci or ruler and feather ceremonial garments for priests, warriors and generals. To declare war, the Purépecha showed enemies wood covered in feathers and send highly prized green feathers to allies and potential allies. Soldiers who died in war were buried with feathers.|$|E
25|$|Trogons are {{generally}} sedentary, with no species known to undertake long migrations. A {{small number of}} species are known to make smaller migratory movements, particularly montane species which move to lower altitudes during different seasons. This has been demonstrated using radio tracking in the resplendent <b>quetzal</b> in Costa Rica and evidence has been accumulated {{for a number of}} other species. The Narina trogon of Africa is thought to undertake some localised short distance migrations over parts of its range, for example birds of Zimbabwe's plateau savannah depart after the breeding season. A complete picture of these movements is however lacking. Trogons are difficult to study as their thick tarsi (feet bones) make ringing studies difficult.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "song" [...] is a treble {{syllable}} {{described as}} kyow or like [...] "a whimpering pup", often in pairs, {{which may be}} repeated monotonously. Resplendent <b>quetzals</b> have other unmusical calls as well.|$|R
50|$|Resplendent <b>quetzals</b> {{are weak}} fliers. Their known predators include the ornate hawk-eagle, golden eagle, and other hawks and owls as adults, emerald toucanets, brown jays, long-tailed weasels, squirrels, and the {{kinkajou}} as nestlings or eggs.|$|R
50|$|Birds of humid Andean forests include mountain-toucans, <b>quetzals</b> and the Andean cock-of-the-rock, while {{mixed species}} flocks {{dominated}} by tanagers and furnariids commonly are seen - {{in contrast to}} several vocal but typically cryptic species of wrens, tapaculos and antpittas.|$|R
25|$|The first ajaw, or king, of B'aakal {{that we know}} of was K'uk Balam (<b>Quetzal</b> Jaguar), who governed {{for four}} years {{starting}} in the year 431. After him, a king came to power, nicknamed Casper by archaeologists. The next two kings were probably Caspers sons. Little was known about the first of these, B'utz Aj Sak Chiik, until 1994, when a tablet was found describing a ritual for the king. The first tablet mentioned his successor Ahkal Mo' Naab I as a teenage prince, and therefore it is believed that there was a family relation between them. For unknown reasons, Akhal Mo' Naab I had great prestige, so the kings who succeeded him were proud to be his descendants.|$|E
25|$|By the 20th century, feather work existed as a handcraft, {{rather than}} as art. One reason for this was that the {{disappearance}} of many bird species {{has led to a}} lack of fine feathers. In {{the first half of the}} century feather work images were almost exclusively of postcards or other informal forms, with images of cockfights or birds made with dyed chicken or turkey feathers. Manuel Gamio tried to revive feather work's artistic nature. In 1920 he designed and supervised the creation of two mural panels, one with an Aztec serpent and the other with a Mayan serpent, copied from archeological pieces. It was done on black silk with <b>quetzal</b> feathers, gold, silver and silk threads. However, the fate of these works is not known.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of feathers in central Mexico were the long green feathers of the resplendent <b>quetzal</b> which were reserved for deities and the emperor. One reason for their rarity was that quetzals could not be domesticated as they died in captivity. Instead wild birds were caught, plucked and released. Other tropical birds were used as well. Bernardino de Sahagún {{made a list of}} the species used for fine feathers, many of which are now either threatened or locally extinct. These include the mountain trogon, lovely cotinga, roseate spoonbill, squirrel cuckoo, red-legged honeycreeper, emerald toucanet, agami heron, russet-crowned motmot, turquoise-browed motmot, blue grosbeak, golden eagle, great egret, military macaw, scarlet macaw, yellow-headed amazon, Montezuma oropendola and the over 53 species of hummingbird found in Mexico.|$|E
