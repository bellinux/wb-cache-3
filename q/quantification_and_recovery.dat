40|$|Tau protein {{concentration}} in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is currently {{used as a}} sensitive and specific biomarker for Alzheimer's disease. Its detection currently relies on ELISA but the perspective of using mass spectrometry (MS) to detect its different proteoforms represents an interesting alternative. This is however an analytical challenge because of its low {{concentration in}} the CSF, a biological fluid collected in small volume by lumbar puncture, and with a high structural heterogeneity. To overcome these issues, instead of using immunocapture as previously done, we rather relied on an original two steps pre-fractionation technique of CSF: perchloric acid followed by micro solid phase extraction (µSPE). We could then measure seven tau trypsic peptides by Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Quantification was performed using isotopically labelled 15 N- recombinant Tau protein as internal standard and validated using CSF pools with low, medium or high tau concentrations. Repeatability, intermediate precision, linearity, limit of <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> were calculated for the different peptides.

40|$|The {{presence}} of both pharmaceuticals and pesticides in the aquatic environment {{has become a}} well-known environmental issue during the last decade. An increasing demand however still exists for sensitive and reliable monitoring tools for these rather polar contaminants in the marine environment. In recent years, the great potential of passive samplers or equilibrium based sampling techniques for evaluation of the fate of these contaminants {{has been shown in}} literature. Therefore, we developed a new analytical method for the quantification of a high number of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in passive sampling devices. The analytical procedure consisted of extraction using 1 : 1 methanol/acetonitrile followed by detection with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution and high mass accuracy Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Validation of the analytical method resulted in limits of <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> <b>recoveries</b> ranging between 0. 2 and 20 ng per sampler sheet and between 87. 9 and 105. 2 %, respectively. Determination of the sampler-water partition coefficients of all compounds demonstrated that several pharmaceuticals and most pesticides exert a high affinity for the polydimethylsiloxane passive samplers. Finally, the developed analytical methods were used to measure the time-weighted average (TWA) concentrations of the targeted pollutants in passive samplers, deployed at eight stations in the Belgian coastal zone. Propranolol, carbamazepine and seven pesticides were found to be very abundant in the passive samplers.

We previously demonstrated that coupling immunoaffinity enrichment using anti-peptide antibodies (SISCAPA) to multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) produces Immunoprecipitation MRM-MS (immuno-MRM-MS) assays that can be multiplexed to quantify proteins in plasma with high sensitivity, specificity, and precision. Here we report the first systematic evaluation of the interlaboratory performance of multiplexed (8 -plex) immuno-MRM-MS in three independent labs. A staged study {{was carried out in}} which the effect of each processing and analysis step on assay coefficient of variance, limit of detection, limit of <b>quantification,</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> was evaluated. Limits of detection were at or below 1 ng/ml for the assayed proteins in 30 mu l of plasma. Assay reproducibility was acceptable for verification studies, with median intra-and interlaboratory coefficients of variance above the limit of quantification of 11 % and < 14 %, respectively, for the entire immuno-MRM-MS assay process, including enzymatic digestion of plasma. Trypsin digestion and its requisite sample handling contributed the most to assay variability and reduced the recovery of target peptides from digested proteins. Using a stable isotope-labeled protein as an internal standard instead of stable isotope-labeled pep-tides to account for losses in the digestion process nearly doubled assay accuracy for this while improving assay precision 5 %.

40|$|Introduction: Astaxanthin (3, 3 ’-dihydroxy-β-β´-carotene- 4 - 4 ´-dione), {{a potent}} antioxidant, {{is one of}} the major {{carotenoids}} in crustaceans. In the frame of the project ‘Preparation of active packaging with antioxidant and antimicrobial activity based on astaxanthin and chitosan’, a methodology for the incorporation of compounds obtained from shrimp waste in plastic matrices was developed to produce an active packaging with antioxidant properties. The aim of the present work was to develop and optimize a method to determine astaxanthin by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography in fermented shrimp waste. Moreover, the method was also applied to determine the migration of astaxanthin from plastic films containing different amounts of shrimp waste to food simulants. Material and Methods: The method was optimized to determine astaxanthin by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) with diode array detection (DAD). The chromatographic separation was achieved using a vanguard pre-column (UPLCÒ BEH, 1. 7 µm particle size) and a column (UPLCÒ BEH, 2. 1 x 50 mm, 1. 7 µm particle size) at 20 °C. The mobile phase was a gradient of A (dichloromethane/methanol with ammonium acetate/acetonitrile 5 : 20 : 75 (v/v)) and B (ultrapure water) with a flow rate of 0. 5 mL/min. The optimized UPLC method allowed an excellent resolution of astaxanthin. The method was also evaluated in what concerns to validation parameters such as linearity, precision, limit of detection, limit of <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> Low density polyethylene plastic films produced by extrusion with different amounts of the lipid fraction of shrimp waste were prepared and tested regarding migration into fatty food stimulants (isooctane and ethanol 95 %, v/v). Results and conclusion: The proposed method to determine astaxanthin in shrimp waste is simple and has a low detection level (0. 054 μg/mL). The concentration of astaxanthin found in the lipid fraction of fermented shrimp waste was 453. 8 μg/g. The films produced by extrusion with the lipid fraction of the fermented shrimp waste did not originate astaxanthin migration into the tested fatty food simulants. Further studies could be made in order to evaluate the capacity of these films in protecting packed food from oxidation.

40|$|The PhD {{activity}} {{described in}} the present work concerned the determination of organic micropollutants in food matrices at trace level, with the aim of correctly evaluating the measurement uncertainty and establishing metrological traceability for the results of these measurements. The metrological traceability of organic micropollutants measurements is a relevant issue due to the potential adverse effects that these substances can act on human health and on natural ecosystems. Many organic micropollutants have been classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in the framework of the Stockholm Convention (2001) [1]. The research activity was addressed to the study of some food matrices and the attention was focused on two different matrices, green tea powder and milk, and on two organic molecules: - endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide banned in 2011 due to its toxicity, analysed in green tea; - melamine, a molecule commonly used in the plastic industry which became famous for its fraudulent use as adulterant of the protein content of milk in 2008. Ad hoc methods were developed for the extraction of these molecules from food samples and for their quantification by means of two different analytical techniques: - gaschromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the analysis of endosulfan; - Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy for the analysis of melamine. For the development of these methods a metrological approach was adopted and correct metrological traceability chains to the SI units were established, considering all the steps which constitute an analytical method. The activity concerning the Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) started for the participation in 2012 in an international comparison carried out in the framework of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM), namely the "Pilot Study CCQM-P 136 Mid-Polarity Analytes in Food Matrix: Mid-Polarity Pesticides in Tea". Metrological traceability was established using suitable Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), both for the calibration of the analytical instrumentation and for the evaluation of the recovery efficiency of the analytes from the matrix. For the uncertainty evaluation, two approaches were followed: the classical GUM approach based on the law of propagation of uncertainty [2] and the Monte Carlo method [3]. The activity for the determination of melamine in milk consisted in the set up of an extraction procedure followed by the analysis by means of Raman spectroscopy, performed after mixing the samples with gold nanoparticles. Their synthesis is carried out in order to obtain particles having a diameter of 40 nm and a negatively charged surface, which allows their interaction with the melamine molecules (positively charged at acidic pH). These agglomerates are responsible for the amplification of the Raman signal by means of the SERS effect, which generates a considerable intensity enhancement of the Raman signal when the sample is put in contact with a metallic irregular surface or constituted of metallic nanoparticles. This procedure was validated by studying different parameters (linearity, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery).</b> The developed method allows the quantification of melamine in milk samples in accordance with the European law limits, fixed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, due to its potential toxicity, to 1 mg/l for powder infant formula and 2. 5 mg/l for other foods and animal feed [4]. For the determination of the calibration curve of the Raman spectrophotometer and of the uncertainties of the related coefficients, an algorithm based on Total Weighted Least Squares [5] was used, which takes into account the uncertainty contributions deriving from the instrumental repeatability and the calibration solutions used to calibrate the measuring instrument.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{importance of}} glycolipids has {{emphasized the need}} for more sensitive methods of detection, characterization, <b>and</b> <b>quantification</b> than has often been possible using traditional thin-layer chromatographic techniques. We describe the use of ceramide glycanase and HPLC to identify and quantify gangliosides in which the carbohydrate is in Glcbeta 1 [...] > linkage with ceramide. Detection of released carbohydrate was by fluorescent labeling with 2 -aminobenzamide at the reducing terminal prior to HPLC analysis. Under the conditions described, ceramide glycanase hydrolyzed all of the common gangliosides studied, offering a broad spectrum of specificity. Release and detection of carbohydrate were linear over a wide range (over two orders of magnitude) of micromolar glycolipid substrate concentrations. Use of an N-linked glycan as an internal standard allowed accurate <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> a <b>recovery</b> of 93 % was achieved. The method additionally maintained the sensitivity (chromatographic peaks containing 1 pmol were readily detected from tissue samples) and comparable resolution to related assays. This was shown by the separation, not only of isomeric carbohydrates from the "a" and "b" series, but also of ganglioside carbohydrate differing only by the presence of either N-acetyl- or N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Application of the method to neutral glycosphingolipids and to tissue samples, including 10 -microl quantities of plasma, is illustrated. Glycan structures were confirmed by exoglycosidase digestion and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{convenient}} method for the digestion of animal tissues, lichens, and plants for 33 metals measured by sector field {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) was described. Microwave-assisted acid digestions were performed at atmospheric pressure {{by means of a}} multi-samples rotor designed for processing a large number of samples at once in screw-capped disposable polystyrene liners. The digested samples were filled up to final volume directly in the polystyrene liners ready for elemental quantification. Seven certified reference materials, namely BCR 184 (bovine muscle), BCR 186 (pig kidney), DORM- 2 (dogfish muscle), BCR 422 (cod muscle), BCR 62 (olive leaves), BCR 100 (beech leaves), and BCR 482 (lichen) were analysed to verify the accuracy of the method. The linearity range, limit of <b>quantification,</b> precision, <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> by addition of non-certified elements were also assessed. All elements, with the exception of Hg in BCR 184 and As in BCR 186, were above the <b>quantification</b> limit <b>and</b> blank concentrations, and good agreement existed between found and target values in bovine muscle, pig kidney, and cod muscle. Significant deviations were observed for Al, Co, Cr, Mn, and Ni in dogfish muscle and for Ca, Cr, Fe, and Hg in lichens and plants. The proposed digestion procedure offers a low contamination risk, simplicity, speed, low cost, and applicability in routine analysis, and the SF-ICP-MS method allowed metals from a fraction of ng g(- 1) to hundreds of mu g g(- 1) to be quantified in one analytical run...|$|R
40|$|A {{solid-phase}} extraction method {{followed by}} reverse phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (RP-HPLC) was optimized and validated for the quantitative determination of tartaric, malic, shikimic, lactic, citric and succinic acids in wine. Solid-phase extraction was carried out with C 18 cartridges <b>and</b> extraction <b>recoveries</b> for all acids ranging from 98. 3 to 103 % were obtained. HPLC separation was performed with isocratic elution on a LiChrosorb RP- 18 column (250 × 4. 6 mm I. D., 5 µm) protected with the appropriate guard column. The mobile phase was a 5 mM solution of H 3 PO 4 with pH 2. 1 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Detection of the organic acids was performed at 210 nm.

40|$|High-resolution imaging {{techniques}} {{have increased the}} detection rate of adrenal inciden-taloma. We developed a method of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for detection of plasma free metanephrine (MN) and normetanephrine (NMN) and evaluated its analytical performance and clinical efficacy in differential diag-nosis of adrenal incidentaloma. After solid-phase extraction, chromatographic isolation of the analytes and internal standard was achieved by column elution in the LC-MS/MS sys-tem. The analytes were detected in multiple-reaction monitoring mode by using positive electrospray ionization: MN, transition m/z 180. 1 → 165. 1; NMN, m/z 166. 1 → 134. 1. This method was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, lower limits of <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> detection, extraction <b>recovery,</b> <b>and</b> the matrix effect. Plasma concentrations of MN and NMN of 14 patients with pheochromocytoma were {{compared with those of}} 17 healthy vol-unteers, 10 patients with essential hypertension, and 60 patients with adrenal adenoma. The assay’s linear range was 0. 04 - 50. 0 and 0. 08 - 100. 0 nmol/L for MN and NMN, respec-tively. Assay imprecision was 1. 86 - 7. 50 %.

In this work, rapid analytical procedures for the extraction <b>and</b> <b>quantification</b> of components in fluid milk and diatom fermentation broth were developed. Analytical methods to measure the concentration of vitamin A, E & C in fluid milk were developed and applied to quantify these vitamins in milk distributed commercially in Spain and their retention in milk subjected to pressure-assisted thermal processing (PATP). Analytical procedures were also developed for the <b>quantification,</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>and</b> purification of chitin in diatom photobioreactor broths and for its conversion into glucosamine by HCl acid hydrolysis. This information was required for a techno-economical and life-cycle analysis of diatom-produced chitin for food and biomedical applications, and of its conversion into glucosamine to be marketed as a nutraceutical.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{free fatty acids}} {{plays an important role}} in several fields; in fact these compounds are in relationship with the quality of several foods (1, 2), with the health state of animals and humans (3) and their amount and composition are meaningful in a number of other matrices. The quantity of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the intestinal content is important, since they are fermentation products of dietary fiber and they have been associated with reduced risk of some diseases, including the irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular disease and cancer (3). Thus, in the presented study, headspace solid-phase microextraction gaschromatography with flame ionization detection is exploited for developing and validating a method to quantify SCFAs (acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, valeric and caproic acids) in rat fecal samples. Fiber coating, pH of the sample, conditioning and extraction time, salting out effect, linearity, limit of detection <b>and</b> <b>quantification,</b> repeatability <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> are under evaluation and preliminary results will be presented.

40|$|This methodological {{paper is}} part of a short series {{dedicated}} to the long-standing astronomical problem of de-projecting the bi-dimensional, apparent morphology of a three-dimensional distribution of gas. We focus on the <b>quantification</b> <b>and</b> spatial <b>recovery</b> of turbulent motions in planetary nebulae (and other classes of expanding nebulae) by means of long-slit echellograms over a wide spectral range. We introduce some basic theoretical notions, discuss the observational methodology, and develop an accurate procedure disentangling all broadening components of the velocity profile in all spatial positions of each spectral image. This allows us to extract random, non-thermal motions at unprecedented accuracy, and to map them in 1 -, 2 - and 3 -dimensions. We present the solution to practical problems in the multi-dimensional turbulence-analysis of a testing-planetary nebula (NGC 7009), using the three-step procedure (spatio-kinematics, tomography, and 3 -D rendering) developed at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua. In addition, we introduce an observational paradigm valid for all spectroscopic parameters in all classes of expanding nebulae. Unsteady, chaotic motions at a local scale constitute a fundamental (although elusive) kinematical parameter of each planetary nebula, providing deep insights on its different shaping agents and mechanisms, and on their mutual interaction. The detailed study of turbulence, its stratification within a target and (possible) systematic variation among different sub-classes of planetary nebulae deserve long-slit, multi-position angle, wide-spectral range echellograms containing emissions at low-, medium-, and high-ionization, to be analyzed pixel-to-pixel with a straightforward and versatile methodology, extracting all the physical information stored in each frame at best.

40|$|Steroid hormone {{concentrations}} {{are mostly}} determined by using different body fluids as matrices and applying immunoassay techniques. However, usability {{of these approaches}} may be restricted for several reasons, including ethical barriers to invasive sampling. Therefore, we developed an ultra-performance LC-MS-MS method for high-throughput determination of concentrations of cortisol, cortisone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) in small quantities of human nails. The method was validated for linearity, limits of detection <b>and</b> <b>quantification,</b> <b>recovery,</b> intra <b>and</b> interassay precision, accuracy, and matrix effect. Samples from 10 adult women were analyzed to provide proof-of-principle for the method's applicability. Calibration curves were linear (r (2) ? 14 % for all analytes) and accuracy (relative error (%) - 8. 3 % to 12. 2 % for all analytes). The median (pg mg(- 1), range) hormone concentrations were 69. 5 (36 - 158), 65 (32 - 133), 212 (50 - 1077), and 246 (115 - 547) for cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEAS, respectively. This method enables measurement of cortisol, cortisone, DHEA, and DHEAS in small quantities of human nails, leading {{to the development of}} applications in endocrinology and beyond...|$|R
