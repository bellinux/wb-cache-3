Methods: We derived quality aspects from focus group discussions, existing <b>questionnaires</b> <b>and</b> literature. We developed an experience <b>questionnaire</b> <b>and</b> sent it to 1, 498 Dutch cancer patients. Another questionnaire measuring {{the importance of the}} quality aspects was sent to 600 cancer patients. Data were psychometrically analysed. Results: The response to the experience questionnaire was 50 percent. Psychometric analysis revealed 12 reliable scales. Patients rated rapid and adequate referral, rapid start of the treatment after diagnosis, enough information and confidence in the healthcare professionals as most important themes. Hospitals received high scores for skills <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> of healthcare professionals and a patient-centered approach by doctors; and low scores for psychosocial guidance and information at completion of the treatment. Conclusions: The CQI Cancer Care questionnaire is a valuable tool for the evaluation of the quality of cancer care from the patient’s perspective.

This study is particularly relevant because studies on emergent markets are scarce. The conceptual model presented is based on the relationship marketing literature, specifically the Morgan-Hunt Model (1994), named KMV (Key Mediating Variables). It intends to analyse how trust influences both commitment <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Similarly, it examines how commitment influences cooperation. Finally, this study aims to analyse the association between <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> export performance based on the last and next three years. Concerning the methodology adopted <b>questionnaire</b> <b>and</b> interviews that have been chosen. The study sampled 102 Portuguese companies at FILDA (International Fair of Luanda). Thirty questionnaires were fully completed and the data was analysed through SPSS. Meanwhile, some Portuguese companies’ managers were interviewed so that questions related to «how» and «why» could be clarified. All in all, it was possible to acknowledge a positive association amongst trust, commitment <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> Likewise, it was confirmed that there is also a positive association between <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> export performance.

40|$|This article {{examines}} trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> between farming communities using groundwater resource for irrigation in northern Gujarat. Trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{play a crucial}} role in building social capital, which is critical for good governance and economic development. Recent studies have focused on whether socio-economic and demographic differences between individuals affect degree of trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This study reports survey evidence on trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> from 150 farm households from 50 self-governed tubewell organizations across five villages in northern Gujarat. The field data is analysed in a regression-based quantitative framework. The major finding is that difference in economic and demographic attributes of individuals is likely to impact trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> While ethnic (caste) heterogeneity has no significant impact on trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> behaviour at a micro level, the demographic attribute (age) of an individual has significant influence on trusting behaviour. The household data shows that at the individual level, trusting and cooperating behaviour varies with economic and demographic attributes of individuals. Policies aiming at economic development of farming communities need to consider these variables with other conditions under which trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> become imperative...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> amongst unfamiliar collaborators in remote locations is crucial to Global Software Engineering (GSE) practices. Furthermore, trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> development requires proper social or technical mediations. Our prior empirical research demonstrates that informal, non-work-related conversation (a. k. a, "cheap talk") over the internet correlates with higher trust <b>and</b> better <b>cooperation.</b> This empirical observation inspired us to hypothesize that cheap talk may also bring about better trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation.</b> We conducted three related studies to investigate how cheap talk influenced the emergence and diffusion of trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> in GSE teams. Using game theory, we performed theoretical analyses and agent-based modeling and simulation in which we abstracted GSE collaboration to {{a variation of the}} classic stag hunt game. We empirically studied the project communication records of Apache Lucene and Google Chromium OS to validate our approach and to provide a context for our three studies. The results of the three studies revealed the following. First, all three studies revealed that cheap talk over the internet positively influences trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> development among GSE practitioners. Second, cheap talk over the internet often functioned as "catalyst" and might disappear once trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> become a team norm. Third, proper seeding strategies would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> development when considering the social network's effect. Last, but not least, individuals' baseline trust significantly impacted the dynamics of trust <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> development. Our results and findings have important implications for theory development, GSE practices, and research methodology. Theoretically, we developed descriptions and explanations. Practically, the results and findings led to implications for collaboration management, and potential data-driven tools that support game theory analytics. Methodologically, we demonstrated the feasibility of using together, game theory, social network analysis, and agent-based modeling simulation to investigate software engineering's human and social aspects...|$|R
