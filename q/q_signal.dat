50|$|IQ {{imbalances}} occur due to mismatches {{between the}} parallel {{sections of the}} receiver chain dealing with the in-phase (I) and quadrature (<b>Q)</b> <b>signal</b> paths. The local oscillator (LO) generates a sinewave, {{and a copy of}} that sinewave that is delayed by 90 degrees. When the direct LO output is mixed with the original signal, this produces the I signal, whereas when the delayed LO output is mixed with the original signal, that produces the <b>Q</b> <b>signal.</b> In the analog domain, the delay is never exactly 90 degrees. Similarly, analog gain is never perfectly matched for each of the signal paths.|$|E

30|$|For high carrier frequencies, direct {{synthesis}} of the CPM signal by computing phase, using a digital approach is impractical since maintaining an adequate sampling rate requires an extremely high operating frequency. Instead, one can resort to a quadrature implementation, where baseband I and <b>Q</b> <b>signals</b> containing the phase information are generated that vary much slower than the phase of the modulated carrier, thus making it feasible to implement them digitally. An efficient I-Q implementation of a CPM modulator skips some steps and instead generates the I and <b>Q</b> baseband <b>signals</b> directly from the binary data, thereby eliminating errors in filtering and phase and sine /cosine computation inherent in the conventional architecture.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a phase {{compensation}} technique for the digital upconversion of a quadrature signal for amplification with switch mode power amplifiers is proposed. When a digital signal generator {{is used to}} generate the complex envelope signal {{care must be taken}} to compensate for the phase skew between the two paths. If phase compensation is not implemented an image caused by up converting the complex envelope of the modulation signal is created. By compensating for phase skew between the I and <b>Q</b> <b>signal</b> paths it is possible to remove this image signal and enable the transmission of multi carrier signals. As a direct result of this technique there is a reduction in the filtering effort at the output of the power amplifier to meet spectral mask requirements...|$|E

An alternative cost effective solution to expensive analog components with small tolerances, which make the I/Q mismatch effect negli-gible, consists in estimating and compensating it through appropriate {{digital signal processing}} techniques. In this paper we derive a novel low-complexity data-aided scheme for jointly estimating the carrier phase offset, the I/Q phase mismatch, and the gain of the I and Q branches following the maximum likelihood criterion and adopting as training symbols an orthogonal sequence.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect faults and predict loads on a wind turbine drivetrain's {{mechanical}} components cost-effectively is critical to making the cost of wind energy competitive. In order to investigate whether this is possible using the readily available power converter current signals, an existing permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind energy conversion system computer model was modified to include a grid-side converter (GSC) for an improved converter model and a gearbox. The GSC maintains a constant DC link voltage via vector control. The gearbox was modelled as a 3 -mass model to allow faults to be included. Gusts and gearbox faults were introduced to investigate {{the ability of the}} machine side converter (MSC) current (I q) to detect and quantify loads on the mechanical components.

40|$|A new, computationallly {{efficient}} {{method is}} presented for processing transient thin-film heat transfer gauge signals. These gauges {{are widely used}} in gas turbine heat transfer research, where, historically, the desired experimental heat transfer flux signals, q, are derived from transient measured surface-temperature signals, T, using numerical approximations to the solutions of the linear differential equations relating the two. The new method uses known pairs of exact solutions, such as the T response due to a step in q, to derive a sampled approximation of the impulse response of the gauge system. This impulse response is then used as a finite impulse response digital filter to process the sampled T signal to derive the required sampled <b>q</b> <b>signal.</b> This is computationally efficient because the impulse response need only be derived once for each gauge for a given sample rate, but can be reused repeatedly, using optimized MATLAB filter routines and is highly accurate. The impulse response method {{can be used for}} most types of heat flux gauge. In fact, the method is universal for any linear differential equations where theoretical solution pairs exist between input and output.

Regulatory light chain from chicken gizzard myosin was covalently modified with iodoacetamidotetramethylrhodamine and exchanged into skinned fibers from rabbit psoas muscle without significant effect of the tension transients. Fluorescence polarization ratios Q parallel = (parallel I parallel-perpendicular I parallel) / (parallel I parallel+perpendicular I parallel) and Q perpendicular = perpendicular I perpendicular - parallel I perpendicular) / (perpendicular I perpendicular + parallel I perpendicular), where mIn denote fluorescence intensities for excitation (pre-subscript) and emission (post-subscript) parallel or perpendicular to the fiber axis, were simultaneously measured at 0. 5 ms time resolution. Q perpendicular decreased and Q parallel increased promptly after ATP release in {{the presence or absence}} of CA 2 +, indicating changes in {{orientation of}} the light-chain region associated with ATP binding or cross-bridge detachment. Little further change in the <b>Q</b> <b>signals</b> accompanied either active tension development (+Ca 2 +) or the final relaxation (-Ca 2 +). The Q and tension transients slowed when liberated ATP concentration was reduced. Assuming that ATP is released at 118 s- 1 (20 degrees C), the apparent second-order rate constants were 3 - 10 x 10 (5) M- 1 s- 1 for Q parallel, 1 - 5 x 10 (5) M- 1 s- 1 for Q perpendicular, and 0. 5 - 2 x 10 (5) M- 1 s- 1 for the convergence of tension traces starting from different rigor values. Fitting of model orientation distributions to the <b>Q</b> <b>signals</b> indicated that the angular disorder increases after ATP binding. This orientation change is specific to ATP because photo release of ADP caused much smaller changes in the <b>Q</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Experimentation for {{achieving}} a robust process often involves signal variables which are controllable and internal {{to the process}} and noise variables which are generally external and routinely uncontrollable. To achieve a robust process, designs based on a combined array have been suggested by many authors. Many of these designs allow parameter estimation for the linear-quadratic (LQ) response surface model when the experimental design region is the hypercube. The LQ model contains the full quadratic model terms in the <b>Q</b> <b>signal</b> variables, the linear model terms in the L noise variables, and the signal by noise variable interaction terms. Because the quadratic regression model is just a special case of the LQ model when there are L = 0 noise variables, this article extends the optimal design theory regarding regression on the hypercube. An approach {{similar to that of}} Farrell, Kiefer, and Walbran [13] will be taken in this article. A support of D- and G-optimal designs for the LQ model on the hypercube will be defined. Closed-form expressions for the generalized (D) and prediction (G) variance are derived.
