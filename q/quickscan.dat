30|$|The role of Higher Education Institutions (HEI), {{which are}} in the {{forefront}} of the challenges of sustainable development, is becoming increasingly predominant, given the importance of these institutions in the dissemination of knowledge and the implementation of sustainable conscientiousness in society. This article presents the application of the Auditing Instrument for Sustainability in Higher Education (AISHE) at the University of Passo Fundo, which is situated in Southern Brazil. The research evaluated the level of sustainability in 30 undergraduate courses at this university, focusing on Education for Sustainability. To do this, interviews were conducted with course coordinators and <b>quickscans</b> were utilized with professors and students. The way in which the University of Passo Fundo applied AISHE is innovative and interesting: first of all, it is important to emphasize that during the research, a wide variety of university departments were assessed; secondly, this approach allowed a comparison between the courses, producing interesting outcomes that can easily be used for a successive phase of sustainability integration. The most innovative element in the UPF approach {{is the way in which}} the outcome of the twenty AISHE criteria are related to the results of the <b>quickscans,</b> which are part of the ‘Check’ criteria of AISHE. Considering the priorities within sustainability in the UPF, the need exists of an initial drive in the managerial stage, such as definition of vision and policy for the institution.|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the method of}} {{environmental}} quickscans is introduced. This method is developed in the EU-funded project 'BioBuild'. The goal of BioBuild is to develop biocomposite building products with 50 % reduction of embodied energy and no increase in costs, compared to current alternatives. To ensure that the developed products have this improved performance, environmental quickscans are executed for important design decisions related to fibre selection, fibre treatment, matrix selection, painting and coating of the building products. In this article the benefits and lessons learned of the environmental <b>quickscan</b> approach will be explained by using the <b>quickscan</b> on fibre treatment as an example. The <b>quickscan</b> indicates that the embodied energy of fibre treatment processes differs with a factor 6. This shows that investigating {{the environmental impact of}} production options is of importance as the options can differ substantially in environmental performance. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether results from the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> questionnaire on risk factors for arm, shoulder and neck symptoms can predict future arm, neck and shoulder symptoms in a population of computer workers. For this prospective cohort study, with a follow-up of 24 months, 3383 workers who regularly worked with a computer were approached. Generalised estimating equations (GEE) with 6, 12, 18 and 24 months time lags were used to determine whether high exposure was related to symptoms at follow-up. The results showed that high scores on 9 out of 13 scales, including previous symptoms, were significantly related to arm, shoulder and neck symptoms at follow-up. These results provide support for the predictive validity of the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> questionnaire. Practitioner Summary: The results showed that high scores on 9 out of 13 scales, including previous symptoms, were significantly related to arm, shoulder and neck symptoms at follow-up. The RSI <b>QuickScan</b> questionnaire may be recommended as a tool in the identification of computer workers who should be targeted with interventions aimed at prevention of future symptoms. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

40|$|Policy {{making is}} {{required}} in cases in which a public good needs to be either maintained or created, and private or civil initiatives cannot deal alone with this. Policy making thus starts with a phase of problem identification and determining {{whether there is a}} problem that needs to be dealt with. Rapidly evolving contexts exert influence on policy makers who have to take decisions much faster and more accurately than in the past, also facing greater complexity. There is a need for a method that lowers the lead time of the exploratory phase of the policy cycle. At the same time the method should create a joint understanding of the most important interactions. This paper proposes <b>QUICKScan,</b> a method, process and spatially explicit tool, to jointly scope policy problems in a participatory setting, investigate the most important interactions and feedbacks and assesses the state of knowledge and data of relevance to the problem. <b>QUICKScan</b> uses strongly moderated participatory workshops bringing together a wide range of stakeholders relevant to the policy issue. These moderated workshops jointly build an expert system in a spatially explicit tool using functionality of bayesian belief networks, python programming, simple map algebra and knowledge matrices, with a strong focus on visualization of results. <b>QUICKScan</b> has been applied in 70 different applications in a range of different policy contexts, stakeholders and physical locations. Through these applications participants were able to internalize the knowledge that was usually handed to them in briefs and reports, to develop a joint understanding of the main interactions and their link to impacts and to develop a problem statement and solution space in a reduced lead time. Ultimately, <b>QUICKScan</b> demonstrates another role of science, not solely as a knowledge production, but also facilitating the knowledge consumption. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the RSI <b>QuickScan,</b> a newly developed questionnaire that aims to identify the presumed risk factors for neck, shoulder and arm symptoms in a population of computer workers. The internal consistency was calculated using item analysis. The test-retest reliability and concurrent validity were analysed by calculating the percentage of agreement, Cohen's Kappa and the Ppositive and Pnegative. The concurrent validity was also tested by comparing the results from the new questionnaire with those from the original questionnaires that the current questionnaire was based on, on-site expert observations and direct measurements. The results indicate that the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> is a measurement tool with acceptable internal consistency, reliability and concurrent validity.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{costs of}} arm, {{shoulder}} and neck symptoms are high. In order to decrease these costs employers implement interventions {{aimed at reducing}} these symptoms. One frequently used intervention is the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> intervention programme. It establishes a risk profile of the target population and subsequently advises interventions following a decision tree based on that risk profile. The {{purpose of this study}} was to perform an economic evaluation, from both the societal and companies' perspective, of the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> intervention programme for computer workers. In this study, effectiveness was defined at three levels: exposure to risk factors, prevalence of arm, shoulder and neck symptoms, and days of sick leave. Methods The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participating computer workers from 7 companies (N = 638) were assigned to either the intervention group (N = 320) or the usual care group (N = 318) by means of cluster randomisation (N = 50). The intervention consisted of a tailor-made programme, based on a previously established risk profile. At baseline, 6 and 12 month follow-up, the participants completed the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> questionnaire. Analyses to estimate the effect of the intervention were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. To compare costs between groups, confidence intervals for cost differences were computed by bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrapping. Results The mean intervention costs, paid by the employer, were 59 euro per participant in the intervention and 28 euro in the usual care group. Mean total health care and non-health care costs per participant were 108 euro in both groups. As to the cost-effectiveness, improvement in received information on healthy computer use as well as in their work posture and movement was observed at higher costs. With regard to the other risk factors, symptoms and sick leave, only small and non-significant effects were found. Conclusions In this study, the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> intervention programme did not prove to be cost-effective from the both the societal and companies' perspective and, therefore, this study does not provide a financial reason for implementing this intervention. However, with a relatively small investment, the programme did increase the number of workers who received information on healthy computer use and improved their work posture and movement.

40|$|Decision Support Tools (DST) {{are a key}} {{instrument}} for preparing legislative proposals and policy initiatives. They provide insight about options, conflicts, synergies and trade-offs between issues, sectors and regions at multiple scales. DST range from integrated systems modelling to value-based knowledge systems resulting from expert groups. The results of the expert groups do not provide regional differentiation {{making it difficult to}} obtain useful insights for policy making. The ‘black-box’ complex tools are found not transparent by the decision makers that seek to understand the modelling behind the results to be able to cope with the scientific uncertainty and changing policy context. In addition, the policy questions need to be answered in a short period to fit the time horizon of policy making, e. g. a couple of months, which is possible with expert groups, but the complex models are often not ready to deal with this urgency. The <b>QUICKScan</b> tool aims at filling the gap in the pallet of available tools by defining a methodology -supported by modelling software to visualize quantitative and value-based modelling in the decision process. The tool enables the creation of alternative storylines for policy questions by the stakeholders, and translates these in-situ into a model by combining tacit expert knowledge with available spatial explicit monitoring- and statistical-data. <b>QUICKScan</b> builds on concepts from Participatory Modelling and Participatory GIS and uses visualisation and interpretation tools which are essential to support the exploration of options allowing and facilitating the discussion and interaction on the definition of alternatives, analysing their consequences, determining trade-offs and synergies and compare the consequences of alternatives. The <b>QUICKScan</b> tool is designed to calculate fast, and therefor perform multiple iterations of a modelling exercise during a workshop. The results of each iteration feed the discussion among stakeholders and policy makers creating input for a next iteration...|$|E

A focused group discussion was utilised to determine stakeholders’ views of the cascade framework and pre- and post-workshop questionnaires quantified the stakeholders’ views of the <b>QUICKScan</b> method. The stakeholders identified both positive and negative aspects of both tools. The diversity of views expressed were associated with (i) the past experience of the individual with the issues discussed, (ii) the technical aspects of the tools i. e. the ability with GIS and (iii) the level of new shared knowledge they reported acquiring on the day which was related to their initial knowledge of the issue and area studied...|$|E

30|$|When the {{opinions}} of the coordinators, professors and students are compared, it can be observed that the professors were the most positive group of the three because they partly agreed with most of the aspects related to the presence of sustainability in the institution. The students showed insecurity at the moment they were asked to affirm something about sustainability at UPF, showing a lack of knowledge about the subject or even about the activities that are being developed at the university. This became clear as most of the students’ answers were “neither agree nor disagree”. The more negative evaluation of the coordinators in some aspects could be a reflection of the instrument of evaluation. The coordinators evaluate the courses through the vision of AISHE, which is far more detailed than <b>quickscan.</b> Because of this, even if they are covering the same subjects, the instruments use different evaluation scales, which make it difficult to make comparisons.|$|E

40|$|Background. Arm, {{shoulder}} and neck symptoms are very prevalent among computer workers. In {{an attempt to}} reduce these symptoms, a large occupational health service in the Netherlands developed a preventive programme on exposure to risk factors, prevalence of arm, {{shoulder and}} neck symptoms, and sick leave in computer workers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effectiveness of this intervention programme. Methods. The study was a randomised controlled trial. The participants were assigned to either the intervention group or the usual care group by means of cluster randomisation. At baseline and after 12 months of follow-up, the participants completed the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> questionnaire on exposure to the risk factors and on the prevalence of arm, shoulder and neck symptoms. A tailor-made intervention programme was proposed to participants with a high risk profile at baseline. Examples of implemented interventions are an individual workstation check, a visit to the occupational health physician and an education programme on the prevention of arm, shoulder and neck symptoms. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of arm, shoulder and neck symptoms. Secondary outcome measures were the scores on risk factors for arm, shoulder and neck symptoms and the number of days of sick leave. Sick leave data was obtained from the companies. Multilevel analyses were used to test the effectiveness. Results. Of the 1, 673 persons invited to participate in the study, 1, 183 persons (71 %) completed the baseline questionnaire and 741 persons participated at baseline as well as at 12 -month follow-up. At 12 -month follow-up, the intervention group showed a significant positive change (OR = 0. 48) in receiving information on healthy computer use, as well as a significant positive change regarding risk indicators for work posture and movement, compared to the usual care group. There were no significant differences in changes in the prevalence of arm, shoulder and neck symptoms or sick leave between the intervention and usual care group. Conclusions. The effects of the RSI <b>QuickScan</b> intervention programme were small, possibly as a result of difficulties with the implementation process of the proposed interventions.

40|$|Aim: There is a {{need for}} service {{providers}} to gain insight into the implementation of a Strength-Based Approach (SBA) in clinical practice. Key elements of SBA are the focus on clients’ wishes, strengths, capacities and on positive behavioral interventions in client support plans and in staff’s SBA attitudes and knowledge. Method: We developed and tested the <b>Quickscan</b> Strength-Based Approach (Q-SBA), a survey instrument that measures the implementation of SBA in group homes. The Q-SBA examines client support plans, and staff’s SBA attitudes and knowledge were assessed in interviews and questionnaires. Results: Analyses showed that the Q-SBA is a reliable and valid instrument to measure SBA in group homes. Overall, SBA implementation scores in client support plans, and staff’s SBA attitudes and knowledge in interviews and questionnaires are positively related to each other. Furthermore, staff members score higher on SBA attitudes and knowledge compared to integrating SBA elements into client support plans. Conclusion: The Q-SBA is a useful tool to measure the level of the SBA provided in group homes and to provide feedback for clinical practice to help improve the implementation of SBA, for instance using coaching on the job...|$|E
40|$|In 2009 a “BIM QuickScan” for {{benchmarking}} BIM {{performance was}} created in the Netherlands (Sebastian, Berlo 2010). This instrument aims to provide insight into the current BIM performance of a company. The benchmarking instrument combines quantitative and qualitative assessments of the ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ aspects of BIM. The use of this instrument by BIM consultants in the Netherlands has taken place since early 2010. Since then, 130 scans were done within companies in different sectors that use BIM. 682 self-scans were also completed on the website. All the data of the scans, and the results were stored in a database. The overall conclusion that is drawn from the data is that the average level of BIM in The Netherlands is fairly high. On an organizational level, {{as well as in the}} mentality and culture of companies, a high BIM level is reached. However, the BIM level in the chapter Tools and applications falls behind in comparison to the maximum potential. In order to facilitate the release of the full potential of BIM in The Netherlands, further research needs to be conducted. The BIM <b>QuickScan</b> will continue to be used in the future in order to monitor the state of art of BIM in The Netherlands...|$|E
