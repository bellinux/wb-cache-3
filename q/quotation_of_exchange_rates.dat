The hypothesis of a Wiener geometric process applied to <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> has become doubtful at the beginning of the nineties, fact determined by a high leptokurtosis of the empirical distributions.

The analysis takes into account daily <b>quotations</b> <b>of</b> EUR/RON <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> over the period of 04 th January 1999 to 13 th June 2016. Thus, we are modeling heteroscedasticity by applying different specifications of GARCH models followed by looking for significant parameters and low information criteria (minimum Akaike Information Criterion). All models are estimated using the maximum likelihood method under the assumption of several distributions of the innovation terms such as: Normal (Gaussian) distribution, Student’s t distribution, Generalized Error distribution (GED), Student’s with fixed df.

The predominant models turned out to be EGARCH and PARCH models, and the empirical results point out that the best model for estimating daily returns <b>of</b> EUR/RON <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is EGARCH(2, 1) with Asymmetric order 2 under the assumption of Student’s t distributed innovation terms.

The paper uses a standard acceleration Phillips Curve model to define overvaluation {{and find that}} the Bank of England was able to maintain an overvalued parity for six years without any speculation against the Pound. Attacks on the U. S. Dollar and the French Franc began immediately after the English devalued in 1931 (see Figures 12 and 13). The measure of speculation is covered interest parity.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{volatility}} <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure and its associated risk have become a hot issue in international financial management. It is often assumed that a firm’s future operating cash flows is proxied by its market value, and the exposure coe fficient {{would be able to}} ef ficiently measure the impact <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes on a firm’s return and its se nsitivity to the changes. Recen tly, some studies begin to investigate whether <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure is asymmetric between currency appreciations and depreciations. By far most existing studies on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure assume that the variances of a firm’s returns and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> changes are time-invariant. In this paper, we assess empirically the validity of this assumption, and argue that the conven iently defined <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure is inadequate for measuring the entire impact <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes on a firm’s future operating cash flows in cases of time-varying variances. There are at least four alternative routes through which a firm’s returns are exposed to foreign exchange risks when the vari ances are time-variant. The four aspects <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure or the mu lti-elements <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure are defines as follows: • the first route is that a firm’s stock returns are e xposed to the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes either directly or indirectly through its business linkages with other firms. • the second route captures the exposure to the volatility <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, namely, the sensitivity of a firm’s value to the degree <b>of</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates.</b> If the degree of fluctuations is time-varying, the firm may react to change its marketing, production location and hedging strategies. • the third level <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure measures the sensitivity of conditional variance of the returns to the volatility <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes. Even if the second relationship is absent, as long as the conditional variances of returns are exposed to volatility <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes and the returns are sensitive to its own volatility changes, there still exists the possibility of an indirect impact <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility on returns. As a consequence, the firm may have to re-assess and even change its current business strategies which may in turn affect its profitability. • The fourth route indicates the time-varying conditional correlation between returns and <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, through which the dynamics <b>of</b> a firm’s <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure will be captured. We employ the bivariate GJR-GARCH-M models to inves tigate the four aspects <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure, by using data of the daily industrial indexes of ten sectors in Japan during the period from 1992 to 2000. The results indicate that there are cases which are not exposed to currency risk under the conventional measure (exposure coefficient), but significantly exposed to currency risk through the alternative routes identified we find significant evidence <b>of</b> such <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> exposure which is not captured by the conventional measure.

However, the results should be interpreted with caution as the history <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility is still relatively young compared with the developed countries...|$|R

With the monthly data of Euro/US dollar and Japanese yen/US dollar, our linear analysis demonstrates the monetary model is a long-run description <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, and our nonlinear modelling suggests the error correction model describes the short-run adjustment <b>of</b> deviations <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> and monetary fundamentals are capable <b>of</b> explaining <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics under an unrestricted framework...|$|R
