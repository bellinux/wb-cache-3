5|$|The {{application}} {{of quantum mechanics}} to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory. In particle physics, <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories {{form the basis for}} our understanding of elementary particles, which are modeled as excitations in the fundamental fields. <b>Quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called quasiparticles.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the (2,0)-theory {{has proven}} to be {{important}} for studying the general properties of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories. Indeed, this theory subsumes many mathematically interesting effective <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories and points to new dualities relating these theories. For example, Luis Alday, Davide Gaiotto, and Yuji Tachikawa showed that by compactifying this theory on a surface, one obtains a four-dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory, and there is a duality known as the AGT correspondence which relates the physics of this theory to certain physical concepts associated with the surface itself. More recently, theorists have extended these ideas to study the theories obtained by compactifying down to three dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

However, not only the phenomena {{emerge from the}} <b>quantum</b> <b>fields,</b> {{the law of the}} conservation of energy must have its origin from the same spatial structure.

40|$|We {{show how}} <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> {{can be used}} to measure the {{curvature}} of spacetime. In particular, we find that knowledge of the imprint that spacetime curvature leaves in the correlators of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> suffices, in principle, to reconstruct the metric. We then consider the possibility that the <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> obey a natural ultraviolet cutoff, for example, at the Planck scale. We investigate how such a cutoff limits the spatial resolution with which curvature can be deduced from the properties of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields.</b> We find that the metric deduced from the quantum correlator exhibits a peculiar scaling behavior as the scale of the natural UV cutoff is approached...|$|R
40|$|In {{this essay}} we {{conjecture}} that <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> {{such as the}} Higgs field is related to a restricted Boltzmann machine for deep neural networks. An accelerating Rindler observer in a flat spacetime sees the <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> having a thermal distribution from the quantum entanglement, and a renormalization group process for the thermal fields on a lattice {{is similar to a}} deep learning algorithm. This correspondence can be generalized for the KMS states of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> in a curved spacetime like a black hole...|$|R
5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (<b>quantum)</b> <b>field</b> theory of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|In <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory, one {{typically}} computes the {{probabilities of}} various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories, {{which form}} the basis of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{developing}} a non-perturbative formulation of string theory {{was one of the}} original motivations for studying the AdS/CFT correspondence. As explained above, the correspondence provides several examples of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theories which are equivalent to string theory on anti-de Sitter space. One can alternatively view this correspondence as providing a definition of string theory in the special case where the gravitational field is asymptotically anti-de Sitter (that is, when the gravitational field resembles that of anti-de Sitter space at spatial infinity). Physically interesting quantities in string theory are defined in terms of quantities in the dual <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory.|$|E

5|$|Renormalizability {{has become}} an {{essential}} criterion for a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory to {{be considered as a}} viable one. All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except gravitation whose quantum counterpart is presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.|$|E
5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, {{theorists have}} {{discovered}} many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions. The theories involved {{are generally not}} viable models of the real world, but they have certain features, such as their particle content or high degree of symmetry, which make them useful for solving problems in <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory and quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues. This {{is one of the}} motivations for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
40|$|We {{recall and}} generalize the {{analysis}} of the output of the so-called balanced homodyne detectors. The most important feature of these detectors is their ability to quantify the vacuum fluctuations of the electric field, that is expectation values of products of (quantum-) electric-field operators. More precisely, the output of BHDs provides information on the one- and two-point functions of arbitrary states of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields.</b> We generalize {{the analysis of}} the response of BHDs to the case of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> under influence of static external conditions such as cavities or polarizable media. By recalling the expressions for two-point functions of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> in Casimir geometries we show, that a rich, position- and frequency-dependent pattern of BHD responses is predicted for ground states. This points to a potentially new characterization of <b>quantum</b> <b>fields</b> in Casimir setups which would not only complement the current global methods (Casimir forces), but also improve understanding of sub-vacuum energy densities present in some regions in these geometries.

5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that {{some aspects of}} matrix models and M-theory are {{described}} by a noncommutative <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> theory, {{a special kind of}} physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension.
