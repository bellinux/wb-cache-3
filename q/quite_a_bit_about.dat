Among the larger uncertainties that can effect an infrared temperature measurement are emissivity, spectral response, blackbody or gray body temperature uncertainty, optical scatter, size of source effect, and transfer standard uncertainty. Emissivity coupled with spectral response when measuring a non-blackbody can be especially troublesome since emissivity can vary with wavelength. There are other factors that are minor contributors to uncertainty as well. For an adequate radiometric uncertainty budget, all of these uncertainties must be evaluated. This paper discussions the calculation of uncertainty budgets for infrared thermometry in an industrial application. It discusses the measurement equation used for uncertainty budget calculation and covers the merits of using this equation as opposed to other equations. It goes into the major uncertainties in these infrared uncertainty budgets and speaks to how they are applied to the measurement equation. 1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> {{is known}} <b>about</b> {{minimizing}} {{different kinds of}} regret in experts problems, and how these regret types relate to types of equilibria in the multiagent setting of repeated matrix games. Much less {{is known about the}} possible kinds of regret in online convex programming problems (OCPs), or about equilibria in the analogous multiagent setting of repeated convex games. This gap is unfortunate, since convex games are much more expressive than matrix games, and since many important machine learning problems can be expressed as OCPs. In this paper, we work to close this gap: we analyze a spectrum of regret types which lie between external and swap regret, along with their corresponding equilibria, which lie between coarse correlated and correlated equilibrium. We also analyze algorithms for minimizing these regret types. As examples of our framework, we derive algorithms for learning correlated equilibria in polyhedral convex games and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. The former is exponentially more efficient than previous algorithms, and the latter is the first of its type. 1...|$|R

In the finite-dimensional case, the polynomial functional calculus yields <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of information <b>about</b> the operator. For example, consider the family of polynomials which annihilates an operator T. This family is an ideal in the ring of polynomials. Furthermore, it is a nontrivial ideal: let n be the finite dimension of the algebra of matrices, then {I, T, T2...Tn} is linearly dependent. So ∑ αi Ti = 0 for some scalars αi, not all equal to 0. This implies that the polynomial ∑ αi xi lies in the ideal. Since the ring of polynomials is a principal ideal domain, this ideal is generated by some polynomial m. Multiplying by a unit if necessary, we can choose m to be monic. When this is done, the polynomial m is precisely the minimal polynomial of T. This polynomial gives deep information about T. For instance, a scalar α is an eigenvalue of T {{if and only if}} α is a root of m. Also, sometimes m can be used to calculate the exponential of T efficiently.|$|R
