The component E_j of the color-electric field strength in the direction parallel to the <b>Q</b> Q̅ <b>axis</b> is calculated.

40|$|First {{observed}} by von Goeler et al. in 1974 [1], the sawtooth instability {{has not yet}} been en-tirely understood. Sawteeth are macroscopic relaxation-oscillations affecting the core of toka-mak plasmas. A sawtooth cycle starts with a ramp phase where the plasma core density and electron temperature increase slowly, which later is accompanied by the rise of a (m= 1, n= 1) helical perturbation and then is suddenly terminated by a fast drop of the core density and elec-tron temperature. A detailed overview of this topic can be found, for example, in [2] and [3]. One attempt to explain the sudden temperature crash and the subsequent stabilization is B. B. Kadomtsev’s model of complete sawtooth reconnection [4]. According to this model, the rising core temperature causes the safety factor (<b>q)</b> on <b>axis</b> to drop below unity which destabi-lizes the (1, 1) internal kink leading to a (1, 1) magnetic island. Surfaces of equal helical magnetic flux reconnect until the island has replaced the core yielding a stable configuration where the island O-point has become the new magnetic axis. The central temperature drop is explained by the hot core being expelled. The complete reconnection model thus predicts the central safety factor to be unity af-ter the sawtooth crash, which has been contradicted by measurement results in several toka...|$|R

Figure 1 (a) shows how this phase discrimination can help in liftoff noise suppression. Here, the oscilloscope traces the complex impedance of the probe. The impedance plane has been rotated so that the liftoff noise lies entirely in the horizontal channel. Now if we choose to look only at the signal in the vertical channel of the scope, or the Q channel (in phase quadrature with liftoff), there will be no liftoff noise. This, however, is not a very realistic picture. Figure 1 (b) is obtained when we try to detect much smaller flaws (in this case a closed crack of 20 mils in aluminum). We see that the trace of the liftoff noise has a curvature and that there are also fluctuations along the <b>Q</b> channel <b>axis.</b> Both of these effects eventually limit the detectability of small flaws.
