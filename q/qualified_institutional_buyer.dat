50|$|A <b>qualified</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>buyer</b> (QIB), in United States law and finance, is a {{purchaser}} {{of securities}} that is deemed financially sophisticated and is legally recognized by securities market regulators to need less protection from issuers than most public investors. Typically, the qualifications for this designation {{are based on}} an investor's total assets under management and specific legal conditions {{in the country where}} the fund is located. Rule 144A requires an institution to manage at least $100 million in securities from issuers not affiliated with the institution to be considered a QIB. If the institution is a bank or savings and loans thrift they must have a net worth of at least $25 million. If the institution is a registered dealer acting for its own account it must in the aggregate own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities of issuers not affiliated with the dealer.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{large sample}} of {{convertible}} and straight debt {{issues in the}} public, 144 A, and bank loan markets from 1991 to 2004, {{we find that the}} 144 A market has risen largely {{at the expense of the}} nonshelf public market, the overwhelming majority of the 144 A issues are subsequently registered, and straight debt issuers with the highest credit quality and transparency tend to use the shelf public market. Our findings suggest that firms' preference for speed of issuance drives the growth of the 144 A market, and banks and <b>qualified</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers</b> have advantages over public lenders in handling credit risk and information asymmetry.

40|$|The credit {{crisis of}} 2007 and 2008 has thrown much {{focus on the}} models used to price {{mortgage}} backed securities. Many institutions have relied heavily on the credit ratings provided by credit agency. The relationships between management of credit agencies and debt issuers may have resulted in conflict of interest when pricing these securities which has lead to incorrect risk assumptions and value expectations from <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers.</b> Despite the existence of sophisticated models, <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers</b> have relied on these ratings when considering the risks involved with these products.

40|$|South Africa's biggest {{challenge}} remains {{the high rate}} of unemployment especially among the country's youth. Small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) {{have been shown to be}} instrumental in many third world economies as a sustainable means not only to address unemployment but also to contribute significantly to economic growth. Despite government's good intentions and support, the South African SMME sector is not growing as expected and this is impacting negatively on unemployment creation in the country. Good business development services (BDS) is necessary to support SMMEs and specifically the Market Development Approach to the provision of BDS, where subsidies are replaced by private payment for services. Makana municipal area provided scope for analysing the constraints to the implementation of such business development services. Analysing the scope and magnitude of the constraints in this setting would contribute to understanding the constraints also in other parts of the country and help officials in local economic development make better informed decisions regarding support to SMMEs. Authors like Rogerson (2011), UNDP (2004), Miehlbradt and McVay, (2003), the Committee of Donor Agencies for SME Development (Blue book) (2001) and Bear et al., (2001) Gibson (2001), propose that the key to sustainable BDS is the implementation of the Market Development approach which focusses on for-profit activities in the provision of BDS to SMMEs. The aim of this study was to examine perceptions of key stakeholders towards SMME support and development, to identify the constraints to the implementation of a Market Development approach to the provision of business development services to SMMEs in the Makana area and to make recommendations to the Makana LED office of possible intervention strategies to address identified constraints. Purposive sampling was used to identify key stakeholders in SMME support in the Makana area in the categories of, big <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers,</b> public and private BDS providers as well the municipal LED office. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with each stakeholder using questions shown in appendixes A to D. Perceptions of all key stakeholders were very positive with good intentions to support SMMEs. However, this was not consistent with procurement practice at the big <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers.</b> Constraints are summarized in the following five themes: Theme 1. Inconsistent practice in dealing with SMMEs across the organisation. Theme 2. Absence of a cooperative body or Chamber of Commerce. Theme 3. Fragmented Business Development Services. Theme 4. A lack of a culture of cost recovery. Theme 5. Limited awareness of BDS in the Makana area. A number of recommendations were suggested. Big <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers</b> like Rhodes University and Makana municipality need to take a longer term view and move the focus from employment creation to enterprise support which is a more sustainable and empowering source of employment (ILO, 2009). The Grahamstown Chamber of Commerce should become more representative and big <b>institutional</b> <b>buyers</b> also need to be convinced of the value of private BDS. Stakeholders should work together to combine resources to offer a comprehensive one-stop BDS for the Makana area (Chetty, 2009) and this comprehensive BDS should be provided according to the Market Development approach focusing on those services that lend themselves better to this approach whilst using subsidies only for those services with a low potential for cost recovery (UNDP, 2004) ...|$|R
