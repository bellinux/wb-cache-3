40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} design process for {{incorporating}} data quality requirements into database schemas that {{is rooted in}} goal-oriented requirements analysis techniques, developed in the Requirement Engineering community over last 15 years. Goal-oriented approaches (i) offer a body of notations, techniques and processes for modeling, analyzing and operationalizing quality requirements; (ii) support representation and evaluation of alternatives in goal fulfillment; and (iii) provide automated reasoning tools for various analysis and design tasks. This paper extends existing proposals for addressing data/information quality issues during database requirements analysis and design in two ways. First, we consider {{a broader range of}} <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> data <b>requirements,</b> which can be classified as restrictive, descriptive, supportive and reflective. Second, we offer a systematic way to operationalize high-level, abstract quality goals into operational, concrete <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> data <b>requirements</b> plus standard operating procedures, based on a risk-based analysis. In an earlier paper, we presented a goal-oriented conceptual database design approach, focusing on deriving an ordinary conceptual schema from application-specific goals. In this paper, we take the next step to incorporate quality goals into the design process. The proposed quality design process is illustrated step-by-step using a meeting expense database example. We also show how this process fits into the overall goal-oriented conceptual database design approach to offer an integrated framework for analyzing both application-specific and <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> data <b>requirements...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Quality</b> <b>assurance</b> {{techniques}} {{have to be}} carefully considered and adopted for each software artifact, from requirements specifications to final system deliverables. <b>Quality</b> <b>assurance</b> for <b>requirements,</b> especially, is of utmost importance; one unidentified defect in requirements can propagate to {{a wide spectrum of}} actual code, making it tremendously harder and costly to identify it in the later stage of software development. Nevertheless, traditional <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> activities for <b>requirements</b> largely depend on manual techniques, and, thus, it is hard for them to cope with the growing software complexity.

The aim is to do survey on existing integration methods that increase the assurance level with a cost-effective and usable process. To this end, we first identify quality criteria for requirements in general, present existing formal and informal techniques to achieve high quality requirements, and do a survey on general integration frameworks for applying different assurance techniques on different quality aspects. This survey first summarizes general integrated assurance approaches, followed by existing approaches to combine formal and informal verification methods in a limited scope: Use Case analysis is used as an example...|$|R
