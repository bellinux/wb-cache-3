50|$|One {{lesson that}} was learnt from World War I was that {{although}} the navy could stop ships on the open seas, little could be done about traders who acted as the middleman, importing materials the Nazis needed into their own neutral country then transporting it overland to Germany for a profit. Leigh-Ross spent the months before the war compiling a massive dossier on the annual quantities of materials the countries bordering Germany normally imported so that if they exceeded these levels in wartime, pressure could be brought on the authorities in those countries to take action. Diplomats from the Scandinavian nations, as well as Italy and the Balkan countries, who were also major suppliers to Germany, were given <b>quota</b> <b>lists</b> of various commodities and told they could import these amounts and no more, or action would be taken against them.|$|R

50|$|The work of {{the actual}} {{inspection}} of cargoes {{was carried out by}} customs officers and Royal Naval officers and men who, together with their ships, were assigned to Contraband Control for various periods of duty. The job of Control Officer required great tact in the face of irate and defiant neutral skippers, particularly Dutch and Scandinavians who had a long tradition of trade with Germany. Contraband Control patrols dotted all practical sea routes, stopping all neutral ships, and making life very difficult for any who tried to slip by, forcing them into ports and laying them up for days before inspection, in some cases ruining perishable goods. Control ports were often very overcrowded, teleprinters constantly sending out cargo listings and manifests to be checked against import <b>quota</b> <b>lists.</b> Even for innocent ships, a delay of a day or two was inevitable; Contraband Control officers were under instructions to be extremely polite and apologetic to all concerned. Neutral captains often expressed utter astonishment and bemusement at the level of British advance knowledge of their activities, and soon realised it was hard to hide anything. Although numerous attempts were made to bypass the blockade, the net was extremely hard to avoid, and most neutral captains voluntarily stopped at one of the eight Allied Contraband Control ports.|$|R

When a nation has received the maximum of 5 male quotas or four female quotas, its athletes won't count on the allocation list. After the 60 male and 30 female quotas are distributed, if there are less than 12 NOCs with at least four competitors allocated quota places, the next nation with three allocated quota places will {{be allocated}} an additional quota place.

40|$|Female {{under-representation}} {{in politics}} {{can be the}} result of parties 2 ̆ 019 selection of candidates and/or of voters 2 ̆ 019 electoral preferences. To assess the impact of these two channels, we exploit the introduction of Italian Law 215 / 2013, which prescribes both gender <b>quotas</b> on candidate <b>lists</b> and double preference voting conditioned on gender. Using a Regression Discontinuity Design, we estimate that the law increases the share of elected female politicians by 22 percentage points. The result is driven by the increase in preference votes cast for female candidates, suggesting a salient role of double preference voting in promoting female empowerment in politics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} within-board gender inequality following {{the adoption of a}} board-level gender <b>quota</b> for French <b>listed</b> companies in 2011.

However, conditional on these characteristics, we provide evidence that female new comers are less likely that their male counterparts (both seasoned and new comers) to hold key positions within boards (namely, audit, compensation and nominating committee membership and chairing). This positional segregation is the main driver of a within-firm gender fees gap that amounts to 5. 5 % post-quota, as against 3. 3 % pre-quota...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of gender <b>quotas</b> in electoral <b>lists,</b> like the recent “parity law” in France, can be fully rationalized {{on the basis}} of the self interest of male incumbent politicians. This paper explains why the parity law was approved in its form and, at the same time, why it has not been very effective. The existence of a voters’ bias in favor of male candidates is sufficient to convince the incumbents to advocate for equal gender representation in party lists, because it raises the incumbents’ chances of being reelected. The existence of male bias in the French electorate is empirically confirmed in this paper. We also show that parity law may have assembly composition effects and policy effects that vary with the electoral system. ...|$|R
