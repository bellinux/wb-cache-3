5000|$|Landing or Platform : A landing is {{the area}} of a floor near the top or bottom step of a stair. An {{intermediate}} landing is a small platform that is built {{as part of the}} stair between main floor levels and is typically used to allow stairs to change directions, or to allow the user a rest. A half landing is where a 180° change in direction is made, and a <b>quarter</b> <b>landing</b> is where a 90° change in direction is made (on an intermediate landing). As intermediate landings consume floor space they can be expensive to build. However, changing the direction of the stairs allows stairs to fit where they would not otherwise, or provides privacy to the upper level as visitors downstairs cannot simply look {{up the stairs to the}} upper level due to the change in direction. The word 'landing' is also commonly used for a general corridor in any of the floors above the ground floor of a building, even if that corridor is located well away from a staircase.|$|E
50|$|The chapel is set {{in pretty}} {{woodland}} some quarter mile from the busy A5 junction at Ty'n-y-cefn and maintained since 1990 by Cadw (a Welsh word meaning “to keep”, the historic environment service of the Welsh Assembly Government). On buying a joint ticket to see this chapel with the ancient church at Llangar, some three miles away, the visitor will assume that the chapel is as plain inside as out but {{nothing could be further}} from the truth. On passage through the heavy oak west door the visitor enters a very small porch with barely enough room for two people before a second timber door. On the right a wall holds a bell rope and to the left is a timber staircase leading through a <b>quarter</b> <b>landing</b> to the right and to the gallery. Taking the stairs will afford the visitor a remarkable view of a church so ornate and richly adorned to be completely in contrast to the plain exterior. Immediately and closely visible is the rood roof ornately decorated throughout with intertwining rose motifs. Wall panels are intricately carved and painted, elaborately carved and painted angels adorn the walls the colours bright and clear. (See Gallery).|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} find out how many sokhas were in the state, a census {{measured}} and counted the rented <b>lands.</b> <b>Quarters</b> of <b>land</b> that were planted for personal use were free from payment. Until the beginning of the 17th century, a peasant who lived and worked on the land owned by a government employee, just like a peasant living on their own land or state land, paid equally for each exploited <b>quarter</b> of <b>land.</b> This section of land was called living. At the beginning of the 17th century, the term living quarter was used not for the actual <b>quarter</b> of worked <b>land,</b> but for several whole farms in which more than a single quarter was planted.|$|R

It is located 7 miles from Swan <b>Quarter</b> <b>Landing</b> {{waterfront}} to the mouth of Swan Quarter Bay, before getting to Pamlico Sound. Swan Quarter is roughly 70 miles from Edenton and 160 miles from Raleigh (MapQuest nd) and has 122. 10 square miles of land area (USGS 2008). Map 1. Location of Swan Quarter, NC (US Census Bureau 2000) Historical/Background Originally known as “Swann’s Quarter, ” it was named after Samuel Swann, who settled in the area in the 1700 s. Swann’s Quarter was eventually shortened to Swan Quarter and became the seat of Hyde County in 1836 (Lemme and Piosczyk-Lemme nd). Like many other areas in North Carolina, Hyde County relied on the lumber industry and was the center of a “lumber boom ” in the late 1800 s (Hyde County nd). Since then farming, fishing, crabbing, and oystering have long been principal occupations (IWC-NET nd). 1 These community profiles have been created to serve as port descriptions in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for fisheries management actions.

50|$|Subscribers paid {{an annual}} rental, which covered {{switching}} fees and operator costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy {{was based on}} the <b>quarters</b> of <b>land</b> through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A <b>quarter</b> of <b>land</b> which had a line passing through it paid a 'straight' rate, and a <b>quarter</b> of <b>land</b> in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher 'take-off' rate. Since the 'straight' rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a special levy to pay back the debenture.|$|R
