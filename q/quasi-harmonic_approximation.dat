40|$|In {{material}} sciences, spectroscopic approaches combining {{ab initio}} calculations with experiments {{are commonly used}} to accurately analyze the experimental spectral data. Most state-of-the-art first-principle calculations are usually performed assuming an equilibrium static lattice. Yet, nuclear motion affects spectra even when reduced to the zero-point motion at 0 K. We propose a framework based on Density-Functional Theory that includes quantum thermal fluctuations in theoretical X- ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) and solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and allows to well describe temperature effects observed experimentally. Within the Born-Oppenheimer and <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximations,</b> we incorporate the nuclear motion by generating several non-equilibrium configurations from the dynamical matrix. The averaged calculated XANES and NMR spectral data have been compared to experiments in MgO, proof-of-principle compound. The good agreement obtained between experiments and calculations validates the developed approach, which suggests that calculating the XANES spectra at finite temperature by averaging individual non-equilibrium configurations is a suitable approximation. This study high- lights the relevance of phonon renormalization and the relative contributions of thermal expansion and nuclear dynamics on NMR and XANES spectra {{on a wide range}} of temperatures.

40|$|The {{shift in}} {{chemical}} equilibria due to isotope substitution is frequently exploited to obtain insight {{into a wide}} variety of chemical and physical processes. It is a purely quantum mechanical effect, which can be computed exactly using simulations based on the path integral formalism. Here we discuss how these techniques can be made dramatically more efficient, and how they ultimately outperform <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximations</b> to treat quantum liquids {{not only in terms of}} accuracy, but also in terms of computational cost. To achieve this goal we introduce path integral quantum mechanics estimators based on free energy perturbation, which enable the evaluation of isotope effects using only a single path integral molecular dynamics trajectory of the naturally abundant isotope. We use as an example the calculation of the free energy change associated with H/D and (16) O/(18) O substitutions in liquid water, and of the fractionation of those isotopes between the liquid and the vapor phase. In doing so, we demonstrate and discuss quantitatively the relative benefits of each approach, thereby providing a set of guidelines that should facilitate the choice of the most appropriate method in different, commonly encountered scenarios. The efficiency of the estimators we introduce and the analysis that we perform should in particular facilitate accurate ab initio calculation of isotope effects in condensed phase systems...|$|R

We demonstrate that the AGL method, which is significantly cheaper computationally compared to the fully ab initio approach, can reliably predict the ordinal ranking of the thermal conductivity for several different classes of semiconductor materials. We also find that for the set of 182 materials investigated in this work the Debye temperature, calculated with the AGL, is often a better predictor of the ordinal ranking of the experimental thermal conductivities than the calculated thermal conductivity. The Debye temperature is thus a potential descriptor for high-throughput screening of the thermal properties of materials. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figures, 12 table...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Quasi-{{harmonic}}</b> (QH) <b>approximation</b> uses harmonic vibrational frequencies omega(H,Q,V), computed at volumes V {{near the}} volume where the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) energy is minimum. When this {{is used in}} the harmonic free energy, QH approximation gives a good zeroth order theory of thermal expansion, and first order theory of bulk modulus. Here, n-th order means smaller than the leading term by n powers of epsilon, where epsilon is the ratio hbar omega(Q) /E(el) or kT/E(el), and E(el) is an electronic energy scale, typically 2 to 10 eV. Experiment often shows evidence for next order corrections. When such corrections are needed, anharmonic interactions must be included. The most accessible measure of anhamonicity is the quasiparticle (QP) energy, omega(Q,V,T), seen experimentally by vibrational spectroscopy. However, this cannot just be inserted into the harmonic free energy F(H). In this paper, a free energy formula is found which corrects the double-counting of anharmonic interactions that is made when F is approximated by F(H,omega(Q,V,T)). The term "QP thermodynamics" is used for this way of treating anharmonicity. It enables (n+ 1) -order corrections, if QH theory is accurate to order n. This procedure is used to give corrections to specific heat and volume thermal expansion. The QH formulas for isothermal and adiabatic bulk moduli are clarified, and the route to higher order corrections is indicated. Comment: 9 pages (includes 3 figures).

5000|$|Anharmonicity {{plays a role}} in lattice and {{molecular}} vibrations, in quantum oscillations (see [...] ), and in acoustics. The atoms in a molecule or a solid vibrate about their equilibrium positions. When these vibrations have small amplitudes they can be described by harmonic oscillators. However, when the vibrational amplitudes are large, for example at high temperatures, anharmonicity becomes important. An example of the effects of anharmonicity is the thermal expansion of solids, which is usually studied within the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Studying vibrating anharmonic systems using quantum mechanics is a computationally demanding task because anharmonicity not only makes the potential experienced by each oscillator more complicated, but also introduces coupling between the oscillators. It is possible to use first-principles methods such as density-functional theory to map the anharmonic potential experienced by the atoms in both molecules and solids. Accurate anharmonic vibrational energies can then be obtained by solving the anharmonic vibrational equations for the atoms within a mean-field theory. Finally, it is possible to use Møller-Plesset perturbation theory to go beyond the mean-field formalism.|$|E

This approximation allows to obtain thermodynamic information {{at a fraction}} of the computational cost of standard simulation methods, and at the same time permits studying quantum effects related to zero point vibrations of the atoms.

The flexible q-TIP 4 P/F model of water was employed for this study, although the results concerning the capability of the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation</b> are expected to be valid independently of the employed water model.

Background. This work {{is related}} to the {{theoretical}} calculation of the vacancy formation energy in the context of finding an answer to two unsolved questions. Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the vacancy formation energy. Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the vacancy formation energy and entropy of vacancy formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free energy of vacancy formation and its components in a number of metals within the <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Methods. The vacancy formation energy and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a <b>quasi-harmonic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Results. It was shown, that the vacancy formation energy substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the vacancy formation energy is compensated by the vibrational vacancy formation entropy contribution. The latter appears to be strongly increasing with temperature in the case of Mo. Conclusions. However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy formation energy in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature.
