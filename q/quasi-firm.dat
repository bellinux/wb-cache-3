40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{boundary}} of activities undertaken by Korean housebuilding firms. First, it examines the contractual relationships between housebuilding firms and contractors, focusing {{on the existence of}} <b>quasi-firm</b> type organization in the Korean housebuilding industry. Second, it looks at how far Korean housebuilding firms diversify into other activities outside the industry. Secondary data analysis and an interview survey, carried out over the period between 1980 and 1995, were used. The results show that Korean housebuilding firms depend on a traditional contractual relationship with contractors but that <b>quasi-firm</b> type organization is not established. On the other hand, housebuilding firms diversify into both related and unrelated business. This diversification could be a short-term 'survival strategy' under a regulated environment rather than a long-term 'growth strategy'. Organizational boundary, diversification, contracting, <b>quasi-firm,</b> housebuilding,...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry can be characterised as fragmented {{as a consequence}} of its project-based nature and its <b>quasi-firm</b> supply chain (Eccles, 1981). Industry fragmentation may be decreasing with a shift from projects being regarded as independent entities towards an industry with an integrated activity flow through the supply chain. Information Communication Technology (ICT) forms the `glue&# 039; that binds the project supply chain members together, enabling closer and more effective coordination of project teams. A closer virtual engagement through ICT, together with increased acceptance of relationship based procurement systems such as Project Alliancing, has further cemented the shift towards supply chain activity integration. In this paper, we outline four case studies of Australian construction companies that have effectively embraced ICT as a tool for more productive coordination of their project teams. Through their use of ICT, these companies are preparing to embrace the concept of a virtual organisation linked by ICT to facilitate efficient project communication and information exchange for decision-making. These case studies identify how senior management has directed global strategy for change {{and the extent to which}} they have empowered team members at multiple-levels throughout their organisations to shape strategy and its implementation...|$|E
30|$|In the {{examples}} of research groups that carry out social, civic, and cultural entrepreneurial activities, there is a similar process going on to that described by Etzkowitz (2003), when talking about <b>quasi-firms,</b> where research groups {{act as if they}} were companies, but without the prospect of or interest in financial gain. Professors take on the management activities, both internally, by coordinating the activities of students and specialists, and in seeking financial resources to sustain the research and activities.|$|R
30|$|Knorr-Cetina (1999) {{points out}} the {{collective}} dimension (team/group) in modern science, whether it be mono-, multi-, or trans-disciplinary, local or global, composed of researchers or non-specialists, or small or large. They affect the communication process and publicity in science. In their organizational procedures, scientific “facts” are constructed inside laboratories, where they examine reality and register the results, which are then evaluated and published {{in the form of}} papers and other scientific writing (Latour and Woolgar 1979; Latour 1987). The “inner logic” of academic development has pushed the university into expanding the focus from teaching to research and entrepreneurial activities, turning research groups into <b>quasi-firms</b> (Etzkowitz 2003).The specific characteristics of individual universities, such as the history, culture, internal values, and organizational identity contribute to the performance of the in-house research groups (Clarysse et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} industry is notorious for its (lack of) innovativeness. Many papers, reports and articles {{have been written}} on this subject already {{for more than three}} decades. The explanations presented can be summarized by such terms as fragmentation, segmentation and segregation when referring to the industries’ structure and by qualifications such as opportunistic, hostile, antagonistic and conflictive when referring to its culture. In this paper it is argued that the main reason for the innovation status quo {{is the fact that the}} {{construction industry}}, when compared to other industries, lacks real producers- producers who develop products and compete with each other in terms of these products. It is particularly this kind of competition which is identified as a source to stimulate innovation. In construction, production capabilities are tested on the market and not product capabilities. As a result, design decisions are not tested on the market. It is this flaw which is examined in this paper, and possible improvements are suggested. Endurable strategic alliances, as <b>quasi-firms,</b> are proposed as the equivalent of producers. Essential herein is the pivotal position of design. An organizational innovation as such could change the way business is done in the construction industry. It would alter its structure as well as its culture...|$|R
30|$|The {{trend towards}} {{entrepreneurial}} activities adopts various approaches in other Latin American universities and numerous examples {{along these lines}} can be mentioned. For example, {{in the case of}}  the Catholic University of Chile, devoted to deep change, the research groups have been operating as <b>quasi-firms,</b> but don`t launch start-up firms developing products, instead looking to obtain and manage the resources made available for science on a competitive basis, diversifying financial sources as a consequence of government cuts in the 80 s (Bernasconi, 2005). Then there are the numerous Brazilian universities, such as PUC-Rio, USP, UNICAP, UFRJ and others, that pursue entrepreneurial activities and academic excellence, organizing business incubators to nurture start-ups and spin-off companies and cooperative incubators to support the organization of cooperatives to generate jobs and educational and economic opportunities for excluded social sectors (Gonçalo, 1998; Almeida and Etzkowitz, 2012). The national educational policy implemented by the federal government created 17 more federal universities in various regions of the country and also established a progressive quota system in federal universities, as an affirmative action mechanism for Afro-Brazilians, indigenous peoples and students from poor families to study in those institutions, which in the past had been a traditional space for white and the rich/middle classes. In Argentina, the Buenos Aires University has been increasing its entrepreneurial activities and interacting with industry, as well as advancing the research and teaching activities (Fanelli and Estébanez, 2008).|$|R
