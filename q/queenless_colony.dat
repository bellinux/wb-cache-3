50|$|Queenless colonies {{therefore}} face a reproductive dilemma. Once {{a colony}} becomes queenless, some workers activate their ovaries within {{just four days}} and lay eggs in a last effort to ensure gene survival before the colony disappears via absconding behavior. In queenless colonies, worker policing decreases as all workers lay male eggs. However, the dilemma occurs when other workers parasitize a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony</b> and thus worker policing may be re-installed to some extent in this case. Workers that contribute resources and/or time to a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony</b> may succumb to the Concorde fallacy, in which investing in a colony with high rates of parasitism diminishes reproductive success {{and the benefits of}} remaining within that colony. Therefore, queenless colonies are observed to abscond within three weeks of losing a queen. This further supports the notion that Apis florea prefer to have a queenright colony and use worker policing as an ESS.|$|E

40|$|If a {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) colony {{loses its}} queen, worker bees develop their ovaries and produce male offspring [1].

To explore this hypothesis, we examined the behavior and physiology of queenless egg-laying workers. Queenless bees engaged in both personal reproduction and the social foraging and defense tasks that benefited their colony. Laying workers also had larger brood-food-producing and wax glands, showing metabolic investments in both colony maintenance and personal reproduction. Whereas in queenright colonies there is a very clear age-based pattern of division of labor between workers, in <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> the degree of individual specialization was much reduced. <b>Queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> functioned as a collective of reproductive and behaviorally generalist bees that cooperatively maintained and defended their nest.

Interestingly, in colonies of the red dwarf honey bee, Apis florea, the proportion of nonnatal workers increases significantly when the colonies become queenless, and these workers {{are more likely to}} have active ovaries and lay eggs than natal workers. As a result, queenless colonies are heavily parasitized with the eggs of nonnatal workers, but the origin of the parasitizing workers is currently unknown. Here we show that workers from queenless A. florea colonies are far more likely to leave their colony and join another colony compared with workers from queenright colonies. Choice experiments showed that these drifted workers are much more likely to join a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony</b> than a colony with a queen. Perhaps surprisingly, not many workers from queenright colonies joined queenless colonies despite the opportunity for direct reproduction in queenless colonies.

40|$|Summary. Although {{honeybee}} {{workers are}} usually infertile, in <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> some workers can develop ovaries and produce offspring. Therefore the classical Darwinian fitness of workers is not zero. Experimental {{studies in the}} Cape honey bce (Apis mellifera capensis) reveal a huge genetic variation for individual fitness of workers. The present study with a one locus, two allele model for reproductive dominance of workers shows that a balanced system between colony level and individual within colony selection plausibly explains the phenomenon of a high genetic variance of worker fitness. In particular, a frequent occurrcnce of <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> in the population leads to stable polymorphic equilibria.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{selection}} acts at the individual level but, there is heated debate over the relative importance of higher and lower levels of selection. Kin selection is the dominant paradigm explaining the evolution of cooperation. Whereby, individually detrimental traits can be selectively favored if they increase the fitness of genetic relatives. Kin selection operates at the individual level, biasing cooperation towards those sharing the most genes. However, kin selection may also act at the group level when efficiently functioning groups are more productive than dysfunctional ones, provided group success correlates to kin structure. Finally, kin selectioncan occur at the genome level within individuals, where paternally and maternally-inherited ￼genes may favor different behaviors and actions. The imprinting of genes to parent-of-origin could also have important ramifications for social evolution. Here, I exploit the conflict over male production in honey bees to examine how these three levels of selection operate. Honey bee workers could ‘police’ eggs laid by other workers either to maintain colony-level productivity, favor more closely related individuals or as a result of intragenomic conflict (i. e. the paternal genome favors laying, the maternal one favors policing). Firstly, I found that although African workers lay eggs more rapidly than European workers, there is no difference in their times to ovary activation. Significant effects of both the juvenile and adult social environment on ovary activation, suggest that environment has a larger effect on the propensity to activate ovaries rather than subspecies. Secondly, I mathematically simulated a typical eusocial colony where I varied the number of mates per queen, viability of worker-laid males, colony efficiency costs of reduced worker helping, and whether or not intragenomic conflict could be expressed. Genome level selection dominated over both individual and group levels, and group level selection was more significant than the individual level in determining when queens dominate male production. Thirdly, individual level selection predicts policing late into larval development whilst benefits accrued through colony efficiency predicts workers should stop policing viable larvae soon after hatching. To this end I reared queen and worker laid male larvae in a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony</b> and transferred male larvae, from both sources, of differing ages, into a queenright colony. Post transferal (4 and 24 h), I found that workers equally removed larvae regardless of age or maternal source. With the observed high efficiency of policing eggs, these results suggest no mechanism has evolved to police larvae. Alternatively, drones may have a higher level acceptance threshold than female larvae, due to the possibility that they are laid by workers. Finally, I examined genome level selection by crossing African and European honey bees and then placing the emerging worker offspring into a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony.</b> I observed behavior from day 8 to 28 and collected marked workers on day 16 and 28. I predicted that parent-of-origin effects would occur, but instead found workers of both crosses have higher levels of ovarial development than their purebred counterparts. This suggests an imprinting mismatch such that only the paternal imprint is expressed. Together these results indicate that selection is acting at levels besides that of the individual. Continued research is needed to understand how selection, interacting over multiple levels, impacts behavior, across the animal kingdom...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the relative {{contribution of the}} queen and workers to colony nestmate recognition cues and on colony insularity in the Carpenter ant Camponotus fellah. Workers were either individually isolated, preventing contact with both queen and workers (colonial deprived, CD), kept in queenless groups, allowing only worker-worker interactions (queen deprived, QD) or in queenright (QR) groups. Two weeks post-separation QD and QR workers were amicable towards each other but both rejected their CD nestmates, {{which suggests that the}} queen does not measurably influence the colony recognition cues. By contrast, aggression between QD and QR workers from the same original colony was apparent only after six months of separation. This clearly demonstrates the power of the Gestalt and indicates that the queen is not a dominant contributor to the nestmate recognition cues in this species. Aggression between nestmates was correlated with a greater hydrocarbon (HC) profile divergence for CD than for QD and QR workers, supporting the importance of worker-worker interactions in maintaining the colony Gestalt odour. While the queen does not significantly influence nestmate recognition cues, she does influence colony insularity since within 3 days QD (queenless for six months) workers from different colony origins merged to form a single <b>queenless</b> <b>colony.</b> By contrast, the corresponding QR colonies maintained their territoriality and did not merge.

40|$|Colonies of the primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata {{consist of}} a single egg layer (queen) {{and a number of}} non-egg-laying workers.

If the queen is lost or removed, one and only one of the workers potential queen (PQ) ] becomes hyperaggressive and will become the next queen of the colony. The PQ is almost never challenged because she first becomes hyperaggressive and then gradually loses her aggression, develops her ovaries, and starts laying eggs. Although we are unable to identify the PQ when the queen is present, she appears to be a ``cryptic heir designate. '' Here, we show that there is not just one heir designate but a long reproductive queue and that PQs take over the role of egg-laying, successively, without overt conflict, as the queen or previous PQs are removed. The dominance rank of an individual is not a significant predictor of its position in the succession hierarchy. The age of an individual is a significant predictor, but it is not a perfect predictor because PQs often bypass older individuals to become successors.

40|$|In honeybees, worker {{policing}} via egg eating enforces functional worker sterility in colonies with a {{queen and}} brood. It {{is thought that}} queens mark their eggs with a chemical signal, indicating that their eggs are queen-laid. Worker-laid eggs lack this signal and are, therefore, eaten by policing workers. Anarchistic worker honeybees have been hypothesized to circumvent worker policing by mimicking the queen egg-marking signal. We investigated this phenomenon by relating chemical profiles of workers and their eggs to egg acceptability. We found that the ability of some workers (anarchistic workers in queenright colonies and deviant workers from a <b>queenless</b> <b>colony)</b> to lay more acceptable eggs is due to them producing significant amounts of queen-like esters from their Dufour’s gland. These esters appear {{to be transferred to}} eggs during laying and increase egg survival. However, these esters cannot be the normal queen egg-marking signal, as they are generally absent from queen-laid eggs and only increase the short-term persistence of worker-laid eggs, because only 7 – 30 % of anarchistic worker-laid eggs persisted to hatching versus 91 – 92 % of queen-laid eggs. All workers can produce some esters, but only workers that greatly increase their ester production lay more acceptable eggs. The production of esters appears to be a flexible response, as anarchistic workers reared in queenless colonies did not increase their ester production, while some deviant workers in queenless colonies did increase their ester production.

Thorne Department of Entomology The eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) {{is a major}} decomposer of wood and a significant pest of lumber and paper. Despite its economic and ecological importance, key aspects of its colony dynamics are poorly understood. In 1993, laboratory colonies were initiated with alate pairs. In 2003, the colonies contained an average of 12, 600 individuals. Ninety-seven percent of kings and 72 % of primary queens survived; 29 % of colonies contained replacement female reproductives. In addition to providing unprecedented demographic information regarding colony growth rate and longevity, lifespan of founding reproductives, and the response of colonies {{to the loss of}} primary kings and queens, these complete colonies demonstrated foraging and nesting activities of socially intact families. The laboratory colonies foraged in multi-resource networks. Travel between the resource nodes was observed, and after 30 weeks all spatial networks were censused. None of the castes was distributed equally among the three resources. Reproductives, which were found in a satellite node in 71 % of colonies, and brood did not share the same node {{a significant portion of the}} time, suggesting that the nesting strategy was polydomous rather than monodomous. Mark-recapture data indicate that workers were significantly more likely to be found in the resource where they had been located previously, indicating i) they feed non-randomly among the multiple resources and ii) they feed extensively at one location rather than shuttling regularly between satellite- and central nodes (as in a central-place foraging model). Such site fidelity violates an assumption of the Lincoln Index, leading to significant misestimation of actual colony population totals established by census. Worker genotypes, as determined by microsatellite markers, indicate that despite the absence of obvious physical isolation, genetic differentiation had occurred among the workers in one of the queenless colonies. Inbreeding coefficients generated by the <b>queenless</b> <b>colony</b> genotypes did not differ significantly from the predicted F-statistics for colonies of similar breeding structure, confirming that sampled workers can accurately estimate the breeding regime of field populations...|$|E
50|$|While {{the queen}} {{controls}} {{much of the}} egg laying and larval development in the colony, {{it is likely that}} workers play a much bigger role in controlling egg laying than previously thought. Dominant workers will often inhibit younger workers from laying eggs. Workers have low levels of JH and ovarian development during {{the early stages of the}} colony cycle and also after the competition point. Workers introduced into queenright and <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> experience similar levels of inhibition from fellow workers during the competition point, indicating the key role of worker policing of fellow nest mates later in the colony cycle. This suggests that worker reproductive development will be highest between early development and the competition point in the colony.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEusocial insect {{societies}} {{display a}} remarkable reproductive {{division of labor}} between a single fertile queen and thousands of largely sterile workers. In most species, however, the workers retain the capacity to reproduce, particularly in <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies</b> where typically many workers lay eggs. As yet, the molecular determinants that initiate this shift in worker fertility are still poorly documented. By using RNA interference we here demonstrate that the knockdown of epidermal growth factor receptor, a gene which was previously shown {{to be involved in}} queen-worker caste differentiation, also induces reproduction in worker honeybees (Apis mellifera). These data show that worker fertility and queen-worker caste determination partly rely on the same gene regulatory networks, thereby providing a major breakthrough in our understanding of the molecular determinants of the social insects’ spectacular reproductive division of labor...|$|R
40|$|In six {{colonies of}} Apis cerana the queen was removed and {{occurrence}} of egg-laying by workers was studied. Three colonies had brood of all stages and were thus allowed to build emergency queen cells and to rear queens. In three other colonies no young brood to build emergency queen cells was left (hopelessly queenless), but older brood was present. Workers started laying within {{two to three}} days after removal of the queen, both in the colonies rearing queens and in the hopelessly <b>queenless</b> <b>colonies.</b> Four to five days after removal of the queen mass egg-laying by workers occurred in five of the six colonies. These eggs partly developed into capped drone brood. Thus, A. cerana workers may produce a substantial number of drones during short periods of queenlessness, even when new queens are reared simultaneously...|$|R
