5|$|Before the {{building}} of St James', Sydney's growing population had been served by St Philip's Church, York Street.

5|$|Despite this reserve, early {{settlers}} {{extended their}} fences to the river. In 1791, the Land Board ordered that the fences be removed {{to permit the}} reserve's use as a public road. The Niagara Road <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> primary route between Fort Erie and Fort George. Its importance grew with the declaration of war against the Americans in June 1812. During the war, the road became vital for the movement of militia and supplies, and accordingly {{it was one of}} the primary frontiers of the war.|$|E

The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|E

Ahl released BASIC Computer Games, a book of games written in the BASIC programming language and the first million-selling computer book, which included his version of The Sumer Game. This expanded version of the game, titled Hamurabi, <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> more prominent version due to the popularity of both {{the book and the}} programming language. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|An {{understanding}} of the artistic personality of Gasparo Cairano has to be mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He {{can be referred to}} as a novice artist at the beginning, when the Lombard migrant, like many of his contemporaries, arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That historic moment, with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta.|$|E
5|$|Bill Lear {{distributed}} the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, {{the result of}} which became the Stereo8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double {{the speed of the}} Stereo8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo8 <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966.|$|E

5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber {{and have not}} survived. Hundreds of stone churches in the Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> material of choice. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the United States {{produced}} more than 90% of commercially usable helium in the world, while extraction plants in Canada, Poland, Russia, and other nations produced the remainder. In the mid-1990s, a new plant in Arzew, Algeria, producing 17million cubic meters (600million cubic feet) began operation, with enough production to cover all of Europe's demand. Meanwhile, by 2000, the consumption of helium within the U.S. had risen to more than 15 million kg per year. In 2004–2006, additional plants in Ras Laffan, Qatar, and Skikda, Algeria were built. Algeria <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> second leading producer of helium. Through this time, both helium consumption {{and the costs of}} producing helium increased. From 2002 to 2007 helium prices doubled.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

5|$|Mineirão (officially Estádio Governador Magalhães Pinto) {{opened in}} 1965, and <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> home of both Atlético and Cruzeiro, as its peak {{capacity}} of over 100,000 spectators surpassed any other stadium in Belo Horizonte {{or in the}} state. The property {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Mineirão was Atlético's home from its opening until it closed in 2010 for renovations prior to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The club temporarily moved to Arena do Jacaré in Sete Lagoas and subsequently to Independência in 2012. Historically the club's home ground, Atlético's most important matches have all been played at the Mineirão, a fact that has continued even after Independência became the first-choice home stadium again. After the renovation, the Mineirão has an overall capacity of 61,846.|$|E

The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future.

The Indianapolis 500 <b>quickly</b> <b>became</b> <b>the</b> standard in auto racing as European and American companies competed to build the fastest automobile and win at the track. Industrial and technological industries thrived during this era, George Kingston developed an early carburetor in 1902; in 1912, Elwood Haynes received a patent for stainless steel.|$|E
