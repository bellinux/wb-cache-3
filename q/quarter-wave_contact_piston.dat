A mixed lubrication model for the complete ring-pack and piston skirt was developed to correlate with the experimental measurements. Comparisons between the experimental and analytical results showed good agreement. The results revealed that in the reciprocating engines higher friction occur near TDC and BDC of the stroke due to the extremely low piston speed resulting in boundary lubrication. A Small Engine Dynamometer Test Rig was also designed and developed to enable testing of cylinder liner under motored and fired conditions. Results of this study provide a baseline from which to measure the effect of surface modifications. The Pin on Disk Test Rig (POD) was used in a flat-on-flat configuration to study the friction effect of CNC machining circular pockets and laser micro-dimples.

In order to increase fuel efficiency, mechanical loss should be controlled in internal combustion engines. Interaction between piston ring pack and cylinder liner finish accounts for nearly 20 percent of the mechanical losses within an internal combustion engine, and {{is an important factor}} that affects the lubricant oil consumption. Among the total friction between piston ring pack and cylinder liner, boundary friction occurs when piston is at low speed and there is direct contact between rings and liners. This work focuses on prediction of <b>contact</b> between <b>piston</b> ring and liner finish based on 3 D measured surface and different methods are compared. In previous twin-land oil control ring (TLOCR) deterministic model, Greenwood-Tripp correlation function was used to determine contact. The practical challenge for this single equation is that real plateau roughness makes it unreliable. As a result, micro geometry of liner surface needs to be obtained through white light interferometry device or confocal equipment to conduct contact model. Based on real geometry of liner finish and the assumption that ring surface is ideally smooth, contact can be predicted by three different models which were developed by using statistical Greenwood-Williamson model, Hertzian contact and revised deterministic dry contact model by Professor A. A. Lubrecht. The predicted contact between liner finish and piston ring is then combined with hydrodynamic pressure caused by lubricant which was examined using TLOCR deterministic model by Chen. et al to get total friction resulted on the surface of liner finish. Finally, contact model is used to examine friction of different liners in an actual engine running cycle. by Qing Zhao. Thesis: S.

Understanding the contact interactions and lubricant film formation at this interface is crucial for the development of fuel-efficient and low emission engines. This article outlines the development of an ultrasonic approach to enable non-invasive measurement of the lubricant film thickness formed between piston and cylinder wall of a fired engine. The sensor system consisted of a series of small, low cost piezoelectric elements which were bonded to the external surface of a four-stroke, single-cylinder engine. Each element could be individually energised with a short duration voltage pulse and reflections from the cylinder inner bore recorded. By using high frequency pulsing and data capture it proved possible to image individual ring and skirt contacts at full engine speeds. These captured reflections were processed to give lubricant film thickness directly and without the need for independent calibration. The results show good repeatability between cycle sets at specific running conditions. The lubricant films at each of the ring contacts can be measured at sufficient resolution such that individual rails of the oil control ring can be monitored.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most modern engines utilise pistons with an offset gudgeon pin. In internal combustion engines, the offset is to the major thrust side of the piston. The piston thrust side {{is the part of}} the piston perpendicular to the gudgeon pin that carries the majority of side loading during the power stroke. Primary reason for having the gudgeon pin positioned eccentrically is to prevent the piston from slamming into the cylinder bore after the connecting rod journal passes the top dead centre. This phenomenon is referred to as piston slap, and is more pronounced in compression ignition and high performance engines due to higher combustion pressure than that of commercial spark ignition engines. The coming together of the piston and the bore results in scuffing, at best, or, catastrophic failure at worst. Clearance space between bore and piston is filled by a lubricant film. The main role of the lubricant is to separate the piston and bore by reacting to the applied load. Investigating the above problem requires a holistic approach, whereby a dynamic three degree-of-freedom piston model is coupled with a lubrication model to represent the actual system. The dynamic model determines the motion of the piston in combined axial, lateral and rotation about the gudgeon pin. The reactive forces due to lubricant films on the major and minor thrust sides of the piston play significant roles in piston dynamics and are evaluated by either quasi-static or transient solution of the lubricant contact conjunctions. The novel quasi-static analysis is carried out in the sense of its detailed approach, including many key practical features. not incorporated in other analyses, hitherto reported in literature. These features include first and foremost the development of a specific contact mechanics model for evaluation of conforming <b>contacts</b> for <b>piston</b> skirt against liner or bore. The quasi-static analysis includes many practical feature not encountered in other literature on the subject, such as detailed surface irregularities and modification features, and with thermal distortion. The analysis has been extended to thermohydrodynamics, as well as micro-hydrodynamics, all with high computational mesh densities, and robust methods of solution in space and time domains, including effective influence Newton-Raphson method and linear acceleration integration scheme. The transient tribo-elasto-multi-body dynamics problem includes physics of motion study from film thickness prediction and secondary motion evaluation of the order of micrometers and minutes of arc to large rigid body dynamics, including simultaneous solution of the contact problem at both major and minor thrust sides. Such a comprehensive solution has not hitherto been reported in literature.

In particular, it provides solutions for high performance Formula 1 racing engines.

The tribological considerations in the <b>contact</b> between the <b>piston</b> ring and cylinder liner have attracted much attention over several decades. Many non-conventional cylinder liner finishes has been and are being developed with the aim to reduce oil- and fuel consumption, but the effects of surface finish on piston ring pack performance is not well understood. To enable the study of impact from cylinder liner topography on cylinder system performance, an improvement in liner finish characterisation is needed to be able to discriminate surface features important for function. Also in manufacturing quality control issues {{there is a need for}} surface characterisation methods that are robust and reasonably fast. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate different roughness characterisation systems stability and ability to discriminate surface features. One seemingly obvious useful characterisation method for plateau honed surfaces is the Rk parameter family based on the bearing area curve. But there is a interdependency between the parameters within the parameter family which makes it very difficult to specify a surface that is possible to manufacture in a controlled way. The Rxq family is more promising in describing the different stages in the honing process. Liner surfaces with finer finish show a decrease in oil consumption in engine tests. To be able to produce finer surfaces an introduction of diamond honing tools is required. Honing with diamond tools gives a more robust manufacturing process in terms of surface roughness but there is a increased risk of cold worked material, blechmantel, due to higher honing pressure. A manufacturing quality control method based on SEM pictures and 2 D profilometry of cylinder liner surfaces is developed and evaluated. The method is capable of discriminating surface quality but SEM pictures are not optimal for usage in manufacturing plants due to the complexity to obtain comparable pictures of the surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines {{are perhaps the}} most ubiquitous power source in the modern world. Their heavy use in the vehicle industry and the current impetus to improve efficiency whilst reducing emissions means that OEMs are driving research to provide cleaner and 'greener' engines. Though significant effort is being channelled into teasing out improvements in thermodynamic Efficiency by such methods as pressure boosting and power management. the nature of an engine means many moving parts contribute to parasitic frictional loss. Of these interfaces. the reciprocating <b>contacts</b> between cylinder. <b>piston</b> rings and skirt are arguably subject to the most demanding tribological conditions within an engine. required to seal against the high temperature' combustion gases whilst supporting the large side loading inherent to the system. Given that the piston of an engine may perform this action hundreds of millions of times in its lifespan. the lubrication strategy and component design is of key importance in minimising wear frictional losses. Though the use of numerical simulation tools for improving design has seen significant growth as computational capabilities improve and provide cost advantages to full scale testing. robust validation methods are required to guide the development of the underlying models. The aim of this project was to assess the suitability of an ultrasonic method to monitor the condition of lubrication at the aforementioned contacts by measuring film thickness. Though various techniques involving optical and electrical principles have been employed in the past they generally require the cylinder of the engine to be penetrated and implementation. for the most part. is limited to the test cell. The results of investigations at the <b>piston</b> ring <b>contact</b> have shown that the ultrasonic technique can be used to measure lubricant film thickness and have shown the influence of cylinder pressure and reciprocating speed. Measurements correlate well with work by other authors using the alternative methods mentioned. giving confidence in the robustness of the method. Film measurements at the skirt have been also been successful. not only in quantifying the minimum films present. but also in detailing the profile of the film over its surface and enabling some of the secondary motions of the piston to be deduced. It has been shown that the ultrasonic technique offers the ability and freedom to measure film thickness within an operational engine whilst having the distinct advantage of limiting the degree structural modification required. It shows promise as a research tool and with further development. offers the potential to be incorporated into a lubricant monitoring and control System to help reduce friction losses and emissions.

40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{of more than}} 20 % can be achieved through engine friction reduction. Piston and piston rings contribute {{approximately half of the}} total engine friction and are therefore central to friction reduction efforts. The most common method to reduce mechanical losses from piston rings has been to lower ring tension, the normal force providing sealing between the piston ring and the cylinder liner. However tension reduction can result in additional lubricant consumption. The objective of this thesis is to understand and model the physical mechanisms resulting in flow of oil to the combustion chamber in order to achieve optimal designs of piston rings. The optimal design is a compromise between friction reduction and adequate gas and lubricant sealing performance. To do so a multi-scale curved beam finite element model of piston ring is developed. It is built to couple ring deformation, dynamics and <b>contact</b> with the <b>piston</b> and the cylinder. Oil flow at the interfaces between the ring and the cylinder liner and between the ring and the piston groove can thus be simulated. The piston ring model is used to study the sealing performance of the Oil Control Ring (OCR), whose function is to limit the amount of oil supplied to the ring pack. The contributions of the three main mechanisms previously identified, to oil flow past the OCR are quantified: - Deformation of the cylinder under operating conditions can lead to a loss of contact between the ring and the liner. - Tilting of the piston around its pin can force the OCR to twist and scrape oil from the liner. - Oil accumulating below the OCR can flow to the groove and leak {{on the top of the}} OCR The OCR is found to be flexible enough to limit the impact of cylinder deformation on oil consumption. Both ring scraping and flow through the OCR groove can contribute to oil consumption in the range of engine running conditions simulated. Reduction of scraping is possible by increasing the ability of both OCR lands to maintain contact with the liner regardless of piston groove tilt. The flow of oil through the OCR groove can be reduced by designing appropriate draining of oil in the groove and an adequate oil reservoir below the OCR. The piston ring oil transport model developed in this thesis will be a valuable tool to optimize ring pack designs to achieve further ring pack friction reduction without increasing oil consumption. by Camille Baelden.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study into the flow behaviour of lubricant in a reciprocating <b>contact</b> simulating a <b>piston</b> ring–cylinder liner pair. The {{aim was to}} understand the effects of cavitation, starvation and surface texture, as well as the interaction between these, in order to improve automotive engine performance. A custom-built test rig was used, in which a section of piston ring is loaded against a reciprocating, laser-textured, fused silica pad representing the liner. A fluorescence microscope focusses through the silica specimen onto the contact in order to image the distribution of dyed oil. Tests were performed using a range of texture geometries and orientations, under starved and fully-flooded lubrication conditions, with measurements being compared against those from a non-textured reference. Under limited oil supply conditions, the non-textured reciprocating contact sweeps oil towards the reversal points (TDC and BDC), leading to starvation and increased friction. This issue is alleviated by the presence of surface texturing, with each pocket transferring oil from the inlet to the outlet of the contact as it passes; the result being 33 % lower friction and oil distributed evenly over the liner surface. Even under fully flooded conditions, starvation is shown to occur following each reversal, as the change in sliding direction causes the cavitated outlet to become the oil-deprived inlet. This proof of cavitation-reversal-starvation, which occurs for up to the first 5 % of the stroke length, depending on the lubricant’s viscosity, corresponds to regions of high wear, measured in this study and on actual cylinder liners reported in the literature. This process is also counteracted by the presence of surface texture, with each pocket depositing oil into the cavitated region prior to reversal. Fluorescence data also provides insights into other mechanisms with which different textures geometries control friction. Grooves oriented parallel to sliding direction increase friction as they appear to connect the high pressure inlet with the low pressure outlet, leading to oil film collapse. Grooves oriented transverse to sliding direction produce localised cavitation inside each pocket, which supports the theory that texture draws lubricant into the contact through the ‘inlet suction’ mechanism. These findings can aid texture design by showing how pockets can be used in practice to simultaneously control oil consumption, and reduce friction and wear along the stroke. It {{should be noted that the}} lubricant transport mechanisms described above should also result from other types of depressions, such those produced by porous coatings (provided they are smaller than the contact area) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear of piston rings in a {{hydraulic}} radial piston motor. The piston ring has to satisfy increasing demands for reliability and longer service life. It has two contacting surfaces, the face and the flank, and operates under a boundary lubrication state. This {{first part of the}} project aimed to detect and characterise piston ring wear. Measurement by weighing gives an overall value for wear defined as loss of mass. Two-dimensional form and surface roughness measurements show the distribution of wear on the piston ring face in contact with the cylinder bore and the piston ring flank in <b>contact</b> with the <b>piston</b> groove. Three-dimensional analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, allow the wear mechanisms to be identified. The wear of piston rings from an actual hydraulic motor was characterised. As well, rig testing was performed in two different test rig set-ups, one simulating the sliding movement of the piston ring and the other the tilting movement {{at the end of the}} strokes. Wear during the running-in period was investigated, and the findings indicate that the period when this takes place is of short duration. In the long term, mild wear makes the surfaces smoother than they were when new, resulting in a very low wear coefficient. Significant levels of wear were measured on both contacting surfaces of the piston ring. In cases in which the flank exhibits more wear than the face, the wear on the flank can be reduced by proper design of the piston groove. The second part of the project aimed to evaluate use of a textured surface for the cylinder bore counter surface and a coated surface for the piston ring. Three modelling experiments were performed to characterise the friction and wear properties under lean boundary lubrication conditions. Under such conditions, textured surfaces have the advantage of retaining more lubricant and supplying it over a longer time. Stable friction was also a distinctive feature of the textured surface. Use of a coating could also possibly reduce the amount of wear. Though a smooth surface, like a polished one, is hard to beat for a working texture, a coated surface is far ahead of a smooth uncoated one. Different manufactured and commonly used cylinder bore surfaces, including textured ones, were evaluated in the sliding movement test rig. That allowed favourable wear properties, such as lowest wear coefficient, to be determined with the use of a roller burnished surface. A final part of the research involved simulating wear on the piston ring face throughout the entire service life of a hydraulic motor. This allowed us to determine the roles of surface roughness and coating in prolonging service life and achieving acceptable and secure piston ring operation. The model is simple and realistic, but still needs to be refined so as to correspond even better to reality. QC 2010100...|$|R
