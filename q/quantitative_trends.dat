DOI: 10. 1111 /j. 1475 - 1305. 2008. 00457. xLack of {{representative}} theoretical models for gear wear causes difficulties in their useful lifetime prediction. Critical operating parameters, such as loading and lubrication, affect the wear process in a very complex manner and lead the theoretical modelling to an imperfect zone of assumptions. Complexities in gear wear mathematical modelling allow the researchers to use approximations for useful lifetime calculations. On the basis of modelling approximations and assumptions, organizations, such as American Gear Manufacturers' Association (AGMA) and British Standards (BS), provide gear useful lifetime formulations. In these formulations, the useful lifetime values are estimated by means of experimentation that is controlled with known gear operating conditions and physical dimensions. However, for useful lifetime estimation and validation, these standards have not considered any experimental approach that represents the actual gear wear. In this paper, an effort is made to validate the competency of standard's gear useful lifetime formulation. For this purpose, an approach that is able to provide an idea about actual gear wear is used. During the effort, BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard formulation is used for helical gear useful lifetime estimation under linear pitting fatigue conditions. The used formulation is validated by using wear quantitative feature analysis that is able to provide actual gear wear <b>quantitative</b> <b>trends.</b> The obtained wear <b>quantitative</b> <b>trends</b> fairly validate the lifetime estimation of BS-ISO 6336 - 2 standard...|$|E

X-ray radiographs of laboratory-produced glulam were taken before and after gluing. The distribution of adhesive resin in glulam was evaluated by comparing brightness values on the radiographs. Two validation experiments revealed that the method showed high accuracy in estimating both the average and local spread rate and could provide a clear visualization of <b>quantitative</b> <b>trends</b> in the distribution of resin in glulam. The method allows us to nondestructively evaluate the distribution of the studied adhesive resin in each glulam, suggesting that X-rays are not only useful for various fundamental studies relating to wood adhesives but also suitable for industrial application.|$|E

First, {{to strengthen the}} detection adaptability of wireless sensor networks to various security attacks, a region similarity multitask-based security event forecast method for wireless sensor networks is proposed.
