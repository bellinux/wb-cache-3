40|$|The new EGM 2008 global gravity {{field model}} is {{evaluated}} by comparisons of geoid heights computed {{from the model}} with those available at GPS levelling stations in various regions and by computing sea surface topography solutions from {{the difference between the}} mean sea surface and the geoid from this model. In order to identify how good the model performs the same tests also are performed for other recent global gravity field models. The evaluation method, in particular, has {{to take into account the}} omission error when truncating global gravity field models at chosen degrees and orders and when comparing them with observed <b>quantities.</b> The procedures <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> the computation of the omission error as well as the general methods <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> the evaluation are described in the paper. For testing the models there are available GPS levelling heights in six different regions (Europe, Germany, USA, Japan, Canada, Australia). Some of these data sets seem not to be adequate for evaluation purposes, because they exhibit long wavelength structures in the geoid height differences. Nevertheless, from the results of the geoid height comparisons one can conclude that the EGM 2008 model performs best in most of the regions. Similar results are derived from th...|$|R
40|$|Biotechnological {{production}} of chemicals from renewable feedstocks offers a sustainable alternative to petrochemistry. Understanding of {{the biology of}} microorganisms and plants is increasing at an unprecedented rate and tools with which these organisms can be engineered for industrial application are becoming ever more powerful. However, biotechnological production processes that are cost-competitive with petrochemistry {{still have to be}} developed for many types of chemicals. In this thesis, the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker’s yeast) to produce C 4 -dicarboxylic acids (fumarate, malate and succinate) is investigated. These acids, currently produced from oil in relatively small <b>quantities</b> and mainly <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> human consumption, have interesting properties for roles as commodity platform chemicals. First, S. cerevisiae was metabolically engineered for malate production via a pyruvate carboxylase-dependent pathway. While titers of nearly 60 g per liter were achieved, the fermentation process required oxygen, a significant drawback. Therefore, {{the second part of the}} research focused on improving process energetics by using phospho-enol-pyruvate carboxykinase or malic enzyme as alternative carboxylating enzymes. Interestingly, it was found that either enzyme could replace the anaplerotic function of pyruvate carboxylase, which offers the perspective of anaerobic and more efficient {{production of}} C 4 -acids with S. cerevisiae.

The measured values of the lightweight floor impact noises were (53.2, 54.7, 51.3, 47.1, and 36.4) dB for (125, 250, 500, 1000, and 200) Hz, respectively. When the frequencies for the lightweight floor impact sound were observed, the 250  Hz showed the highest value for the sound pressure, while the 2000  Hz indicated the lowest value for the sound pressure. The normalised floor impact sound levels were (53.8, 55.0, 51.3, 46.3, and 35.6) dB for (125, 250, 500, 1000, and 200) Hz, respectively. Comparing the normalised floor impact sound levels with the single-value <b>quantity</b> <b>applying</b> the inverse A characteristic curve for the lightweight floor impact source, the values above the normalised curve were (2.0, 4.3, and 2.3) dB for 250, 500, and 1000  Hz, respectively.

40|$|Expected yield losses as a {{function}} of quality and <b>quantity</b> of water <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> irrigation are required to formulate guidelines for the effective utilisation of marginal quality waters. In an experiment conducted during 2004 - 2006, double-line source sprinklers were used to determine the separate and interactive effects of saline and alkali irrigation waters on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study included three water qualities: groundwater (GW; electrical conductivity of water, ECw 3. 5 dSm- 1; sodium adsorption ratio, SAR 9. 8 mmolL- 1; residual sodium carbonate, RSC, nil) available at the site, and two synthesized waters, saline (SW; ECw 9. 4 dSm- 1, SAR 10. 3 mmolL- 1; RSC nil) and alkali (AW; ECw 3. 7 dSm- 1, SAR 15. 1 mmolL- 1; RSC 9. 6 meq. L- 1). The depths of applied SW, AW, and GW per irrigation ranged from 0. 7 to 3. 5 cm; the depths of applied mixtures of GW with either SW (MSW) or AW (MAW) ranged from 3. 2 to 5 cm. Thereby, the water <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> post-plant irrigations using either of GW, SW or AW ranged between 15. 2 and 34. 6 cm and 17. 1 and 48. 1 cm during 2004 - 2005 and 2005 - 2006, respectively and the range was 32. 1 - 37. 0 and 53. 1 - 60. 0 cm for MSW or MAW. Grain yields, when averaged for two years, ranged between 3. 08 and 4. 36 Mgha- 1, 2. 57 and 3. 70 Mgha- 1 and 2. 73 and 3. 74 Mgha- 1 with various <b>quantities</b> of water <b>applied</b> using GW, SW and AW, respectively, and between 3. 47 and 3. 75 Mgha- 1 and 3. 63 and 3. 77 Mgha- 1 for MSW and MAW, respectively. The water production functions developed for the two sets of water quality treatments could be represented as: RY= 0. 528 + 0. 843 (WA/OPE) - 0. 359 (WA/OPE) 2 - 0. 027 ECw+ 0. 44 ×  10 - 2 (WA/OPE) × ECw for SW (R 2 = 0. 63); RY= 0. 446 + 0. 816 (OPE/WA) - 0. 326 (WA/OPE) 2 - 0. 0124 RSC- 0. 55 ×  10 - 4 (WA/OPE) × RSC for AW (R 2 = 0. 56). Here, RY, WA and OPE are the relative yields in reference to the maximum yield obtained with GW, water <b>applied</b> <b>for</b> pre- and post-plant irrigations (cm), and open pan evaporation, respectively. Crop yield increased with increasing amount of <b>applied</b> water <b>for</b> all of the irrigation waters but the maximum yields as obtained with GW, could not be attained even with increased quantities of SW and AW. Increased frequency of irrigation with sprinklers reduced the rate of yield decline with increasing salinity in irrigation water. The sodium contents of plants increased with salinity/alkalinity of sprinkled waters as also with their quantities. Simultaneous decrease in potassium contents resulted in remarkable increase in Na:K ratio. Alkali water Double-line sprinkler source Na:K ratio Saline water Triticum aestivum L.
