40|$|Modified adjustable-grip-length <b>quick-release</b> <b>pin</b> holds {{two bodies}} together. Threaded shaft of pin {{threaded}} in floating nut to pretension fastener. Pin connects and disconnects rapidly and adjusted to accommodate small differences between thicknesses of nominally identical sets of parts to {{be attached to}} each other...|$|E
40|$|Lever-action <b>quick-release</b> <b>pin</b> {{operated}} more easily. Mechanism operated with gloved hand. In modified version, lever {{added to}} handle to facilitate actuation. Lever action reduces actuation force. Lever-action pin operated by squeezing on any point of moveable ends of lever and handle together between {{thumb and forefinger}} or by simply grasping and squeezing handle and lever with entire hand in more natural grasp...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} <b>quick-release</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism supplants a prior such {{mechanism in}} which the pin bears a shear load to hold two objects together. The prior mechanism, of a ball-locking design, can fail when vibrations cause balls to fall out. The load-bearing pin is an outer tube with a handle at one end (hereafter denoted the near end). Within the outer tube is a spring-loaded inner tube that includes a handle at its near end and a pivoting tab at its far end. The pin is inserted through holes in the objects to be retained and the inner tube is pushed against an offset pivot inside the outer tube to make the tab rotate outward so that it protrudes past the outer diameter of the outer tube, and the spring load maintains this configuration so that the pin cannot be withdrawn through the holes. Pushing the handles together against the spring load moves the locking tab out far enough that the tab becomes free to rotate inward. Then releasing the inner-tube handle causes the tab to be pulled into a resting position inside the outer tube. The pin can then be pulled out through the holes...|$|E
50|$|A shackle, {{also known}} as a gyve, is a U-shaped piece of metal secured with a clevis pin or bolt across the opening, or a hinged metal loop secured with a <b>quick-release</b> locking <b>pin</b> mechanism. The term also applies to {{handcuffs}} and other similarly conceived restraint devices that function in a similar manner. Shackles are the primary connecting link in all manner of rigging systems, from boats and ships to industrial crane rigging, as they allow different rigging subsets to be connected or disconnected quickly. A shackle is also the similarly shaped piece of metal used with a locking mechanism in padlocks.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to lessons learned in combat, the British Army developed the Virtus personal armour system that offers the same protection as Osprey, but is significantly lighter, moves {{with the body}} more easily, and produces a slimmer profile. Virtus is 4.7 kg lighter, and will be even lighter once new armor plates in development are introduced. The level of protection can be increased or decreased depending on the threat environment by adding or removing soft armour pads and hard ballistic plates. Unlike the Osprey's Velcro straps, the Virtus has a chest-positioned <b>pin</b> <b>quick-release</b> mechanism that releases the entire body kit when pulled for safe extraction in hazardous situations. A new, lighter helmet provides increased blunt impact protection, face and mandible guards for certain roles, and a shape designed {{to work with the}} armour and daysack so weapons can be comfortably used even in a prone position; it has a permanent universal mount for night vision gear and a scalable counterweight attached to the rear to ease strain on the wearer's neck. The system also eases strain on loads the soldier would be carrying, incorporating the dynamic weight distribution (DWD) integral spine system, which is linked to the waist belt and helps spread the load of the body armour or daysack across the back, shoulders, and hips, which can be adjusted through a hand controller to their preference. Virtus began being issued in May 2016.|$|R
