Applicants without realizing it may engage in a number of behaviors that influence ratings of their performance.

A second experimenter asked a different set of questions that was more hypothetically based than the first set. Their <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to simulate a court competence examination. The {{children were}} told a story and asked questions about it to determine their capacity to comprehend moral values.

Parents were also asked to give their views freely on underage gambling by providing descriptions (e.g. underage gambling was a game, a memory enhancer, a children recreation).|$|E

Therefore, these question significantly asks how this relationship gives an impact, or affects on their CY life and their future.
