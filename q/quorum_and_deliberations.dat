Each house of the Diet determines its own standing orders and has responsibility for disciplining its own members. A member may be expelled, but only by a two-thirds majority vote. Every member of the Cabinet has the right to appear in either house of the Diet for the purpose of speaking on bills, and each house has the right to compel the appearance of Cabinet members.|$|E

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISINegotiation <b>and</b> <b>deliberation</b> are two context types or {{genres of}} {{discourse}} widely {{studied in the}} argumentation literature. Within the pragma-dialectical framework, they have been characterised {{in terms of the}} conventions constraining the use of argumentative discourse in each of them. Thanks to these descriptions, it has become possible to analyse the arguers’ strategic manoeuvres and carry out more systematic, context-sensitive evaluations of argumentative discussions. However, one issue that still must be addressed in the pragma-dialectical theory— and other contextual approaches to argumentation—is how to distinguish negotiation <b>and</b> <b>deliberation</b> in practice. In this paper, I seek to develop criteria that can help the analyst identify them in discourse. To this end, I characterise the felicity conditions of the superordinate speech acts defining <b>and</b> structuring <b>deliberation</b> <b>and</b> negotiation encounters...|$|R
