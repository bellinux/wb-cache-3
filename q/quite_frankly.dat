5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} {{also attracted}} mixed commentary. Though Perry was reportedly {{excited by the}} performance of her [...] "California Gurls", it was poorly received by critics. VanDerWerff found it surprisingly [...] "weak and lifeless", and Fallon called it [...] "slow, unfunny, and, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> boring." [...] Reiter also deemed it boring, describing it as [...] "an elaborate smorgasbord without flavor", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman criticized the uninspired, over-the-top choreography.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{is known}} for his blunt {{speaking}} and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally. [...] This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him. [...] When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, [...] "Well, as Rhett Butler once said in Gone With the Wind, if I'm gone, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> I don't give a damn." [...] In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.|$|E

500|$|He {{initially}} {{supported the}} War in Afghanistan, but {{has become increasingly}} skeptical of the war. In June 2010 he pushed a funding amendment which would require President Barack Obama to provide for a draw-down plan before any further funding would be authorized. [...] "Let us not waste, you know, more resources, more lives, on a policy that <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> {{is going to lead}} us nowhere," [...] said McGovern. [...] "We need to let Afghan President Hamid Karzai know that we're not a cheap date. We expect him to clean up his government." ...|$|E
500|$|Tropic Thunder {{opened in}} 3,319 theaters and, {{for its first}} fivedays of American and Canadian release, earned $36,845,588. The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $25,812,796, surpassing [...] and Mirrors, which debuted the same weekend. Reacting to the film's opening receipts, DreamWorks {{spokesman}} Chip Sullivan stated [...] "We're thrilled, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly.</b> It played out exactly how we hoped." [...] In foreign markets for the film's opening weekend, it was released in 418 Russian and 19 United Arab Emirates locations earning $2.2 million and $319,000, respectively.|$|E
500|$|... "They were saying, 'Well, do {{a couple}} of weeks, a farewell.'" [...] Dahl said. [...] "I said, 'It's not a farewell. You guys are taking me off the air. I'm not retiring.' ... "I still have {{two and a half}} years left on my deal so, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> I'm not letting them out of it." [...] Dahl also said he was {{prepared}} to stay off the air for the remainder of his contract, which was to end in mid-2011 and was said to be worth more than $1 million annually.|$|E
60|$|I {{gazed at}} him, full of horror. The man was {{too ill to}} hear me, too ill to reason, too ill to {{recognise}} the meaning of his own words, almost. Otherwise, perhaps, he would hardly have expressed himself <b>quite</b> so <b>frankly.</b> Though {{to be sure he}} had said nothing to criminate himself in any way; his action might have been due to anxiety for our safety.|$|R
5000|$|The third {{volume to}} be produced, {{covering}} 1603-1714, was likewise {{described by the}} South West Maritime History Society as 'In a single word [...] "SUPERLATIVE"' and 'This book is <b>frankly</b> <b>quite</b> superb and deserves {{to be included in}} the library of anyone interested in this period of maritime history.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} see you and Broadwood taking this line, Ralph; but I've long {{suspected}} that your views were not <b>quite</b> sound. <b>Frankly,</b> I'm afraid of the thin end of the wedge." [...] He turned to the others. [...] "You will understand {{that there can be}} no compromise. We shall continue to live as English gentlemen and have nothing to do with the grasping commercialism that is getting a dangerous hold on the older countries. I will do my best to keep Allenwood free from it while I have the power." ...|$|R
500|$|The event gained {{national}} and international media attention. [...] While the Calvos were cleared of wrongdoing, the police were accused by the Calvos and civil rights groups of lacking a proper search warrant, excessive force, and failure to conduct a proper background investigation of the home being raided. Despite the criticisms, no action has been taken against the officers or their respective police departments. [...] In August 2010, Sheriff Michael A. Jackson stated that [...] "We've apologized for the incident, but we will never apologize for taking drugs off our streets. <b>Quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> we'd do it again. Tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{gave the}} video a {{positive}} review: [...] "The video that accompanies this track {{is one of}} the year's best so far—and certainly the sexiest: Ciara licks Justin's ear, Justin reciprocates by slapping her bum, and, well, Ciara's flexibility would put many a poledancer to shame. <b>Quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> the whole thing could make a nun have impure thoughts." [...] At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for [...] "Best Choreography;" [...] it lost to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)." [...] The video ranked at number thirty-nine on BET's [...] countdown.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{development}} of higher education provided opportunities for women. In all-female surroundings, a culture of romantic pursuit was fostered in women's colleges. Older students mentored younger ones, called on them socially, took them to all-women dances, and sent them flowers, cards, and poems that declared their undying love for each other. These were called [...] "smashes" [...] or [...] "spoons", and they were written about <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> in stories for girls aspiring to attend college in publications such as Ladies Home Journal, a children's magazine titled St. Nicholas, and a collection called Smith College Stories, without negative views. Enduring loyalty, devotion, and love were major components to these stories, and sexual acts beyond kissing were consistently absent.|$|E
60|$|If Mac {{had been}} a lover, {{he would not have}} {{discussed}} the subject in this simple and sincere fashion, though he might have felt it far more deeply, but being <b>quite</b> heart-free, he <b>frankly</b> showed his interest and, curiously enough, out of his wise young head unconsciously gave the three lovers before him counsel which they valued, because he practiced what he preached.|$|R
60|$|I {{took her}} hand, which she relinquished to me <b>quite</b> freely and <b>frankly</b> with an innocence {{as great as}} my own; and I asked her who she was and how she came to Mondolfo. It was then that I learnt that her name was Luisina, {{that she was the}} {{daughter}} of one of the women employed in the castle kitchen, who had brought her to help there a week ago from Borgo Taro, where she had been living with an aunt.|$|R
500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song {{four out of}} five stars, commenting that {{although}} she sings through the verses in her [...] "usual speak-sing fashion", the chorus is [...] "joyously irresistible". He also brands the song a [...] "bubblegum electro stomper" [...] adding that the song distinguishes itself from her previous singles writing that it manages to [...] "put some distance between the singer and the novelty sound of her previous hits, while still being the fun, trashy and <b>frankly</b> <b>quite</b> filthy".|$|R
500|$|... song {{writing and}} musical {{instrument}} prowess (...) It's rare to find truly mainstream contemporary pop artists today {{who are also}} extremely skilled live performance artists and talented songwriters". That same year Stephanie McGrath from AllPop.com said M2M's music [...] "breathes fresh, brusque Norwegian air {{into the world of}} pop music dominated by Britney Spears wanna-bes and Orlando-born boy bands", noting that instead of typical teen subjects like true love or candy, M2M's songs were about [...] "taking things slow or not betraying your friends." [...] Reviewing Shades of Purple, Michael Paoletta from Billboard said the album's tracks showed a [...] "seasoned singing style that is, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> the antithesis of teen sensations like Britney Spears", concluding [...] "Beautifully sun-kissed, Shades of Purple is poised to be the soundtrack of spring/summer 2000.|$|E
500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we {{wanted to do was to}} make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly.</b> We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} critical acclaim. Robert Christgau gave it an A-, stating: [...] "even {{when the}} writing is ordinary, the quality teenpop, some assembly-line and some personalized, is transfigured by the duo's singing." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying M2M's [...] "precise Euro-dance pop is fun, fun, fun, and behind the lip gloss is enough insecurity to charm." [...] Heather Phares from AllMusic said [...] "Overall, Shades of Purple is a strong debut from a young group that still sounds fresh and innocent ... something of a rarity in teen pop." [...] Michael Paoletta from Billboard gave a favourable review, saying [...] "The 13 tracks on display here showcase a seasoned singing style that is, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> the antithesis of teen sensations like Britney Spears", concluding [...] "Beautifully sun-kissed, Shades of Purple is poised to be the soundtrack of spring/summer 2000." [...] The album was nominated for the best pop album at the 2000 Spellemannprisen awards.|$|E
5000|$|Todd Douglass of DVD Talk said: [...] "The story {{stands up}} <b>quite</b> well and <b>frankly</b> it reinvigorates a {{franchise}} that has otherwise turned stagnant. ... As {{a lover of}} Highlander and anime, The Search for Vengeance {{was more or less}} what I wanted it to be. ... film is worth a look if you're even slightly interested in it." [...] Jason Cook of The Spinning Image said that [...] "The Search for Vengeance is a thoroughly enjoyable animated feature coupling classy visual flourishes with a lean plot. ... Anime fans will want to seek this out due to its director's pedigree, but those unfamiliar with the genre are still advised to give this a go." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the in-network computation of approximate "big picture" summaries in bandwidth-constrained sensor networks. First we review early work on computing the Haar wavelet decomposition as a User-Defined Aggregate in a sensor query engine. We {{argue that this}} technique can be significantly improved by choosing a function-specific network topology. We generalize this discussion to a loose definition of a 2 -level optimization problem that maps from a function to {{what we call a}} support graph for the function, and from there to an aggregation tree that is chosen from possible subgraphs of the physical network connectivity. This work is <b>frankly</b> <b>quite</b> preliminary: we raise a number of questions but provide relatively few answers. The intent of the paper is to lay groundwork for discussion and further research...|$|R
60|$|It {{can hardly}} be due to {{anything}} in the curriculum or programme of studies. Indeed, to any one accustomed to the best models of a university curriculum as it flourishes in the United States and Canada, the programme of studies is <b>frankly</b> <b>quite</b> laughable. There is less Applied Science in the place than would be found with us in a theological college. Hardly a single professor at Oxford would recognise a dynamo if he met it in broad daylight. The Oxford student learns nothing of chemistry, physics, heat, plumbing, electric wiring, gas-fitting {{or the use of}} a blow-torch. Any American college student can run a motor car, take a gasoline engine to pieces, fix a washer on a kitchen tap, mend a broken electric bell, and give an expert opinion on what has gone wrong with the furnace. It is these things indeed which stamp him as a college man, and occasion a very pardonable pride in the minds of his parents.|$|R
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly.</b> With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. If we lose a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E
500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for me. <b>Quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Gregory told Billboard {{that he did}} {{question}} the appropriateness of taking a bad news story and making it into a musical parody but then {{came to the conclusion}} that [...] "it's taking a terrible situation and making at least something positive out of it." [...] The band is splitting the money they make from sales 50% with the Dodson family. The Dodson family was subsequently able to move out of the projects. [...] Evan Gregory said of the song's success, [...] "I think people are latching onto it is <b>frankly</b> <b>quite</b> similar to why they latch onto a classic ballad or pop song that tops the charts - because there's real emotion behind it that people identify with, even if, in this case, it was for unusual reasons." [...] Andrew Gregory said that [...] "There are plenty of comments that quote funny lines from the song but one of the comments I see most often on our videos is, 'I can't get this out of my head.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing can {{exceed the}} {{closeness}} {{with which the}} whole fits again into its germ. That had been given me bodily, as usual, by the spoken word, for I {{was to take the}} image over exactly as I happened to have met it. A friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction, much his senior, and to which a sense akin to that of Strether's melancholy eloquence might be imputed--said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday afternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the [...] "note" [...] that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose--had contained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support, to give me what I may call the note absolute. There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway; driven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a cable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, {{in the light of the}} hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so confronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in this fashion, of suggested wealth. For I think, verily, that there are degrees of merit in subjects--in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for the feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its dignity as POSSIBLY absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that even among the supremely good--since with such alone is it one's theory of one's honour to be concerned--there is an ideal BEAUTY of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum. Then truly, I hold, one's theme may be said to shine, and that of [...] "The Ambassadors," [...] I confess, wore this glow for me from beginning to end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as, <b>frankly,</b> <b>quite</b> the best, [...] "all round," [...] of all my productions; any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous.|$|R
2500|$|Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, [...] "“Ninja Kids!!!” is {{a massive}} disappointing effort from such a capable director. Sure some fun can be had and the class of kids are fun to watch, {{but it is only}} a manner of time before the same antics you once fall for, becomes <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> {{annoying}} and eventually regrettably bored." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Daniel Catullo {{was asked}} about the idea behind documenting them making The Oracle, he stated that, [...] "We felt that over the course of 10 years of me filming the band we have done it all; the stadium show, the small {{intimate}} acoustic performance, the arena show and the mini-movie. The only thing we haven't done was document the recording of a record. <b>Quite</b> <b>frankly</b> {{it was the only thing}} left to do with them that wouldn't be repeating history!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hugh Jackman was {{the first}} actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him some time later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed {{to be a part}} of the film. [...] "He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> {{incredibly}} ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, or you could look silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Mike McCurry, the White House press {{secretary}} at the time, recalled that [...] " [...] posture was <b>quite</b> <b>frankly</b> {{driven by the}} political realities of an election year in 1996." [...] James Hormel, who was appointed by Clinton as the first openly gay U.S. Ambassador, described the reaction from the gay community to Clinton signing DOMA as shock and anger. On Hormel's account, Clinton {{had been the first}} President to advocate gay rights, push for AIDS funding, support gay and lesbian civil rights legislation, and appoint open LGBT people to his Administration. Thus his signing of DOMA was viewed by much of the community as a great betrayal.|$|E
2500|$|With two {{different}} sets of players competing in performance and two producers with conflicting views on how to approach each song, the sessions were far from disciplined. Years later, when asked about Time Out of Mind, Dickinson replied, [...] "I haven't {{been able to tell}} what's actually happening. I know they were listening to playbacks, I don't know whether they were trying to mix it or not! Twelve musicians playing live—three sets of drums,... it was unbelievable—two pedal steels, I've never even heard two pedal steels played at the same time before! ... I don't know man, I thought that much was overdoing it, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly.</b> [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Sam/Jack {{relationship}} was fraught with complications {{given that he}} was her commanding officer. Pursuing any sort of relationship would have been inappropriate for both and would only have really been possible late in the series after Jack's retirement. [...] Jack and Sam could have gotten together after Jack's retirement, {{but it was never}} made canon because, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> it wasn't my call. Still, despite the lack of official confirmation, it was only natural that they should get together after the events of Threads and, in my mind, they have been together ever since. An attempt to suggest as much in [...] season 4's Trio unfortunately ended up on the cutting room floor when the episode ran long." ...|$|E
2500|$|The aunts {{resented the}} {{children}} {{for the fact that}} they had to sacrifice their young lives to look after them. It was Mona who was troubled the most by having to care for her niece and nephew. [...] "It was very big of her to take on the responsibility, but having said that, I wish people wouldn't do that. I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and get out of my life, because, <b>quite</b> <b>frankly,</b> I would rather have gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same. To this day, I'm still working on the things she did to me." ...|$|E
