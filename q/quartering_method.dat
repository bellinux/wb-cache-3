40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} an attempt made to {{estimate}} the quantity solid waste that can be generated in the ELURU city, A. P, INDIA per day and to estimate the generation potentiality of energy through combustion of solid waste. The waste-to-energy industry has proven itself to be an environmentally friendly solution to the disposal of municipal solid waste {{and the production of}} energy. Waste-to-energy is now a clean, renewable, sustainable source of energy. The estimation of energy content of municipal solid waste in Eluru Municipal Corporation is discussed in this paper. The data related to number of house holds in division wise is collected from Municipal Corporation of Eluru as 39, 996. Out of the 50 divisions in Eluru Municipal Corporation based on income six divisions are selected for random survey covering low, medium and high income groups. Division maps are collected from the corporation for the sample survey divisions. The divisions selected for sampling survey are re- mapped representing minimum of 10 % houses selected in each division covering the total geographical location. House hold collection of solid waste is done physically in all the six divisions selected for estimating the per capita waste generation in the city. By physical weighment of all the waste collecting vehicles the total waste collected in the city is estimated and the same is compared by using the calculated per capita waste generation taking the total population of the city in to consideration to find out the quantity of waste generated in the corporation. Then a representative sample of the corporation using <b>quartering</b> <b>method</b> is collected from the dump yard. The representative sample of the city is sent for lab analysis at a MoEF recognized lab to estimate the calorific value and the same is compared by conducting several trials at the experimental setup designed with conventional approach on a Bomb calorimeter. It is estimated that by combusting the solid waste in ELURU Municipal Corporation it is possible to generate nearly 3 MW of power...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{different methods}} of estimating bovine carcass composition, seventy yearling bulls of the "Asturiana de los Valles" beef breed were slaughtered and their carcass composition estimated by a commercial dissection {{of the right}} half-carcass and by tissular dissection of the 6 th and 10 th rib of the left half-carcass. Correlation and regression analyses were used to identify the most accurate predictors of carcass composition. In simple regression, the percentage of lean in the 10 th rib was the most accurate predictor (r= 0. 88; P< 0. 001) of the lean proportion in the carcass {{and the percentage of}} fat in the 6 th rib was the best predictor (r= 0. 90; P< 0. 001) of the carcass fat content. The correlation coefficients for estimating the bone percentage in the carcass from the bone proportion in the ribs (6 th and 10 th) were low (r= 0. 63 and 0. 51 respectively), although significant (P< 0. 001) and the coefficient improved when the proportion of lean in the ribs was used as predictor (r= 0. 78 and 0. 70 for the 6 th and the 10 th rib respectively). In multiple regression, the addition of more regressors of the rib composition and carcass traits, such as carcass hot weight, the carcass fatness score and the weight of the kidney knob and channel fat, led to an improvement (P< 0. 05) in accuracy for some predictions. The results in general show that the accuracy of the predictions for the carcass composition obtained from dissection of both the 6 th and 10 th ribs was similar, although the dissection of the 10 th rib tended to overestimate the proportion of fat in the carcass. Therefore, considering the carcass <b>quartering</b> <b>method</b> for the extraction of the ribs, it is proposed that dissection of the 6 th rib is more appropriate than dissection of the 10 th rib so as not to reduce the carcass value and obtain a good estimate of the carcass composition...|$|E
