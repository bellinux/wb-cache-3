5000|$|In physics, and in {{particular}} as measured by radiometry, radiant energy is the energy of electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. As energy, its SI unit is the joule (J). The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> may be calculated by integrating radiant flux (or power) with respect to time. The symbol Qe is often used throughout literature to denote radiant energy ("e" [...] for [...] "energetic", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities). In branches of physics other than radiometry, electromagnetic energy is referred to using E or W. The term is used particularly when electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a source into the surrounding environment. This radiation may be visible or invisible to the human eye.|$|E
40|$|IONIZING {{radiations}} {{have long}} been known to affect biological systems, and a great many radiation effects have been described (Duggar, 1936; HoUaender, 1954). Biological processes are generally inhibited by ionizing radiations, except at low levels, and the biological response to the irradiations {{is proportional to the}} dose (i. e., the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> absorbed by the tissue or organism). Al-though the mechanism of action of ioniz-ing radiations is not completely under-stood, they can be used to great advan-tage in the study of biological processes. Functional alteration of tissues, resulting from irradiation, may be used to interpret the normal process of the tissue. In a study of the physiological processes that lead to the formation of the egg shell and albumen, the surgically exposed ovi-duct was irradiated with graded doses of X-rays, {{and the nature of the}} post-irradia-tion eggs determined. This procedure re-sulted in some changes of egg production rate and of egg quality, which are de-scribed herein...|$|E

Of the new aids which physics has given workers in biology, probably the most important are the quantum theory of light, and the new implements, techniques of generating, manipulating and measuring radiations. <b>Radiant</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> desired wave lengths and frequencies is now at the command of research workers in the field of biology and physiology who are engaged {{in the study of the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> on the living organism...|$|R

50|$|In photometry, {{luminous}} {{energy is}} the perceived energy of light. This {{is sometimes called}} the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> light.

This is because the human eye can only see light in the visible spectrum and has different sensitivities to light of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions (photopic vision), the eye is most sensitive to light at a wavelength of 555 nm. Light with a given amount <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> will have more luminous energy if the wavelength is 555 nm than if the wavelength is longer or shorter.

40|$|At superorbital reentry {{velocities}} radiative heating is {{the dominant}} mode of heat transfer to the stagnation region of blunt reentry vehicles. The radiative heat transfer rate at the wall {{is determined by the}} temperature profile through the shock layer which depends on the net radiative transport through both the viscous inner region adjacent to the wall and the outer region where convection and radiative transport processes dominate the energy transfer. When atomic line transitions are included a very small scale length for <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> transport is introduced which results in characteristic changes in the shock layer flow. The inclusion of atomic line transitions necessitates consideration <b>of</b> self-absorption <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> and results in the coupling <b>of</b> <b>radiant</b> <b>energy</b> transport and convection and conduction transport processes even for relatively small vehicle nose radii.
