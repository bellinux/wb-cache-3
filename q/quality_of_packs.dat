40|$|In this diploma thesis, {{capillary}} columns with {{an inner}} diameter of 530 microns filled with gel particles were prepared. These columns {{are intended for}} gel chromatography. Three various methods of filling were used for their preparation. The first method was based on filling of wet particles in suspension with the organic solvent, followed by drying and swelling of particles with water into the form of gel. The second method used filling of wet particles in the suspension form with the aqueous phase. The last method started with suction of dry gel particles by air and continued with their subsequent swelling with water into {{the form of the}} gel. The prepared columns have been compared analysing hyaluronic acid and thiourea. The basic parameters specified for the gel column chromatography were determined by using phenylalanine.

When compared to the TS, more BSD students had a sugar-sweetened beverage packed in their lunch. Greater portions of snack items were also packed and consumed in the BSD. Correspondingly, children in the BSD consumed more energy, carbohydrates, saturated fatty acids, total sugar, and percent energy from total sugar than in the TS.

40|$|Background Foods {{are prone}} to quality {{degradation}} in the whole supply chain, but the possibilities for monitoring the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> foods inside the package are limited. When sensors <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> indicators are included into the package of a food, the package can become an intelligent packaging that is able to communicate information about the packed food. An intelligent packaging {{could be used to}} monitor <b>quality</b> attributes <b>of</b> the food and translate this into a message about the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>packed</b> food that is communicated to all actors in the supply chain. Knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>quality</b> status <b>of</b> the food could lead to improvements in quality based logistic decision making in the food chain and reduce food waste. In this thesis the possibilities and pitfalls to use intelligent packaging to monitor the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> foods were explored.   Aim of this thesis The objective of this thesis was to study and develop an intelligent packaging concept that can monitor and predict food quality within the supply chain. Intelligent packaging systems, based on a direct or indirect quality monitoring sensor and combined with mathematical models, were evaluated on their abilities to predict the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>packed</b> perishable foods under different conditions that can occur in the supply chain. The development of new non-destructive methods for monitoring changes in the freshness status <b>of</b> <b>packed</b> fresh fish was chosen as a case study for the proof of principle of the application of intelligent packaging for monitoring food quality.   Results First, a literature study was performed on the possibilities for intelligent packaging for monitoring the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> foods (chapter 2). One of the conclusions was that foods that benefit the most from intelligent packaging are expensive, highly perishable foods. Foods with a known or low variation in initial quality can benefit from sensors that monitor the environmental conditions surrounding the food that influence the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>packed</b> foods. Foods with an unknown or high variation in the initial quality need sensors that directly monitor a <b>quality</b> attribute <b>of</b> the food itself. The initial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> fresh fish is highly variable and therefore fresh cod fillets require sensors monitoring compounds correlated with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the fish. Therefore, fresh cod was chosen as case example for the development <b>of</b> a <b>quality</b> sensor for intelligent packaging. The content of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) compounds were identified as possible quality indicator compounds to predict the freshness of fish, the most important <b>quality</b> attribute <b>of</b> fresh fish...|$|R

At our blood center, we receive blood requisitions via the PTS, but units are carried to the ward by human courier. Recently we considered using the PTS for transporting blood units. Since, {{there are reports of}} hemolysis in blood samples sent through the PTS, we evaluated this system for transporting red cell units. Aims: The aim was to assess the effect of PTS transport on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>packed</b> red cell units. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 red blood cells units (RBC), (25 non-irradiated and 25 irradiated) were subjected to transportation through the PTS. The control arm in the study was age-matched RBC units not subjected to PTS transport. Each RBC unit was evaluated for hemoglobin (Hb), lactate dehydrogenase, potassium and plasma hemoglobin (Hb). The paired t-test was used to compare these parameters, and the P value was calculated. Results and Conclusion: The percentage of hemolysis after transportation through PTS was below the recommended guidelines. Delivery of the blood unit to the wrong station, bags lying unattended at the destination were few of the problems that had to be addressed. To conclude, though the PTS is a safe means of transporting blood products with reduction in the turn-around-time, it must be validated before use...|$|R

Currently, more than half of primary {{school children}} have a packed lunch. New food-based standards for school meals were introduced in English primary schools in 2006, followed by nutrient-based standards in 2008. No formal comparisons of primary school lunches by lunch type have been undertaken to date. The present review identified seven studies from 1990 to 2007 measuring lunchtime nutrient intake in children aged 5 - 11 years having a school meal and children having a packed lunch. Pooled estimates for each nutrient were as follows: energy intake was 543 (95 % CI 233, 854) kJ higher in packed lunches; total sugar intake was 14. 0 (95 % CI 10. 3, 17. 7) g higher in packed lunches; non-milk extrinsic sugar intake was 11. 7 (95 % CI 7. 3, 16. 2) g higher in packed lunches; saturated fat intake was 4. 7 (95 % CI 2. 4, 7. 1) g higher in packed lunches and Na intake was 357 (95 % CI 174, 539) mg higher in packed lunches. Differences between school meals and packed lunches were larger for all nutrients after the introduction of food-based standards compared with the period of no standards. However, differences between before and after standards did not reach statistical significance. The nutritional <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>packed</b> lunches is poor compared with school meals.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of sub- 2 μm totally porous particles and sub- 3 μm shell particles for peptide and protein analysis. Specific analytical strategies must be developed for these biomolecules as their importance in the pharmaceutical industry increases and as their structural complexity involves some issues when classical LC conditions are employed. Attention was paid on comparing these different columns in various LC conditions (different temperatures, gradient times, and mobile phase flow rates). The comparison of the different supports was assessed considering columns characteristics (<b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>packing,</b> silanol activity, pore size, totally porous or shell particles). In this article, peptides were first analyzed with both column technologies. Similar results to those achieved with low molecular weight compounds were obtained (peak capacity > 100 for tgrad around 3 min and columns dimensions of 2. 1 mm id × 50 mm), but specific conditions were required (elevated temperature and the use of a volatile ion-pairing reagent, namely TFA). For peptide analysis following tryptic digestion, the goal was to improve peak capacity and resolution because of the large number of generated peptides. For this purpose, longer columns packed with porous sub- 2 μm or shell sub- 3 μm particles (i. e., 150 mm) and gradient times (i. e., up to 30 min) were tested. On the other hand, proteins in their intact forms have higher molecular weights (MW > 5000 Da) and a tertiary structure, thus requiring different conditions in terms of stationary phase hydrophobicity (C 4 vs. C 18) and pore size (300 vs. 120 A˚). In addition, there were issues with adsorption onto the LC system and/or the column itself. This study showed that proteins with MWs lower than 40, 000 Da required chromatographic conditions close to those employed for peptide analysis. For larger proteins, a C 4 300 ˚A stationary phase gave the best results, confirming theoretical predictions...|$|R

The results showed that: a) the seed moisture content was kept relatively constant throughout the experimental period for the seeds packed in polyethylene bags, while the moisture contents <b>of</b> seeds <b>packed</b> in paper bags reached the equilibrium moisture content with the relative humidity of the storehouse; b) the physiological <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the seeds <b>packed</b> in polyethylene bags decreased faster than any other experimental condition; c) {{by the end of}} the experiment, seed germination was about the same for the seeds stored with 10 - 11 % and 6 - 7 % moisture content in the polyethylene bags; d) best results of seed germination and vigor were obtained with the seeds dried to 6 - 7 % moisture content, and packed in polyethylene bags; e) seeds treated with sulfuric acid consistently showed greater losses of viability than non-treated seeds...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> canned tilapia <b>packed</b> in oil {{and tomato}} sauce at ambient and {{accelerated}} temperatures were examined by microbiological and sensory evaluation. Canned tilapia {{were found to be}} microbiologically stable and organoleptically acceptable after six months storage period. Total viable count (TVC) were generally low (2. 5 x 10 super(2)). Thermophilic organisms (Clostridium) were absent in all samples. The yield of edible part of tilapia was 72 % after dressing. Pre-cooking of tilapia resulted in a loss of 21. 5 % of its dressed weight. Comparison of canned tilapia with available canned fishes (geisha and bonga) showed similar trends in the taste, proximate composition, microbiological stability and sensory scores. The possibility for investment in tilapia cannary was also investigated. It was found that production of canned tilapia will be economically viable if a ten hectare tilapia farm is used as a source of raw materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} modeling the failure <b>of</b> air-conditioning/cooling <b>packs</b> {{for a particular}} type of aircraft with field data. In many regards, field data are highly desirable for more accurate failure prediction by aircraft operators, because the data implicitly account for all actual usage and environmental stresses. It is not always possible to accurately anticipate or simulate these stresses in a laboratory or even in a field test. Field data, in a larger extent, are also important to the manufacturer, because the data identify product deficiencies and areas of improvement. In this study, the failure of the aircraft air-conditioning/cooling pack under a customer-use environment is first modeled at the component level by using the Weibull distribution and its extensions. These include the two-parameter Weibull model, three-parameter Weibull model, mixture model, and phased bi-Weibull model. The number of failures over time is estimated by a renewal process. The failure <b>of</b> the air-conditioning/cooling <b>pack</b> at the system level is then modeled by using the power law process model. The failure trend is tested by the Laplace test. The results give an insight into the reliability and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the air-conditioning/cooling <b>pack</b> under actual operating conditions. The models presented here can be used by aircraft operators for assessing system and component failures and customizing the maintenance programs recommended by the manufacturer...|$|R
