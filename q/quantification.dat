He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to <b>quantification</b> and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Water, energy, {{and food}} are lifelines for modern societies. The {{continuously}} rising world population, growing desires for higher living standards, and inextricable links {{among the three}} sectors make the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus a vibrant research pursuit. For the integrated delivery of WEF systems, quantifying WEF connections helps understand synergies and trade-offs across the water, energy, and food sectors, and thus is a critical initial step toward integrated WEF nexus modeling and management. However, current WEF interconnection <b>quantifications</b> encounter methodological hurdles. Also, existing calculation results are scattered across a wide collection of studies in multiple disciplines, which increases data collection and interpretation difficulties. To advance robust WEF nexus <b>quantifications</b> and further contribute to integrated WEF systems modeling and management, this study: (i) summarizes the estimate results to date on WEF interconnections; (ii) analyzes methodological and practical challenges associated with WEF interconnection calculations; and (iii) points out opportunities for enabling robust WEF nexus <b>quantifications</b> in the future...|$|R
25|$|Monadic second-order logic (MSO) is a {{restriction}} of second-order logic {{in which only}} <b>quantification</b> over unary relations (i.e.: sets) are allowed. <b>Quantification</b> over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called full second-order logic to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used {{in the context of}} Courcelle's theorem, an algorithmic meta-theorem in graph theory.|$|E
25|$|Second-order {{arithmetic}} includes, but {{is significantly}} stronger than, its first-order counterpart Peano arithmetic. Unlike Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic allows <b>quantification</b> over sets of natural numbers {{as well as}} numbers themselves. Because real numbers can be represented as (infinite) sets of natural numbers in well-known ways, and because second order arithmetic allows <b>quantification</b> over such sets, {{it is possible to}} formalize the real numbers in second-order arithmetic. For this reason, second-order arithmetic is sometimes called “analysis” (Sieg 2013, p.291).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} quantifying the frequency domain accuracy of ARMA spectral estimates as dictated by the Cramer [...] Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Classical {{work in this area}} has led to expressions that are asymptotically exact as both data length and model order tend to infinity, although they are commonly used in finite model order and finite data length settings as approximations. More recent work has established <b>quantifications</b> which, for AR models, are exact for finite model order. By employing new analysis methods based on rational orthonormal parameterisations, together with the ideas of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, this paper develops <b>quantifications</b> that extend this previous work by being exact for finite model order in all of the AR, MA and ARMA system cases. These <b>quantifications,</b> via their explicit dependence on poles and zeros of the underlying spectral factor, reveal certain fundamental aspects of the accuracy achievable by spectral estimates of ARMA processes...|$|R

25|$|Here then De Morgan {{had made}} a great advance by {{introducing}} <b>quantification</b> of the terms. At that time Sir William Hamilton was teaching in Edinburgh a doctrine of the <b>quantification</b> of the predicate, and a correspondence sprang up. However, De Morgan soon perceived that Hamilton's <b>quantification</b> was of a different character; that it meant for example, substituting the two forms The whole of A is the whole of B, and The whole of A {{is a part of}} B for the Aristotelian form All A's are B's. Hamilton thought that he had placed the keystone in the Aristotelian arch, as he phrased it. Although {{it must have been a}} curious arch which could stand 2000 years without a keystone. As a consequence he had no room for De Morgan's innovations. He accused De Morgan of plagiarism, and the controversy raged for years in the columns of the Athenæum, and in the publications of the two writers.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Real-Time {{quantitative}} PCR is {{an important}} tool in research and clinical settings. Here, we describe two new approaches that broaden the scope of real-time quantitative PCR; namely, run-internal mini standard curves (RIMS) and direct real-time relative quantitative PCR (drqPCR). RIMS are an efficient alternative to traditional standard curves and provide both run-specific and target-specific estimates of PCR parameters. The drqPCR enables direct estimation of target ratios without reference to conventional control samples. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we compared RIMS-based drqPCR with classical <b>quantifications</b> based on external standard curves and the "comparative Ct method". Specifically, we used a raw real-time PCR dataset {{as the basis for}} more than two-and-a-half million simulated <b>quantifications</b> with various user-defined conditions. Compared with classical approaches, we found that RIMS-based drqPCR provided superior precision and comparable accuracy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The obviation of referencing to control samples is attractive whenever unpaired samples are quantified. This may be in clinical and research settings; for instance, studies on chimerism, TREC <b>quantifications,</b> copy number variations etc. Also, lab-to-lab comparability can be greatly simplified...|$|R
40|$|Databases contain {{data and}} {{database}} systems governing such databases are often intended {{to allow a}} user to query these data. On one hand, these data {{may be subject to}} imperfections, on the other hand, users may employ imperfect query preference specifications to query such databases. All of these imperfections lead to each query answer being accompanied by a collection of <b>quantifications</b> indicating how well (part of) a group of data complies with (part of) the user's query. A fundamental question is how to present the user with the query answers complying best to his or her query preferences. The work presented in this paper first determines the difficulties to overcome in reaching such presentation. Mainly, a useful presentation needs the ranking of the query answers based on the aforementioned <b>quantifications,</b> but it seems advisable to not combine <b>quantifications</b> with different interpretations. Thus, the work presented in this paper continues to introduce and examine a novel technique to determine a query answer ranking. Finally, a few aspects of this technique, among which its computational efficiency, are discussed...|$|R
