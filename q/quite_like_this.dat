500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will have a moment that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be." ...|$|E

6000|$|The hostess {{seemed not}} <b>quite</b> to <b>like</b> <b>this</b> arrogant humility. She said, over {{the length of}} the table (it was not very long), [...] "I'm sure you know some very nice people who have not been." ...|$|R
50|$|Situated in east CRA, the Chinko Project {{provides}} a rare sanctuary for wildlife in a volatile region plagued by militarised ivory poachers and excessive cattle farming. Extreme poverty {{has resulted in}} a 95% depletion of all wildlife, making this one of the most crucial conservation projects on the continent. There are very few places on earth <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> Chinko. <b>This</b> landscape, comprising both tropical rainforest and savannah plains, is home to ten species of primate, two distinct types of elephant and the iconic Lord Derby eland.|$|R
60|$|During the {{following}} fortnight, M. Claude came often, and I could not disguise from myself {{the fact that}} M. Claude did not <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> me. <b>This</b> was odd, for I liked him very much. I suppose he took me for a potential rival: men are so jealous {{when they are in}} love. Besides, I observed that Isaline tried not to be thrown too much with him alone; tried to include me in the party wherever she went with him. Also, I will freely confess that I felt myself every day more fond of Isaline's society, and I half fancied I caught myself trepidating a little inwardly now and then when she happened to come up to me. Absurd to be so susceptible; but such is man.|$|R

5000|$|Pop Insomniacs said, [...] "We've seen {{versions}} of this story several times, but never <b>quite</b> mangled together <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before, which is precisely why I was so captivated, uncomfortable and surprised by this movie". Kansas City Star reporter Jocelyn Noveck said, [...] "It {{all comes down to}} a doozy of a plot twist, and it's enjoyably shocking. But at the end you're still left shaking your head, feeling lost, wishing there was something tangible to hold on to — perhaps a bit like being trapped in a snow globe... Two stars out of four".|$|R
5000|$|What truly fascinates {{me about}} games like VA-11 Hall-A {{is that they}} make magic out of the mundane. In most games, the {{bartender}} is a background NPC with a few throwaway lines and maybe a quest or two. Here, as the bartender, you find her relatively normal life to be <b>quite</b> intriguing; games <b>like</b> <b>this</b> are digital page-turners and Fernando Damas' superb writing just {{makes you want to}} go even faster. As you go through more dialogue screens with Jill you discover she's quite eloquent and scientifically educated to no small degree ...Her back story unfolds along with the tragedies of her clients - and it's heartbreakingly relatable.

50|$|In this continuity, Shrinking Violet is {{also known}} as Atom Girl, a myth to all but the {{founding}} Legion members. She was considered a joke by the second wave of Legionnaires, until Brainiac 5 revealed her in the battle against Elysion of Terror Firma. She says she was exploring Brainiac 5's microverse and simply lost track of time. Invisible Kid used her name as a cover up to veil his tracks while spying on Brainiac 5. Subsequently, she assaulted Invisible Kid and after suspending him over the city, forgave him. She seems to <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> the image <b>this</b> gives her of being slightly crazy. She is fiercely loyal to Brainiac 5. Atom Girl overreacts to comments about her size and appears to feel hurt about appearing small {{in the eyes of the}} other Legionnaires, and seems unable to handle failure, as her rough facade only hides underlying self-image issues.|$|R
60|$|Rollo did not <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> plan; but he {{knew that}} Jonas was always firm when it was a {{question}} of right and wrong, and so he said no more; only, after a moment's pause, he asked Jonas when he would make the cabinet.|$|E

[...] "I do not <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> declaration of independence, though I can scarce blame congress for having made it. Of the two, I think the Americans nearest right, and I now conceive {{myself to be}} more of an American than an Englishman. I wish this to be understood, Joyce." ...|$|E
6000|$|Herbert did not <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{interference}} on the boy's part. Was he {{to explain}} to a young lad from Eton what his future intentions were with reference to his mode of living and period of marriage? [...] "Of course," [...] he said, addressing himself to the countess, [...] "I shall not insist on an engagement made under such different circumstances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] said Barrow, [...] "the {{rest of the}} outfit, is well enough, {{and while}} it's not too conspicuous, it isn't <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> the clothes that anybody else wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man he'll {{recognize}} {{the rest of his}} suit. That's a mighty embarrassing hat, you know, in a centre of civilization <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> I don't believe an angel could get employment in Washington in a halo like that." ...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{literature}} {{contains a}} lot of information which is found not only in text but also in depictions, tables and diagrams. Due to the fact the layout of scientific articles is <b>quite</b> complicated (<b>like</b> <b>this</b> poster) and differs from normal text sources. Nowadays chemistry journals are already digitally available (e. g. as PDF). However for extracting chemical related information like structural formulas from these sources it is necessary to identify and separate chemical objects and their context {{from the rest of the}} document. In the second step the separated chemistry objects are processed by name-to-structure or image-to-structure tools like chemoCRTM. Challenge 1 : grouping of semantic entities in full page scans The first step is to find all coherent regions and mark them with boxes. It is possible that several chemical structures appear in such a region. However, it is not allowed to have text, figures and structures mixed in one region. Coherent regions should consist of one chemical structure, one diagram, one text paragraph, a caption or section header. Columns should be separated. Methods: Input to the segmentation module are grayscale and binary full pages scans from PDF documents. An algorithm coined region growing has been developed. It uses dilatio...|$|R

"It may be so," [...] said Wallace, [...] "and {{of course}} I shall not fail {{you in this}} attempt to protect your old friends; but, {{to tell you the}} truth, I don't <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> {{readiness}} on the part of you Covenanters to defy the laws, however bad they may be, and to attack the King's troops.

60|$|Now Striped Chipmunk had {{not heard}} Bowser the Hound at all when he spoke, but just {{then there was the}} patter of heavy feet among the dried leaves, and sure enough there was Bowser himself.

6000|$|Mr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath {{left the}} office in Bedford Row together, and thus {{it was almost a}} {{necessity}} that they should walk together for some distance through the streets. Mr. Mason was going to his hotel in Soho Square, and Mr. Dockwrath turned with him through the passage leading into Red Lion Square, linking his own arm in that of his companion.

5000|$|During his {{introduction}} of Wegner at the 2011 USPTA Nor Cal Annual Convention Dick Gould remarked: [...] "Sometimes {{you listen to}} things {{a little different from}} what you've done before and Oscar and I go back a number of years...get to know him a little bit...to talk to him. He is not afraid to test the barriers a little bit, he is not afraid to say, hey, you don't <b>quite</b> do it <b>like</b> <b>this</b> and to look at how the players are really really playing...the mark of a good teacher is someone who listens and evolves with the game and leads that evolution and you have that guy here today.

The song peaked at #32 on the {{mainstream}} rock charts in 2002. The middle of the song pays homage to Lynyrd Skynyrd's classic [...] "Free Bird". The 'Live' Trucker version contains the 1st verse of the song before he returns to finish [...] "You Never Met..." ...|$|R

60|$|Tavernake {{remained}} {{alone in}} the luxurious little sitting-room for nearly ten minutes. Then {{the door of the}} inner room was opened and Elizabeth appeared. Tavernake, rising slowly to his feet, looked {{at her for a moment}} in reluctant but wondering admiration. She was wearing an ivory satin gown, without trimming or lace of any sort, a gown the fit of which seemed to him almost a miracle. Her only jewelry was a long rope of pearls and a small tiara. Tavernake had never been brought into close contact with any one <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} his notes and began a letter. It was a curious communication. It seemed to be all about buying Bertha and selling Clara--a cold-blooded {{proceeding}} which almost suggested slave-dealing. I gathered he was giving instructions to his agent: could he have business relations with Cuba, I wondered. But there were also hints of mysterious middies--brave British tars to the rescue, possibly! Perhaps my bewilderment showed itself upon my face, for at last he looked queerly at me. 'You don't <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I'm afraid,' he said, breaking off short.|$|E
6000|$|Lapham {{looked as}} if he did not <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> tone, and he resumed a little more quietly. [...] "Oh, there isn't really very much more to say about the paint itself. But you can use it for almost {{anything}} where a paint is wanted, inside or out. It'll prevent decay, and it'll stop it, after it's begun, in tin or iron. You can paint the inside of a cistern or a bath-tub with it, and water won't hurt it; and you can paint a steam-boiler with it, and heat won't. You can cover a brick wall with it, or a railroad car, or the deck of a steamboat, and you can't do a better thing for either." ...|$|E

60|$|Sally {{sat down}} in the chair he had vacated. She had never felt <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> before in her life. Everything seemed dreamlike. The {{splashing}} of water in the bathroom came faintly to her, and she realized that she had been on the point of falling asleep again. She got up and opened the window, and once more the air acted as a restorative. She watched the activities of the street with a distant interest. They, too, seemed dreamlike and unreal. People were hurrying up and down on mysterious errands. An inscrutable cat picked its way daintily across the road. At the door of the apartment house an open car purred sleepily.|$|E
6000|$|There is no book in {{the world}} <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> of Mr. Morris's old Oxford days when {{the spirit of the}} Middle Ages entered into him, with all its contradictions of faith and doubt, and its earnest desire to enjoy this life to the full in war and love, or to make certain of a future in which war is not, and all love is pure heavenly. If one were to choose favourites from [...] "The Defence of Guinevere," [...] they would be the ballads of [...] "Shameful Death," [...] and of [...] "The Sailing of the Sword," [...] and [...] "The Wind," [...] which has the wind's wail in its voice, and all the mad regret of [...] "Porphyria's Lover" [...] in its burden.|$|E

It savoured to him both of communism and priestcraft. 'That's an awkward text, you know,' he said, looking up curiously from the Bible in his hand into the doctor's face, 'a very awkward text; and I should say it was rather a dangerous one to set too fully before young people. It {{seems to me to}} make too little altogether of Property. You know, Dr. Greatrex, at first sight it DOES look just a little like communism.' ...|$|E
