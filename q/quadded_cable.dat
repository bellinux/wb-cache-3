50|$|Montage Mountain Waterpark {{is located}} on ski area grounds. It {{features}} six water attractions including a lazy river, wave pool, and water slides. Dry attractions include batting cages, beach volleyball, mini-golf, and the ZipRider (a 50 mph <b>quad</b> <b>cable</b> ride).|$|R
50|$|The {{magnetic}} immunity of star <b>quad</b> <b>cable</b> is {{a function}} of the accuracy of the star-quad geometry, the accuracy of the impedance balancing, and the common-mode rejection ratio of the balanced receiver. Star-quad cable typically provides a 10 dB to 30 dB reduction in magnetically-induced interference.|$|R
50|$|Some {{balanced}} lines use 4-conductor star <b>quad</b> <b>cable</b> {{to provide}} immunity to magnetic fields. The {{geometry of the}} cable ensures that magnetic fields will causes equal interference of both legs of the balanced circuit. This balanced interference is a common-mode signal that can easily be removed by a transformer or balanced differential receiver.|$|R

50|$|The Zobel {{networks}} {{described here}} {{can be used to}} equalise land lines composed of twisted pair or star <b>quad</b> <b>cables.</b> The balanced circuit nature of these lines delivers a good common mode rejection ratio (CMRR). To maintain the CMRR, circuits connected to the line should maintain the balance. For this reason, balanced versions of Zobel networks are sometimes required. This is achieved by halving the impedance of the series components and then putting identical components in the return leg of the circuit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{capacitance}} of a 4-conductor quad-star {{cable is}} roughly {{equal to the}} capacitance of a standard 2-conductor cable about 1.5 times as long. The increased capacitance of the star <b>quad</b> <b>cable</b> is not usually a problem with short cable runs, {{but it can be}} an issue for long cable runs. For example, an 8 m (25 ft) star-quad cable has a capacitance of 150 pF/m [...] for a total capacitance of 1200 pF for the entire length of cable. With a 150-ohm source impedance and 1200 pF load capacitance, the frequency response of this RC circuit is -0.02 dB at 20 kHz. If the cable was 80 m instead of 8 m, then the frequency response would be -0.2 dB at 20 kHz, and -3 dB at 88 kHz.|$|R
50|$|Star <b>quad</b> <b>cables</b> {{often use}} filler {{elements}} {{to hold the}} conductor centers in a symmetric four-point arrangement about the cable axis. All points of the star must lie at equal distances {{from the center of}} the star. When opposite points are connected together they act as if they are one conductor located at the center of the star. This configuration places the geometric center of each of the two legs of the balanced circuit in the center of the star. To a magnetic field, both legs of the balanced circuit appear to be in the exact center of the star. This means that both legs of the balanced circuit will receive exactly the same interference from the magnetic field and a common-mode interference signal will be produced. This common-mode interference signal will be rejected by the balanced receiver.|$|R

This paper provides crosstalk models derived from measured data for <b>quad</b> <b>cable,</b> lengths between 75 and 590 meters, and frequencies up to 30 MHz. The results indicate that the log-normal statistical model (with a simple parametric law for the frequency-dependent mean) fits well up to 30 MHz for both FEXT and NEXT. This extends earlier log-normal statistical modeling and validation results for NEXT over bandwidths in the order of a few MHz. The fitted crosstalk power spectra are useful for modem design and simulation. Insertion loss, phase, and impulse response duration characteristics of the direct channels are also provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{studio is}} located in a gated complex with high tech {{security}} system. The studio consists of a large control room, small live room, a large vocal booth, a grand piano room, and a private bar with seats. These rooms are fully equipped with the latest state of the art equipment. They boast of technology like Neve, Chandler, SSL 9000J and many more. The entire place is covered by Mogami <b>quad</b> <b>cabling</b> as well as terminated Neutrick connections for all panels. There are touch screens in all rooms to help artists interface with pro tools or work directly with their lyrics without the need of assistance from the engineer. The place has its own clean power grid making it possible to continue working even when there is no power in the city. The control room is also acoustically designed to give deaf people the power of sound.|$|R

50|$|KWKB is a {{television}} station that broadcasts on digital channel 25 {{and is the}} This TV affiliate for Eastern Iowa. KWKB is licensed to Iowa City, but its studios and transmitter are located on Baker Avenue in West Branch. KWKB serves the greater Eastern Iowa area including Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo, and Dubuque (its signal also reaches the <b>Quad</b> Cities, but <b>cable</b> television systems in that area carry KGCW-DT2 instead).|$|R
50|$|Lift Engineering {{also moved}} into the funitel market in the early 1990s. The <b>quad</b> mono <b>cable,</b> or QMC funitel, was invented by Mr. Kunczynski (US Patent 4,848,241). The lift {{consisted}} of four separate loops of cable, strung between {{the upper and lower}} stations. Two cables were run in the uphill direction, and two were run in the downhill direction. The cabins would be mounted between the cables. But, because the cables were looped, once the cabins reached the upper station, the cables would loop back downhill not carrying a load. Only one of these lifts was ever built, at June Mountain, California. Apparently, the owners had difficulty getting the cables to run in synchronicity. The lift also developed the grip problems that occurred on the Yan high-speed quads, and was removed in 1997.|$|R
