5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal that forced {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The Land of Lost Content: the Biography of Anthony Chenevix-Trench is a biographical {{book about}} the life of British {{headmaster}} Anthony Chenevix-Trench, written by Mark Peel. Chenevix-Trench had been a widely acclaimed teacher at Shrewsbury School, and subsequently headmaster at Bradfield College, Eton College and Fettes College, but was later criticised for his approach to corporal punishment. Published by Pentland Press in 1996, the book received mixed reviews, with <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> its neutrality and writing style, but plaudits for its insights into British culture and education.|$|E

5|$|Along with <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> the new ships' {{nomenclature}} came {{uncertainty about}} their actual role {{due to their}} lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with {{which they had been}} equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The Invincibles were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.|$|E
5|$|As the Monbar {{case and}} similar cases came to light, the GAL issue became {{increasingly}} controversial in the 1990s, with <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> whether {{members of the}} Spanish government and state security service had known about the group's operations in places like Bayonne and, if so, to what extent they had supported and funded the attacks. This became a major issue during the 1996 Spanish general election with Spanish Interior Minister, José Barrionuevo, and his security chief, Rafael Vera, implicated in the GAL case. In 1998, both were jailed for ten years for sanctioning a kidnapping and {{misappropriation of public funds}} to finance the GAL. Along with various corruption scandals and the poor state of the Spanish economy in the mid-1990s, the GAL scandal is seen as a key factor in the PSOE defeat.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} strong interest among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, 2017 the British paper The Guardian {{reported}} {{that hundreds of}} banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> what they knew about the international scheme and why they did not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash. Other banks facing scrutiny under the investigation included HSBC, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays and Coutts.|$|E
5|$|Very few {{historical}} sources give detailed {{accounts of}} the battle {{and they do not}} describe the exact deployments of the armies. The paucity of such primary sources led early historians to adopt Hall's chronicle as their main resource for the engagement, despite its authorship 70years after the event and <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> the origin of his information. The Burgundian chronicler Jehan de Waurin (13981474) was a more contemporary source, but his chronicle was made available to the public only from 1891, and several mistakes in it discouraged historians at that time from using it. Later reconstructions of the battle were based on Hall's version, supplemented by minor details from other sources.|$|E
5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured slight damage during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E

5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} {{death of the}} childless David II, Robert Stewart, {{the first of the}} Stewart (later Stuart) monarchs, came to the throne in 1371. Despite his relatively venerable age of 55, his son, John, Earl of Carrick, grew impatient and assumed the reins of government as Lord Lieutenant. A border incursion into England led to the victory at Otterburn in 1388, but at the cost of the life of John's ally James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas. This, along with Carrick having suffered a debilitating horse kick, led to a shift in power to his brother Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife, who now was appointed as Lieutenant in his place. When Robert II died in 1390 John took the regnal name Robert III, to avoid awkward <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> the exact status of the first King John, but power rested with his brother Robert, now Duke of Albany. After the suspicious death of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, James (the future James I), sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III later that year, regents ruled Scotland: first Albany and after his death in 1420 his son Murdoch, during whose term of office the country suffered considerable unrest.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish whether they had a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> Vorster's intentions.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in fact she is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish <b>questions</b> <b>over</b> homosexual activity.|$|E
