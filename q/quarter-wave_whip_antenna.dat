5000|$|To {{function}} as a ground plane, the conducting surface {{must be at least}} a quarter of the wavelength (λ/4) of the radio waves in size. In lower frequency antennas, such as the mast radiators used for broadcast antennas, the Earth itself (or a body of water such as a salt marsh or ocean) is used as a ground plane. For higher frequency antennas, in the VHF or UHF range, the ground plane can be smaller, and metal disks, screens and wires are used as ground planes. At upper VHF and UHF, the metal skin of a car or aircraft can serve as a ground plane for whip antennas projecting from it. In microstrip antennas and printed monopole antennas an area of copper foil {{on the opposite side of}} a printed circuit board serves as a ground plane. The ground plane doesn't have to be a continuous surface. In the ground plane antenna style whip antenna, the [...] "plane" [...] consists of several wires λ/4 long radiating from the base of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{ground plane}} {{used with a}} {{monopole}} may be the actual earth; {{in this case the}} antenna is mounted on the ground and one side of the feedline is connected to an earth ground {{at the base of the}} antenna. This design is used for the mast radiator antennas employed in radio broadcasting at low frequencies, as well as other low frequency antennas such as the T-antenna and umbrella antenna. At VHF and UHF frequencies the size of the ground plane needed is smaller, so artificial ground planes are used to allow the antenna to be mounted above the ground. A common type of monopole antenna at these frequencies consists of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> with a ground plane consisting of several wires or rods radiating horizontally or diagonally from its base; this is called a ground-plane antenna. At gigahertz frequencies the metal surface of a car roof or airplane body makes a good ground plane, so car cell phone antennas consist of short whips mounted on the roof, and aircraft communication antennas frequently consist of a short conductor in an aerodynamic fairing projecting from the fuselage; this is called a blade antenna. [...] The most common antenna used in mobile phones is the inverted-F antenna, which is a variant of the inverted-L monopole. Bending over the antenna saves space and keeps the it within the bounds of the mobile's case but the antenna then has a very low impedance. To improve the match the antenna is not fed from the end, rather some intermediate point, and the end is grounded instead. The quarter-wave whip and rubber ducky antennas used with handheld radios such as walkie-talkies and cell phones are also monopole antennas. These don't use a ground plane, and the ground side of the transmitter is just connected to the ground connection on its circuit board. The hand and body of the person holding them may function as a rudimentary ground plane.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Whip</b> <b>antennas</b> are {{normally}} designed as resonant antennas; the rod {{acts as a}} resonator for radio waves, with standing waves of voltage and current reflected {{back and forth from}} its ends. Therefore, the length of the antenna rod is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. The most common length is approximately one-quarter of the wavelength, called a [...] "quarter-wave whip" [...] (although often shortened by the use of a loading coil; see Electrically short whips below). For example, the common <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> <b>antennas</b> used on FM radios in the USA are approximately 75 cm long, which is roughly one-quarter the length of radio waves in the FM radio band, which are 2.78 to 3.41 meters long. Half-wave antennas are also common.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the rubber}} ducky, antennas on {{portable}} radios usually consisted of <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> <b>antennas,</b> rods whose length was {{one-quarter of the}} wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] In the VHF range where they were used, these antennas were 2 or 3 feet long, making them cumbersome. They were often made of telescoping tubes that could be retracted when not in use. To make the antenna more compact, electrically short antennas, shorter than one-quarter wavelength, began to be used. Electrically short antennas have considerable capacitive reactance, so to make them resonant at the operating frequency an inductor (loading coil) is added in series with the antenna. Antennas which have these inductors built into their bases are called base-loaded whips.|$|R
40|$|Microstrip-patch-style antennas that {{generate}} monopole radiation patterns {{similar to those}} of <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip</b> <b>antennas</b> can be designed to have dimensions smaller than those needed heretofore for this purpose, by taking advantage of a feed configuration different from the conventional one. The large sizes necessitated by the conventional feed configuration have, until now, made such antennas impractical for frequencies below about 800 MHz: for example, at 200 MHz, the conventional feed configuration necessitates a patch diameter of about 8 ft (. 2. 4 m). too large, for example, for mounting on the roof of an automobile or on a small or medium-size aircraft. By making it possible to reduce diameters to between a tenth and a third of that necessitated by the conventional feed configuration, the modified configuration makes it possible to install such antennas in places where they could not previously be installed and thereby helps to realize the potential advantages (concealment and/or reduction of aerodynamic drag) of microstrip versus <b>whip</b> <b>antennas.</b> In both the conventional approach and the innovative approach, a microstrip-patch (or microstrip-patch-style) antenna for generating a monopole radiation pattern includes an electrically conductive patch or plate separated from an electrically conductive ground plane by a layer of electrically insulating material. In the conventional approach, the electrically insulating layer is typically a printed-circuit board about 1 / 16 in. (. 1. 6 mm) thick. Ordinarily, a coaxial cable from a transmitter, receiver, or transceiver is attached at the center on the ground-plane side, the shield of the cable being electrically connected to the ground plane. In the conventional approach, the coaxial cable is mated with a connector mounted on the ground plane. The center pin of this connector connects {{to the center of the}} coaxial cable and passes through a hole in the ground plane and a small hole in the insulating layer and then connects with the patch above one-third of the radial distance from the center. The modified feed configuration of the innovative approach is an inductive-short-circuit configuration that provides impedance matching and that has been used for many years on other antennas but not on microstrip-style monopole antennas. In this configuration, the pin is connected to both the conductive patch and the ground plane. As before, the shield of the coaxial cable is connected to the ground plane, but now the central conductor is connected to a point on the pin between the ground plane and the conductive plate (see figure). The location of the connection point on the pin is chosen so that together, the inductive short circuit and the conductive plate or patch act as components of a lumped-element resonant circuit that radiates efficiently at the resonance frequency and, at the resonance frequency, has an impedance that matches that of the coaxial cable. It should be noted that the innovative design entails two significant disadvantages. One disadvantage is that the frequency bandwidth for efficient operation is only about 1 / 20 to 1 / 15 that of a <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> designed for the same nominal frequency. The other disadvantage is that the estimated gain is between 3 - 1 / 2 and 4 - 1 / 2 dB below that of the <b>whip</b> <b>antenna.</b> However, if an affected radio-communication system used only a few adjacent frequency channels and the design of the components of the system other than the antenna provided adequate power or gain margin, then these disadvantages could be overcome...|$|R
50|$|A <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> is {{an antenna}} {{consisting}} of a straight flexible wire or rod. The bottom end of the whip {{is connected to the}} radio receiver or transmitter. The antenna is designed to be flexible so that it does not break easily,and the name is derived from the whip-like motion that it exhibits when disturbed. <b>Whip</b> <b>antennas</b> for portable radios are often made of a series of interlocking telescoping metal tubes, so they can be retracted when not in use. Longer ones, made for mounting on vehicles and structures, are made of a flexible fiberglass rod around a wire core and can be up to 35 ft (10 m) long. The length of the <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with. The most common type is the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip,</b> which is approximately one-quarter of a wavelength long. Whips are {{the most common type of}} monopole antenna, and are used in the HF, VHF and UHF radio bands. They are widely used as the antennas for hand-held radios, such as cell phones, cordless phones, walkie-talkies, FM radios, boom boxes, Wi-Fi enabled devices, and GPS receivers, and are attached to vehicles as the antennas for car radios and two-way radios for wheeled vehicles and for aircraft. Larger versions mounted on roofs and radio masts are used as base station antennas for police, fire, ambulance, taxi, and other vehicle dispatchers.|$|R
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} length of a <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> to make it less cumbersome, an {{inductor}} (loading coil) is often added in series with it. This allows the antenna to be made much shorter than the normal length of a quarter-wavelength, and still be resonant, by cancelling out the capacitive reactance of the short antenna. The coil is added {{at the base of the}} whip (called a base-loaded whip) or occasionally in the middle (center-loaded whip). In the most widely used form, the rubber ducky antenna, the loading coil is integrated with the antenna itself by making the whip out of a narrow helix of springy wire. The helix distributes the inductance along the antenna's length, improving the radiation pattern, and also makes it more flexible. Another alternative occasionally used to shorten the antenna is to add a [...] "capacity hat", a metal screen or radiating wires, at the end. However all these electrically short whips have lower gain than a full length <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip.</b>|$|R
50|$|Antennas: 9 ft <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> (receiver), 15 ft <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> (transmitter). Optional 21 ft <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> while {{stationary}} or 45 ft {{auxiliary wire}} antenna for 2.0 to 4.5 MHz coverage.|$|R
50|$|Although {{like other}} {{electrically}} short antennas the rubber ducky has poorer performance (less gain) than a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>whip,</b> it has somewhat better performance than an equal length base loaded antenna. This {{is because the}} inductance is distributed throughout the antenna and so allows somewhat greater current in the antenna.|$|R
