The aim of this financial reform initiative was to provide a pilot scheme for relaxing, in a limited way, foreign exchange controls over the country&# 039;s capital account, as well as to leverage the investment and management skills of successful foreign financial institutions to raise the standards of the Chinese market. QFII are perceived by the Chinese Government to have stronger motivation to undertake long-term investment strategies. They are expected to bring with them not only advanced investment methodology and skills, but also an investment approach that may help develop a more stable and healthy stock market environment. This study examines the empirical evidence of this development to assess if such expectations are being fulfilled. The findings suggest that QFII have made some inroads, but have not yet been able to exert long-term impacts on the Chinese market...|$|E

In this paper we focus on the changing competitive pressures on clothing producers in the region and on the diversity of adjustments currently being made in response to these changes. In particular, we detail the wide range of adjustment strategies being adopted by firms in Slovakia and Bulgaria, and show how interregional price competition, downgrading, and geographical shifts in patterns of sourcing and production are articulated with imperatives to regionalized production for major markets, stabilization of supply networks, industrial upgrading, and the expansion of localized sourcing and domestic-marketing strategies. ...|$|R

40|$|Aims: The study {{tests the}} effects of {{reduction}} in alcohol taxation and increased travellers’ allowances on alcohol consumption and related harm in Denmark, Finland and southern Sweden. In late 2003 and early 2004, taxes on alcoholic beverages were reduced in Denmark and Finland, and the abolition of <b>quantitative</b> <b>quotas</b> on alcohol import for personal use from other European Union countries made cheaper alcohol more available in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.   Methods: Analyses of routine statistical register data, and summarizing results from longitudinal and repeated cross-sectional population surveys and other previous analyses, with northern Sweden as a control site for secular trends. Results: Contrary to expectations, alcohol consumption – as based on register data – increased only in Finland and not in Denmark and southern Sweden, and self-reported survey data did not show an increase in any site. In Finland, alcohol-attributable harms in register data increased, especially in people with low socio-economic status. Few such effects were found in Denmark and southern Sweden. Neither did results for self-reported alcohol-attributable problems show any general increases in the three sites. These results remained after controlling for regression to the mean and modelling of drop-outs. Conclusions: Harms measured in register data did tend to increase {{in the short term}} with the policy change, particularly in Finland, where the tax changes were broader. But reducing price and increasing availability does not always increase alcohol consumption and harm.   Effects are dampened in affluent societies, and other factors may intervene.   The results for Finland also suggest some limits for general population surveys in testing for relatively small policy effects.

50|$|A TRQ {{combines}} two {{policy instruments}} that nations historically {{have used to}} restrict imports: quotas and tariffs. In a TRQ, the quota component works together with a specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection. Essentially, a TRQ is a two-tiered tariff. The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower, tariff rate called the Inside tariff quota rate or ITQR. Imports above the <b>quota's</b> <b>quantitative</b> threshold (Q) face a much higher (usually prohibitive) Outside tariff quota rate or OTQR. The Q units are called the quota volume, and this volume serves as the cut off between the ITQR and the OTQR.|$|R

40|$|The 1996 Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture was a {{step toward}} free trade. The Agreement lifts bans and quotas on imports, but allows their {{conversion}} into tariff-rate quotas (TRQs), which function like quotas. At present, many of the 1, 300 TRQs increased market access to imports, but some have preserved pre-Agreement levels of protection. The World Trade Organization's intent as to the administration of TRQs is open to interpretation. This report analyzes seven administrative methods {{in light of the}} principle of nondiscrimination. We conclude that auctions are the best way to administer a TRQ. First-come, first-served and license-on-demand methods present a moderate risk of biased trade. State trading organizations and producer groups that directly administer TRQs can also bias trade. Historical allocation is the method most likely to be discriminatory.

40|$|Thesis (M. Dev. Studies) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2006 A {{fundamental}} change in the global and textile industries took place on 1 January 2005, when the global <b>quantitative</b> <b>quotas</b> were abolished. International retail buyers are now able {{to reduce the number of}} their international suppliers, and can act on a preference to buy from suppliers anywhere in the world, offering the cheapest price on international orders. South Africa had been experiencing growth in cheaper imports, mostly at the lower end of the market, since 1994 when the political arena in South Africa changed, resulting in a reduction of its tariffs faster than the World Trade Organisation required. The post- 2005 environment has seen a rapid increase in imports into South Africa, predominantly from Asia. This has resulted in numerous South African firms in the clothing and textile industries having to reduce their labour, outsource part of their production, or close down altogether, due to their inability to compete with their Asian counterparts. One area of the clothing and textile industries in South Africa that has the potential to assist in the sustainability of these industries is the development and growth of South African design content. Relatively new to South Africa is the growth in and recognition of South African fashion designers entering the market, which has resulted in the heightened visibility and activity of numerous inter-related industries, all servicing South African fashion, such as: model agencies, hair-stylists, make-up artists, the fashion media, fashion events and private boutiques. This study explores the experiences of and problems faced by South African designers in producing garments, meeting the price demanded by consumers, and being competitive in the current context of the local market that is dominated by the major retail chains. However, as this research paper will show, numerous South African designers are managing in different ways to succeed and in so doing, have created viable and successful design operations in a very competitive industry. The participants interviewed for this study are all independent designers and successful in their own right. Some have been in the industry for many years, while others are establishing their names and brands in the marketplace. All these designers manufacture from their own atelier (studio) or factory, thereby retaining production control. As and when the need arises, some outsource part of their production to CMTs (cutmake- and-trim specialists) or home-based workers. Many of the designers sell within both the formal and informal economy, some sell their products through their own boutiques while others sell through private boutiques. A common theme of these designers' success is that they grew their business gradually, learning incrementally about the business of fashion and how to maintain control over their cash-flows while slowly growing their visibility in the market. In the interviews, the designers reflected on the importance of customer relations, the importance of Fashion Weeks for promoting their products, as well as the importance of finding reliable suppliers. A common difficulty experienced by the designers is that of finding the correct balance between creativity and commercial success. The study concludes with some recommendations for the promotion and sustainability of South African design content, such as development of co-operative ventures or small clusters of designers working together and creating economies of scale in order to wield greater influence in the value chain. Another important recommendation made is that of designers finding suitable business partners, so that while the designers focus on creative work, their partner drives the commercial and marketing arm of the operation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} contemporary {{themes and}} best practice in student assessment within chiropractic practice-integrated learning (PIL), taken {{as being the}} institution-managed, supervised clinicalplacement of senior chiropractic students {{within the context of}} a first-professional tertiary qualification. Methods: Focus group methodology was applied to four main categories of participants being multiple groups of chiropractic students, chiropractic academics, and chiropractic clinical educators or ‘clinicians’ in three institutions in three countries. The fourth category, industry, was represented by 3 groups. There were 65 total individual participants. Results: The findings provide evidence that (i) the complexities of clinical learning are compounded by a lack of consistent assessment processes and clinician behaviours; (ii) student assessment within chiropractic PIL should shift more towards the quality of the patient interaction and management given that <b>quantitative</b> measurement by <b>quota</b> completion equates to neither competency nor capability; (iii) specific elements of chiropractic PIL, namely radiography and radiology, are thought to remain relevant in the university-managed PIL environment and a structured assessment of their perceived value should be undertaken; (iv) feedback to students is acknowledged as important if not critical to their growth and development as a learner and a strong desire is present to strengthen and improve feedback as an assessment tool in the PILenvironment; and (v) critical self reflection has value as an assessment tool in this environment and must be properly implemented with a pre-determined structure and training of both students and clinicians. Discussion: The results are congruent with contemporary educational theory and point to a range of changes that could be developed and implemented by chiropractic educational institutions to improve the learning experience of chiropractic students and the quality of patient care provided in the teaching clinics. Conclusion: The finding that the complexities of clinical learning are compounded by a lack of consistent assessment processes and clinician behaviours supports the recent observations of the authors. The evidence is strongly indicative of the need to shift clinical assessment and processes more towards the quality of the patient interaction and management. The findings also signal the need to shift to a more holistic view of the patient in which the roleof radiography and radiology may be refreshed and strengthened and the primacy of the patient becomes the key driver of the learning around clinical decision making...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Determining {{the country}} of origin of a product is {{important}} for properly assessing tariffs, enforcing trade remedies (such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties) or <b>quantitative</b> restrictions (tariff <b>quotas),</b> and statistical purposes. Other commercial trade policies are also linked with origin determinations, such as country of origin labeling and government procurement regulations. Rules of origin (ROO), used to determine {{the country of}} origin of merchandise entering the U. S. market, can be very simple, noncontroversial tools of international trade as long as all of the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled primarily in one country. However, when a finished product’s component parts originate in many countries, {{as is often the case}} in today’s global trading environment, determining origin can be a very complex, sometimes subjective, and time-consuming process. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency responsible for determining country of origin using various ROO schemes. Non-preferential rules of origin are {{used to determine the}} origin of goods imported from countries with which the United States has most-favored-nation (MFN) status. They are the principal regulatory tools for accurate assessment of tariffs on imports, addressing country of origin labeling issues, qualifying goods for government procurement, and enforcing trade remedy actions and trade sanctions. Preferential rules are used to determine the eligibility of imported goods from certain U. S. free trade agreement (FTA) partners and certain developing country beneficiaries to receive duty-free or reduced tariff benefits under bilateral or regional FTAs, trade preference programs (such as the Generalized System of Preferences), and other special import programs. Preferential rules of origin are specific to each FTA, which means that they vary from agreement to agreement and preference to preference. This report deals with ROO in three parts. First, we describe in more detail the reasons that country of origin rules are important and briefly describe U. S. laws and methods that provide direction in making these determinations. Second, we discuss briefly some of the more controversial issues involving rules of origin, including the apparently subjective nature of some CBP origin determinations, and the effects of the global manufacturing process on ROO. Third, we conclude with some alternatives and options that Congress could consider that might assist in simplifying the process. This report will be updated as events warrant...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MPhil) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: HIV and AIDS {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats to the world of work. The {{knowledge}} of the epidemic and modes of transmission are important to inform all interventions in a mainstreamed fashion to address both internal and external responses to HIV and AIDS (Human Science Research Council, 2005). According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (2007), Organization and companies has conducted studies on knowledge, attitudes and practices or behaviour within its workplace and have found it to be very useful practices for the development, as well for the monitoring and evaluation of HIV and AIDS programs. This study used <b>quantitative</b> methods through <b>quota</b> sampling in selecting 50 employees in west rand health district stakeholders where 40 % managers, 50 % nurses and 10 % union stewards. The researcher used self administered questionnaire to establish the knowledge, attitude and practices of WRHD Stakeholders towards HIV and AIDS Policy procedures at workplace to improve service delivery. The results findings of the total respondents shows that employees have received training and have acquired HIV and AIDS knowledge, that‟s showed positive attitudes towards people living HIV and AIDS at workplace but they were not satisfied with practices of the HIV and AIDS policy procedures at workplace. Majority of the respondents showed that the HIV and AIDS policy procedure not user friendly, not comfortable to disclosure their HIV status, and Safety, care and support protocols not enforced on all concerned staff. Recommendation are provided to that the employer should work together within different and relevant program by ensuring that training team is fully involved together with human resource and employees wellness program and other relevant NGOs.

40|$|The {{latest round}} of {{multilateral}} trade negotiations was launched at the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001. Agriculture is a major item on {{the agenda for the}} Doha Round. The primary focus is on the three “pillars” of the Uruguay Round agreement—domestic support, market access, and export competition. The framework for a final agreement was finalized at a Ministerial meeting in Geneva in July 2004, but contains few details on modalities (e. g., the formula to be used for reductions in tariffs/increases in tariff-rate <b>quotas,</b> <b>quantitative</b> limitations on domestic support, and the schedule for the elimination of export subsidies). Detailed proposals on a number of these issues were put forward in October 2005 by the European Union and the United States, in addition to the G 10 and G 20 groups of countries. The Doha Round negotiations have since run into several major hurdles, and it is unclear at this time if, or when, an agreement might be reached. Nevertheless, the range of alternatives for key parameters is becoming increasingly clear. In this paper we analyze empirically the implications of the provisions of a Doha agreement for agricultural markets in Sudan. The analysis is based on the PEATSim model (Partial Equilibrium Agricultural Trade Simulator) developed by the Penn State University in collaboration with the Economic Research Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. This dynamic, multi-country, multi-commodity model covers 35 of the major traded agricultural commodities and contains a detailed representation of markets and policies in twelve countries/regions that are particularly significant for world agricultural trade. The model is used to analyze the US, EU, and G 20 negotiating proposals from October 2005. The PEATSim model has previously been used to analyze a number of agricultural trade and policy reform scenarios, including global agricultural trade liberalization in all commodities, trade liberalization in global dairy markets, and trade liberalization in coarse grain markets. Sudan is not a currently member of the WTO although {{it has been in the}} accession process since 1994. Assuming that Sudan continues outside of WTO membership, its trade policies will not be directly affected by a Doha agreement. But Sudan could be affected significantly by changes in global agricultural markets. Preliminary results using PEATSim indicate an increase in Sudanese production and exports of course grains, peanuts, cotton, sunflowers, and beef due to increases in world prices. Imports of several products increase, especially wheat, rice, and poultry meat. On the whole the preliminary results suggest that Sudanese agriculture should benefit from a Doha agreement.
