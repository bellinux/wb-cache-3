However, {{there are also some}} unique climate anomalies in and around the Asian inland Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), where the climate was unusually humid during MIS 3 and 13, and extremely cold during MIS 22 and 38. Most explanations involve modifications to atmospheric circulation, but there is no single answer for such anomalies. Here, we compare relative geomagnetic paleointensity with benthic δ¹⁸O, and find that all anomalies occur when paleointensity negatively correlates with δ¹⁸O. The reason for this is not yet clear. Milankovitch theory fundamentally explains <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles</b> by external forcing. Our results suggest that changes in the Earth's deep interior, especially geomagnetic field intensity, may {{play a significant role in}} some non-linear climate changes in mid-latitude long-term Quaternary climate change. We are currently pursuing the idea that fluctuations in global climatic background (δ¹⁸O record) and cosmic ray influx, which is controlled by the strength of the geomagnetic field, may from time to time act in concert to create regional anomalies such as those seen on the CLP. 5 page(s...|$|R

In cooperation between the University of Bremen and institutes in Chile, Denmark and Sweden the carbon cycle in this, on a global scale, important area will be studied. The aim of this studies is the investigation of the present day cycling of carbon and the reconstruction of paleoenvironmental conditions, focusing on paleoproductivity, through the late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles.</b> Only very little is known so far about the southern part of the Peru/Chile current and about its youngest geological history.

A detailed study of the oceanographic and biologic conditions about the entire width of the Peru/Chile current in combination with surface sediment data will help to understand the present-day sedimentation processes with this region. In addition, this expedition provided the excellent opportunity to repeat the oceanographic measurements done during the SCORPIO cruise 28 years ago. By this repetition, variations in water mass structure and composition and changes as e. g. global warming can be detected. (orig.)

The study area covers depositional settings from the West African margin (ODP Site 959) through the Equatorial Divergence (ODP Site 663) to the pelagic Equatorial Atlantic.

The results are finally compared to a concept established for fossil deep sea environments [Littke and Sachsenhofer, 1994 doi: 10. 1021 /ef 00048 a 041]. Organic geochemical results obtained from Equatorial Atlantic deep sea deposits provide new aspects {{on the distribution of}} sedimentary OM in response to continental distance, atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, and depositional processes controlling sedimentation under modern and past glacial-interglacial conditions. The inventory of macerals in deep sea deposits is limited due to mechanical breakdown of particles, degree of oxidation, and selective remineralization of labile (mostly marine) OM. Nevertheless, organic petrology has a great potential for paleoenvironmental studies, especially as a proxy to assess quantitative information on the relative abundance of marine vs. terrigenous OM. Discrepancies between quantitative data obtained from microscopic and isotopic (delta 13 Corg) {{analyses were}} observed depending on the stratigraphic level and depositional setting. Strongest offset between both records was found close to the continent and during glacial periods, suggesting a coupling with wind-born terrigenous OM from central Africa.

In Europe, general evolutionary scenarios have been defined from genetic evidence. Recently, these scenarios have been challenged with genetic as well as fossil data. The origins of the modern distributions of most temperate plant and animal species could predate the Last Glacial Maximum. The glacial survival of such populations may have occurred in either southern (Mediterranean regions) and/or northern (Carpathians) refugia. Here, a phylogeographic analysis of a widespread European small mammal (Microtus arvalis) is conducted with a multidisciplinary approach. Genetic, fossil and ecological traits are used to assess the evolutionary history of this vole. Regardless of whether the European distribution of the five previously identified evolutionary lineages is corroborated, this combined analysis brings to light several colonization processes of M. arvalis. The species' dispersal was relatively gradual with glacial survival in small favourable habitats in Western Europe (from Germany to Spain) while in the rest of Europe, because of periglacial conditions, dispersal was less regular with bottleneck events followed by postglacial expansions. Our study demonstrates that the evolutionary history of European temperate small mammals is indeed much more complex than previously suggested. Species can experience heterogeneous evolutionary histories over their geographic range. Multidisciplinary approaches should therefore be preferentially chosen in prospective studies, the better to understand the impact of climatic change on past and present biodiversit...|$|R

40|$|This project {{focused on}} the {{reconstruction}} of the paleoproductivity and the history of the terrigenous sediment input in the Peru/Chile Current through the Late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles.</b> The aim of this project was to investigate the impact of this high productive region on the global variations in productivity, which often have been postulated to be in rhythm with the changing climate between glacials and interglacials and to be - at least partly - responsible for the respective variations in the atmospheric CO_ 2 -content. Another focal point of this project was the investigation of the input of terrigenous sediments along the Chilean continental slope. Variations in this input have been analysed in order to find evidence for proposed glacial/interglacial shifts of the climatic zonation in Chile. The project started with the expedition SO- 102 with RV SONNE, which has been carried out successful in May and June 1995. The results, which have been obtained so far within this project, point to regional differences in the development of glacial paleoproductivities in the Peru/Chile Current. For some regions the data indicate decreased glacial productivity, while for others glacial productivity was considerably increased. Investigations along {{the northern part of the}} Chilean continental slope have shown, that the input of terrigenous material was affected by cyclic variations with a dominant 23, 000 years frequency. These variations in the terrigenous input are most likely due to variations of the precipitation conditions, which are interpreted to reflect shifts of Chilean climatic zones during the last 120, 000 years.

40|$|Kniphofia, a genus of {{approximately}} 71 species, {{is almost entirely}} African with two species occurring in Madagascar and one in Yemen. Commonly known as ‘red hot pokers’ they are popular among horticulturists. The genus is also well known for its complex alpha taxonomy. To date, no {{studies have examined the}} phylogenetic relationships among species or the evolutionary history of the genus, and little work has been done on their biogeography. The main focus of this study was (i) to review the alpha taxonomy, (ii) to assess diversity and endemism in Kniphofia, (iii) to use DNA sequence data to reconstruct a specieslevel phylogeny to understand intra-generic species relationships and evolutionary processes (iv) to use phylogeographic approaches to study the biogeography and evaluate biogeographical patterns, and (v) to assess anatomical variation and determine if anatomical characters are useful for species delimitation. It was found that the genus has six centres of diversity, five of which are centres of endemism. The South African Centre is the most speciose and is also the largest centre of endemism. Kniphofia shows a strong Afromontane grassland affinity in Tropical and East Africa. In South Africa, it is found from high altitudes to coastal habitats, with the most speciose regions being Afromontane grasslands. It is thus not considered to be an Afromontane element, but rather an Afromontane associate. Five major evolutionary lineages were identified using cpDNA sequence data (trnT-L spacer), four of which are southern African. The fifth lineage is represented by material from Madagascar, East and Tropical Africa. The nuclear ITS region failed to provide resolution, as many sequences were identical. The five lineages recovered using cpDNA showed some congruence with geographic origin rather than the taxonomic arrangement based on morphology. All of the species with multiple samples were non-monophyletic. This could be due to hybridisation and/or incomplete lineage sorting. The nested clade analysis, although preliminary, did not completely agree with the phylogenetic analyses. One of the three third level nested clades appears to show fragmentation between the Cape Region, KwaZulu-Natal and northern parts of southern Africa. Furthermore, another nested clades recovered suggest a range expansion and radiation from the Drakensberg into the adjacent Drakensberg-Maputoland-Pondoland transition. Morphological species of Kniphofia exhibited substantial leaf anatomical variation and anatomical characters do not cluster samples into their morphological species. The anatomical results do not fit any geographic pattern, nor do they correspond to the lineages recovered using molecular markers or the nested clades. Leaf anatomical variation {{does not appear to be}} influenced by geographical or environmental factors. However, hybridisation may play a role but was not tested in this study. In light of the above findings it is proposed that the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Kniphofia is strongly linked to tectonic events, and <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles</b> and vegetation changes. Tectonic events (viz. uplifts) may have resulted in vicariance events that may account for the five cpDNA lineages recovered in phylogenetic analyses, while <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>cycles</b> and vegetation changes may have had a more recent impact on evolution and biogeography. It is hypothesised that the ancestral area for Kniphofia was much more widespread when Afromontane grasslands were more extensive during cooler and drier glacial episodes. Kniphofia on the high mountains of Tropical and East Africa would have tracked Afromontane grasslands as they expanded their ranges in cooler periods. While during wetter and warmer interglacial periods Kniphofia would have retreated into refugia on the mountains of Tropical and East Africa, with no gene flow possible between these refugia. In South Africa, where latitude compensates for altitude, Kniphofia may have maintained a distribution that extended into the lowlands even during interglacials. A cyclic climate change hypothesis implies that populations of Kniphofia (at different phases of the <b>climatic</b> <b>cycle)</b> would have experienced periods of contractions and fragmentation followed by periods of range expansion and coalescence or secondary contact. Altitudinal shifting is proposed to be the most likely mechanism for fragmentation and range expansion, and would would possibly promoted hybridisation. Within the five lineages there is evidence for recent differentiation as the branch lengths are short, there are numerous nonmonophyletic species and numerous identical haplotypes (cpDNA and ITS) which collectively indicate a recent radiation in southern Africa. A recent radiation would also account for the taxonomic confusion and difficulty in differentiating morpho-species. These climatic events may also account for the substantial anatomical variation in southern African Kniphofia species...|$|R

How ferns occurring in QTP and HHM changed their distribution ranges in response to <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> oscillations remains almost unknown. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We employed sequences of two chloroplast DNA regions, rps 4 -trnS and trnL-trnF, to reconstruct phylogeography of the Sino-Himalayan fern Lepisorus clathratus, occurring mainly in the QTP and HHM. Individuals of this species have either dehiscent or indehiscent sporangia with the latter evolved from the plesiomorphic dehiscent forms. Based on a range-wide sampling, we detected 27 cpDNA haplotypes that were divided into five groups by network analyses. Populations in the Hengduan Mountains possess the highest genetic diversity, while a single haplogroup is detected across the north-central region. A distinct phylogeographical subdivision was detected between the Hengduan Mountains and north-central region by AMOVA analysis. The haplogroup distribution pattern, coalescence and AMOVA analysis suggest that a long term survival area (refugia) of the species was located in the Hengduan Mountains during glaciations, with probable range expansions into north-central regions during interglacial periods. Populations with indehiscent sporangium can carry private haplotypes and are inclined to maintain genetic homogeneity. One group with indehiscent sporangia most likely survived in situ on the QTP during glaciations.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> {{oscillations}} had dramatic {{effects on}} species evolution. In northern latitudes, populations had {{to survive the}} coldest periods in refugial areas and recurrently colonized northern regions during interglacials. Such a history usually results {{in a loss of}} genetic diversity. Populations that did not experience glaciations, in contrast, probably maintained most of their ancestral genetic diversity. These characteristics dramatically affected the present-day distribution of genetic diversity and may influence the ability of species to cope with the current global changes. We conducted a range-wide study of mitochondrial genetic diversity in the pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa / T. wilkinsoni complex, Notodontidae), a forest pest occurring around the Mediterranean Basin and in southern Europe. This species is responding to the current climate change by rapid natural range expansion and can also be accidentally transported by humans. Our aim was to assess if <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> oscillations had a different effect across the species' range and to determine if genetic footprints of contemporary processes can be identified in areas of recent introduction. Results We identified three main clades that were spatially structured. In most of Europe, the genetic diversity pattern was typical for species that experienced marked glaciation cycles. Except in refugia, European populations were characterized by the occurrence of one main haplotype and by a strong reduction in genetic diversity, which is expected in regions that were rapidly re-colonized when climatic conditions improved. In contrast, all other sub-clades around the Mediterranean Basin occurred in limited parts of the range and were strongly structured in space, as is expected in regions in which the impact of glaciations was limited. In such places, genetic diversity was retained in most populations, and almost all haplotypes were endemic. This pattern was extreme on remote Mediterranean islands (Crete, Cyprus, Corsica) where highly differentiated, endemic haplotypes were found. Recent introductions were typified by the existence of closely-related haplotypes in geographically distant populations, which is difficult to detect in most of Europe {{because of a lack of}} overall genetic structure. Conclusion In regions that were not prone to marked glaciations, recent moth introductions/expansions could be detected due to the existence of a strong spatial genetic structure. In contrast, in regions that experienced the most intense <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> oscillations, the natural populations are not genetically structured, and contemporary patterns of population expansion remain undetected. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} and current {{distribution of the}} Sino-Tibetan flora have been greatly affected by historical geological events, such as the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), and <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> oscillations. Rhodiola kirilowii, a perennial herb with its distribution ranging from the southeastern QTP and the Hengduan Mountains (HM) to adjacent northern China and central Asia, provides an excellent model to examine and disentangle the effect of both geological orogeny and climatic oscillation on the evolutionary history of species with such distribution patterns. We here conducted a phylogeographic study using sequences of two chloroplast fragments (trnL-F and trnS-G) and internal transcribed spacers in 29 populations of R. kirilowii. A total of 25 plastid haplotypes and 12 ITS ribotypes were found. Molecular clock estimation revealed deep divergence between the central Asian populations and other populations from the HM and northern China; this split occurred ca. 2. 84 million year ago. The majority of populations from the mountains of northern China were dominated by a single haplotype or ribotype, while populations of the HM harbored both high genetic diversity and high haplotype diversity. This distribution pattern indicates that HM was either a diversification center or a refugium for R. kirilowii during the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climatic</b> oscillations.
