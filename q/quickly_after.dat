5|$|Queen's grew <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the war, {{propelled}} by the expanding postwar {{economy and the}} demographic boom that peaked in the 1960s. From 1951 to 1961, enrolment increased from just over 2,000 students to more than 3,000. The university embarked on a building program, constructing five student residences in less than ten years.|$|E
5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> a front's passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, {{although there is}} invariably a wind shift.|$|E

5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and the discomfort of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the Leviathan {{joined the}} {{similarly}} named Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada. It {{was the first}} new ride in Medieval Faire {{in more than a}} decade. Leviathan is ranked as the seventh tallest, and the eighth fastest roller coaster in the world. It is Canada's Wonderland's 16th roller coaster. The addition came <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the launch of the 230-foot-tall Behemoth roller coaster in 2008, and the 301-foot-tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season.|$|E

5|$|Nora took {{an unusual}} path, making {{landfall}} twice as a hurricane in Baja California. Weakening <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> landfall, its remnants lashed the Southwestern United States with tropical-storm-force winds, torrential rain and flooding. The storm was blamed for two direct casualties in Mexico, {{as well as}} substantial beach erosion on the Mexican coast, flash flooding in Baja California, and record precipitation in Arizona. It persisted far inland and eventually dissipated near the Arizona–Nevada border.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Nova Scotia pledged $10million (2003 CAD) {{in relief}} money after the {{hurricane}} hit, and private contributions were also made <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the storm hit. Prince Edward Island also pledged $200,000 (2003 CAD) immediately {{after the hurricane}} hit, {{and the federal government}} also announced their own package. The Mayor of Toronto at the time, Mel Lastman, also contributed $50,000 (2003 CAD) to replace damaged trees in Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|The Greencards {{gained more}} fans and became known by name <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> {{the release of}} Movin' On. The band was {{credited}} with performing the most energetic sets {{during the course of}} the 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to bring a global sound to bluegrass, and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles—were pushing the genre's boundaries. Their live show during this period was ranked by the Houston Chronicle in the top five nights of live music for the year in 2004.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the Wagga Wagga region were the Wiradjuri people. In 1829, Charles Sturt became the first European explorer to visit the future site of the city. Squatters arrived soon after. The town, positioned {{on the site of}} a ford across the Murrumbidgee, was surveyed and gazetted as a village in 1849 and the town grew <b>quickly</b> <b>after.</b> In 1870, the town was gazetted as a municipality.|$|E
5|$|Bureaucratic affairs were {{completed}} during Diocletian's stay: a census took place, and Alexandria, in punishment for its rebellion, {{lost the ability}} to mint independently. Diocletian's reforms in the region, combined with those of Septimius Severus, brought Egyptian administrative practices much closer to Roman standards. Diocletian travelled south along the Nile the following summer, where he visited Oxyrhynchus and Elephantine. In Nubia, he made peace with the Nobatae and Blemmyes tribes. Under the terms of the peace treaty Rome's borders moved north to Philae and the two tribes received an annual gold stipend. Diocletian left Africa <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the treaty, moving from Upper Egypt in September 298 to Syria in February 299. He met with Galerius in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{investigations}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) were launched, {{and they}} interviewed witnesses, checked documentation, and conducted on-scene {{examination of the}} plant. OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours. Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started. In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too <b>quickly.</b> <b>After</b> the first draft was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Lakers, the 1970s were {{characterized}} by a major breakthrough of the league's western franchises. In 1975, after compiling a 48–34 regular-season record, the Golden State Warriors swept the heavily favored Washington Bullets 4–0 in the 1975 NBA Finals. In 1976, the Phoenix Suns, who only enjoyed eight years of existence as a franchise, overcame a losing record early in the season to build a remarkable win streak to finish 42–40. The events culminated in upset victories over the Seattle SuperSonics and the Warriors, before facing Boston in the Finals. The teams split the first four games, before Game 5 went into three overtimes before Boston won 128–126. The Celtics managed to secure their 13th championship <b>quickly</b> <b>after,</b> defeating the Suns 87–80 in Game 6.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to his}} August 1990 Invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein {{was pushing}} OPEC to end {{overproduction}} and to send oil prices higher, {{in order to help}} OPEC members financially and to accelerate rebuilding from the 1980–1988 Iran–Iraq War. But these two Iraqi wars against fellow OPEC founders marked a low point in the cohesion of the organization, and oil prices subsided <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the short-term supply disruptions. The September 2001 Al Qaeda attacks on the US and the March 2003 US invasion of Iraq had even milder short-term impacts on oil prices, as Saudi Arabia and other exporters again cooperated to keep the world adequately supplied.|$|E

5|$|Life on Earth {{seemed to}} recover <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the Permian extinctions, {{though this was}} mostly {{in the form of}} {{disaster}} taxa such as the hardy Lystrosaurus. Specialized animals that formed complex ecosystems with high biodiversity, complex food webs, and a variety of niches, took much longer to recover. Current research indicates that this long recovery was due to successive waves of extinction, which inhibited recovery, and to prolonged environmental stress to organisms that continued into the Early Triassic. Recent research indicates that recovery did not begin until the start of the mid-Triassic, 4M to 6M years after the extinction; and some writers estimate that the recovery was not complete until 30M years after the P-Tr extinction, i.e. in the late Triassic.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, an NVA {{regiment}} attacked an Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) battalion at Song Be, {{capital of}} Phuoc Long Province. The North Vietnamese fought for several days, took casualties, and fell back. Two days later, the 273rd NLF Regiment attacked a Special Forces camp {{near the border}} town of Loc Ninh, in Binh Long Province. Troops of the US 1st Infantry Division were able to respond <b>quickly.</b> <b>After</b> a ten-day battle, the attackers were pushed back into Cambodia. At least 852 North Vietnamese soldiers were killed during the action, as opposed to 50 American and South Vietnamese dead.|$|E
5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed <b>quickly</b> <b>after</b> the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew dramatically over {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E
