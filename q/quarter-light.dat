50|$|In 1974, the B20E/F engine {{switched}} {{from using the}} Bosch D-Jetronic to the K-Jetronic mechanical fuel injection system. Also, several safety changes were introduced including a fuel tank that was located close to the transaxle to protect it {{in the case of}} a rear-end collision, and larger bumpers that protruded more from the body. The <b>quarter-light</b> windows in the front doors were removed as a result of the improvements in ventilation inside the car, and small anodised aluminium strips were added to the bottom of the side windows.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "super" [...] version (branded [...] "de luxe" [...] in some export markets) {{with opening}} rear <b>quarter-light</b> windows and extra trim was also offered. [...] The de luxe and super {{versions}} of the R4L received {{a version of the}} engine from the Renault Dauphine giving them a four-cylinder engine capacity of 845 cc. After the withdrawal of the 603 cc engined R3, the 747 cc R4 model continued to be listed with an entry level recommended retail price, but the slightly larger-engined L versions were more popular. By 1965, Renault had removed the extra [...] "R" [...] from their model names: the Renault R4L had become the Renault 4L.|$|E
5000|$|For the October 1962 Motor Show {{there were}} minor improvements. The rear window {{was changed to}} give the roof line an {{improved}} appearance and now more nearly match the original 1955 Chevrolet shape. Engine output was now rated at [...] bhp and the rear axle {{had been given a}} higher gear ratio. Manual gearbox cars received a new type of diaphragm clutch made by Borg and Beck and the petrol tank was enlarged from 12.5 to 16 gallons capacity. It can be distinguished by its revised rear-window treatment (doesn't wrap around quite as much as earlier models), Snipe bird badge on grille, opening <b>quarter-light</b> windows in the rear doors, and other trim differences.|$|E

25|$|An all-new hardtop {{was also}} available, with rear <b>quarter-lights</b> and a flatter rear screen.|$|R
50|$|Produced from 1956, second {{series with}} many small {{alterations}} to the Aurelia Spider. One part chrome bumpers and wider bonnet air-scoop. Cars from this series {{no longer have}} panoramic windscreen and now have fixed <b>quarter-lights.</b> 521 cars were built. All had 2,451cc engines. Dashboard features 2 big dials.|$|R
50|$|The curved and raked {{windscreen}} and the {{electrically powered}} semi-elliptical rear <b>quarter-lights</b> {{were made from}} Triplex laminated heat-reflecting safety glass, and the electrically powered side windows were double glazed. The roof was thermally insulated and had a transparent sun panel fixed toward the front, with a blind underneath the panel to block the light when desired.|$|R
50|$|Particular care {{had been}} taken to ensure draught-free {{ventilation}} by scuttle ventilators and hinged rear <b>quarter-lights.</b> The windscreen was hinged at the top for clearer sheltered wet-weather unmisted vision after dark. The front windows were fitted with louvres and, when open, the windows provided an extractor effect at their rear edge. The steering was by Bishop cam. The rigid axle suspension for both front and rear was controlled by long semi-elliptic springs aided by Armstrong hydraulic dampers.|$|R
50|$|The wide (53 inches) rear seating {{was given}} extra knee-room by {{recesses}} in {{the backs of}} the front seats. Luxury rear standard fittings included folding tables. Draught free ventilation came from swivelling <b>quarter-lights.</b> There were independent bucket seats in front with a settee type available if requested. Both seating and pedals were adjustable. The driver's steering column was telescopic. A flush-fitting sliding roof was provided. The Lucas mellotone wind-horns adjusted for town or country. The luxurious upholstery was unpleated.|$|R
5000|$|After a second, more {{thorough}} restyling in December 1986, it received the SEAT Marbella nameplate (codenamed 28 for SEAT Marbella and 028A for SEAT Marbella box) and {{was produced by}} SEAT until 1998 in the company's Zona Franca plant in Spain. The end of Marbella production in 1998 also meant the end of vehicle production in that factory. The SEAT model did not receive the mechanical and cosmetic tweaks (such as the loss of front window <b>quarter-lights)</b> applied to Fiat Pandas [...] "Mark II"s from 1986 but was instead subjected to those from SEAT.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{supplied}} with an {{adjustable steering column}} and body insulation. It comfortably carried four passengers with room for a small fifth passenger in {{the centre of the}} back seat. Even the <b>quarter-lights</b> were {{supplied with}} blinds, there were flush fitting footrests {{in the back of the}} large, adjustable, front seats with pull straps above. The back floor was flat except for the somewhat pronounced propellor shaft tunnel. The boot was provided with a fitted suitcase, the spare wheel sitting horizontally in the space below. The door could be let down and used as a luggage platform.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{importer}} and CKD assembler Todd Motors {{also created}} {{its own unique}} versions of the Arrow line. The single 1967 launch version (1725 cc aluminium head engine with four-speed manual transmission or three-speed Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission with twin front seats) was almost identical to its UK counterpart but Todd started to use its own upholstery designs from the 1969 rectangular headlight update. For 1970, it added a silver rear trim panel and a 'by Chrysler' boot lid badge to the Hunter saloon and introduced the estate although this had a lower specification than the saloon - an iron head 1725 cc engine, no automatic option, simpler dashboard trim (no locking glovebox), interior door pull handles instead of armrests (sedans had them on the three passenger doors), painted rather than bright metal door window frame trim and fixed rather than opening front <b>quarter-lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|The new Hawk {{announced}} in May 1957 had {{a completely new}} body with unitary construction which it {{would go on to}} share with the 1958 Humber Super Snipe. The Estate Car was the biggest bodyshell for a saloon based estate car built in Great Britain at the time. The 2267 cc engine was carried over, though with modifications to the distributor mounting, and other details; and an automatic transmission, the Borg Warner D.G. model, was now available. The body was styled in Rootes' own studios and featured more glass than previous models, with wrap-around front windscreen, which gave it a considerable resemblance to a base model 1955 Chevrolet 4-door sedan. The missing rear <b>quarter-lights</b> were returned in Series IV. The estate version featured a horizontally split tailgate—the lower half opening downwards (to provide an extra length of luggage-platform if necessary) and the upper half upwards. The fuel-filler cap was concealed behind the offside rear reflector.|$|R
50|$|Said The Times {{motoring}} correspondent—The four/five seater standard saloon {{has three}} armrests {{in the back}} seat and the front adjustable bucket seats have recesses in their backs for additional toe room for rear passengers. The four doors open wide down to the running boards and the glasses in them can be wound down fully in front (the drivers has a quick-action handle) and three-quarters of the way in the rear doors. The rear-most <b>quarter-lights</b> are fixed. A cupboard with a door is provided either side of the grouped instruments and there is a flap pocket in each rear door. Traps are fitted in the back floorboard for access to the tools, the battery and the oil tank of the hydraulic braking system. The spare wheel and tyre are in the well on the off-side front wing. The windscreen opens fully and the wipers are electrically operated. Safety glass is provided throughout. The coachwork sits low being built outside and below the top of the frame and attached by metal holders with rubber.|$|R
