40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study on the}} incidences of adverse drug events {{and analysis of the}} contributing trigger factors Objectives: To retrospectively determine the extent and types of adverse drug events (ADEs) from the patient cases sheets and identify the contributing factors of medication errors. To assess causality and severity using the World Health Organization (WHO) probability scale and Hartwig’s scale, respectively. Methods: Hundred patient case sheets were randomly selected, modified version of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Global Trigger Tool was utilized to identify the ADEs; causality and severity were calculated utilizing the WHO probability scale and Hartwig’s severity assessment scale, respectively. Results: In total, 153 adverse events (AEs) were identified using the IHI Global Trigger Tool. Majority of the AEs are due to medication errors (46. 41 %) followed by 60 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 15 therapeutic failure incidents, and 7 over-dose cases. Out of the 153 AEs, 60 are due to ADRs such as rashes, nausea, and vomiting. Therapeutic failure contributes 9. 80 % of the AEs, while overdose contributes to 4. 58 % of the total 153 AEs. Using the trigger tools, we were able to detect 45 positive triggers in 36 patient records. Among it, 19 AEs were identified in 15 patient records. The percentage of AE/ 100 patients is 17 %. The average ADEs/ 1000 doses is 2. 03 % (calculated).

40|$|The Anomura McLeay, 1838 are a {{group of}} decapods which on first {{appearance}} seem to have little in common; some look like crabs, others are hermit crabs, others resemble small lobsters, and others not easily placed in one or other of these well-known crustacean types. The only easy character uniting them is the small fifth thoracic leg. To further complicate the issue, animals of {{any one of these}} forms cannot easily be placed in one or other of the three superfamilies into which the infraorder is classified. Crab-like forms occur in the Paguroidea, Galatheoidea and Hippoidea. None of the anomuran lobster-like crustaceans have strong abdomens like lobsters but some galatheoids are often called squal lobsters. And shell-carrying hermit crabs, easily recognisable as such, belong in four families. Two boxes are useful for the anomuran groups.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} track changes in {{vigilance}} resulting from performing under conditions with varied levels of monotony and task demand. Accordingly task monotony and task demand were manipulated experimentally in a dual vigilance task. The central task required <b>quick</b> <b>key</b> presses to visually presented digits and the withholding {{of responses to}} an unpredictably occurring target digit. Non-monotonous and monotonous contexts were characterized by a high (p = 0. 50) and a low target probability (p = 0. 11) respectively. A second, peripheral task was introduced simultaneously, consisting of a moving circle that changed color unpredictably (p = 0. 11). In addition to performing the central task, {{participants were asked to}} either ignore the circle's color change or to signal it by pressing a key. Response times and errors were recorded. As predicted, while performance in monotonous contexts was significantly faster overall, the requirement to respond also to a peripheral task significantly delayed responses. Dual task performance increased error rates overall (especially incorrectly withheld responses) but markedly so only in the monotonous context. Importantly, these performance decrements in monotonous contexts were observed on tasks that took less than 5 minutes to complete. It is concluded that changes in vigilance and consequent reduced performance can be traced as a function of context and task demands, independently of time on task. The implications of the dual vigilance task as a diagnostic tool are discussed...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{perturbation}} {{finite volume}} (PFV) method for the convective-diffusion integral equa-tion is developed in this paper. The PFV scheme is an upwind and mixed scheme using any higher-order interpolation and second-order integration approximations, {{with the least}} modes imilar to the standard three-point schemes, that is, {{the number of the}} nodes needed is equal to unity plus the face-number of the control volume. For instance, in the two-dimensional (2 -D) case, only four nodes for the triangle grids and five nodes for the Cartesian grids are utilized, respectively. The PFV scheme is applied on a number of 1 -D linear and nonlinear problems, 2 -D and 3 -D flow model equations. Comparing with other standard three-point schemes, the PFV scheme has much smaller numerical diffusion than the first-order upwind scheme (UDS). Its numerical accuracies are also higher than the second-order central scheme (CDS), the power-law scheme (PLS) and <b>QUICK</b> scheme. <b>KEY</b> WORDS: perturbation finite vohme, convective-diffusion integral equation, numerical accuracy...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The dynamic {{behavior}} of the commercially used electrorheological fluid RheOil 3. 0 is measured under well-defined conditions. Measurements were carried out in shear mode {{as well as in}} flow mode using flow channels that provide similar flow conditions to many electrorheological applications. The response times of the change in flow behavior upon a changed electric field are measured. Measurements were carried out in time domain (single step response) as well as in frequency domain (sinusoidal frequency sweep). In most flow conditions, the observed dynamic behavior is characterized by two leading response times of which the fast one is in the millisecond range.

It is considered less effective and efficient in terms of military service because of spending lots of time to chase the target. So needed a tool to move the weapon automatically. This final project present about object tracking in a weapon and it’s turret, that will be controlled by camera. The camera is used to detect moving targets based on a particular color. In a image sequence consisting of many different objects, accompanied by a different background, this system {{will be able to}} distinguish between the target or not. Camera detection is done by taking moving images with color composition that has been determined. Then, The image resolution is resized of the smallest of camera’s resolutions, that is 320 x 240. Smaller image size are intended for the system’s working to be faster. Capturing image process is use segmentation object process in digital image processing which aims to separate the object region with background. The weapon that will be used, have two degrees of freedom. Maximum 360 degrees rotation in x axis, and maximum 90 degrees in y axis. Both of them using brushed DC motor. At the direction of the y- axis motion required a gear for transmitting power between motor shaft and the shaft, so the shaft is not directly connected to the motor and no distortion.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the risk of cultivation of cucumber pick-ling cultivars in Poland caused by unfavourable thermal conditions of soil. To achieve {{the goal of the}} work used starting data collected from 28 experimental stations of the Re-search Centre for Cultivar Testing (COBORU) and 47 meteorological stations of the Insti-tute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW) in 1966 – 2005 were used. Curvilin-ear regression analysis was used to determine the relation between the total and market-able yield of cucumber and soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm in the period of sowing-the end of harvesting. Potential, at least of 5 %, reduction in the total yield of cucumber occurred when average soil temperature at the depth of 5 cm in the period from sowing to the end of harvesting amounted to 17. 9 °C and of the marketable yield 17. 3 °C. The highest reduction in yield, occurring in south-west and south-east part of Poland. The re-duction was from 15 up to over 18 % {{in the case of the}} total yield and from 12 up to 15 % in the case of the marketable yield. On average, it occurred respectively every 1. 5 – 2 years and 2. 5 – 3 years. Taking into account the data from the whole country area in 1966 – 2005, a considerable increase appeored by 0. 2 °C/ 10 years in soil temperature in the period from sowing to the end of harvesting.

The methodology improves the efficiency of optical flow based tracking by utilizing motion characteristics of individual feature points across frames of an image sequence.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EVs) hold many promises including {{diversification of}} the transportation energy feedstock and reduction of greenhouse gas and other emissions. However, achieving large-scale adoption of EVs presents a number of challenges resulting from a current lack of supporting infrastructure and difficulties in overcoming technological barriers. This dissertation addresses some of these challenges by contributing {{to the advancement of}} theories in the areas of network optimization and mechanism design. To increase the electric driving range of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), we propose a powertrain energy management control system that exploits energy efficiency dif- ferences of the electric machine and the internal combustion engine during route planning. We introduce the Energy-Efficient Routing problem (EERP) for PHEVs, and formulate this problem as a new class of the shortest path problem. We prove that the EERP is NP-complete. We then propose two exact algorithms that find optimal solutions by exploiting the transitive structure inherent in the network. To tackle the intractability of the problem, we proposed a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS). From a theoretic perspective, the proposed two-phase approaches improve the state-of-the-art to optimally solving shortest path problems on general constrained multi-graph networks. These novel approaches are scalable and offer broad potential in many network optimization problems. In the context of vehicle routing, this is the first study to take into account energy efficiency difference of different operating modes of PHEVs during route planning, which is a high level powertrain energy management procedure. Another challenge for EV adoption is the inefficiency of current charging systems. In addition, high electricity consumption rates of EVs during charging make the load manage- ment of micro grids a challenge. We proposed an offline optimal mechanism for scheduling and pricing of electric vehicle charging considering incentives of both EV owners and utility companies. In the offline setting, information about future supply and demand is known to the scheduler. By considering uncertainty about future demand, we then designed a family of online mechanisms for real-time scheduling of EV charging. A fundamental problem with significant economic implications is how to price the charging units at different times under dynamic demand. We propose novel bidding based mechanisms for online scheduling and pricing of electric vehicle charging. The proposed preemption-aware charging mechanisms consider incentives of both EV drivers and grid operators. We also prove incentive-compatibility of the mechanisms, that is, truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for self-interested EV drivers. The proposed mechanisms demonstrate the benefits of electric grid load management, revenue maximization, and <b>quick</b> response, <b>key</b> attributes when providing online charging services...|$|R

In [7], a real-time message content validation (RMCV) scheme is proposed, which is based on the information-oriented trust model. It empowered each individual vehicle with the capability of evaluating the trustworthiness of the possibly large amount of messages received in VANETs, without relying on any infrastructure support such as roadside units or central servers. Huang et al. [27] stated that almost all the existing reputation systems compute trust value based on the past interaction with target nodes. They argue that due to the dynamic and open environment, this assumption is not valid in VANETs. In fact, if a vehicle is communicating with another vehicle, it is not guaranteed whether it will interact with the same vehicle in the future. Therefore, the existing algorithms which are based on the long-term relationship are not suitable for VANETs. To solve this problem, they proposed a social network approach for trust management in VANETs.|$|R
