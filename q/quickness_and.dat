5|$|Aspects of Raonic's game {{which have}} been criticized include his return of serve, <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> mobility, backhand, short game, {{and the use of}} {{backspin}} or sidespin. His above-average height—196cm (6ft 5in)—is linked to his strong serve, but is said to limit his movement around the court.|$|E

5|$|Olajuwon {{was highly}} skilled as both an {{offensive}} and defensive player. On defense, his rare combination of <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> strength allowed him to guard {{a wide range of}} players effectively. He was noted for both his outstanding shot-blocking ability and his unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball. Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season. He averaged 3.09 blocks and 1.75 steals per game for his career. He is the only center to rank among the top ten all time in steals. Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game. He led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection.|$|E

25|$|Particularly in {{the early}} parts of his career, Donovan played as a {{withdrawn}} striker and was most noted for his <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> goalscoring ability. As his professional career progressed, Donovan was increasingly utilized by managers as a wide attacking midfielder, where he could additionally benefit the team with his passing vision and defensive work rate. Donovan also possessed capable delivery on set pieces (as well as occasionally scoring from direct kicks) and served as first-choice penalty taker for club and country {{for much of his}} career.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} {{years in the}} league, he had a few, but {{effective}} and powerful moves underneath the basket which already made him an effective post player. During the off-season prior to the 2005–06 season, he trimmed his weight to increase his <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> added more finesse moves underneath the basket {{so that he could}} score without having to utilize power all the time. But most importantly, he worked on his shooting range and developed a dependable 18ft. jumper. As a result, he raised his scoring by 4.7 points in that season.|$|E

Houston had been a standout basketball player in Illinois, but Paul Brown, the head football coach at Massillon Washington High School, thought his combination of <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> size would make him a good football player. He started as a middle guard on defense but was soon switched to an offensive guard, where he excelled. The Associated Press named him a first-team All-Ohio guard in 1938.|$|E

25|$|The opening {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Montel Vontavious Porter for MVP's WWE United States Championship. Mysterio used his <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> aerial {{techniques}} {{to be on}} the top. Mysterio wrestled a good match by sending MVP who crashed on the arena floor and then he executed a hurricanrana on MVP. Mysterio got into the ring to break the referee's 10 count and MVP also got up at 8 count but he simply walked out instead of coming back into the ring after he climbed on the ring apron. MVP was counted out and thus he retained the title because a title does not change hands by countout. After the match, Mysterio threw MVP back into the ring and executed the 619 on MVP.|$|E
25|$|He had {{excellent}} parts, {{which had}} been improved by parliamentary and diplomatic experience; but the infirmities of his temper detracted much from the effective strength of his abilities. Negotiator and courtier as he was, he never learnt the art of governing or of concealing his emotions. When prosperous, he was insolent and boastful; when he sustained a check, his undisguised mortification doubled the triumph of his enemies: very slight provocations sufficed to kindle his anger; {{and when he was}} angry he said bitter things which he forgot {{as soon as he was}} pacified, but which others remembered many years. His <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> penetration would have made him a consummate man of business but for his selfsufficiency and impatience. His writings prove that he had many of the qualities of an orator: but his irritability prevented him from doing himself justice in debate: for nothing was easier than to goad him into a passion; and, from the moment when he went into a passion, he was at the mercy of opponents far inferior to him in capacity. Unlike most of the leading politicians of that generation, he was a consistent, dogged, and rancorous party man, a Cavalier of the old school, a zealous champion of the Crown and of the Church, and a hater of Republicans and Nonconformists. He had consequently a great body of personal adherents. The clergy especially looked on him as their own man, and extended to his foibles an indulgence of which, to say the truth, he stood in some need, for he drank deep, and when was in a rage—and he very often was in a rage—he swore like a porter.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{centers of}} the late 1970s and early 1980s include Wes Unseld of the Baltimore/Washington Bullets, Artis Gilmore of the ABA Kentucky Colonels, Chicago Bulls and San Antonio Spurs; Moses Malone of the Houston Rockets and Philadelphia 76ers; Mark Eaton of the Utah Jazz and Robert Parish of the Boston Celtics, who was {{acquired}} from the Golden State Warriors in 1980 for the top overall pick in the NBA Draft. Unseld led the Bullets to four NBA finals appearances and one championship, in 1978. Using his strength and determination to compensate for his lack of size (6'7", i.e. 2.00 m), he was famous for his rebounding, shotblocking, and bone-jarring picks. Artis Gilmore, often overlooked because of the mediocrity of his teams, established himself as the best low-post scorer in the league. He set the NCAA Division I record for career average in rebounds (25.2) at tiny Jacksonville University, and enjoyed an illustrious ABA career before joining the NBA's Chicago Bulls in 1976, playing there until he was traded to San Antonio in 1982, for whom he played {{until his retirement in}} 1987. He remains the NBA's career leader in field goal percentage (minimum 2000 shots made) with a 59.9 percentage. Malone, the first high school player to turn professional, was drafted by the Houston Rockets after several years in the ABA, and won two MVP Awards and led Houston to its first NBA Finals in 1981, before joining the Philadelphia 76ers, where, teamed with Julius Erving and Bobby Jones, he won an NBA Championship in 1983, as well as a third League MVP. Never a dominant defender, his <b>quickness</b> <b>and</b> tenacity {{made him one of the}} best rebounders in NBA history, particularly on the offensive end; he led the league in rebounds six times in a seven-year period and still holds the NBA record for offensive rebounds.|$|E
