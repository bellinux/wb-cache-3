50|$|The Fiat {{frame was}} {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} a new space-frame chassis built by Devin that weighed just 40 lb. This frame duplicated the locations of the original unit's suspension mounting points, allowing the original Fiat front and rear suspension to be reused. That suspension was a transverse leaf spring with A-arms and tube-shocks in front and semi-trailing arms with coil springs and tube-shocks in the rear. The stock drum brakes were replaced by 12 in disks made by Cagle. The engine was rotated 180 degrees from its rear-engine location in the original car to a mid-engine layout in the Roosevelt-Devin. The Fiat 600 transaxle also received a set of Harley Klentz <b>Quick</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Gears.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Ferrari FXX program {{continued}} until 2009. The car {{continued to be}} improved under the Evolution kit, which continually adjusts specifics to create more power and <b>quicker</b> <b>gear</b> <b>changes,</b> and to lower the car's aerodynamic drag. The V12 engine generates [...] at 9500 rpm. The car also accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.5 s. There were gearbox changes so that shift time should be reduced to 60 milliseconds per shift, a reduction of 20 milliseconds. The car also underwent aerodynamic changes and improvements to the traction control system. Statistically, this is Ferrari's fastest car ever released.|$|R

50|$|The feedscrew (H8) {{is a long}} {{driveshaft}} {{that allows}} a series of gears to drive the carriage mechanisms. These gears {{are located in the}} apron of the carriage. Both the feedscrew and leadscrew (H7) are driven by either the <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> (on the quadrant) or an intermediate gearbox known as a <b>quick</b> <b>change</b> gearbox (H6) or Norton gearbox. These intermediate gears allow the correct ratio and direction to be set for cutting threads or worm gears. Tumbler gears (operated by H5) are provided between the spindle and gear train along with a quadrant plate that enables a gear train of the correct ratio and direction to be introduced. This provides a constant relationship between the number of turns the spindle makes, to the number of turns the leadscrew makes. This ratio allows screwthreads to be cut on the workpiece without the aid of a die.|$|R
5000|$|BUR <b>Quick</b> <b>Change</b> Set - The “BUR Quick Change” was a barbell with slotted ends. <b>Quick</b> <b>Change</b> weights were U-shaped and slotted - not round - and had hooks {{attached}} to them. These hooks {{allowed for the}} quick and easy loading and unloading of weight plates. The BUR <b>Quick</b> <b>Change</b> was patented in 1930 [...] and first offered for sale in 1938 for $60 ($930 in 2010 dollars).|$|R
50|$|Sprint cars use <b>quick</b> <b>change</b> rear ends. This {{allows the}} teams to quickly <b>change</b> the <b>gear</b> ratio for {{different}} size tracks. Most cars use a torsion bar suspension system. Different size bars either soften or stiffen the suspension. Torsion bars, and specialty shock absorbers {{are the key}} ingredients in the handling of sprint cars. That coupled with the wings, tire stagger, light weight, and enormous horsepower make these cars {{one of the fastest}} race cars in the world using a horsepower-to-weight ratio. The monstrous power-to-weight ratios of Sprint Cars can exceed that of Formula 1 cars.|$|R

50|$|Hold-Up is a Franco-Canadian crime comedy from 1985, {{starring}} Jean-Paul Belmondo {{and directed}} by Alexandre Arcady.

50|$|High {{normal or}} top normal rear derailleurs return the chain to the {{smallest}} sprocket on the cassette when no cable tension is applied.

In road racing the swiftest <b>gear</b> <b>changes</b> are required on the sprints to the finish line, hence high-normal types, which allow a <b>quick</b> <b>change</b> to a higher gear, remain the preference.|$|R

40|$|The {{hobbing machine}} {{of recent years}} has {{positively}} introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) system, but many traditional hobbing machines with gear trains are still being used to produce gears. These traditional machines generally prepare many indexing <b>change</b> <b>gears</b> for gear cutting. But when we cut the gear of a prime number of teeth, the indexing <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> is not prepared for more than about 100 teeth of the gear. In such a case, we have to correct the indexing {{of the number of}} teeth using a differential gear to cut a helical gear, but when we apply the prime number of teeth on the helical gear, we cannot choose an arbitrary feed speed. Therefore, in this paper, we report on a new indexing mechanism for the prime number of gear teeth using a double differential gear device, which reduces the number of indexes the <b>change</b> <b>gear</b> must go through...|$|R

40|$|A Bayesian {{formulation}} of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection in multiple onoff processes is obtained within a decision-theoretic framework. For geometrically distributed busy and idle times, {{we show that}} the optimal joint design of channel switching and change detection has a simple threshold structure under a mild condition. Extensions to arbitrarily distributed busy and idle times, in particular, heavy tail distributions, are discussed. We show that this problem presents a fresh twist to the classic problem of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection that considers only one stochastic process. We demonstrate {{that the key to}} <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection in multiple processes is to abandon the current process when its state is unlikely to change in the near future (as indicated by the measurements obtained so far) and seek opportunities in a new process to avoid realizations of long busy periods. This problem arises in spectrum opportunity detection in cognitive radio networks where a secondary user searches for idle channels in the spectrum.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{classical}} problem of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection, a decision maker observes {{a sequence of}} random variables. At some point in time, {{the distribution of the}} random variables changes abruptly. The objective is to detect this change in distribution with minimum possible delay, subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. In many applications of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection, e. g., where the changes are infrequent, it is of interest to control the cost of observations or the cost of data acquired before the change point. To this end, in this survey paper, data-efficient versions of {{the classical}} <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problems are studied, and a summary of existing results on these problems is provided. Some extensions to distributed sensor networks are also discussed...|$|R
