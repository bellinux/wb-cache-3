40|$|<b>Risk</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes that every decision-maker has to perform before undertaking any project. It involves a deep understanding of all the factors that affect the output of the project. This is especially important in revenue-dependent infrastructure projects, where the life of the project depends almost exclusively on its revenue output. ^ The analysis of revenue-dependent infrastructure projects requires the involvement of a large set of qualitative and quantitative factors. The sponsors need to analyze the influence of both factors before making a decision to proceed with the project. Due to the limitations of the typical <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> process, the <b>qualitative</b> factors are analyzed separately from the quantitative factors. Usually the qualitative factors are the first to be analyzed, forcing the decision-maker to provide a subjective decision before the analysis of the quantitative factors is performed. This approach could constrain or even neglect potential opportunities. ^ This research provides a decision support system that combines the quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> factors for <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> of revenue-dependent infrastructure projects. The system considers the relationships among these factors and the influence that they can have on the development of an infrastructure project. It recommends a neuro-fuzzy technique that is able to model the relationships between the risk factors. This neuro-fuzzy model was designed using data from an actual infrastructure project. ^ The analysis of both types of factors in a single tool will contribute to a reduction of the subjectivity involved in the <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> process and will provide better analysis to the decision-maker. The main advantage is that the decision-maker will be able to include in the analysis factors that do not have a numerical nature. Moreover, if the system is properly fed with historical data, it will provide an estimate of the output based on both types of risk factors, quantitative and qualitative. ...|$|R

There are few studied risk factors associated with mortality. Objective: To determine independent risk factors associated with mor- tality in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and neutropenic enterocolitis. Methods: A nested case control study in a cohort of patients with neu- tropenic enterocolitis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of “Instituto Nacional de Pediatría” aged between one month and 17 years old. Cases were defined as subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and died from complications of neutropenic enterocolitis. Controls consisted in living patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit because of neutropenic enterocolitis and survived, two controls for sex and age were selected; 22 cases and 44 controls were obtained.

40|$|Every {{environment}} {{is susceptible to}} risks and Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802. 11 standard are no exception. The most apparent risk of WLANs is {{the ease with which}} itinerant intruders obtain illicit entry into these networks. These intrusion security risks must therefore be addressed which means that information security risk analysis and risk management need to be considered as integral elements of the organisation’s business plan. A well-established <b>qualitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> and risk management methodology, the Operationally Critical Threat Asset and Vulnerability Evaluation (OCTAVE) is selected for conducting the WLAN intrusion security risk analysis and risk management process. However, the OCTAVE risk analysis methodology is beset with a number of problems that could hamper a successful WLAN intrusion security risk analysis. The ultimate deliverable of this <b>qualitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> methodology is the creation of an organisation-wide protection strategy and risk mitigation plan. Achieving this end using the OCTAVE risk analysis methodology requires an inordinate amount of time, ranging from months to years. Since WLANs are persistently under attack, there is a dire need for an expeditious risk analysis methodology. Furthermore, the OCTAVE risk analysis methodology stipulates the identification of assets and corresponding threat scenarios via a brainstorming session, which may be beyond the scope of a person who is not proficient in information security issues. This research was therefore inspired by the pivotal need for a risk analysis and risk management methodology to address WLAN intrusion attacks and the resulting risks they pose to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information processed by these networks.

Therefore, urban agriculture is seen as an experimental model through which we can analyze the interaction between local institutions and citizens, as well as being a marketing tool to promote sustainability aspects linked to the territory. To this end, after a bibliographic review on the <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Analysis</b> and the involvement of stakeholders in decisions relating to the public sector, a valuation of certain projects on the theme of urban and peri-urban agriculture, advanced by the local public Administration will be shown.

40|$|The {{field of}} modern project {{management}} is not new, and {{what seems to}} have changed {{over the past decade}} is the evolution of techniques applying theory into practice. This had as a consequence for the need to standardise and structure different processes of project management, in a detailed, documented and formal manner. On the other hand, change management seen as an integrated process within project management is a rational process for exploring decision and behaviour alternatives in an attempt to realign the course of ‘derailed’ deliverables due to change and ensure project success. However, models contained in such frameworks often lack formal semantics and clarity; generally fail to address and assess organisational change management risk reasoning, in a rather detailed way as they do {{for the majority of the}} project management processes. Since, uncontrolled changes might have an effect on the projects’ success, it is vital to assess the probability of materialisation (risk) of success before the decision is made and whether to proceed with the change or not. For example, if the change dramatically increases the risk of failure then it is logical to assume that avoiding that implementation is the right decision. Ideally, a change or consequence based upon a decision should have a low impact and a fairly high level of predictability. This research, takes the challenge to propose a novel modelling approach, which will contribute significantly to the missing formality of business models especially in the change risks assessment area. The introduction of Change Risk Assessment Model (CRAM) allows the identification and definition of speculative relationships, between change risks in the form of hierarchical <b>risk</b> tree <b>analysis.</b> Overall, the method is dynamic and flexible enough that can be tailored to various project requirements, taking into account significant environmental risk factors which influence project deliverables. Project success is a key objective for today’s organisations; professionals can make use of a new methodology for risk assessment, compatible with project management frameworks which currently seems to be missing from literature. Project management methodologies are not a panacea against project failure; nevertheless, CRAM can be regarded as a comprehensive modelling approach which combines both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>risk</b> criteria <b>analysis</b> in decision making processes...|$|R
