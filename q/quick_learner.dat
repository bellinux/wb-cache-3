Mark King {{was primarily a}} drummer (although he also played guitar) but had recently sold his drum kit to pay for transport back to the UK after an ill-fated European venture. With Phil Gould and Boon Gould established (respectively) as the most accomplished drummer and guitarist in the quartet, King opted to learn bass guitar instead. At the time, King was working in a London music store. A notably flexible musician and <b>quick</b> <b>learner,</b> he had observed visiting American funk players demonstrating the thumb-slap bass guitar technique and developed his own take on the style {{in a matter of}} weeks.|$|E

Eckford proved to be a hard worker and <b>quick</b> <b>learner,</b> with a flair for shipbuilding and ship design. When Black moved to Kingston on Lake Ontario late in 1792, Eckford followed to continue his apprenticeship, but the two soon went their separate ways, with Black moving to Quebec City to pursue revolutionary politics while Eckford stayed behind in Kingston to continue to learn the shipbuilding trade. In 1794, Eckford joined a Freemason Lodge in Kingston, beginning a long association with Freemasonry.|$|E

Taylor {{grew up in}} a small woodland cabin before his family moved to a brick house with increased prosperity. The rapid growth of Louisville was a boon for Taylor's father, who came to own [...] throughout Kentucky by the start of the 19th century; he held 26 slaves to cultivate the most developed portion of his holdings. There were no formal schools on the Kentucky frontier, and Taylor had a sporadic formal education. A schoolmaster recalled Taylor as a <b>quick</b> <b>learner.</b> His early letters show a weak grasp of spelling and grammar, and his handwriting was later described as [...] "that of a near illiterate".|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} cognitive {{process is}} the ability to map objects into meaningful categories depending on the task at hand. Exactly how such mental constructs emerge and what kind of space best embeds this mapping remains incompletely understood. Here we develop tools to quantify the space and organization of such a mapping, thereby providing a framework for studying the geometric representations of neural responses as reflected in functional MRI. Considering how human subjects learn the values of novel objects, we show that <b>quick</b> <b>learners</b> have a higher dimensional geometric representation than slow learners, and hence more easily distinguishable whole-brain responses to objects of different value. Furthermore, we find that <b>quick</b> <b>learners</b> display a more compact embedding of the task-relevant information, where the ratio of task-relevant dimension to embedding dimension is consistent with a greater efficiency of cognitive coding. Lastly, we investigate the neurophysiological drivers of high dimensional patterns at both regional and voxel levels, and complete our study with a complementary test of the distinguishability of associated whole-brain responses. Our results demonstrate a spatial organization of neural responses characteristic of learning, and offer a suite of geometric measures applicable to the study of efficient coding in higher-order cognitive processes more broadly...|$|R

They are eager to please and very <b>quick</b> <b>learners,</b> which means they are also quick to learn things their humans did not intend to teach them. However, Keeshonden make excellent agility and obedience dogs. In fact, so amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that they have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.|$|R

Memer believes {{she is the only}} who knows how to get in, until she finds the Waylord there when she is nine years old. He offers to teach her to read, after swearing her to secrecy. Memer proves to be a <b>quick</b> <b>learner.</b> Four days after her seventeenth birthday, Memer makes the acquaintance of Orrec and Gry, the protagonists of Gifts. Orrec, famous as a poet and storyteller, has been invited to Ansul to perform: Memer invites him and Gry to stay at Galvamand. They tell the Waylord that though the Alds invited them to Ansul, they came to find Galvamand, for the ancient library rumored to have once existed there.

500|$|Jonas Quinn is {{introduced}} in the penultimate season 5 episode [...] "Meridian" [...] as a scientist of the human nation of Kelowna on Langara, a planet with an industrial level comparable to Earth of the 1940s, and that is also locked in a cold war with two rival states. He is an exceptionally <b>quick</b> <b>learner,</b> which becomes useful in memorizing SG mission reports and earth culture. [...] The Kelownans are experimenting with naqahdriah (an unstable but extremely powerful native element related to naqahdah) to build a bomb against their two rival nations, Terrania and the Andari Federation. Jonas is present when SG-1 team member Daniel Jackson gets radiation-poisoned with naqahdriah {{in an attempt to}} prevent a catastrophe in Kelowna, but when the Kelownan leaders respond with glee to Daniel's imminent death, Jonas steals a small amount of naqahdriah and offers it to Earth for more peaceful uses. Still wracked by guilt in the season6 premiere [...] "Redemption" [...] over his hesitation to step in, Jonas helps Major Samantha Carter find a solution to save Earth from an attack by the Goa'uld Anubis. Although Colonel Jack O'Neill is reluctant to add a new fourth member to SG-1, he allows Jonas to join the team, partly to prevent a Russian from being assigned.|$|E
500|$|Duncan {{initially}} had difficulties {{adapting to}} the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: [...] " [...] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time." [...] He overcame this to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play {{attracted the attention of}} several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation. However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a <b>quick</b> <b>learner.</b> Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.|$|E

They are highly intelligent, <b>quick</b> <b>learners</b> who do not enjoy repetition in training. A well-bred German Pinscher can be trusted with small animals and children, though no dog should ever be left unsupervised with either. If the puppy shies away when faced with strangers, it may be a sign of poor breeding.|$|R

Eventually, Jim Webster, airport manager, agreed—with parental permission—to give him flying lessons in {{exchange}} for work around the hangars. In his lessons he was a <b>quick</b> <b>learner,</b> and after logging more cockpit time he finally soloed. This, of course, was an era before the Federal Aviation Administration, with its requisite ground courses and instruction hours.

50|$|In 1967, {{while living}} in Paris, he made contact with former {{colleague}} Roger Faulques, who was organizing a mercenary unit for the newly independent Republic of Biafra. Steiner flew to Port Harcourt via Lisbon, Portugal and enlisted into the Biafran army as a company commander. Steiner had success in the field, and was given the responsibility of organizing the 4th Biafran Commando Brigade as a lieutenant colonel. The first three brigades actually didn't exist; the army created this bit of disinformation to confuse the Nigerian Federal forces. Steiner used a skull and crossbones as his regimental symbol, which he thought would constantly remind his troops of the risks inherent to war, rather than any reference to the pirates' Jolly Roger or the Nazi SS. Steiner found the Biafrans to be <b>quick</b> <b>learners</b> and highly motivated. On May 25, 1968, they led a successful mission against a Federal Nigerian air field in Enugu, destroying six Russian-made bomber and fighter aircraft. Steiner, {{far from being a}} mercenary, fought for the Biafrans without pay, serving long after most other European soldiers of fortune had left the cause.|$|R
5000|$|Although usually well-socialized {{with other}} greyhounds, ex-racers often have limited skills for living {{outside of the}} racing kennel. However, most Greyhounds are <b>quick</b> <b>learners.</b> They tend to be out-going, happy and sociable with people and seem to relish human contact, even {{following}} owners {{from room to room}} at home (known colloquially as being a [...] "Velcro dog"). Some Greyhounds are more timid and can for a time have difficulty coping with new people or situations. A period of rehabilitation and a dedicated owner usually helps nervous [...] "Retired Racers" [...] become more confident. A few people also report that they have known [...] "Greys" [...] who at first fear other dog breeds until sufficiently exposed. As the lure used to train greyhounds for racing resembles a hare, retired racers sometimes also mistake smaller dogs for a lure, causing them to set chase. Similarly, small animals including cats may also be the subject of prey-driven behavior by some greyhounds. Prior to adoption, agencies generally screen greyhounds for their suitability around small animals especially by way of [...] "cat testing" [...] in which a dog is carefully exposed to a cat to see his or her interest level.|$|R
2500|$|Ormandy was a <b>quick</b> <b>learner</b> of scores, often {{conducting}} {{from memory}} {{and without a}} baton. He demonstrated exceptional musical and personal integrity, exceptional leadership skills, and a formal and reserved podium manner {{in the style of}} his idol and friend, Arturo Toscanini. One orchestra musician complimented him by saying: [...] "He doesn't try to conduct every note as some conductors do." [...] Under Ormandy's direction the Philadelphia Orchestra continued the lush, legato style originated by Stokowski and for which the orchestra was well known. Ormandy's conducting style was praised for its opulent sound, but also was criticized for supposedly lacking any real individual touch. In the book Dinner with Lenny, containing one of the last interviews of Leonard Bernstein, Ormandy is criticized by Bernstein for applying the same lush sound to every piece that he conducted, even if the composer of the piece in question did not call for it, a criticism that Bernstein voiced indirectly in The Sound of an Orchestra, one of the Young People's Concerts.|$|E

30|$|A {{critical}} look at this positive {{description of}} an ambitious nation provides insights into potential challenges for schools serving diversity. For instance, {{there are those who}} for various reasons may not be <b>quick</b> <b>learners</b> in the examination-oriented curriculum, whilst others thrive in collaborative-working requiring some form of supervision. Such policy guideline may promote competitiveness rather than collaboration in schools with implications for marginal attention to those requiring diverse support. Indeed, school improvement agendas have been blamed for overemphasis on measurable test-scores with scant attention to subjects enhancing intergroup co-existence, e.g. peace education, human rights education or global citizenship (UNESCO 1996; Davies 2004). In Kenya, schools are expected to ensure that “recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all” (UNESS-Kenya 2010 : x). Along this thinking, ‘ability difference’ has become a big issue in pursuing inclusive practices, especially where learners are perceived as ‘less-able’ or those with talents outside the core subjects. Yet, after cessation of conflict, ‘over-age’ children may arrive in school without prior exposure to formal education (Sommers 2009) positioning them as ‘a problem’ in the highly structured and examination-oriented curriculum. As Davies (2005) argues, emphasis on credentials and competitiveness along global standards potentially creates a dichotomy of losers and winners, besides strained social relations as groups strive to outperform others along narrowed cognitive competences.|$|R
