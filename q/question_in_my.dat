500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E

Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we were singing from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5, finding it fell {{just short of}} being a classic; [...] "the biggest and most obvious problem with the game has to be its story.

Miller told a reporter for The New York Times that, [...] "This is not a whodunit. This lady has committed this offense or offenses in front of the world.

She is bisexual, and said she believes that [...] "all humans are born with the ability to be attracted to both sexes". [...] "I have no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind about being bisexual," [...] Fox stated.

2500|$|Engaging {{in civil}} disobedience {{that would result}} in many people being arrested was a primary objective, as it would focus {{attention}} on the target. On March 24, 1987, 17 people out of 250 participating were arrested for blocking rush-hour traffic in front of the FDA's Wall Street offices. Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe. Immunologist Anthony Fauci states [...] "ACT UP put medical treatment {{in the hands of the}} patients. And that is the way it ought to be... There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind that Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry. Playwright Tony Kushner offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: [...] "In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry's generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry." ...|$|E

[...] The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009. Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. Harbaugh never lost in USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E

Among the forms of script it assumes, Chinese characters, which are graphically iconic and not primarily a representation of phonetics, are a very special case.
