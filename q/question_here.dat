25|$|To {{prohibit}} {{the use of}} certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition. The only <b>question</b> <b>here</b> is whether in the particular instance the advantages gained are greater than the social costs they impose.|$|E
25|$|The <b>question</b> <b>here</b> {{is whether}} such an evidentiary seizure is {{likewise}} lawful {{with the permission}} of one occupant when the other, who later seeks to suppress the evidence, is present at the scene and expressly refuses to consent. We hold that, in the circumstances here at issue, a physically present co- occupant's stated refusal to permit entry prevails, rendering the warrantless search unreasonable and invalid as to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of gross income has been simplified, but no effect upon its present broad scope was intended. Certainly punitive damages cannot reasonably {{be classified as}} gifts, nor do they come under any other exemption provision in the Code. We would do violence to the plain meaning of the statute and restrict a clear legislative attempt to bring the taxing power to bear upon all receipts constitutionally taxable were we {{to say that the}} payments in <b>question</b> <b>here</b> are not gross income.|$|E

25|$|Heavy {{scrutiny}} {{of the criminal justice}} system occurs when a person on trial is a political opponent of the executive government. The pertinent <b>question</b> <b>here,</b> which is extremely difficult to answer, is whether the judge presiding over that particular case would have arrived at his decision in a different manner if the accused had not been a political opponent. However, the impartiality of the judiciary cannot necessarily be impugned on the ground that the courts have to enforce laws or rules of evidence and procedure that are felt to be unjust, because even the most independent judiciary must comply with laws enacted by the legislature.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, {{aided by}} junior counsel Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, Stevenson defended Ruth Ellis against {{the charge of}} murdering her lover. Stevenson's {{decision}} to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his [...] "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: [...] "Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no <b>question</b> <b>here</b> but this woman shot this man... You will not hear one word from me– or from the lady herself– questioning that." [...] The jury took 23minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion at the case {{is thought to have}} played a part in the abolition of capital punishment in the UK in 1969.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{ability to}} project his {{personality}} onto his characters {{played an important}} part in his appearing natural and authentic on screen. Actor John Barrymore said of Cooper, [...] "This fellow is the world's greatest actor. He does without effort what the rest of us spend our lives trying to learn—namely, to be natural." [...] Charles Laughton, who played opposite Cooper in Devil and the Deep agreed, [...] "In truth, that boy hasn't the least idea how well he acts ... He gets at it from the inside, from his own clear way of looking at life." [...] William Wyler, who directed Cooper in two films, called him a [...] "superb actor, a master of movie acting". In his review of Cooper's performance in The Real Glory, Graham Greene wrote, [...] "Sometimes his lean photogenic face seems to leave everything to the lens, but there is no <b>question</b> <b>here</b> of his not acting. Watch him inoculate the girl against cholera—the casual jab of the needle, and the dressing slapped on while he talks, as though a thousand arms had taught him where to stab and he doesn't have to think anymore." ...|$|E

30|$|Questions asking {{compositional}} {{relations of}} events, which were sometimes considered as behavior questions, were considered as structure <b>questions</b> <b>here.</b> For example, the question “What are the stages into which photosynthesis is divided?” {{was treated as}} a structure question.|$|R

2500|$|Fifty Jeopardy!-style {{clues in}} fifty {{different}} categories are {{displayed on the}} screen {{at the front of}} the room and read aloud in a recording by a Clue Crew member (previously, Johnny Gilbert, the show's announcer, did the voice-over on this). [...] A potential contestant has eight seconds to write down his or her response (no need to phrase in the form of a <b>question</b> <b>here)</b> before the next clue is read.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{immediately}} replied on his website, saying, [...] "Unfortunately, {{the witch}} hunt continues and tomorrow's article {{is nothing short}} of tabloid journalism. The paper even admits in its own article that the science in <b>question</b> <b>here</b> is faulty and that I have no way to defend myself. They state: 'There will therefore be no counter-exam nor regulatory prosecutions, in a strict sense, since defendant's rights cannot be respected.' I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Harvesting: {{here the}} mentor focuses on [...] "picking the ripe fruit": {{it is usually}} used to create {{awareness}} of what was learned by experience and to draw conclusions. The key <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> are: [...] "What have you learned?", [...] "How useful is it?".|$|R
2500|$|... "The <b>question</b> <b>here</b> {{is whether}} the use of open lights {{is or is not}} safe. The general or special rules cannot affect this question, though they may apply when it is determined. Further, the umpire has nor {{exceeded}} his powers by stating that the only alternative to open lamps, namely safety lamps, shall be adopted. At all events he has determined the question that the working of the mine with open lamps is dangerous, and his award ought not to be set aside, even if it goes in other respects beyond the scope of his authority. [...] I [...] can see no reason therefore, why the award should not go back to him so that it may be put into form. When that is done, it will be for the mine owner to remedy the defect, for if he does not he will be, if the next tribunal [...] is against him, be liable to the penalties under the Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in <b>question</b> <b>here,</b> only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Times, blamed Al Qaeda and Lashkar-e Jhangvi in an editorial, stating, [...] "International cricket is {{no longer}} {{possible}} in Pakistan; therefore we should stop accusing foreign teams of discriminating against Pakistan vis-à-vis India. The <b>question</b> <b>here</b> is of the survival of Pakistan, not of cricket." [...] The Daily Jang, responding on Chris Broad, Simon Taufel and Steve Davis's comments, said that their [...] "vivid description of the terrifying attack gives us an insight into how people everywhere will see the events of the morning of March 3." [...] It went on to say the [...] "men appeared genuinely shocked over the sight of Pakistani security men running for cover". The paper {{goes on to say that}} [...] "their candid comments will seal the fate of Pakistan cricket for some time to come". It also said that Pakistan [...] "must give up complaining" [...] and that [...] "ways to liven up the game at the domestic level need to be reconsidered with renewed urgency".|$|E

3000|$|The major <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> are: What kind {{of power}} system should the {{rethinking}} produce?

And who should do the rethinking? [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Without {{identifying}} a related judgment, Park, J. disagreed with Adams's contention [...] "that {{there is no}} such case on the books," [...] and refused to nonsuit the plaintiff, opining that [...] "the defendant is liable." [...] At the same time, he pointed out that the jury could consider Priestley's acquiescence in light of the wagon's condition, and granted Adams permission to move the full court in Westminster should the jury enter a verdict against his client. Next, instructing the jury, Park, J. stated that Fowler could not be held liable for a hidden defect in the wagon. Instead the only <b>question</b> <b>here</b> was,--and it was one of fact—was the van shamelessly overladen; was it laden unsafely and to a dangerous degree; and, if so, was the master acquainted with the fact? [...] [...] [...] if the jury were of opinion that the accident was occasioned by the 'pigheadedness' of the defendant in over-loading the van they would find for the plaintiff.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Breyer {{disputed the}} majority's {{assumption}} that {{the perception of the}} children was irrelevant. [...] Even in Lamb's Chapel, the Court had relied in part on the perception of the children in determining whether there had been an Establishment Clause violation. [...] "The critical Establishment Clause <b>question</b> <b>here</b> may well prove to be whether a child, participating in the Good News Club's activities, could reasonably perceive the endorsement of religion" [...] {{on the part of the}} school. [...] Breyer pointed out that the Court's decision merely overturned a grant of summary judgment in favor of Milford, and denying summary judgment to one party was not the same as granting it to the other party. [...] Denials of summary judgment simply mean that there are [...] "genuine issues of material fact" [...] that require a trial. [...] The extent of the coercion perceived by the children was, in Breyer's view, one such issue.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{separate}} questions to consider. First, is the divergence {{a real one}} such that the zero-point energy really is infinite? If we consider the volume [...] is contained by perfectly conducting walls, very high frequencies can only be contained by taking more and more perfect conduction. No actual method of containing the high frequencies is possible. Such modes will not be stationary in our box and thus not countable in the stationary energy content. So from this physical point of view the above sum should only extend to those frequencies which are countable; a cut-off energy is thus eminently reasonable. However, {{on the scale of}} a [...] "universe" [...] questions of general relativity must be included. Suppose even the boxes could be reproduced, fit together and closed nicely by curving spacetime. Then exact conditions for running waves may be possible. However the very high frequency quanta will still not be contained. As per John Wheeler's [...] "geons" [...] these will leak out of the system. So again a cut-off is permissible, almost necessary. The <b>question</b> <b>here</b> becomes one of consistency since the very high energy quanta will act as a mass source and start curving the geometry.|$|E
