5|$|Beef steak is graded for <b>quality,</b> {{with higher}} prices for higher <b>quality.</b> Generally, the higher the <b>quality,</b> the more tender the beef, the less time is needed for cooking, or the better the flavor. For example, beef fillet is the most tender and wagyu, such as Kobe beef from Japan, {{is known for its}} high <b>quality</b> and {{commands}} a high price. Steak can be cooked relatively quickly compared to other cuts of meat, particularly when cooked at very high temperatures, such as by broiling or grilling.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water <b>quality</b> {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical <b>quality</b> and moderate for ecological <b>quality.</b> The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical <b>quality,</b> poor for ecological <b>quality</b> and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical <b>quality</b> is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical <b>quality</b> and moderate for ecological <b>quality,</b> as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E

Lateral aircraft configurations whose flying <b>qualities</b> are degraded by roll ratcheting effects map into the Level 1 region of the criterion.

40|$|Locke {{proposes a}} theory of <b>qualities</b> based on a {{distinction}} between <b>qualities</b> that resemble the idea we have of them {{and those that do}} not.

I will finally suggest that, if Strawson’s response does indeed require something in Locke’s theory to be altered, that thing is the principle of economy of explanation...|$|R

Pragmatic <b>qualities</b> were found to be a hygiene factor removing barriers hindering the fulfilment of the users’ needs (Hassenzahl et al. 2010). Hence, a system’s n <b>qualities</b> enable need fulfilment, but are themselves not a source of a positive experience. Hedonic <b>qualities</b> are associated with a system’s ability to evoke pleasure and the psychological well-being of the user (Hassenzahl 2003). They are motivators and reflect the products capability to create a positive experience (Hassenzahl et al. 2010).|$|R
