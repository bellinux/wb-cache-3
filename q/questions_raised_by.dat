5|$|The {{moral and}} ethical <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> {{performing}} experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species.|$|E
5|$|The chief <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Kulakov {{were that}} the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of {{magnitude}} lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a nuclide alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
25|$|In bioethics, {{the ethics}} of cloning refers {{to a variety of}} ethical {{positions}} regarding the practice and possibilities of cloning, especially human cloning. While many of these views are religious in origin, the <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> cloning are faced by secular perspectives as well. Human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.|$|E

25|$|Just as biology has {{developed}} as an autonomous discipline in full {{conversation with the}} other sciences, {{there is a great}} deal of work now being carried on by biologists and philosophers to develop a dedicated philosophy of biological science which, while in full conversation with all other philosophic disciplines, attempts to give answers to the real <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> scientific investigations in biology.|$|E
25|$|Neuroethics is an {{international}} peer-reviewed journal dedicated to academic articles on the ethical, legal, political, social and philosophical issues provoked by research in the contemporary sciences of the mind, especially, but not only, neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology. The journal publishes high-quality reflections on <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the sciences of the mind, and on {{the ways in which}} the sciences of the mind illuminate longstanding debates in ethics.|$|E
25|$|The state's {{principal}} {{argument was}} that the plaintiffs raised no substantial federal question because Gobitis settled the constitutional <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the flag-salute expulsions. The state's brief quoted extensively from Justice Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion. Given the clear indications that at least five justices were ready to lay aside the Gobitis precedent, there was little else the state's lawyers could do. The American Legion's amicus curiae brief filed {{in support of the}} state's appeal did little more than duplicate the West Virginia argument.|$|E

25|$|After {{the scandal}} broke, some 30 former staffers of The Diamondback, {{who had worked}} with Blair when he was {{editor-in-chief}} at the university newspaper, signed a 2003 letter alleging that Blair had made four serious errors as a reporter and editor while at the University of Maryland. They said these and his work habits brought his integrity into question. The letter-signers alleged that <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> some of these staffers at the time were ignored by Maryland Media, Inc. (MMI), the board that owned the paper.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{took some}} of his {{inspiration}} from the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher on hermeneutics, which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to German Romanticism. Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, {{as the author of}} a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Droysen and Ranke about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (erklären) must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the humanities—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.|$|E
25|$|The {{excavations}} {{had produced}} {{vast amounts of}} artifacts and data, but as yet there was no final publication. In 1978, Malcolm Bell, III, professor of classical art and archaeology at the University of Virginia, took over the project {{with the goal of}} publishing the Morgantina material. Bell was a former Princeton graduate student (Sjöqvist had been Bell's advisor until his retirement) who had written his dissertation on terracotta figurines found at Morgantina. He has conducted investigations on Serra Orlando since 1982, each time with the intention of answering specific <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> earlier work. Bell used his dissertation {{as the basis for the}} first book in the Morgantina Studies series published in 1983. Six volumes have appeared in the series, which is the main vehicle for the definite publication of the excavation results.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Arthur Waskow {{said that}} far from {{enabling}} antisemitism, most of the authors the AJC attacked (Tony Kushner, Adrienne Rich, and Daniel Boyarin, among others) are in fact major contributors to the renewal and revitalization of Jewish culture, cutting across the conventional Jewish diaspora and religious-secular divides. He holds that Rosenfeld and the AJC see no value in such contributions because they see Jewish value only in supporting {{the policies of the}} State of Israel. He also argued that the AJC has done far more to undermine Israel and its Jewishness than the <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> these intellectuals, by the AJC's support for some specific policy decisions by the U.S. and Israeli governments: especially the Iraq War, which has increased dangers to Israel, and the settlement {{of hundreds of thousands of}} Israeli Jews into Palestinian areas.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> {{the large amount of}} funding he took from the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E

500|$|In The Rules of Sociological Method (1895), Durkheim {{expressed}} his will {{to establish a}} method that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the author concerns the objectivity of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, observation must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a [...] "perfectly objective observation" [...] in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its relation with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather than the study of singular independent facts.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""The Broken Man" [...] gave us back The Hound, but his return felt a little diminished, given the parade of returns we've already seen this year, and there weren't as many notable moments in this chapter as other Game of Thrones episodes. There were some fine scenes, but nothing on par with the show's usual goods, though Lady Mormont was a {{highlight}} and Jaime and the Blackfish's standoff is an interesting scenario, {{not to mention the}} <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Sansa's letter. Arya getting her guts punctured was a shocker, but it didn’t feel right that she couldn't see her attacker coming." [...] He gave the episode an 8 out of 10.|$|E

DOE stated that the Yucca Mountain Project [...] "will be based on sound science. By bringing in Oak Ridge for review of technical work, DOE will seek to present a high level of expertise and credibility as they move the project forward... This award gives DOE access to academic and research institutions to help DOE meet their mission and legal obligation to license, construct, and open Yucca Mountain as the nation’s repository for spent nuclear fuel." ...|$|E

We also prove that for each nontorsion point z, there exist at most finitely many torsion points which are S-integral with respect to z. This proves a <b>question</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> Tucker and the author, and it gives the analogue of Ih's conjecture for Drinfeld modules...|$|R

500|$|... "Collateral Damage" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a [...] "B". VanDerWerff {{felt that the}} episode began with a formulaic and [...] "manipulative" [...] attempt to shock the audience with the kidnapping of a young woman, but quickly moved past this to introduce more interesting elements, particularly {{the nature of the}} relationship between Watts and Black. VanDerWerff highlighted the acting of Marsters, finding that he succeeded in making character of Swan into a sympathetic and complex one rather than a simple villain. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Collateral Damage" [...] five stars out of five. Shearman called the episode [...] "magnificent", highlighting its in-depth take on the morality of both Black and Watts when faced with the issue of defending either their beliefs or their families. He also praised the guest acting in the episode, and felt that Perry's script was the first to adequately address <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> the series rather than simply asking more.|$|E
500|$|After On the Origin of Species was published, Darwin became {{involved}} in producing revised editions as well as working on Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication as {{the first part of}} his planned [...] "Big Book". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical <b>questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a {{way of looking at the}} world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, [...] "I am like a gambler, & love a wild experiment." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> critics mainly {{concerned}} the irony and hypocrisy {{of the lyrics}} of the song and its video. Philip Cosores of Paste felt that with the music video, Beyoncé disrespected the message she sent through the song and {{felt that it was}} notable enough to stand on its own. Similarly, Shannon Kelley for TakePart said that the song [...] "offers an honest commentary on an important reality", but highlighted the irony of its music video and felt that it manifested that [...] " [...] not immune to the disease". Randal Roberts of the Los Angeles Times quipped, [...] "She makes a convincing case, {{were it not for the}} string of nearly soft-core fashion shoots that follow ... As a first song on an album, 'Pretty Hurts' works. But as thematic opener to such a relentless visual seduction, the hypocrisy is hard to ignore." [...] Although Daisy Buchanan of The Daily Telegraph praised the message of the song and its video, she wrote in her review that the clip was [...] "pure hypocrisy" [...] because she opined that Beyoncé had promoted [...] "heavily sexualised and unattainable standards" [...] with her body throughout her career.|$|E
