40|$|A totally {{automated}} {{facility for}} semiconductor oxidation and diffusion was developed using a state-of-the-art diffusion furnace and high temperature grown oxides. Major innovations include: (1) a process controller specifically for semiconductor processing; (2) an automatic loading system to accept wafers from an air track, insert {{them into a}} <b>quartz</b> <b>carrier</b> and then place the carrier on a paddle for insertion into the furnace; (3) automatic unloading of the wafers back onto the air track, and (4) boron diffusion using diborane with plus or minus 5 percent uniformity. Processes demonstrated include Wet and dry oxidation for general use and for gate oxide, boron diffusion, phosphorous diffusion, and sintering...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated ageing in {{damp heat}} (DH) {{can reduce the}} {{stability}} of chalcopyrite solar modules. The decrease in lateral conductivity of the transparent Al-doped zinc oxide (ZAO) front contact contributes significantly to this effect. We present {{a study on the}} optical and electrical properties of ZAO without encapsulation on transparent quartz glass substrates with smooth and rough morphology before and after DH. Measured transmission/reflection curves are evaluated numerically to obtain the Drude mobility and carrier concentration. Comparison of optical and electrical data is helpful in evaluating the carrier transport in inhomogeneous ZAO layers, in particular the contributions of grains, grain boundaries and, what we have termed, 'extended grain boundaries'. The latter are perturbations in the ZAO growth caused by the substrate microstructure. After 1000 h of exposure to DH, the lateral electrical conductivity of ZAO on smooth quartz decreases only by a factor of two, whereas it changes up to two orders of magnitude on rough <b>quartz.</b> <b>Carrier</b> concentration and mobility derived from the optical analysis show a systematic but only minor degradation within the grains. We thus conclude, that the substrate morphology is the dominant factor on the extent of ZAO degradation. Due to the significant difference in the decrease of conductivity on rough and smooth substrates, we postulate that the extended grain boundaries are the prevailing source of this degradation...|$|E
40|$|A {{cleaning}} and drying system for processing at least 2500 three in. diameter wafers per hour was developed with {{a reduction in}} process cost. The system consists of an ammonia hydrogen peroxide bath in which both surfaces of 3 / 32 in. spaced, ion implanted wafers are cleaned in <b>quartz</b> <b>carriers</b> moved on a belt past two pairs of megasonic transducers. The wafers are dried in the novel room temperature, high velocity air dryer in the same carriers used for annealing. A new laser scanner was used effectively to monitor the cleaning ability on a sampling basis...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} study {{applying}} the technique of cold plasma ashing on polycarbonate filters as a preparative step for subsequent elemental analysis of aerosol particles by Total-Reflection X-ray fluorescence. The procedure has been validated by analyzing blanks of the filter material, chemicals used as additives as well as certified standard reference material. The results showed that cold plasma ashing is superior to conventional digestion methods {{with regard to the}} ease of sample preparation and contamination. A PIXE cascade impactor was used to collect size-fractionated aerosol particles in 9 size classes ranging from 16 to 0. 06 mu m aerodynamic diameter at an urban and a suburban site in Goteborg, Sweden. Filter segments loaded with the aerosol particles were cut out and fixed on <b>Quartz</b> <b>carriers.</b> After adding 10 ng of Ga as internal standard the samples were dried, digested by cold plasma ashing and analyzed by Total-Reflection X-ray fluorescence. The analysis of aerosol particles showed that elemental concentrations at both the urban and the suburban site in Goteborg were low compared to central Europe. More and concurrent sampling of size-fractionated particles is required to identify local sources of trace elements in the urban area of Goteborg. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study {{it was found that}} when p-type (100) silicon wafers in a fused <b>quartz</b> wafer <b>carrier</b> were annealed in argon in the temperature range 900 ~ 176 S iQ migrated over the Si wafer surface and etched it. In this initial study, ex-periments were isochronal, sothat different degrees of etching occurred at each temperature studied. In the present study, the heat-treatments were conducted in a high purity argon atmosphere for periods of t ime so chosen that at each tempera-ture an approximately equal weight loss of silicon, due to the etching process, could be expected. The effects of heat-treat-ment on the resulting surface morphology of etch structures of (100), (110), or (111) silicon wafers were compared. It was found under these equal weight loss conditions that the etching at T-< 1000 ~ is anisotropic (polyhedron etch pits are ob-served) while at higher temperatures a close to isotropic behavior is observed. It is bel ieved that the crystallographic etch structure generation in the anisotropic etching regime begins at crystal attice defect sites or at impurity inhomogeneit ies. In addit ion to the crystallographic etch pit structures, there is observed at very high magnifications, 9000 times, a slight background structure in the anisotropic etching regime. Here, it is bel ieved that this background structure is the be-ginning of crystallographically defined etch pits, originating again at some sort of crystal defect. In the isotropic regime, where a similar background structure is also observed, but where crystallographic etch pits are not, it is bel ieved that this again represents crystal defects or impurity inhomogeneit ies being etched at different rates than the lattice planes, bu...|$|R
30|$|First, GaN {{thin films}} were grown on Si (111) {{substrate}} by PLD {{at the growth temperature}} of 800 °C using a GaN ceramic target. The film deposition {{was carried out}} in a stainless steel vacuum chamber evacuated by a turbomolecular pump to a base pressure of 5.6 [*]×[*] 10 − 5  Pa. A pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a wavelength of 1, 064  nm (repetition 10  Hz, duration 10  ns) was focused by a lens on the ZnO target at an angle of incidence of 45 °. During the deposition, the laser incident energy was maintained at 300  mJ/pulse. The size of the ablation spot is about 0.5  mm in diameter. A series of Si (111) substrate was placed at 40  mm from the target surface. For the ZnO target ablation and even thin film fabrication, GaN target and substrate rotated reversely with a frequency of 7  rpm. GaN films were deposited in the nitrogen background of 1.3  Pa, and depositing time was 15  min. The thickness of GaN thin films measured is about 50  nm. Second, the samples were placed on a <b>quartz</b> <b>carrier</b> and annealed in a high-temperature tube quartz furnace. After the furnace reached the equilibrium temperature of 1, 000 °C the carrier with the GaN samples was placed in a constant temperature region of the furnace. Flowing N 2 was introduced into the tube for 5  min at a flow rate of 100  ml/min to flush out the residual air. Then, we terminated N 2 flow and introduced NH 3 into the tube at a flow rate of 800  ml/min for 20  min. Finally, the NH 3 was flushed out by N 2 introduced into the tube for another 5  min before the carrier was removed from the furnace. Third, ZnO thin films were fabricated on GaN (111) template by PLD at a growth temperature of 400 °C in O 2 ambience with a pressure of 1.3  Pa using a ZnO ceramic target. The laser incident energy was maintained at 200  mJ/pulse, and depositing time was 60  min. The thickness of ZnO thin films is about 600  nm, which was measured by the weight technique. The structural properties of thin films were studied by Rigaku D/max-rB XRD (Tokyo, Japan) spectroscopy with Cu Kα line radiation at 0.15418  nm. The surface morphology and the microstructure were studied using FESEM (QUANTA 250, FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR, USA). The IR spectra were acquired using a BRUKER TENSOR 27 spectrophotometer (Bruker Optik Gmbh, Ettlingen, Germany; wavenumber range 400 to 4, 000  cm− 1, optical resolution 4  cm− 1, transmission mode). The optical properties of ZnO thin films were characterized by photoluminescence spectra with the excitation wavelength of 320  nm pumped by Xe lamp.|$|E
