5|$|A {{total of}} 104,198 {{light-duty}} plug-in electric vehicles have been {{registered in the}} UK up until March 2017, including about 4,500 plug-in commercial vans. Since {{the launch of the}} Plug-In Car Grant in January 2011, a total of 94,541 eligible cars have been registered through March 2017, and, , the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 2,938 units since the launch of the scheme in 2012. Before the introduction of series production plug-in vehicles, a total of 1,096 all-electric vehicles were registered in the UK between 2006 and December 2010. Before 2011, the G-Wiz, a heavy <b>quadricycle,</b> listed as the top-selling EV for several years. , the UK had the fourth largest European stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles, and with 36,907 plug-in passenger cars registered in 2016, ranked as the second best selling European market that year after Norway.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' car is {{believed}} to be the second gasoline-engine powered vehicle successfully road tested in the United States, according to its exhibit information at the Smithsonian Institution. It was built two years before Henry Ford's <b>Quadricycle,</b> and preceded only by Charles Duryea's Motorized Wagon less than a year earlier. Unlike Duryea's car, which was an adapted buckboard wagon that was designed to run under its own power but still able to be pulled by horse, Haynes' car was designed only to run on its own. Some automotive historians use this difference to determine that Haynes' car was the first true American automobile. The Sintz company continued to be intrigued by Haynes' use of their motor and sent representatives to photo his vehicle and published the images as an advertisement for one of their engine's possible uses. The publicity spurred the creation of numerous other automobiles across the American midwest.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quadricycles</b> are European vehicle {{categories}} of four-wheeled microcars defined by limitations {{in terms of}} weight, power and speed. Two categories are defined; knowingly light <b>quadricycles</b> (L6e), and heavy <b>quadricycles</b> (L7e).|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the European Union {{published}} Directive 92/61/EEC which {{considered that}} <b>quadricycles</b> {{fell into the}} same category as mopeds. Framework Directive 2002/24/EC then refined this definition by distinguishing between light and heavy <b>quadricycles</b> (L6e and L7e categories).|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, Directive 2006/126 (3rd Driving Licence Directive) {{establishes}} a common framework for light <b>quadricycles</b> driving licences. It imposes the same requirements for light <b>quadricycles</b> as for mopeds, including the driving age, {{for which it}} recommends 16 years as a minimum. The transposition deadline of the directive is 19 January 2011.|$|R
25|$|In 1891, Ford {{became an}} {{engineer}} with the Edison Illuminating Company. After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, {{he had enough}} {{time and money to}} devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the Ford <b>Quadricycle.</b> He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the <b>Quadricycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first Type 192 {{prototype}} XG447 flew on 5 July 1958 with tandem wooden rotor blades, {{a completely}} manual control {{system and a}} castored, fixed <b>quadricycle</b> undercarriage. From the fifth prototype, the rotors fitted were all-metal, four-bladed units. Production model controls and instruments allowed night operations. The prototype machines had an upwards-hinged main passenger and cockpit door, which was prone to being slammed shut by the downwash from the rotors. This {{was replaced by a}} sliding door on the later aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In Italy {{the driving}} licence is a {{governmental}} right given {{to those who}} request a licence {{for any of the}} categories they desire. It is required for every type of motorized vehicle. The minimum age to obtain a driving licence is: 16 years for a motorcycle 125cc with a limit of motor power of 11kW and for a <b>quadricycle</b> motor (cars with a weight of 400kg (550kg if it's for freight transport)and a motor power not exceeding 15kW), 18 years for a car or a motorcycle without a limit for the engine cylinder capacity and a limit of motor power of 35kW, and 21 years for mini-buses, three-wheeler without a limit of motor power and cargo vehicles, and 24 years for motorcycles without limits of motor power and for buses.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} 2,956 all-electric {{vehicles}} were registered in Germany during 2012, a 37.2% increase over 2011. When 901 registered plug-in hybrids are accounted for, 2012 registrations climb to 3,857 units, {{and sales of}} plug-in electric car represented a 0.12% market share of new passenger vehicles sold {{in the country in}} 2012. Most sales in the country were made by corporate and fleet customers and 1,493 all-electric vehicles were registered by the automobile industry, as demonstration or research vehicles. Registrations of plug-in electric-drive vehicles were led by the Opel Ampera extended-range electric car with 828 units, followed by the Smart electric drive with 734 units. In addition, a total of 2,413 Renault Twizys were sold during 2012, making Germany the top selling European market for the electric <b>quadricycle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The G.II {{carried a}} crew of three and a {{defensive}} armament of two 7.92mm (.312in) machine guns. The forward section of the fuselage was skinned in plywood, with the remainder covered in fabric. The fuselage and two very large nacelles were mounted on the lower wing. Each nacelle contained fuel and oil tanks beneath each {{of a pair of}} geared-output 160KW (220hp) Mercedes D.IV straight-eight engines, one per nacelle, driving pusher propellers. The undercarriage was unusual, being <b>quadricycle</b> in arrangement with a pair of wheels mounted at the front and rear of each engine nacelle. This feature was intended to remove the possibility of a nose-over on landing. In fact, the nacelles and undercarriage constituted fully self-contained, wheeled units intended to facilitate construction and maintenance. The entire aircraft was intended to be easily dismantled so that fuselage, engines, and wings would easily fit onto three railway flatcars.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} {{to a lack of}} large-automaker participation in the electric car industry, a number of small companies cropped up in their place, designing and marketing electric cars for the public. In 1994, the Reva Electric Car Company was established in Bangalore, India, as a joint venture between the Maini Group India and AEV of California. After seven years of research and development, it launched the REVAi an all-electric small micro car, known as the G-Wiz i in the United Kingdom, in 2001. The car was powered by lead–acid batteries, and in January 2009, a new model was launched, the REVA L-ion. It is similar to the REVAi but powered by high performance lithium-ion batteries, which reduce the car's curb weight. In many countries the REVAi does not meet the criteria to qualify as a highway-capable motor vehicle, and fits into other classes, such as neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) in the United States and heavy <b>quadricycle</b> in Europe. The REVA sold more than 4,000 vehicles worldwide by March 2011 and was available in 26 countries. Sales in the UK, its main market, ended by late 2011. Production ended in 2012 and was replaced by the Mahindra e2o in 2013.|$|E
