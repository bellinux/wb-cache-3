5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{about the causes of}} the {{disaster}} which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him whether}} he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E

5|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the House of Commons {{about the}} cost of {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|In late 1986, <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the UK Parliament {{concerning}} the matters in Lobster. Then Labour Party Member of Parliament for Hull North, Kevin McNamara, {{brought up the}} issue in the House of Commons, asking the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, to refer the matter to the Security Commission, and asking then Attorney-General and Conservative MP Michael Havers, to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate allegations published in Lobster and prosecute Colin Wallace for revealing details of secret service operations against Her Majesty's Government. Both declined. Two weeks later, Labour MP Tam Dalyell asked the Prime Minister why she would not refer the matter to the Security Commission, but she said that she had nothing more to add.|$|E
5|$|In September <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the House of Commons {{about the}} incident, {{by which time}} Constantine had decided to take legal action. In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court. Although there was no law against racial {{discrimination}} in Britain at the time, Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him. Constantine informed the court that {{the attitude of the}} hotel changed between his booking and arrival, owing to the presence of white American servicemen. The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily. The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used. After two days of evidence, the judge found in Constantine's favour, rejecting the defence's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation. Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas, Constantine was vindicated. He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised the issue of racism in the public eye; the case was widely reported in the press, and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government.|$|E

25|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the British Parliament {{about the}} IRA's 12 January {{ultimatum}} to the British government. The ultimatum {{had previously been}} publicised in the British newspapers following the 17 January attack.

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} that started in 1986, a complete overhaul of how the CPS was administered and what type of <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> occurred. Prior to 1994, the alternate measures of unemployment had different names because the BLS drastically revised the questions in the CPS and renamed the measures: U3 and U4 were eliminated; the official rate U5 remained the same measure but was renamed U3; U6 and U7 were revised and renamed U5 and U6.|$|E

25|$|The Board of Trade held an enquiry {{into the}} loss of Hopestar. It was held in London on 4-6, 9-13, 16-17 and 26–28 January 1950. It was {{concluded}} that Hopestar had probably broke in two and foundered with {{the loss of}} all 40 of her crew. The possibility that she struck a mine could not be discounted, but was thought unlikely. <b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> by Stanley Awbery in the House of Commons on 20 March 1950 although they were never satisfactorily answered.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in Parliament by Manny Shinwell about the lack of use of the guns carried on Domala in her defence. Winston Churchill replied that the {{aircraft}} that attacked Domala had been initially misidentified as a friendly one, which was why the guns were not manned. A British destroyer also misidentified the aircraft. It was also asked why the gunners were not always manning the guns. In India, there was public anger towards Germany as {{a result of}} the attack. Eighty-one of those killed were Indian citizens.|$|E
25|$|On 25 May 1917 Lympne {{was bombed}} by Gotha G.IV bombers of Kagohl 3 who dropped 19 bombs on the airfield.

25|$|In {{addition}} to cutting its {{ties with the}} Second International, the 1920 Annual Conference of the ILP directed its executive to contact the Swiss Socialist Party {{with a view to}} establishing an all-inclusive international which would join the internationalist left wing socialist parties with their revolutionary socialist brethren of the new Moscow international. A further set of <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> of the Comintern in letter dated 21 May 1920 by ILP Chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its program, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.|$|E
25|$|In 1912–13, {{he played}} 14 league matches, scoring once, before signing for Fulham {{just ahead of}} the March {{transfer}} deadline. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division {{at the end of that}} season, and promptly re-signed Winship, who had played just twice for Fulham. <b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> as to the probity of the transfer– Sir Henry Norris had been and remained a director of Fulham before becoming major shareholder in and chairman of Arsenal– but the Football League's management committee ratified his return. Woolwich Arsenal began the 1913–14 season in their new stadium with the visit of Leicester City on 6 September. The visitors took a one-goal lead, and George Jobey scored the equaliser– Arsenal's first goal at what would become generally known as Highbury– with a header from Winship's corner; Arsenal won 2–1.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1939, {{he was the}} {{commanding}} instructor for Haganah Leader's courses held at Yavniel when two British Palestine Police officers discovered a quantity of illegal rifles. Haganah HQ ordered the camp evacuated. Leading a group of 43 men through Wadi Bira, early the following morning, 12 to 15 Arab members of the Transjordan Frontier Force arrested them. <b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> about how such a large force was arrested by a much smaller one. Moshe Carmel, the group's deputy commander, was also critical of Dayan's willingness {{to talk to his}} interrogators in Acre prison. On 30 October 1939, most of the group were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Seven months later, Dayan was replaced as the prisoners' representative after it was discovered that moves were being made to get him an individual pardon. On 16 February 1941, after Chaim Weizmann's intervention in London, they were all released.|$|E

He was also King of the Mountains for six stages; however, he ultimately finished second to Quintana in that classification. Froome's overall win and stage victories in the Tour win put him {{at the top of}} the UCI World Tour ranking, with 587, ahead of Sagan on 409. Partly because the 2013 Tour was the first since Lance Armstrong's admission of doping, such <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> of Froome. He insisted that he and his team were clean and stated that the questioning saddened him. Froome was drug tested 19 times during the Tour and Team Sky principal Dave Brailsford offered the World Anti-Doping Agency all performance data they had on Froome as evidence.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{was made}} a partner in Bewick, Moreing & Co. on December 18, 1901 and assumed {{responsibility}} for various Australian operations and investments. His initial compensation rose to $12,500 annually {{in addition to a}} 20% share of profits. The company eventually controlled at one point approximately 50% of gold production in Western Australia. In 1901, Hoover no longer lived in Australia, but he visited the country in 1902, 1903, 1905, and 1907 as an overseas investor. Hoover was also a director of Chinese Engineering and Mining Corporation (CEMC) when it became a supplier of immigrant labor from Southeast Asia for South African mines. The first shipment of almost 2,000 workers arrived in Durban from Qinhuangdao in July 1904. By 1906, the total number of immigrant workers increased to 50,000, almost entirely recruited and shipped by CEMC. When the living and working conditions of the laborers became known, public opposition to the scheme grew and <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the British Parliament. The scheme was abandoned in 1911.|$|E
25|$|In 1908 Wilson had {{his senior}} class prepare a scheme for the {{deployment}} of an Expeditionary Force to France, assuming Germany to have invaded Belgium. <b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> in the House of Commons when news of this leaked out, and the following year no assumption was made of a German invasion of Belgium, and students were sharply reminded that the exercise was “SECRET”. Wilson first met Foch {{on a visit to}} the Ecole Superieur de Guerre (December 1909, and again on Wilson’s way home from holiday in Switzerland in January 1910). They struck up a good rapport, and both thought the Germans would attack between Verdun and Namur (in the actual event they would attack much further west than that). Wilson arranged for Foch and Victor Huguet to visit Britain in June 1910, and copied his practice of setting students outdoor exercises in which they were distracted by instructors shouting “Allez! Allez!” and “Vite! Vite!” at them whilst they were attempting to draw up plans at short notice.|$|E
