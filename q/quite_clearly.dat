5|$|Similarities {{between the}} humerus of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus northropi have been noted; {{both have a}} long, smooth deltopectoral crest, and a {{thickened}} humeral head. These were initially {{the basis of the}} taxon's referral to the clade Azhdarchidae, but they are also similar enough to be a basis for the synonymy of Hatzegopteryx and Quetzalcoatlus. However, this is likely due to the relatively non-diagnostic nature of the humerus in giant azhdarchid taxonomy, and the lack of a detailed description for the elements of Q. northropi. However, the neck and jaw anatomy of Hatzegopteryx is <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> distinct from the smaller Q. sp., which warrants the retention of Hatzegopteryx as a taxon separate from Quetzalcoatlus.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, and that such fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion of the concepts of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E

25|$|In {{the famous}} tragedy of Euripides Bacchae, Kadmos states {{an early version}} of Pascal's Wager. It is {{noteworthy}} {{that at the end of}} the tragedy Dionysos, the god to whom Kadmos referred, appears and punishes him for thinking in this way. Euripides, <b>quite</b> <b>clearly,</b> considered and dismissed the wager in this tragedy.|$|E
25|$|Sidath Wettimuny is {{a former}} Sri Lankan cricketer, who played Test cricket and One Day Internationals as an opening batsman from 1982 to 1987. Wettimuny was a typical opening batsman in that he often played very defensively, {{grafting}} for his runs, and his ODI strike rate of 48 shows this <b>quite</b> <b>clearly.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{had then}} {{looked into his}} face, which--though the vestry was but ill lighted by a tiny very dusty window--she had never seen <b>quite</b> so <b>clearly</b> before, {{and then it was}} that that amazing sense of {{something}} awful and unreal had descended upon her like a clammy shroud.|$|R

25|$|However, {{despite this}} {{apparent}} diversity, {{some of the}} same old problems which had dogged international rugby were still manifest in the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1980s – for example, in a photograph of the Hong Kong vs. Bahrain game at the tournament in 1984, the teams do not appear to include anyone who is ethnically Arab or Chinese; instead both teams are <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> of northern European ethnic origin.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} that arose {{at that point}} of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation. During the reception of former British Prime Minister Edward Heath during his sixth visit to the PRC, Deng Xiaoping commented <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> on the impossibility of exchanging sovereignty for administration, declaring an ultimatum: the British government must modify or give up its position or the PRC will announce its resolution {{of the issue of}} Hong Kong sovereignty unilaterally.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This might happen if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, {{know anything about the}} genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century.|$|E

25|$|From {{this point}} in time, we can {{distinguish}} <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> between two classes of commemorative coins. Apart from the non-circulating medal-like coins referred to above, increasing numbers of circulating base metal commemorative coins have been issued in recent decades. When West Germany replaced the silver 5 mark coin with a copper-nickel one in 1975, the silver 5 mark commemoratives also reverted to copper-nickel (in 1979). Already in 1965, the Soviet Union issued a copper-nickel-zinc rouble commemorating the victory in World War II. This, and the next four commemorative roubles, were issued in several millions of copies, and circulated as regular currency.|$|E
25|$|Rural women, {{although}} poor, are independent, better organised, socially outspoken. According {{to another}} local custom, women {{can choose to}} terminate a marriage relationship through a custom called chudi pahanana, if she desires. Most of the old temples and shrines here are related to 'women power' (e.g., Shabari, Mahamaya, Danteshwari) {{and the existence of}} these temples gives insight into historical and current social fabric of this state. However, a mention of these progressive local customs in no way suggests that the ideology of female subservience does not exist in Chhattisgarh. On the contrary, the male authority and dominance is seen <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> in the social and cultural life.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{differentiation}} {{in terms}} of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This {{is illustrated by the}} discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear that a young child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. There is probably also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and Aussensiedlung were not able to locally produce enough food to support their own populations implied <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> that they must have been able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of enabling {{quality of service}} in input-queued packet switches has been investigated. Expanded version of maximum weight matching (MWM) scheduling mechanism has been proposed by including additional weight calculation algorithms. The overall results are <b>quite</b> satisfactory. <b>Clearly,</b> the performance of output-queued packet switches cannot be achieved, but controlled service class separation is possible. For example, by using weighted fair queuing (WFQ) weight calculation algorithm, fair bandwidth distribution can be achieved...|$|R

Major Thomson," [...] she went on, [...] "I wonder, {{do you really}} believe all these stories of the horrible doings of the Germans--the way they have treated drowning people attacked by their submarines, and these hateful stories of Belgium?

25|$|Initially, the waltz was {{significantly}} different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions {{make it clear that}} the couples danced with arm positions {{similar to that of the}} precursor dances, the Ländler and the Allemande. The hold was at times semi-closed, and at times side by side. Arms are intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. There was another significant difference from our present technique. The feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced than it is today. This can be seen <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed.|$|E
25|$|Ease {{of voting}} {{is a factor}} in rates of turnout. In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through {{separate}} voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> decreases turnout. U.S. states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts. Other methods of improving turnout include making voting easier through more available absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters have to spend waiting in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. In some areas, generally those where some polling centres are relatively inaccessible, such as India, elections often take several days. Some countries have considered Internet voting as a possible solution. In other countries, like France, voting is held on the weekend, when most voters are away from work. Therefore, the need for time off from work as a factor in voter turnout is greatly reduced.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} written by {{freelance}} journalist Michael Hastings, ("The Runaway General", appearing in Rolling Stone magazine, July 8–22, 2010 issue), McChrystal {{and his staff}} mocked civilian government officials, including Joe Biden, National Security Advisor James L. Jones, US Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl W. Eikenberry, and Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke. McChrystal was not quoted as being directly critical of {{the president or the}} president's policies, but several comments from his aides in the article reflected their perception of McChrystal's disappointment with Obama on their first two occasions of meeting. According to Rolling Stone, McChrystal's staff was contacted prior to release of the article and did not deny the validity of the article, although senior members of his staff dispute this, and have accused Hastings in Army Times of exaggerating the seniority of aides quoted and breaking the off the record trust of private conversations between him and the aides. Hastings told Newsweek that he was <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> a reporter gathering material, and actually bemused at the degree to which soldiers freely spoke to him.|$|E

500|$|The {{politician}} and architect Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's [...] Quattro Libri as his bible. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs {{for his own}} beloved Monticello, the James Barbour Barboursville estate, Virginia State Capitol, and the University of Virginia were based on drawings from Palladio's book. Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is <b>quite</b> <b>clearly</b> based on Palladio's Villa Capra, however, with modifications, in a style which is described in America today as Colonial Georgian. Jefferson's Pantheon, or Rotunda, at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.|$|E
500|$|According to Meredith, Mugabe {{presented}} himself as [...] "articulate, thoughtful, and conciliatory" [...] after his 1980 election victory. Blair noted {{that at this}} period of his career, Mugabe displayed [...] "genuine magnanimity and moral courage" [...] despite his [...] "intense personal reasons for feeling bitterness and hatred" [...] toward {{the members of the}} former regime. Following his dealing with Mugabe during the 1979 negotiations, Michael Pallister, head of the British Foreign Office, described Mugabe as having [...] "a very sharp, sometimes rather aggressive, and unpleasant manner". The British diplomat Peter Longworth stated that in private, Mugabe was [...] "very charming and very articulate and he's not devoid of humour. It's very difficult to relate the man you meet with the man ranting on television". Norman stated that [...] "I always found him personable and honourable in his dealings.

60|$|For example, monogamy {{in general}} {{seems to me}} to be clearly {{indicated}} (as doctors say) by the fact that there are not several women in the world for every man, but <b>quite</b> as <b>clearly</b> does it seem necessary to recognize that the fact that there are (or were in 1901) 21,436,107 females to 20,172,984 males in our British community seems to condemn our present rigorous insistence upon monogamy, unless feminine celibacy has its own delights. But, as I have said, it is now largely believed that the sexual life of a woman is more important to her than his sexual life to a man and less easily ignored.|$|R
