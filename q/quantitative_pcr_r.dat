40|$|Objectives and methods: Tropheryma whipplei is {{a poorly}} studied {{bacterium}} responsible for Whipple’s disease. In this study, its susceptibility to doxycycline was investigated at a transcriptional level using a whole-genome DNA microarray. Results: Exposure of T. whipplei to the MIC of doxycycline (0. 5 mg/L) induced antibiotic-specific primary expression profiles, while indirect effects were detected at 103 MIC. In contrast {{to what was}} observed for several microorganisms exposed to antibiotics, the heat-shock proteins were not affected. Consistent with the mode of action of this translation inhibitor, genes encoding for ribosomal proteins and translation factors were differentially transcribed. This analysis also evidenced the regu-lation of genes that should account for cell growth arrest. Long-term survival of non-replicating bacteria {{is likely to be}} ensured by an increased level of ppGpp, the nucleotide effector of the stringent response. The gene expression profile observed with 103 MIC was mainly characterized by the up-regulation of ABC transporters that possibly form efflux and detoxification systems, through which T. whipplei may limit the effects of this bacteriostatic compound. Obtained microarray data showed good agreement with real-time <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> (<b>R</b> 2 5 0. 969). Conclusions: This work represents the first comprehensive genomic approach providing insights into the expression signature triggered by the exposure of T. whipplei to antibiotics...|$|E

Methods: We identified a mass grave in Douai, France dating from the early XVIII th century. This city was besieged during the European war of Spanish succession. We tested dental pulp from 1192 teeth (including 40 from Douai) by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> (qPCR) for <b>R.</b> prowazekii and B. quintana. We also used ultra-sensitive suicide <b>PCR</b> to detect <b>R.</b> prowazekii and genotyped positive samples. Results and Discussion: In the Douai remains, we identified one case of B. quintana infection (by qPCR) and R. prowazekii (by suicide PCR) in 6 / 21 individuals (29 %). The R. prowazekii was genotype B, a genotype previously found in a Spanish isolate obtained {{in the first part}} of the XX th century.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new microarray technology for quantitative gene-expression profiling {{on the basis of}} randomly assembled arrays of beads. Each bead carries a gene-specific probe sequence. There are multiple copies of each sequence-specific bead in an array, which contributes to measurement precision and reliability. We optimized the system for specific and sensitive analysis of mammalian RNA, and using RNA controls of defined concentration, obtained the following estimates of system performance: specificity of 1 : 250, 000 in mammalian poly(A+) mRNA; limit of detection 0. 13 pM; dynamic range 3. 2 logs; and sufficient precision to detect 1. 3 -fold differences with 95 % confidence within the dynamic range. Measurements of expression differences between human brain and liver were validated by concordance with <b>quantitative</b> real-time <b>PCR</b> (<b>R</b> 2 = 0. 98 for log-transformed ratios, and slope of the best-fit line = 1. 04, for 20 genes). Quantitative performance was further verified using a mouse B- and T-cell model system. We found published reports of B- or T-cell-specific expression for 42 of 59 genes that showed the greatest differential expression between B- and T-cells in our system. All of the literature observations were concordant with our results. Our experiments were carried out on a 96 -array matrix system that requires only 100 ng of input RNA and uses standard microtiter plates to process samples in parallel. Our technology has advantages for analyzing multiple samples, is scalable to all known genes in a genome, and is flexible, allowing the use of standard or custom probes in an array...|$|R
40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work Motivation: Affymetrix SNP arrays {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the DNA copy number measurement of 11, 000 to 500, 000 SNPs along the genome. Their high density facilitates the precise localization of genomic alterations and makes them a powerful tool for studies of cancers and copy number polymorphism. Like other microarray technologies it is influenced by non-relevant sources of variation, requiring correction. Moreover, the amplitude of variation induced by non-relevant effects is similar or greater than the biologically relevant effect (i. e. true copy number), making it difficult to estimate non-relevant effects accurately without including the biologically relevant effect. Results: We addressed this problem by developing ITALICS, a normalization method that estimates both biological and non-relevant effects in an alternate, iterative manner, accurately eliminating irrelevant effects. We compared our normalization method with other existing and available methods, and found that ITALICS outperformed these methods for several in-house datasets and one public dataset. These results were validated biologically by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> Availability: The <b>R</b> package ITALICS (ITerative and Alternative normaLIzation and Copy number call for affymetrix Snp arrays) has been submitted to Bioconductor.

40|$|Abstract Background Copy number {{variants}} are > 1 kb genomic amplifications or deletions {{that can}} be identified using array platforms. However, arrays produce substantial background noise that contributes to high false discovery rates of variants. We hypothesized that <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> could finitely determine copy number and assess the validity of calling algorithms. Results Using data from 29 Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 arrays, we determined copy numbers using three programs: Partek Genomics Suite, Affymetrix Genotyping Console 2. 0 and Birdsuite. We compared array calls at 25 chromosomal regions to those determined by qPCR and found nearly identical calls in regions of copy number 2. Conversely, agreement differed in regions called variant {{by at least one}} method. The highest overall agreement in calls, 91 %, was between Birdsuite and <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> Partek Genomics Suite calls agreed with <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> 76 % of the time while the agreement of Affymetrix Genotyping Console 2. 0 with <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> was 79 %.

40|$|Clinical {{microbiology}} laboratories rely on <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> for its speed, sensitivity, specificity and ease-of-use. However, <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> quantitation {{requires the}} use of a standard curve or normalisation to reference genes. Droplet digital PCR provides absolute quantitation without the need for calibration curves. A comparison between droplet digital <b>PCR</b> and <b>quantitative</b> PCR-based analyses was conducted for the enteric parasite Cryptosporidium, which is an important cause of gastritis in both humans and animals. Two loci were analysed (18 S rRNA and actin) using a range of Cryptosporidium DNA templates, including recombinant plasmids, purified haemocytometer-counted oocysts, commercial flow cytometry-counted oocysts and faecal DNA samples from sheep, cattle and humans. Each method was evaluated for linearity, precision, limit of detection and cost. Across the same range of detection, both methods showed a high degree of linearity and positive correlation for standards (R 2 ≥ 0. 999) and faecal samples (R 2 ≥ 0. 9750). The precision of droplet digital PCR, as measured by mean Relative Standard Deviation (RSD;%), was consistently better compared with <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR,</b> particularly for the 18 S rRNA locus, but was poorer as DNA concentration decreased. The quantitative detection of <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> was unaffected by DNA concentration, but droplet digital <b>PCR</b> <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> was less affected by the presence of inhibitors, compared with <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> For most templates analysed including Cryptosporidium-positive faecal DNA, the template copy numbers, as determined by droplet digital PCR, were consistently lower than by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> However, the quantitations obtained by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> are dependent on the accuracy of the standard curve and when the <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> data were corrected for pipetting and DNA losses (as determined by droplet digital PCR), then the sensitivity of both methods was comparable. A cost analysis based on 96 samples revealed that the overall cost (consumables and labour) of droplet digital PCR was two times higher than <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> Using droplet digital PCR to precisely quantify standard dilutions used for high-throughput and cost-effective amplifications by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> would be one way to combine the advantages of the two technologies...|$|R

This {{study was}} carried out to explore the potential inhibitory effects and mechanisms of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on AngII induced rat CFs. Methods: Viability, proliferation and collagen production of CFs were measured by MTT assay, [3 H]-thymidine and [3 H]-proline incorporation respectively. β-arrestin 1 (βarr 1), AT 1 aR and AT 1 bR mRNA levels were determined by <b>quantitative</b> <b>PCR.</b> AT 1 <b>R,</b> Gq, βarr 1 / 2, phosphorylated kinase C (p-PKC) -delta expressions were detected by western blotting. We blocked βarr 1 expression using βarr 1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Results: EGCG inhibited the activation of CFs induced by AngII. βarr 1 mRNA level revealed a positive correlation with the viability of CFs. SiRNA targeting βarr 1 blocked the activation of CFs. In vitro, AngII increased βarr 1 mRNA, total and membrane βarr 1 protein expressions, but reduced AT 1 aR mRNA, global and membrane AT 1 R, total Gq and cytoplasmic p-PKC-delta levels. Administration of EGCG restored the above abnormalities, whereas Gq levels were not affected. Conclusion: Our findings showed that βarr 1 is essential for AngII-mediated activation of CFs.

50|$|In most {{traditional}} PCRs the resulting products are analyzed after the PCR has been completed. This is called end-point analysis and is normally qualitative of nature {{rather than being}} quantitative. For this sort of analysis, products are mostly analyzed on an agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide as a fluorescent dye. Direct correlation between signal strength and initial sample concentration is not possible using end-point analysis since PCR efficiency decreases as the reaction nears the plateau phase. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>PCR,</b> however, offers an accurate and rapid alternative to traditional <b>PCR.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> <b>PCR</b> offers the researcher the opportunity to amplify and analyze the product in a single tube using fluorescent dyes.
