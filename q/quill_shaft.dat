40|$|The {{combination}} of a high-speed motor, dry gas seals, and magnetic bearings realized in this unit facilitates the elimination of oil.

However, the controller of each bearing then has to take the combined modes of both machines into account. The requirements for the controller to ensure stability and sufficient damping of all critical speeds are designed and compared with the implemented controller. The calculated closed loop behavior was confirmed experimentally, except the stability of some higher modes due to slight frequency deviations of the rotor model to the actual rotor.

After all, it was not necessary to install the damper, since all modes cold be stabilized by the controller...|$|E
40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the driving gear of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the hub fillet. After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the gear cluster had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the driving gear. Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the driving gear appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual.

40|$|A {{thrust bearing}} test rig {{experienced}} a catastrophic failure while operating with gas bearings. After many repairs, {{the test rig}} is in operating condition with water-lubricated bearings. Previous work details the failure and several initial repairs and modifications. Further modifications include manufacturing two rotors, repairing the main housing, aligning the motor shaft and test rotor, upgrading the water pipeline system, developing a static load system, installing instrumentation, and developing means of data acquisition. Presently, the revamped system has rotated to a speed of 5 krpm. Measurements of the free-free mode natural frequencies and lateral mode shapes of the rotor-coupling system show that the rotor and <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> operate as a unit. Once assembled, water lubricates the bearings to lift and support the test rotor connected to the motor through its coupling. Impact loads identify the system fundamental natural frequency and damping ratio for operation without rotor speed or active thrust bearings. The flexibility of the <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> commands {{the location of the}} system lateral natural frequency (~ 93 Hz) and its low damping ratio. XLTRC 2 ? based predictions agree well with the measured natural frequency and identified damping ratio. The water lubricates the radial bearings to lift the test rotor again as the motor accelerates the rotor to 5 krpm. During this operation, the rotor motion is synchronous and does not excite the first natural frequency. While operating at speeds up to 5 krpm, the system did not reach its first critical speed. Measurements show the thrust bearing axial clearance increases as the water supply pressure increases, max. 4. 14 bar(g), for operation with a constant axial load and at null or low rotor speed (3 krpm). As the imposed axial load increases, the operating clearance decreases exponentially. The decreasing operating clearance causes an increased flow resistance across the film lands, resulting in a reduced flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, there is a lower pressure drop across each orifice, resulting in an increase in recess pressure. The derived axial stiffness increases as the axial clearance decreases or the water supply pressure increases. XLHydroThrust? uses the thrust bearing geometry to generate predictions of thrust bearing performance. The predictions accurately describe the influence of the load and supply pressure on the thrust bearing performance; however, there are discrepancies between the magnitudes of the predictions and the magnitudes of the measurements at a high axial load (low axial clearance). The average percent difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes of supply flow rate, flow rate through inner diameter, axial clearance, and recess pressure ratio change from 2 % to 47 %, 7 % to 73 %, 25 % to 53 %, and 7 % to 18 %, respectively, as the applied axial load increases from its minimum to maximum magnitude. Thus, there is a significant increase in difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes as the applied axial load increases. Future work includes measurements of static and dynamic load performance of a water lubricated hybrid thrust bearing...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 101 - 110 The {{design and}} {{application}} of solid couplings combined with flexible quill shafts for high speed turbocompressors are presented. Solid couplings are rigid in the axial direction. They transmit any residual thrust from one compressor casing to another, and even into the gear. A single thrust bearing then positions the complete rotor train. Elimination of individual thrust bearings results in a smaller lube-oil system and a reduced power loss. Any additional thrust components from a prestressed flexible-disc coupling or a gear-type coupling (gear lock) are completely avoided. The use of a flexible intermediate shaft (<b>quill</b> <b>shaft)</b> gives the solid coupling the same lateral flexibility as for a geartype or flexible-disc coupling. Criteria for allowable misalignment are given in this paper. A solid coupling is neither exposed {{to any kind of}} wear nor endangered by corrosion or stress corrosion so that no maintenance is necessary. Couplings have a decisive influence on rotordynamics. The conventional arrangement of a multicasing train with gear-type or flexible-disc couplings incorporates individual thrust bearings located outboard of the journal bearings (long shaft over hangs). Introducing solid couplings leads to a stiffer rotor by eliminating individual thrust bearings. A comparison of critical speeds of a high-speed/high-power compressor train is made alternatively equipped with solid couplings, flexible-disc or gear-type couplings. The response of the different rotors and couplings to specified unbalance weights is calculated and compared throughout the complete speed range. Torsional and lateral critical frequencies can easily be influenced by modification of intermediate shafts, even after installation of a compressor train. Operating experience on nearly 1500 compressors equipped with solid couplings have proven their excellent reliability especially on high speed, high power turbocompressor applications...|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} the engine accessory gearbox (EAGB) of an aeroengine, bearing serial No. 16 - 96 - 007 were forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that there was fatigue failure in the gears on O 6 and O 8 axes and in the cage of the ball bearing on O 7 axis. The primary failure in the EAGB has been identified to be the failure in the ball bearing located on the O 7 axis and opposite to the fuel pump. The failure in the bearing was caused due to excessive stresses on the cage resulting from misalignment of the bearing on the gear shaft. Progressive failure in the ball bearing had also resulted in {{a chain of events}} in the transmission system along and in the vicinity of O 7 axis. The failure of the cage in the bearing by fatigue resulted in non-uniform rotation and vibration in the O 7 axis. This would have resulted in fretting wear on the mating splines of the <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> and the gear shaft. Also, the failure of the bearing had resulted in non-uniform meshing of the gears {{on either side of the}} O 7 axis, i. e., O 6 and O 8 axes leading to fatigue failure in these gears. Once a few teeth of the gears have failed by fatigue, further damages were caused by impact. The other damages seen on various components of EAGB are secondary in nature.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 157 - 172 Over {{the last}} 50 years {{industrial}} gas turbines have advanced significantly. Horsepower has increased 200 percent (and even higher) {{within the same}} envelope. Improvements in efficiencies and reliability (more operating time before overhauls) are being made more often. What took 15 years to change 30 years ago, now, in the last 15 years, happens in five years or less. There are constant demands for lighter weight, lower maintenance designs. Moreover, the operation engineers demand {{to be able to}} run six or eight years, and more, before an overhaul, not just three years. As advancements in the industrial gas turbine have occurred, so have advancements in the couplings that connect them to the driven equipment - a gear, compressor, pump, or generator. Most of the early industrial gas turbines that required flexible couplings pushed the state-of-the-art in gear couplings in the late 60 s and early 70 s. But because of high vibration at higher speeds, and unexpected and maintenance downtime of the equipment due to gear coupling technology, there started the industrial use of and rapid advancements in diaphragm and disc couplings for gas turbine use. In this tutorial is a comparison of the characteristics of the various types of gas turbine couplings: gear, diaphragm, and disc. (Rigid and <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> couplings are not covered.) The analysis of characteristics for these aforementioned different types of couplings will show that they do not react in the same way when they see the same torque and misalignment. Discussed will be the reliability of the various types, what kinds of safety margins are required, and what experience factors should be considered for various applications. Also discussed will, of course, be the conversion of gear couplings to disc or diaphragm types.

40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} the engine accessory gearbox of an aeroengine were forwarded to this laboratory for investigation. Examination revealed that there was fatigue failure in the bevel gear on O 11 axis bearing part No. 104. 06. 52. 008 and Sl. No. /set No. II 054027. Multiple fatigue cracks {{were found to have}} initiated at the concave side root fillet of one of the teeth. After initiation, these cracks have propagated progressively over a distance of about 45 mm in the hub before giving way to overload failure. The failure has resulted in dislodgement of a sector of the gear encompassing 5 teeth. Detailed examination revealed that the fatigue cracks were initiated during the start-up of the engine, that is, when the concave side of the teeth was the loading flank. It was also discovered that after initiation, these cracks have propagated only when the concave side of the teeth acted as the loading flank, that is, during the start-up of the engine. Similar fatigue cracks were seen in another tooth of the fractured segment. The fracture surface of the gear had distinctive bands that were resulted due to change in the crack propagation plane. The change in crack propagation plane generally occurs due to sudden change in the state of stress ahead of the crack tip such as during starting of the engine.

Examination revealed that there was fatigue failure in the bevel gear on O 11 axis bearing part No. 104. 06. 52. 008 and Sl. No. /set No.  054027. Multiple fatigue cracks were found to have initiated at the concave side root fillet of one of the teeth.

The change in crack propagation plane generally occurs due to sudden change in the state of stress ahead of the crack tip such as during starting of the engine. Examination revealed that there were about 175 bands on the fracture surface. Assuming that each band is associated with a starting cycle of the engine and the average duration of each starting cycle as 50 s, the crack propagation time, after initiation, is estimated to be approximately 2. 5 hr. Also, since the engine had a total of 288 starting cycles, it is, therefore, stated that the fatigue cracks were initiated in the gear after about 115 starting cycles after the engine was inducted in service. The primary failure in the engine accessory gearbox (EAGB) has been identified as the fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. Once the fracturing took place in this gear, the smooth running of the bevel gear pair in O 11 and O 1 axes was affected. This has led to resistance in power transmission from engine to the EAGB. During this time, the <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> on O 11 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 003) has failed by torsional overload. Hence, the failure in the <b>quill</b> <b>shaft</b> is secondary in nature and it occurred subsequent to the primary fatigue failure of the bevel gear on O 11 axis. The other damages seen on bevel gear on O 1 axis (part No. 104. 06. 52. 200) and the spur gear (part No. 104. 06. 52. 025) are also secondary in nature. Fatigue crack initiation regions in bevel gear on O 11 axis were largely damaged due to post fracture impact. However, the available fracture signatures and the location of fatigue crack origins did not suggest any specific abnormalities in the material which could be responsible for premature fatigue crack initiation. This was further confirmed through metallurgical examination of the gear wherein the material of construction was found to conform to specification with respect to composition, microstructure, surface hardening, hardness and case depth. Hence, the fatigue failure of the gear appears to be because of reasons other than metallurgical factors. From the laboratory examination and the analysis, {{it was not possible to}} identify the exact cause(s) for the premature fatigue crack initiation in the bevel gear in question. However, based on the failure evidences and the analysis, one or more of the following could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It is suggested that these aspects be examined thoroughly by the investigation committee/court of inquiry before the conclusions are drawn. (a) 	The fatigue crack has initiated and propagated only when the bevel gear on O 11 axis has acted as a driven gear, that is, during the engine start-up. Hence, it needs to be examined whether or not there was any situation during the service life of the engine wherein the torque during starting cycle exceeded the design value. Examination of the run-down time in the engine log may provide valuable information in this regard. It is important to note that once the cracks initiate, they continue to propagate even if the engine running conditions are normal thereafter. (b) 	The meshing between the bevel gears of O 11 and O 1 axes needs to be examined. In this regard, the contact patterns on the flanks of the failed gear need to be analyzed. In case of abnormal meshing, tooth bending stresses at the fillet may be unfavourable and this can promote premature fatigue crack initiation in the gear. (c) 	Examination revealed discrete tool marks on the root region of the failed bevel gear. Comparative study suggested that such tool marks were not present in the root region of the bevel gear of O 1 axis. Possible stress concentration effect because of the presence of rough machining marks leading to premature fatigue crack initiation also needs to be examined...|$|E
