50|$|The tower survived many hurricanes, {{but over}} time the tower {{developed}} a considerable tilt, which placement of granite blocks around the footings in 1896 was not sufficient to remedy. The beacon was automated in 1929 and discontinued in 1965, and the tower abandoned, though <b>quick</b> <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> were set on the structure to warn of the obstruction. The town of Berwick plans to move the tower to a park in the town, adjoining the Southwest Reef Light which has already been relocated there, but Ship Shoal Light remains in the gulf for now.|$|R

50|$|The Gibraltar North Mole Lighthouse is a black, {{octagonal}} tower {{constructed of}} cast-iron, with {{a height of}} 17 metres (56 feet). The skeletal tower has a central cylinder.

The Gibraltar North Mole Lighthouse is operational and is utilized as an aid to navigation, particularly in and near the port.

5|$|In 1901 the keeper's {{quarters}} {{went through}} major repairs, replacing the original slate tiles with terracotta ones. This was followed with {{the replacement of}} the steps handrail in 1903. A 1903 report criticised the light, saying that the red flashes were only visible for half the distance of the white ones, confusing navigators. This led to a recommendation to remove the red shades, resulting in a new characteristic of one white flash every minute, and later to upgrade the light to a <b>quick</b> group <b>flashing</b> dioptric <b>light.</b> Another report in 1912 stated that the station was in good condition, but criticised the low power of the light, and recommended withdrawing two of the keepers. However, all of these recommendations were not acted upon until 1 July 1922, when the apparatus was upgraded to a revolving Dalén light with an intensity of 20,000cd, and the manning reduced to two keepers.

40|$|Movie {{directors}} and producers worldwide, {{in their quest}} to narrate a good story that warrants repeated audience viewing, use many cinematic elements to intensify and clarify the viewing experience. One such element that directors manipulate is lighting. In this paper we examine one aspect of <b>lighting,</b> namely <b>flashing</b> <b>lights,</b> and its role as an intensifier of dramatic effects in film. We present an algorithm for robust extraction of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> and a simple mechanism to group detected <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> into <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> scenes and analyze the role of these segments in story narration. In addition, we demonstrate how <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> detection can improve the performance of shot-based video segmentation. Experiments on a number of video sequences extracted from real movies yields good results. Our technique detects 90. 4 % of <b>flashing</b> <b>lights.</b> The detected <b>flashing</b> <b>lights</b> correctly eliminates 92. 7 % of false cuts in these sequences. In addition, data support is compiled to demonstrate the association between <b>flashing</b> <b>light</b> scenes and certain dramatic intensification events such as supernatural power, crisis or excitement. <br /...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a new way}} to {{fabricate}} nanoporous TiO 2 photoanode by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> is demonstrated. TiO 2 nanoparticles are sintered on FTO glass by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> irradiation at room temperature in ambient condition, which is dramatically simple, ultrahigh speed and one-shot large area fabrication process compared to a conventional high temperature (120 °C) thermal sintering process. The effect of the <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> conditions (<b>flash</b> <b>light</b> energy, pulse numbers and pulse duration) on the nanostructures of sintered TiO 2 layer, was studied and discussed using several microscopic and spectroscopic characterization techniques such as SEM, FT-IR, XRD and XPS. The sintered TiO 2 photoanodes by <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> were used in DSSC and its performance were compared with that of DSSC fabricated by conventional thermal sintering process. It was found that a <b>flash</b> <b>light</b> sintered TiO 2 photoanode has efficiency which {{is similar to that of}} the thermal sintered photoanode.
