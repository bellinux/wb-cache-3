40|$|Capillary zone {{electrophoresis}} (CZE) {{was investigated}} in non-aqueous media. Efficient, rapid and versatile electrophoretic conditions were obtained with 20 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile-methanol-acetic acid (49 : 50 : 1). Using this non-aqueous medium, the baseline separation of nine morphine analogues, eleven antihistamines, eleven antipsychotics and ten stimulants could each be achieved in 6 min. The migration order observed {{was very different from}} one expected for an aqueous medium. The migration time repeatability for individual components was between 0. 8 and 3. 7 % R. S. D. The migration time-normalized peak area had a poor precision; however, with one of the components as an internal reference, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>repeatability</b> could be improved to between 2. 2 and 9. 1 % R. S. D. The precision data appeared to be instrument dependent, as excellent results could be obtained from an instrument with better evaporation and temperature control. Alternatively, much improved speed, efficiency and precision were also achieved with tetra-n-butylammonium tetrafluoroborate as the electrolyte, albeit with reduced selectivity. The effects of the electrolyte, non-aqueous medium and applied voltage on the separation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{off-line}} {{solid phase}} extraction-large volume injection-gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (SPE-LVI-GC-FID) method, {{based on the}} use of silver silica gel and low solvent consumption, was developed for mineral oil saturated hydrocarbon (MOSH) and mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbon (MOAH) determination in cardboard and dried foods packaged in cardboard. The SPE method was vali- dated using LVI with a conventional on-column injector and the retention gap technique (which allowed to inject up to 50 L of the sample). Detector response was linear over all the concentration range tested (0. 5 – 250 g/mL), recoveries were practically <b>quantitative,</b> <b>repeatability</b> was good (coefficients of varia- tion lower than 7 %) and limit of quantification adequate to quantify the envisioned limit of 0. 15 mg/kg proposed in Germany for MOAH analysis in food samples packaged in recycled cardboard. Rapid heating of the GC oven allowed to increase sample throughput (3 – 4 samples per hour) and to enhance sensitivity. The proposed method was used for MOSH and MOAH determination in selected food samples usually commercialised in cardboard packaging. The most contaminated was a tea sample (102. 2 and 7. 9 mg/kg of MOSH and MOAH below n-C 25, respectively), followed by a rice and a sugar powder sample, all packaged in recycled cardboa...|$|E
40|$|This work {{suggests}} an HPLC method for {{qualitative and quantitative}} determination of N-epsilon(2 -amino- 2 -carboxyethyl) -L-lysine (LAL). LAL was released from total hydrolysates of various proteins of animal origin and derivatized with dansyl chloride, The performance of two different columns, Spherisorb 3 S TG and mu-Bondapack C- 18, was compared; better resolution and quantitative response were obtained with the former. The mobile phase {{was a mixture of}} 0. 01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) and acetonitrile. Linear response and <b>quantitative</b> <b>repeatability</b> were tested for both detectors used (UV-Vis set at 254 nm; fluorimetric set at lambda(ex(max)) = 360 nm and lambda(em(max)) = 525 nm). For LAL standard the minimum detectable amount was 0. 05 ng, whereas for LAL in actual samples the amount was 0. 5 ng (40 mu g/g of analyzed proteins). Good analytical repeatability was obtained, resulting in CV% of 4. 7 and 3. 8 for UV and fluorimetric detectors, respectively. LAL recovery was determined using both detectors; the values obtained were 94 % (fluorimetric) and 92 % (UV). Greater noise levels were observed with the fluorimetric detector and its higher sensitivity could not, therefore, be fully utilized, The highest amounts of LAL were found in the casein (2816 mu g/g) and cooked albumin (615 mu g/g) samples...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To develop {{methods for}} {{optimization}} of diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) in the abdomen and pelvis on 1. 5 T MR scanners from three manufacturers and assess repeatability of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) estimates in a temperature-controlled phantom and abdominal and pelvic organs in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Geometric distortion, ghosting, fat suppression, and repeatability and homogeneity of ADC estimates were assessed using phantoms and volunteers. Healthy volunteers (ten per scanner) were each scanned twice {{on the same}} scanner. One volunteer traveled to all three institutions {{in order to provide}} images for qualitative comparison. The common volunteer was excluded from quantitative analysis of the data from scanners 2 and 3 in order to ensure statistical independence, giving n = 10 on scanner 1 and n = 9 on scanners 2 and 3 for <b>quantitative</b> analysis. <b>Repeatability</b> and interscanner variation of ADC estimates in kidneys, liver, spleen, and uterus were assessed using within-patient coefficient of variation (wCV) and Kruskal-Wallis tests, respectively. RESULTS: The coefficient of variation of ADC estimates in the temperature-controlled phantom was 1 %- 4 % for all scanners. Images of healthy volunteers from all scanners showed homogeneous fat suppression and no marked ghosting or geometric distortion. The wCV of ADC estimates was 2 %- 4 % for kidneys, 3 %- 7 % for liver, 6 %- 9 % for spleen, and 7 %- 10 % for uterus. ADC estimates in kidneys, spleen, and uterus showed no significant difference between scanners but a significant difference was observed in liver (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: DW-MRI protocols can be optimized using simple phantom measurements to produce good quality images in the abdomen and pelvis at 1. 5 T with repeatable quantitative measurements in a multicenter study...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To prospectively {{determine}} the repeatability of functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging brain activation tasks {{in a group}} of healthy older male volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Local research ethics committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Sixteen men {{with a mean age of}} 69 years +/- 3 (standard deviation) performed finger-tapping and N-back (number of screens back) working-memory tasks. Each subject underwent MR imaging three times in weekly intervals. Within-subject task repeatability was analyzed in terms of the number of voxels classified as activated (activation extent), the mean activation amplitude, and (for finger tapping) the center of the mass of the activated region. A repeatability index was calculated to compare test-retest repeatability between subjects and between functional MR imaging tasks. Within-session, between-session, and between-subject variability was assessed by using analysis of variance testing of activation amplitude and extent. RESULTS: Nine of the 16 subjects generated useful data at all three MR imaging-functional task sessions. At single-subject, single-session analysis, cortical activation was identified in most subjects and at most sessions. The centers of the masses of motor cortex activation were highly reproducible (within 3 mm). Patterns of activation were qualitatively repeatable, but there was substantial variability in the amplitudes and extents of activated regions. Within-session coefficients of variation (CVs) for left- versus right-hand and right- versus left-hand finger tapping were, respectively, 65 % and 43 % for activation amplitude and 75 % and 121 % for activation extent. The between-session CVs for activation amplitude were similar to the within-session values, whereas between-session CVs for activation extent were much greater than within-session values, up to 206 %. CONCLUSION: The generally poor <b>quantitative</b> task <b>repeatability</b> highlights the need for further methodologic developments before much reliance can be placed on functional MR imaging results of single-session experiments...|$|R
40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} influence of sample collection for two different collection methods on THC concentrations and to compare THC concentrations collected by both methods. A total of 136 pairs of oral fluid samples from subjects who had recently smoked Cannabis were obtained by the non-acidic Statsure oral fluid collection device and by ordinary spit tubes. Oral fluid was analysed for THC by LC–MS/MS. Bland–Altman plots were used for the <b>quantitative</b> analysis of <b>repeatability,</b> whereas Cohen's kappa was used for qualitative analysis to determine the consistency of the results with regard to the Belgian legal limit. Repeatability of both sampling methods was very low. The Statsure device had a better rate of agreement when compared with the Belgian legal limit than the spitting method. THC concentrations of samples collected by spit tubes were on average a factor 5. 9 higher than the corresponding concentrations in samples collected by the Statsure device. The repeatability of both the Statsure collection method and the ordinary spit tubes was low when applied to subjects who had consumed Cannabis very recently. Furthermore, THC concentrations were higher in samples obtained by spitting than samples collected with Statsure. These results may have implications for confirmation analysis in oral fluid, when applied for legal purposes. (Author/publisher...|$|R

40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) airway microbiome is complex; polymicrobial infections are common, {{and the presence}} of fastidious bacteria including anaerobes make culture-based diagnosis challenging. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) offers a cultureindependent method for bacterial quantification that may improve diagnosis of CF airway infections; however, the reliability of qPCR applied to CF airway specimens is unknown. We sought to determine the reliability of nine specific bacterial qPCR assays (total bacteria, three typical CF pathogens, and five anaerobes) applied to CF airway specimens. Airway and salivary specimens from clinically stable pediatric CF subjects were collected. <b>Quantitative</b> PCR assay <b>repeatability</b> was determined using triplicate reactions. Split-sample measurements were performed to measure variability introduced by DNA extraction. Results from qPCR were compared to standard microbial culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae, common pathogens in CF. We obtained 84 sputa, 47 oropharyngeal and 27 salivary specimens from 16 pediatric subjects with CF. Quantitative PCR detected bacterial DNA in over 97 % of specimens. All qPCR assays were highly reproducible at quantities $ 10 2 rRNA gene copies/reaction with coefficient of variation less than 20 % for over 99 % of samples. There was also excellent agreement between samples processed in duplicate. Anaerobic bacteria were highly prevalent and were detected in mean quantities similar to that of typical CF pathogens. Compared to a composite gold standard, qPCR and culture had variable sensitivities for detection of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and H. influenzae from C...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{generating}} controlled atmospheres of hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) in an 8 m 3 exposure chamber was developed. The permeation principle {{was used for}} gaseous HHPA generation. HHPA concentration was monitored by sampling on XAD- 2 tubes and by a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer using the partial least-square <b>quantitative</b> method. The <b>repeatability</b> of the FTIR was 5 %, the reproducibility 12 %, and the limit of detection 10 micrograms/m 3. A bubbler method determined the sum of HHPA and HHP acid by using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detection after derivatization with methanol/boron trifluoride. The precision of the work-up procedure was 3 % and the recovery was 94 % at 300 ng sampled amount of HHPA. The limit of detection was 10 ng HHPA. The variation in the permeation rate was 3 % over 3 days. Different concentrations in the exposure chamber were generated by changing {{the temperature of the}} permeation tubes. The generated HHPA concentration range, at human exposure, was 3 - 90 micrograms/m 3. The concentration at one temperature was reproducible even after major changes in the temperature. The coefficient of variation (CV) of six samples from different places in the breathing zone was 3 %. The variation in the concentration, during an 8 -hour human exposure at 10 micrograms/m 3, was 3 %. Time-weighted averages (8 hour) for human exposures of 10 micrograms/m 3 (CV = 15 %; n = 6); 37 micrograms/m 3 (CV = 5 %; n = 5); and 81 micrograms/m 3 (CV = 6 %; n = 9) were obtained at intended concentrations of 10 micrograms/m 3, 40 micrograms/m 3, and 80 micrograms/m 3. The loss of HHPA in the exposure chamber was 54 % (CV = 17 %). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology-based drug {{delivery}} systems are in constant development and, therefore, {{it is of}} great importance to have rapid, efficient and accurate analytical methodology to quantify the encapsulated drugs. Here, simple and fast methods, by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) and UV spectrophotometry, were developed and validated for the determination of methotrexate (MTX) in pH-sensitive chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NPs). NPs were prepared using a modified ionotropic complexation process, in which was included a surfactant derived from Nα,Nε-dioctanoyl lysine with an inorganic sodium counterion. The RP-LC method was carried out on a Waters XBridgeTM C 18 column (250 mm x 4. 6 mm I. D., 5 μm), with mobile phase consisted of potassium phosphate buffer (0. 05 M, pH 3. 2) : acetonitrile (86 : 14, v/v), and UV detection set at 303 nm. The analyses of MTX content by the UV method were also accomplished at 303 nm, using 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide as diluent. The measurements were linearly correlated with concentration for both methods in the 1 - 30 μg/mL range (r > 0. 9999). The specificity tests showed {{that there was no}} interference of the NP components on the <b>quantitative</b> analyses. Precision (<b>repeatability</b> and intermediate precision) was demonstrated by a relative standard deviation lower than 1. 5 %, whereas the accuracy was assessed by the recovery of MTX from sample matrices, given mean value of ~ 99 %. The proposed methods were applied for the analyses of MTX in different batches of NPs, and the results showed non-significant differences (p > 0. 05) between the values obtained with both methodologies. Moreover, the RP-LC method was successfully used to determine the drug entrapment efficiency, and to quantify MTX during in vitro release assays and photolytic degradation studies. In conclusion, the validated methods are suitable to assay MTX in pH-sensitive CS-NPs without any interference from the polymer or surfactant...|$|R
