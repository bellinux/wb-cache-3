A second interactive game, QI: Strictly Come Duncing followed on the 26November 2007, from Warner's Music division. Both games feature Fry asking questions, and then explaining the answers in full QI-mode.|$|E

It (the story) first appeared some twenty {{years ago in a}} newspaper article, to which my father immediately wrote a rebuttal. This was obviously ferreted out by some BBC researcher. It may be <b>quite</b> <b>interesting,</b> but in this case, it just isn't true.|$|E

[...] He stated that while the band was {{doing a lot of}} experimenting, something was still missing, but continued that newcomers would probably find the album <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> and original. [...] Trey Spencer of Sputnik Music described the album as a blend of elements from many of their previous albums, and also said {{it would be a good}} first album for new listeners to buy.|$|E
500|$|QI (short for <b>Quite</b> <b>Interesting)</b> is a BBC comedy panel game {{television}} show {{that began in}} 2003. It was created by John Lloyd, and was hosted by Stephen Fry {{until the end of}} Series 13 [...] after which Sandi Toksvig took over, and features permanent panellist Alan Davies. Each series covers topics that begin with a different letter of the alphabet; for example, the first series covered topics whose word began with [...] "A". Thus it is referred to as [...] "Series A" [...] instead of [...] "Series One".|$|E
500|$|All {{members of}} the band were {{involved}} in the writing of songs, and there may have been more than one person's set of lyrics appearing in a single release. Powell said that [...] "It's <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> to have two people's viewpoints within the same song. I'm not sure how many bands actually do that. In most bands, the guitarist writes the music and the singer writes the lyrics. We tend to share things out more evenly." [...] He also criticised the attachment of an indie pop label to the band, saying [...] "We're seen as one of the indie bands. But we've always just tried to make pop music. Even if it is pop music with a hard edge and quite a twisted little view of life. We've always seen ourselves as a little bigger than an indie band." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Gill of The Independent {{gave the}} album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Williams' albums have {{increasingly}} come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them {{less and less}} appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that [...] "Reality Killed the Video Star is littered with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge {{on the premise that}} someone or something else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." [...] Swash said that [...] "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> when he moves off the topic of himself." [...] Swash concluded that the album swings between [...] "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" [...] and [...] "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".|$|E
2500|$|QIs second book, The Book of Animal Ignorance, was {{released}} in the UK (in the same hardback format) by Faber & Faber on 4 October 2007. (...)

Andrew Siers at MichaelDVD {{described it as}} [...] "mainly a collection of the band's greatest hits in video clip form, but in between songs {{it is also a}} documentary.

2500|$|In 2003, Fry began hosting QI (<b>Quite</b> <b>Interesting),</b> {{a comedy}} panel game {{television}} quiz show. QI was created and co-produced by John Lloyd, and features permanent panellist Alan Davies. QI {{has the highest}} viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave (formerly UKTV G2). In 2006, Fry won the Rose d'Or award for [...] "Best Game Show Host" [...] {{for his work on}} the series. In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would retire as the host of QI after the [...] "M" [...] series.|$|E
2500|$|In total, {{since it}} was (re)discovered in 1964, {{according}} to Tica and Druzic (2006) the HBS theory [...] "has been tested 60 times in 98 countries in time series or panel analyses and in 142 countries in cross-country analyses. In these analyzed estimates, country specific HBS coefficients have been estimated 166 times in total, and at least once for 65 different countries". Also, one should have in mind {{that a lot of}} papers have been published since then. Bahmani-Oskooee and Abm (2005) and Egert, Halpern and McDonald (2006) also provide <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> surveys of empirical evidence on BS effect.|$|E
2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{justified}} {{his interest}} in the McCarthy novel. [...] "There's something about it– there were echoes of it in No Country for Old Men that were <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> for us", he said, [...] "because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story. Because you only saw this person in this movie making things and doing things in order to survive and to make this journey, {{and the fact that you}} were thrown back on that, as opposed to any dialogue, was interesting to us." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Scott Osborne scored it 6.4 out of 10, {{criticizing the}} low {{graphical}} and sound quality, and writing [...] "Dark Fall breaks no new ground and puts {{too much emphasis}} on puzzles, but its meticulously detailed world and paranormal detective story generally keep things entertaining." [...] Of the general gameplay, he wrote, [...] "the game puts {{too much emphasis on}} puzzle solving, and some of the puzzles, while <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> because of their intricate detail and diversity, can be too obscure and perplexing. It's also a shame that the game so often relies on the old adventure-game cliché of telling its story through clues offered by written materials." ...|$|E
2500|$|Any {{subgroup}} {{of a free}} group is free. This result is <b>quite</b> <b>interesting,</b> because the statement is purely algebraic yet the simplest known proof is topological. Namely, any free group G may be realized as the fundamental group of a graph X. The main theorem on covering spaces tells us that every subgroup H of G is the fundamental group of some covering space Y of X; but every such Y is again a graph. Therefore, its fundamental group H is free. On the other hand, this type of application is also handled more simply {{by the use of}} covering morphisms of groupoids, and that technique has yielded subgroup theorems not yet proved by methods of algebraic topology. (See the book by Higgins listed under groupoids.) ...|$|E

Kenny replied: [...] "Not yet, but there's definitely the possibility in the future. I'm sure she'll be in soon". Kenny also stated that her character is to be heavily involved with her on-screen aunt Shirley. She added: [...] "The pair recognise their similarities and that brings a warmth to their relationship. At first, though, they really clash and Heather thinks that Zsa Zsa's complete trouble - which she is! Elsewhere on the Square, there's a lot of story between the other young people on the Square. Zsa Zsa definitely gets stuck in". Kenny also said about Zsa Zsa's second side: [...] "It's <b>quite</b> <b>interesting</b> because I know when Zsa Zsa comes in, people will just hate her because she's a real bitch. That's quite intimidating {{because there are so}} many good bitches on the show - Janine being the queen of them all. Zsa Zsa's a little different in the way she looks and talks, though. So we've definitely tried to make her different".|$|E
2500|$|Writer {{and former}} BBC {{producer}} John Lloyd devised {{the format of}} the show, and it is produced by <b>Quite</b> <b>Interesting</b> Limited, an organisation set up by Lloyd. QI was originally seen as being an [...] "Annotated Encyclopædia Britannica... the world's first non-boring encyclopaedia." [...] As a panel game, it was conceived as a radio show, with Lloyd as chairman. While developing the show with Peter Fincham and Alan Yentob, Lloyd decided that it would work better on television. The three pitched it to Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One at the time. Heggessey passed on the format, opting to commission a similar panel game called Class War (which was never made). When Fincham became controller of BBC One, Lloyd pitched it to him, only to be turned down by his former collaborator. Eventually, he pitched it to Jane Root, then controller of BBC Two, who agreed to develop it. When it was decided that the show would air on television, Michael Palin was offered the job of chairman with Fry and Davies as captains of the [...] "cleverclogs" [...] and [...] "dunderheads" [...] teams, respectively. However, when Palin decided not to take the job, the producers opted to change the format; Fry became the host, with Davies as the only regular panelist. Root commissioned a pilot and a further 16episodes after that, although budget limitations reduced the first series to 12episodes.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{narrative}} {{history has}} survived {{for most of}} the Hellenistic world, [...] at least of the kings and the wars; this is lacking for India. The main Greco-Roman source on the Indo-Greeks is Justin, who wrote an anthology drawn from the Roman [...] historian Pompeius Trogus, who in turn wrote, from Greek sources, at the time of Augustus Caesar. Justin tells the parts of Trogus' history he finds particularly interesting at some length; he connects them by short and simplified summaries {{of the rest of the}} material. In the process he has left 85% to 90% of Trogus out; and his summaries are held together by phrases like [...] "meanwhile" [...] (eodem tempore) and [...] "thereafter" [...] (deinde), which he uses very loosely. Where Justin covers periods for which there are other and better sources, he has occasionally made provable mistakes. As Tarn and Develin both point out, Justin is not trying to write history in our sense of the word; he is collecting instructive moral anecdotes. Justin does find the customs and growth of the Parthians, which were covered in Trogus' 41st book, <b>quite</b> <b>interesting,</b> and discusses them at length; in the process, he mentions four of the kings of Bactria and one Greek king of India, getting the names of two of them wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Sonia Saraiya {{writing for}} Variety called the show [...] "a silly, {{lightweight}} half-hour, somewhere between horror thriller and teen soap" [...] and ultimately said [...] "The show never <b>quite</b> becomes <b>interesting</b> enough to transcend either the dully predictable beats of zombie horror or the plodding angst of young adulthood." ...|$|R
