40|$|ICAO Annex 14, chapter 9. 4, sets as a {{worldwide}} standard <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> airport wildlife hazards by ‘competent’ airport personnel. Unfortunately ICAO provides no guidance {{as to what}} constitutes competence or properly trained personnel. The International Birdstrike Committee sought to develop a ‘best practice’ for <b>the</b> training <b>of</b> airport wildlife control personnel by forming a Working Group to develop a training recommendation. Surprisingly the Working Group found almost no state guidelines worldwide and little in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> informal training guidelines among ICAO states reviewed. Using input from various national regulatory agencies, informal programs and the working group’s wildlife control experience, a ‘best practice’ was developed and forwarded to IBSC for approval. This training guideline addresses not only <b>the</b> <b>qualifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trainers,</b> but also <b>the</b> subject matter to be covered and <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> recurrent/requalification training of airport wildlife control personnel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the nutritional knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of male and female bodybuilding trainers in Ahwaz, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 7 major cities of Iran. KAP questionnaires which contained information about nutrients, food groups, using of supplements and ergogenic aids, were completed by trainers. Sixty three certified male bodybuilding trainers (37. 9 ± 2. 7 y) and 30 certified female trainers (37. 3 ± 8. 1 y) were recruited from all clubs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male and 47 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female <b>trainers</b> have prescribed diet program for their trainees (P< 0. 001) and it showed that there was a significant (P< 0. 001) relationship between their diet prescription and their educational degrees. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female <b>trainers</b> neither use nor advise anabolic hormones such as Nandrolon; however 62 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male <b>trainers</b> have advised hormones to their trainees while only 50 % of them use hormones themselves. 96. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> did not know that minerals and 88. 2 % did not know water are essential nutrients; and more than 90 % did not realize that fat and sugars are as food groups. The training courses and educational levels of trainers are positively related to their practices.
