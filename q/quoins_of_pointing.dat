50|$|Auberge d'Auvergne {{was built}} in the Mannerist style, typical of its {{architect}} Girolamo Cassar.

Another one-story addition was added around 1950.|$|R
50|$|The east {{elevation}} of the main range is partially obscured {{by the addition of}} Mansion Cottage at the north end and the old dairy at the south end.

50|$|The {{main block}} {{of the house}} was built around 1855. It is 1.5 stories with well-constructed walls of randomly-coursed fieldstone, with corner <b>quoins</b> <b>of</b> {{limestone}}. Arches above the windows are limestone or brick. The roof is rather low-pitched, with a shed-roofed dormer - a more modern design than the original roof. In the living room is a large stone oven which may be original to the house.|$|R

50|$|The 11th floor sill {{course is}} a {{continuous}} suppressed cornice of modest projection. From this level to the 12th floor sill level, the wall treatment is essentially a repetition of the treatment between the sill levels of the 3rd and 4th floor, but with a wide, prominently projecting, and continuous sill cornice. At the 12th floor, the wall is red face brick, with <b>quoins</b> <b>of</b> architectural terracotta {{at the corners of}} the building.|$|R
50|$|The Stable Block at Slebech Park is Grade II listed. A {{rectangular}} block 40m by 60m {{built of}} local rubble stone masonry with <b>quoins</b> <b>of</b> limestone. An unusual feature is that crenellated parapets hide slate roofs. The stables have an octagonal clock-tower with a weathervane. The stable block loft {{is also an}} important breeding roost for the rare Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and numbers have been recorded at Slebech since 1983.|$|R

The viaduct carried a double track railway, and had a walkway on either side for pedestrians.|$|R
50|$|The Roman ruins {{consist of}} an amphitheatre (now almost entirely demolished, but better {{preserved}} in the 18th century), a theatre in opus reticulatum, and an aqueduct in opus reticulatum, the <b>quoins</b> <b>of</b> which are of various colours arranged in patterns to produce a decorative effect. There are also a statue commonly called of Sepeone (Scipio), from the Late Empire age, {{and the remains of}} a Capitolium, built in Italic-Etruscan style after 191 BC, near the Appian Way.|$|R
50|$|St Mary's Church {{has been}} a place of Christian worship for over 1000 years. Built during Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods, it is {{probably}} {{on the site of}} an even earlier timber church. There are many hints of its past in its structure. These include the south-west <b>quoin</b> <b>of</b> the nave, and a single splay window high on the south wall with traces of Roman brick as well as arches that are presumed to pre-date 1066.|$|R
50|$|Believed to {{have been}} built around 1840 as a parsonage, it is a hipped-roofed Federal style one-story {{building}} with a raised basement giving {{the effect of a}} ground floor. The 18 by 24 ft main block is sided in cobblestone applied more carefully than that on the church. On the east and west sides of the ground level the field cobbles are set in the Gaines Pattern, in which each is part of a small hexagonal box. <b>Quoins</b> <b>of</b> Medina sandstone mark the corners.|$|R
50|$|In 1892 {{the line}} was {{converted}} to quadruple track and a second bridge was built alongside the upstream side of the original and connected to it by girders and brick bridgelets. The second bridge was built to the same profile and dimensions as the original but it lacks the stone <b>quoins</b> <b>of</b> the original and the plain uncut bricks make a jagged pattern where they meet {{the faces of the}} bridge. The second bridge is also narrower, having been built to carry a pair of standard gauge tracks.|$|R

5000|$|Built during Anglo-Saxon {{and early}} Norman periods, the {{structure}} has been conjectured by the Victoria County History's architectural analysis {{to have been}} a redevelopment of an Anglo-Saxon church: [...] Roman bricks in considerable quantities in Fetcham Church, remains of Anglo-Saxon architecture in the church......quoins and dressings of thin red bricks, no doubt Roman, set in wide mortar joints. [...] Traces of its long past exist in many parts of its structure. These include the south-west <b>quoin</b> <b>of</b> the nave, and a single splay window high on the south wall with traces of Roman brick, as well as arches which fit with the architecture prevailing before the Norman Conquest of 1066.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} the building are some Anglo-Saxon [...] "long-and-short" [...] stonework, visible externally at the southeast and southwest corners (<b>quoins)</b> <b>of</b> the nave. The church also has several Romanesque details dating from the Norman era, including a Priest's Door ("uncommonly ornate", according to Nikolaus Pevsner) with a finely carved tympanum; the empty circular niche in the tympanum {{is said to have}} held a relic; the birds in roundels to either side are probably eagles, as one is legendarily supposed to have sheltered Medard from the rain https://web.archive.org/web/20081017040859/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintm23.htm. Also Norman are the plain, undecorated arch into the tower, and the north door (late 12th century).|$|R

It has <b>quoins</b> made <b>of</b> the same rusticated granite stone. Its front entrance {{is flanked by}} pilasters.|$|R
6000|$|The plain, I have said, is {{everywhere}} broken by piles of stone forming knobby hills. Leaving the outlined sphinx to the right, we ascended a second block, which rises {{on the west}} of the chief watercourse, further down than the [...] "Owl's Hill." [...] This Tell el-Ahmar ("Red Hill"), alias Ja'dat Badá (the [...] "Curved Hill of Bada'"), is a <b>quoin</b> <b>of</b> grey granite bluff to the south-west. The north-eastern flank shows the normal revetment of ruddy and black heat-altered grit, which gives a red back to the pale-sided, drab-coloured heap. Over the easy ascent is run a zigzag path; half-way, up it passes piles of stone that denote building, and it abuts at the summit upon one of those [...] "look-outs" [...] which are essentially Arab.|$|R
