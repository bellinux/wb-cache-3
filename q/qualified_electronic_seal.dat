40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification Device) <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> based container management system and method. The management {{system comprises an}} RFID <b>electronic</b> <b>seal,</b> sensing equipment and a control device, wherein the control device is used for giving a sealing or opening command to the RFID <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> and acquiring the state information of a container from the sensing equipment; the RFID <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> is used for sealing or opening the container according to the command given by the control device and returning the state information of the container to the control device; the RFID <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> comprises a first communication module and a first power supply unit; the sensing equipment is used for monitoring the state information of the container and returning the state information to the control device according to a request of the control device; the sensing equipment comprises a second communication module and a second power supply unit; and the RFID <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> and the sensing equipment automatically enter a dormant state after the operation is finished each time. The technical scheme can provide a low-power consumption <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> for a long-distance transportation and also provide low-power consumption sensing equipment. 本发明涉及一种基于RFID电子封条的集装箱管理系统和方法，该管理系统包括RFID电子封条、传感设备、控制装置；控制装置用于向RFID电子封条下达密封或开启指令、向传感设备获取集装箱的状态信息；RFID电子封条用于依据控制装置下达的命令密封或开启集装箱并返回集装箱的状态信息至控制装置；RFID电子封条包括第一通信模块、第一电源供应单元；传感设备用于监控集装箱的状态信息并依据控制装置的请求返回状态信息至控制装置；传感设备包括第二通信模块、第二电源供应单元；RFID电子封条和所述传感设备每次完成操作后自动进入休眠状态。本发明的技术方案可提供适于长距离运输的低功耗的电子封条；还可提供低功耗的传感设备。Department of Industrial and Systems EngineeringInventor name used in this publication: Guo ShaoqiangTitle in Traditional Chinese: 一種基於RFID電子封條的集裝箱管理系統和方法Chin...|$|R

40|$|This joint U. S. -German {{evaluation}} of seals developed by {{each other is}} part of the U. S. -German bilateral exchange program. The purpose was to arrive at an independent {{evaluation of}} both <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> systems and then jointly define the characteristics a next generation <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> should possess. The independent evaluations are summarized in this document. Many of the features jointly agreed upon as desirable for a state-of-the art <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> are contained in the latest version of the German developed VACOSS 3 system. This system has drawn on the U. S. and German development and evaluation activities in arriving at its present status. The U. S. development activity was completed in 1980 whereas the VACOSS 3 continued incorporating new ideas in early 1983. The joint testing was thus not only for comparison purposes, but also to generally aid in future <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> development. Operational testing of both seals revealed a need for improved procedures. Both seals generally met the specified environmental operating conditions. Vulnerability testing identified the ability to predict the code sequences in the older U. S. seal and revealed physical vulnerabilities of the VACOSS 3 system which are being corrected. Our conclusion is that the VACOSS 3 represents the most attractive <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> developed to date. It is therefore recommended that the VACOSS 3 be used in the first Agency <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> safeguards applications...|$|R

5000|$|Electronic {{signatures}} may {{be created}} with increasing levels of security, with each having {{its own set}} of requirements and means of creation on various levels that prove the validity of the signature. To provide an even stronger probative value than the above described advanced electronic signature, some countries like the European Union or Switzerland introduced the <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> signature. It is difficult to challenge the authorship of a statement signed with a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> signature - the statement is non-reputable.

50|$|While an {{advanced}} electronic signature is legally binding under eIDAS, a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> signature which has been created by a qualified trust service provider carries a higher probative value when used as evidence in court.

EU member states are obligated to accept <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> signatures that have been created with qualified certificate from other Member states as valid.

It helps integrate the information systems which are used in all administrative levels. It is reached a satisfactory level of security by a <b>qualified</b> <b>electronic</b> signature. The electronic signature provides data protection and allows the wide use of e-Services. A form of interoperability is carried out by centralizedly stored registers which provide broad overall information for each management level.
