When it is expressed in SI units, {{it is one of}} the smallest constants used in physics.

50|$|The {{failure of}} {{classical}} mechanics applied to molecular, atomic, and nuclear systems and smaller induced {{the need for}} a new mechanics: quantum mechanics. The mathematical formulation was led by De Broglie, Bohr, Schrödinger, Pauli, and Heisenberg, and others, around the mid-1920s, and at that time was analogous to that of classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation and the Heisenberg picture resemble the classical equations of motion in the limit of large quantum numbers and as the reduced Planck constant , the <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> tends to zero. This is the correspondence principle. At this point, special relativity was not fully combined with quantum mechanics, so the Schrödinger and Heisenberg formulations, as originally proposed, could not be used in situations where the particles travel near the speed of light, or when the number of each type of particle changes (this happens in real particle interactions; the numerous forms of particle decays, annihilation, matter creation, pair production, and so on).|$|E

This definition {{can be applied to}} the organization of any complex system. Systems self-organize to decrease the average action per element per unit motion. This lowest action state is the attractor for the continuous self-organization and evolution of a dynamical complex system. Constraints increase this average action and constraint minimization by the elements is a basic mechanism for <b>action</b> minimization.

5000|$|In his {{original}} {{lecture on the}} topic, Bohr pointed out that just as the finitude {{of the speed of}} light implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between space and time (relativity), the finitude of the <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> implies the impossibility of a sharp separation between the behavior of a system and its interaction with the measuring instruments and leads to the well known difficulties with the concept of 'state' in quantum theory; the notion of complementarity is intended to symbolize this new situation in epistemology created by quantum theory. Some people consider it a philosophical adjunct to quantum mechanics, while others consider it to be a discovery that {{is as important as the}} formal aspects of quantum theory. Examples of the latter include Leon Rosenfeld, who claimed that [...] "Complementarity is not a philosophical superstructure invented by Bohr to be placed as a decoration on top of the quantal formalism, it is the bedrock of the quantal description.", and John Wheeler, who opined that [...] "Bohr's principle of complementarity is the most revolutionary scientific concept of this century and the heart of his fifty-year search for the full significance of the quantum idea." ...|$|E
50|$|Natural units {{began in}} 1881, when George Johnstone Stoney, noting that {{electric}} charge is quantized, derived units of length, time, and mass, now named Stoney units in his honor, by normalizing G, c, and the electron charge, e, to 1. In 1898, Max Planck discovered that action is quantized, and published the {{result in a}} paper presented to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in May 1899. At {{the end of the}} paper, Planck introduced, as a consequence of his discovery, the base units later named in his honor. The Planck units are based on the <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> now usually known as Planck's constant. Planck called the constant b in his paper, though h is now common. Planck underlined the universality of the new unit system, writing:Planck considered only the units based on the universal constants G, ħ, c, and kB to arrive at natural units for length, time, mass, and temperature. Planck did not adopt any electromagnetic units. However, since the non-rationalized gravitational constant, G, is set to 1, a natural extension of Planck units to a unit of electric charge is to also set the non-rationalized Coulomb constant, ke, to 1 as well. Another convention is to use the elementary charge as the basic unit of electric charge in Planck system. Such system is convenient for black hole physics. The two conventions for unit charge differ by a factor of the square root of the fine-structure constant. Planck's paper also gave numerical values for the base units that were close to modern values.|$|E

5000|$|The {{developments}} <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> formulation {{early this}} century has also led physicists {{to question the}} Newtonian concepts of physical objects, such as 'particle' and 'wave', which are basic ideas in all of classical physics. Subsequently, Heisenberg in his pioneering paper [...] developed a conceptual framework {{that in a way}} retained all the classical concepts, and plays a great role in the Copenhagen interpretation. This basic new step was to study the disturbance of observing instruments, and for this purpose, Heisenberg constructed the famous gedanken microscope experiment to measure very accurately the position of an electron. It was found that since the individual <b>quanta</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> {{must be taken into account}} in the measurement process, the irreducible disturbance rendered it impossible to assign simultaneously the precise values of position and momentum. Consequently, by considering the uncontrollable influence from the observation itself, the notion <b>of</b> particle into <b>quantum</b> mechanics was preserved, and the uncertainty principle was born.|$|R

40|$|There {{exists a}} {{paradigm}} in which Quantum Mechanics is an exclusively developed theory to explain phenomena on a microscopic scale. As the Planck's constant is extremely small, h∼ 10 ^- 34 J. s, and {{as in the}} relation of de Broglie the wavelength is inversely proportional to the momentum; for a mesoscopic or macroscopic object the Broglie wavelength is very small, and consequently the undulatory behavior of this object is undetectable. In this paper we show that with a particle oscillating around its classical trajectory, the action is an integer multiple of a <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> S = nh_o. The <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>action,</b> h_o, which plays a role equivalent to Planck's constant, is a free parameter that must be determined and depends on the physical system considered.
