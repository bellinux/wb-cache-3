5|$|Sloped, {{vertical}} or upside-down welding {{requires more}} operator skill, and often necessitates {{the use of}} an electrode that solidifies <b>quickly</b> to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more <b>quickly</b> than magnesium and less <b>quickly</b> than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it <b>quickly</b> forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army <b>quickly</b> {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached.

On the Byzantine right Vitalius was <b>quickly</b> victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted <b>quickly.</b> He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E

Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops.

5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier <b>quickly</b> {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs <b>quickly</b> reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E
