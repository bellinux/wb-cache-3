40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model which yields examples of stable vortices in a continuously stratified rotating fluid, thus providing {{a possible explanation}} of the observed longevity of oceanic eddies. The model is based on two assumptions. Firstly, the ocean comprises a thin upper (active) layer and a thick lower (passive) one, with large and small vertical gradients of density, respectively. Secondly, the Rossby number is small, justifying {{the use of the}} geostrophic and <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximations</b> for the active and passive layers (the two are treated differently because the vortex-induced displacement of the isopycnal surfaces is comparable to the depth of the active layer, but is much smaller than that of the passive one).

40|$|The surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) model {{describes}} {{the evolution of}} buoyancy at vertical boundaries {{in the limit of}} infinitesimal Rossby number. In this regime, the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximations</b> are expected to hold. Numerical simulation of the SQG model often generate small-scale vortices which may have Rossby numbers that approach unity and may be outside the range of SQG. In this thesis we investigate the evolution of a surface trapped elliptical vortex in both the SQG model and the non-hydrostatic Boussinesq primitive equations (PE) which are better able to describe a wider range of oceanic dynamics. Thus, in the PE, we can vary the Rossby number in order to understand how the surface trapped vortex breaks down at the smaller-scale during its evolution. For small Rossby number, we confirm that the PE match the SQG prediction very well. For larger Rossby number however, we find that the models do not agree and different dynamics begin emerging in the PE. In particular, we find that the thin filament instability in the surface buoyancy field, common to SQG, begins to stabilize as the Rossby number increases and thus the emergence of the secondary small-scale vortices is halted. The core of the vortex spreads out and becomes much more uniform for larger Rossby number. The energy spectrum of the surface trapped vortex steepens from a power law of - 5 / 3 to about - 3 and the divergent energy grows as the Rossby number approaches unity. The growing divergent energy is an indication that inertia-gravity waves are generated in the simulation and we do indeed observe these in the vertical velocity field. We conclude that when the Rossby number of the surface trapped elliptical vortex is at least 0. 05 new dynamics emerge and the PE must be used to attain an accurate description of the evolution of the flow...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{attractive}} {{ideas about the}} westward drift is wave propagation. Magnetostrophic wave (often called magnetic Rossby wave) generated by combined effect of Coriolis, Lorentz and/or gravitational forces has been {{considered to be a}} cause of the westward drift of the magnetic field (see, e.g., Finlay et al. 2010 for review). Yoshida and Hamano (1993), Hori et al. (2018), for example, examined the magnetostrophic waves in the framework of <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Yoshida and Hamano (1993) obtained the westward drifting field with phase velocity similar to the observed, which was excited by the oscillation of the mantle with respect to the core with heterogeneous topographic bottom boundary. To be noted is that they obtained the wave that was symmetric about the equator as expressed by sectorial harmonics. That is exactly the type of the observed field. This stems from the type of the toroidal field they assumed as the background. It was equatorially symmetric field. Interaction of the columnar flow, which is essentially symmetric type in the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation,</b> with the symmetric toroidal field induces equatorially symmetric poloidal field. Accordingly, the problem in their study is whether the toroidal field is equatorially symmetric or not. Hori et al. (2018) conducted geodynamo simulations and found the magnetostrophic waves that were compatible with those derived from <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> Unfortunately, however, their waves were of equatorially anti-symmetric type. This is due to the toroidal field in their simulation, which was anti-symmetric about the equator, although it is very usual in the geodynamo simulations (see, e.g., Christensen and Wicht 2009). Through interaction with anti-symmetric toroidal field, columnar flow induces anti-symmetric field.|$|E
40|$|In rapidly {{rotating}} convective stars, {{the effect}} of Coriolis forces is predominant and the dynamics of convective instabilities is fundamentally different from that in slowly rotating stars. Coriolis forces not only enforce two-dimensionality of the fluid motions driven by convective instabilities but also generate strong differential rotation even {{in the vicinity of}} the onset of the instabilities. This characteristic suggests a <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation</b> taking advantage of quasi two-dimensionality of the fluid motions. We investigate convective instabilities and differential rotation generated by the instabilities in rapidly rotating stars using a new <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation</b> incorporating full spherical geometry and the equation of mass conservation. We model a rapidly rotating stellar convection zone of inner radius r(i) and outer radius r(o) by a large-gap spherical annulus defined by s(i) <= s <= s(o) and -(r(o) (2) - s(2)) (1 / 2) <= z <= (r(o) (2) -s(2)) (1 / 2), where (s, phi, z) are cylindrical polar coordinates with the axis of rotation at s = 0 and r(i) = s(i) < s(o) approximate to r(o). In the limits si ! 0 and so ! ro, the corresponding spherical annulus represents a fully convective rapidly rotating star in the full sphere. For the purpose of comparison, fully three-dimensional solutions in spherical geometry are also calculated. It is demonstrated that the primary features of the convective instabilities in rapidly rotating spheres or spherical shells are quantitatively captured by large-gap spherical annuli using the new <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation,</b> providing an exciting opportunity to analyze and compute convective flows in rapidly rotating stars (very small Ekman numbers), which cannot be achieved by fully three-dimensional numerical simulations.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of space exploration makes planet dynamics {{become one of}} the most active research fields. Understanding the dynamics of the planets is very important for the astrophysics and geophysics. People want to know more detail process of the birth of the magnetic field, the dynamics of the fluid core and the atmosphere, so we can know the evolution of the solar system. In this paper we aimed at the convection and the different rotation in the planetary interior. Our works summarized as follows are based on the quasi-greostrophysic approximation model: 1. We model a rapidly rotating stellar convection zone by a large-gap spherical annulus using a two-dimensional <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation</b> incorporating full spherical geometry and the equation of mass conservation. It is demonstrated that the primary features of thermal instabilities in rapidly rotating spheres or sphere shells are quantitatively captures by large-gap spherical annuluses using the new <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> 2. Introduced a domain decomposition method suitable the massively parallel computers into the numerical simulation. It can help us improving the efficiency of the parallel. Investigated the results of numerical simulations of convection for planetary core, giant planets atmosphere and extra solar synchronized planets. For the weakly nonlinear convection, the results of simulation support the multi-layer-wave structure first suggested in an analytical model for Jovian atmosphere by Busse(1976). When the nonlinear effect and the corresponding Reynolds stresses become sufficiently large, the mean flow becomes prevailing: the strongly nonlinear flow, dominated by the spatially regular axisymmetric flow, gains the spatial regularity lost in mildly nonlinear convection. 3 Saturation and temporal variation of the mean zonal flow in rapidly rotating quasi-geostrophic spherical systems are investigated. Convective instabilities generate highly coherent small-scale eddies which feed energy into the mean flow via the inverse cascade mechanism. We show that this inverse cascade causes a continual piling up of energy in the mean flow which, in turn, strongly stabilizes the system and hence dramatically reduces the amplitude of the eddies, leading to the reduction and saturation of the mean flow. This implies that a steady state for the fast equatorial zonal jets on giant planets cannot exist. 随着国际深空探测计划的不断实施，行星科学引起了国际天文学和地球科学界的极大关注，人们期望深入研究行星演化过程中诸如磁场是如何产生的、液态核和大气的动力学性质等，以逐步加深人们对太阳系演化的理解。 文章中选用准地转流近似模型，利用有限差分方法集中讨论快速旋转行星内部对流和较差转动问题。本文中主要进行了以下一些方面的研究工作： 1 、针对快速旋转行星流体基本展现二维运动基本特征，提取动力学方程中的主要项，建立了一个能较好反映行星内部对流的二维行星准地转流模型，并对线性问题进行了详细的理论分析，给出了对流和较差转动的基本物理形态； 2 、采用区域分解的思想，对非线性问题编写了一套高效的并行差分数值模拟软件，在此基础上，分别数值模拟了地球液态外核、木星大气以及太阳系外飞马座 51 号b-型行星的流体动力学过程，发现它们具有一个共同的动力学特征：当非线性效应弱时，系统基本呈现小尺度对流模式；当非线性效应强时，一些小尺度对流胞会将其能量转移到带状环流，系统主要呈现大尺度平均流模式，此时较差转动特征显著，这与实际观测到的现象相符。 3 、基于二维准地转流模型，首次清楚揭示了行星带状环流产生、维持以及变化的动力学过程：热不稳定性产生小尺度对流胞，由于Coriolis力的作用使其不断将能量输送到具有减弱热输送作用的大尺度带状环流，一定时间后热对流接近停止，而粘滞效应逐步损耗带状环流的能量，从而系统的热输送逐步加强，开始新的热不稳定。此过程说明，带状环流随时间是变化的，这与深空探测结构相符...|$|E

We consider the motion of a single ellipsoidal vortex with uniform potential vorticity in a rotating stratified fluid at finite Rossby number. Building on previous solutions obtained under the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation</b> (at first order in), we obtain analytical solutions for the balanced part of the flow at. These solutions capture important ageostrophic effects giving rise to an asymmetry in the evolution of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices. Previous work has shown that, if the velocity field induced by an ellipsoidal vortex only depends linearly on spatial coordinates inside the vortex, i. e., then the dynamics reduces markedly to a simple matrix equation. The instantaneous vortex shape and orientation are encapsulated in a symmetric matrix, which is acted upon by the flow matrix to provide the vortex evolution. Under the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation,</b> the flow matrix is determined by inverting the potential vorticity to obtain the streamfunction via Poisson's equation, which has a known analytical solution depending on elliptic integrals. Here we show that higher-order balanced solutions, up to second order in the Rossby number, can also be calculated analytically. However, in this case there is a vector potential that requires the solution of three Poisson equations for each of its components. The source terms for these equations are independent of spatial coordinates within the ellipsoid, depending only on the elliptic integrals solved at the leading, quasi-geostrophic order. Unlike the quasi-geostrophic case, these source terms do not in general vanish outside the ellipsoid and have an inordinately complicated dependence on spatial coordinates. In the special case of an ellipsoid whose axes are aligned with the coordinate axes, we are able to derive these source terms and obtain the full analytical solution to the three Poisson equations. However, if one considers the homogeneous case, whereby the outer source terms are neglected, one can obtain an approximate solution having a compact matrix form analogous to the leading-order quasi-geostrophic case. This approximate solution proves to be highly accurate for the general case of an arbitrarily oriented ellipsoid, as verified through comparisons of the solutions with solutions obtained from numerical simulations of an ellipsoid using an accurate nonlinear balance model, even at moderate Rossby numbers.

The hetons prone to baroclinic instability often break into two hetons drifting in opposite directions, and in more hetons, for wider initial structures.

The convective structures and the zonal jets widen when the thermal forcing increases.

(2010) {{claim that}} the {{apparent}} spectrum power law E(k) approximate to k(- 3) on scales >= 600 km obtained {{with the help of}} commercial jetliner trajectory deviations (GASP and Mozaic databases) could not be brought into question (Lovejoy et al., 2009 a), because this spectrum corresponds to "a well known theory of quasi-geostrophic turbulence developed by Charney (1971) ". Lindborg et al. (2010) also claim that " limitations [of this theory] have been relaxed in many of the modern models of atmospheric turbulence". We show that both claims are irrelevant and that generalized scale invariance (GSI) is indispensable to go beyond the quasi-geostrophic limitations, to go in fact from scale analysis to scaling analysis in order to derive better analytical models. In this direction, we derive vorticity equations in a space of (fractal) dimension D = 2 + H-z (0 <= H-z <= 1), which corresponds to a first step in the derivation of a dynamical alternative to the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation</b> and turbulence. The corresponding precise definition of fractional dimensional turbulence already demonstrates that the classical 2 -D and 3 -D turbulence are not the main options to understand atmospheric dynamics. Although (2 + H-z) -D turbulence (with 0 < H-z < 1) has more common features with 3 -D turbulence than with 2 -D turbulence, it has nevertheless very distinctive features: its scaling anisotropy is in agreement with the layered pancake structure, which is typical of rotating and stratified turbulence but not of the classical 3 -D turbulence...|$|E
40|$|An inertia-gravity wave (IGW) {{propagating}} in a vertically sheared, rotating stratified fluid {{interacts with}} the pair of inertial levels that surround the critical level. An exact expression {{for the form of}} the IGW is derived here {{in the case of a}} linear shear and used to examine this interaction in detail. This expression recovers the classical values of the transmission and reflection coefficients |T|=(-πμ) and |R|= 0, where μ^ 2 =J(1 +ν^ 2) - 1 / 4, J is the Richardson number and ν the ratio between the horizontal transverse and along-shear wavenumbers. For large J, a WKB analysis provides an interpretation of this result in term of tunnelling: an IGW incident to the lower inertial level becomes evanescent between the inertial levels, returning to an oscillatory behaviour above the upper inertial level. The amplitude of the transmitted wave is directly related to the decay of the evanescent solution between the inertial levels. In the immediate vicinity of the critical level, the evanescent IGW is well represented by the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation,</b> so that the process can be interpreted as resulting from the coupling between balanced and unbalanced motion. The exact and WKB solutions describe the so-called valve effect, a dependence of the behaviour in the region between the inertial levels on the direction of wave propagation. For J < 1 this is shown to lead to an amplification of the wave between the inertial levels. Since the flow is inertially unstable for J< 1, this establishes a correspondence between the inertial-level interaction and the condition for inertial instability...|$|E
40|$|Vortices, or {{coherent}} {{volumes of}} anomalous potential vorticity abound {{in the oceans}} and participate to the trans-port of many properties such as heat, salinity, and many other tracers. For example, Ebbesmeyer et al. (1986) estimated a population of 1, 000 to 10, 000 vortices on the surface layers of the North Atlantic alone. A well-known example of such vortices are the cold rings generated by the barotropic-baroclinic destabilisation of the Gulf Stream. These cold rings may pair with deep-water anticyclonic vortices of Saragasso sea water, forming a baroclinic struc-ture called “heton”, Bane et al. (1999). Such dipolar structures are self-propagating (when disaligned in the vertical), hence leave {{the vicinity of the}} Gulf Stream. Hetons are also forming nearby the Gulf of Cadiz, see Carton et al. (2002). Recently, Reinaud & Carton (2009) investigated the linear stability and the nonlinear evolution of a family of hetons under the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> In this study, the hetons consist of two cylindrical vortices (poles) aligned in the vertical, separated by a vertical gap d. Both the influence of the aspect ratio of the poles of the heton r/hv and the vertical gap d/hv are addressed in this study. r is the horizontal radius of the heton, while hv is the half-height of each pole of the heton. The quasi-geostrophic model takes the Rossby number (Ro) and the Froude number (Fr) to tend to zero (Ro ∼ Fr → 0). As a consequence, there is no dynamical difference between the behaviour of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices. Further to this research, we investigate the nonlinear evolution of such hetons at small, yet finite Rossby number...|$|E
40|$|The role of short-wave instabilities on geostrophic {{turbulence}} is {{studied in}} a simplified model consisting of three layers in the <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> The linear stability analysis shows that short-wave instabilities {{are created by}} the interplay between the shear in {{the upper and lower}} layers. If the stratification is non-uniform, in particular surface intensified, the linear growth rate is larger for short-wave instabilities than for long-wave instabilities and the layers are essentially decoupled, with the small scales growing independently. The fully developed homogeneous turbulence is studied in a number of numerical experiments. Results show that in both the case of equal layer depths and surface intensified stratification an inverse cascade in kinetic energy is observed. The modal kinetic energy spectra for the case with surface intensified stratification show higher energy for higher baroclinic numbers at small scales, due to the decoupling of the layers. As a result, while the case with equal layer depths shows large barotropic instabilities with large scale gradients of potential temperature, the surface intensified stratification is characterized by a transition from surface dynamics, characterized by a patchy distribution of vorticity, to interior dynamics, characterized by vorticity filamentation. The effect of the short-wave instabilities {{can be seen in the}} probability distribution functions of the potential vorticity anomaly, which reduces to a Gaussian distribution when the growth rate of the short-wave instabilities is larger than the growth rate for the long-wave instabilities. The surface intensified stratification also alters the vertical structure of the potential vorticity fluxes and shows deviations of the fluxes from a scaling obtained assuming that the turbulence acts as a downgradient diffusion. Experiments with a passive tracer shows a dominance of the coherent structures at large scales, and of filamentation at smaller scales, in the tracer dispersion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceData {{assimilation}} in geomagnetism designates {{the set of}} inverse {{methods for}} geomagnetic data analysis which rely on an underlying prognostic numerical model of core dynamics. Within that framework, the time-dependency of the magnetohydrodynamic state of the core need no longer be parameterized: The model trajectory (and the secular variation it generates at {{the surface of the}} Earth) is controlled by the initial condition, and possibly some other static control parameters. The primary goal of geomagnetic data assimilation is then to combine in an optimal fashion the information contained in the database of geomagnetic observations and in the dynamical model, by adjusting the model trajectory in order to provide an adequate fit to the data. The recent developments in that emerging field of research are motivated mostly by the increase in data quality and quantity during the last decade, owing to the ongoing era of magnetic observation of the Earth from space, and by the concurrent progress in the numerical description of core dynamics. In this article we review briefly the current status of our knowledge of core dynamics, and elaborate on the reasons which motivate geomagnetic data assimilation studies, most notably (a) the prospect to propagate the current quality of data backward in time to construct dynamically consistent historical core field and flow models, (b) the possibility to improve the forecast of the secular variation, and (c) on a more fundamental level, the will to identify unambiguously the physical mechanisms governing the secular variation. We then present the fundamentals of data assimilation (in its sequential and variational forms) and summarize the observations at hand for data assimilation practice. We present next two approaches to geomagnetic data assimilation: The first relies on a three-dimensional model of the geodynamo, and the second on a <b>quasi-geostrophic</b> <b>approximation.</b> We also provide an estimate of the limit of the predictability of the geomagnetic secular variation based upon a suite of three-dimensional dynamo models. We finish by discussing possible directions for future research, in particular the assimilation of laboratory observations of liquid metal analogs of Earth's core...|$|E
