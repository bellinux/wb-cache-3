40|$|Purpose – The video-sharing website YouTube {{encourages}} {{interaction between}} its users via the provision <b>of</b> a user <b>comments</b> facility. This was originally envisaged {{as a way}} for viewers to provide information about and reactions to videos, but is employed for other communicative purposes including sharing ideas, paying tributes, social networking, and question answering. This study seeks to examine and categorise the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> created by YouTube users to highlight the various ways in which this interactive feature has been employed as a means of communication and self-expression. Design/methodology/approach – By conducting a content analysis of 66, 637 user comments on YouTube videos the authors created a classification schema which may be used to categorise the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> users leave. Findings – The schema reveals ten broad categories, and 58 subcategories which reflect the wide-ranging use <b>of</b> the YouTube <b>comments</b> facility. Research limitations/implications – As YouTube continues to evolve, new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> that do not appear in the scheme outlined will appear. However, this schema will provide an initial structure upon which other investigations can build when analysing the ongoing use <b>of</b> the YouTube <b>comments</b> feature as a communication device. Practical implications – This scheme may be used for researchers in a variety of disciplines who are interested in using user-generated content. The scheme will aid in the description and mining of this content and provides a way of structuring this content into categories representing user intent. Social implications – This study highlights the variety of purposes to which the user <b>commenting</b> facility <b>of</b> YouTube is employed. These include purposes such as reminiscence, grieving, giving advice and communication. Originality/value – This is the first detailed, content-based analysis <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> created by YouTube users. The classification scheme facilitates the analysis <b>of</b> these <b>comments</b> for a variety of purposes, including marketing, communication studies and studies of information seeking...|$|R

30|$|Another aspect we {{analyzed}} was difference in vocabulary between <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments,</b> and the tendency comments {{considered to be}} particularly “non-informative” have to express more positive sentiments than those considered {{to have at least}} some useful information (that is, comments that have {{at least one of the}} discriminative words from the top-K set). This discrepancy in sentiment values indicates that it’s possible to design a method for identifying relevant/irrelevant comments for a determinate topic, or even entire comment sequences, based on sentiment polarity and word usage. Such a method could be used to automatically find out-of-topic comments, spam, or flamers. For that, a deeper study on how these sentiment values differ according to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>comment</b> would be required, properly identifying how these behaviors change according to different contexts.|$|R

A taxonomy was developed for the purpose of categorizing and describing comments written on the papers; 1, 475 comments were analyzed. ^ The teacher whose comments were most specific and explicit and the teacher whose comments were least specific and explicit each submitted three additional sets of writing samples during an 8 -month period. A team of three rates used holistic scoring procedures to score the first and last papers submitted by each teacher. Interrater reliability coefficients were significant at the. 01 level. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique for repeated measures was used to test for relative effects <b>of</b> the two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> on improvement in writing performance. ^ A significant interaction was found between <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>comment</b> and occasion <b>of</b> testing.

De-cisions about whether to publish occasional commentaries in the Journal of Applied Psychology have been guided more by tradition than by an explicit editorial policy. With the encour-agement of the APA Publications and Communications Board, I have formulated a comment policy for the journal. There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>comments</b> that the journal will consider for pub-lication. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>comment</b> will continue to follow the tradi-tional model.

The comments will be submitted to the journal as regular submissions and will go through our review process. These comments will be judged as to whether they make a meaningful substantive contribution. That standard is the same one applied to all submissions, and it is a high one. 1 If the comment surpasses this standard, it will be published in accordance with its position in the publication queue.
