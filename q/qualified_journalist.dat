40|$|The {{traditional}} {{role of the}} journalist as gatekeeper is being undermined and challenged in the online world where anyone with an internet connection can publish to a global audience. As a consequence {{the role of the}} journalist is being constantly redefined as the “profession” no longer holds exclusive rights to the dissemination of news to the masses. This study seeks to explore how local British journalists perceive their role in the era of Web 2. 0 and how willing they are to adapt. Through interviews and observation at two local British newspapers it was possible to gain a greater understanding of the modern role of the local journalist and their professional distinctions from the public. These NCTJ <b>qualified</b> <b>journalists</b> increasingly view themselves as verifiers of news who use their training and expertise to amplify news to the wider public. Despite some initial reluctance they are largely enthusiastic about technological and cultural adaptations to their role although some are still resisting this change. There is also evidence to suggest audiences play a role in secondary gatekeeping by influencing the selection and prominence of stories on newspaper websites. Furthermore the findings seek to inform educators of the continued relevance of the professional accreditation body, the NCTJ, to an industry persistently challenged by citizen journalism...|$|R

50|$|Schell's {{selection}} as Dean of the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism elicited one unusual attack from right-wing {{radio talk show}} host and health guru, Michael Savage, who alleged the head of the search committee, sociology professor Troy Duster, had refused to interview him. Savage considered himself a <b>qualified</b> conservative <b>journalist</b> for the job, and claimed that Schell's appointment constituted political patronage, which is illegal under California's labor laws. The suit also argued that a political litmus test for the deanship illegally denied public employment and First Amendment rights to a conservative applicant. The lawsuit was dropped as having little merit and when all conservative applicants withdrew from consideration.|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} diversity within Vanuatu’s media landscape and reporting is not dominated by any political perspective. Commercial media frequently publishes corruption related stories, although reporting {{tends to be}} superficial. Media is also active in relaying government press releases, which serves {{to inform the public}} on governance issues and activities. However, media faces a number of challenges in being able to fulfil its “watchdog” role within the national integrity system. There are a limited number of <b>qualified</b> and experienced <b>journalists.</b> Intimidation of journalists occurs regularly. Cultural factors hinder the criticism of leaders. There is no freedom of information law. Licensing laws potentially allow for the Minister in charge to impose restrictive conditions on broadcast activities. All of these factors contribute to an environment which discourages investigative journalists. Internal governance is also weak. Whilst there is a voluntary code of media ethics there is no media regulatory body that can enforce ethical standards and practices. As a result {{there is no way to}} ensure that transparency, accountability and integrity mechanisms contained within this code affect media practices...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This is {{the first}} study of its kind about {{newsroom}} convergence and multi-skilled journalists in Saudi newspaper organisations and aimed {{to fill a gap}} in the literature about this particular issue in the Saudi context. The study investigated transformations, implications and consequences of technological convergence at four Saudi traditional newspaper organisations; Al-Madina, Alriyadh, Alyaum, and Alwatan. This thesis has explored the particular impacts of online journalistic production in traditional newspaper organisations to identify changes and perhaps challenges occurring in newspaper newsrooms. The study used the observation method in the four newsrooms and in-depth interviews with open ended questions with 60 professionals. The findings confirmed that there are ongoing transformations in the newsrooms. Yet, these transformations are challenged by regulatory, business, and cultural forces. Alyaum was the only newsroom to introduce new integrated newsroom. Journalists are observing and using new communication technologies in the workplace. However, there are difficulties in this process such as tensions in the newsrooms and shortage of <b>qualified</b> and trained <b>journalists</b> in the Saudi media market especially, multiskilled journalists. Despite embracing online and digital technology in news production and disruption, the four Saudi newspapers are still prioritising the traditional print side as it is generating more than 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} of news {{has changed in}} the twentieth century. Content analysis of the traditional five Ws in three American newspapers found that stories grew longer, included more analysis, expanded from specific locations to broader regions, placed more emphasis on time frames other than the present, and named fewer individuals and more groups, officials, and outside sources. These trends affected each newspaper’s coverage of three topics: crimes, accidents, and employment. Thus the basic recipe for news — the report of events new to the hearer — acquired a third ingredient: For a story to <b>qualify</b> as news, <b>journalists</b> now supply a context of social problems, interpretations, and themes. This trend springs from the workings of the news market and the culture of journalism. Shit happens, but that is not necessarily news. Events become news when someone tells you, and even then whatever happened is not news to you unless it is new to you. These two elements — the report of events and their novelty to the hearer — have constituted the core meaning or denotation of news in the twentieth century (cf. Schudson, 1982; Burke, 1973). In Western capitalism, news workers labor to find or manufacture events, and news industries compete to deliver those events first to the largest audiences...|$|R
