40|$|The paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> and holding {{pressure}} {{on the structure of}} neat and beta-nucleated isotactic polypropylenes. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene was modified with a beta-specific nucleator based on N,N'-dicyclohexylnaphthalene- 2, 6 -dicarboxamide in the concentration of 0. 03 wt. %. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), dog bone-shaped test specimens were injection-moulded, using two sets of processing parameters. In the T-set the <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> was varied within the range of 40 - 120 degrees C in 10 degrees C steps, while in the beta-set the holding pressure was changed from 5 to 13 MPa in 1 MPa steps. Other processing parameters were kept on the same level. Polarized-light microscopy showed a strong effect of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> on the morphology of alpha-iPP specimens; the skin thinned out and the spherulite size increased with <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> rise. On the other hand, in the case of alpha-iPP only the skin thickness was correspondingly affected, while the spherulite size remained virtually constant, independent of the <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> changes. At the same structure level, both alpha-iPP and beta-iPP specimens were insensitive to holding pressure variations. Polymorphic composition derived from wide-angle X-ray scattering displayed similar range of changes induced by variations of the processing parameters for both materials. The increase of <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> positively influenced the crystallinity and the P-form content, particularly in the skin of specimens. On the contrary, higher holding pressure depressed the crystallinity proportionally within the bulk of specimens. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

A commercial-grade of isotactic polypropylene was modified with a beta-specific nucleator. From both the original material (alpha-iPP) and the beta-nucleated material (beta-iPP), tensile test specimens were injection-moulded. Stress-strain measurements performed at room temperature revealed a positive influence of higher <b>mould</b> <b>temperatures</b> but negligible effect of holding pressure on the elastic modulus of injection-moulded specimens. It was suggested that at optimum processing conditions the elastic modulus of both alpha- and beta-iPP may be comparable. The softening effect of beta-form manifested itself in systematically lower yield stress values of beta-iPP as compared to alpha-iPP. The yield strain of both alpha- and beta-iPP decreased {{with the increase of}} <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> and the decrease of holding pressure.

The {{effects of the}} OWS content and the <b>moulding</b> <b>temperature</b> on the flexural and compressive properties of the composites were investigated and {{were found to be}} highly significant. Increases in the proportion of OWS in the matrix caused a gradual worsening in the mechanical properties of the composites. However, higher <b>moulding</b> <b>temperatures</b> moderately improved the mechanical properties. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was used to study the viscoelastic behaviour, and thermogravimetric analysis was used to study the thermal stability of the composites. The storage and loss moduli gradually decreased with increasing temperature and significantly increased with increasing the proportion of OWS in the composites. The thermal stability of the composites slightly dropped with a higher OWS content. These results suggest that PCR-HDPE and OWS can be used to create composite materials with good mechanical and thermal properties.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to explore what phenomena influence parts warpage after injection moulding by different <b>mould</b> <b>temperature</b> at the opposite walls. Design/methodology/approach: The sample bars were injected into the injection mould and the warpage was observed. The deflection was measured and material structure was observed using optical microscope. Findings: It {{was found that the}} different <b>mould</b> wall <b>temperature</b> values cause the asymmetrical polymer flow in the cross-section. It was discovered by short shots observation. As result the asymmetrical structure in the parts&# 8217; cross-section occurs. Research limitations/implications: In the future work the research of stress in the parts is recommended. This could be done by elastooptical investigation of transparent parts made from polymers like PS, ABS or PC. Practical implications: It is required to assure homogeneous <b>mould</b> wall <b>temperature</b> across the entire cavity when injection moulding parts production is made. Originality/value: This is an example of combined research that is not focused on one kind of tests only and helps to find reasons of the quality problem in polymer parts manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an iterative learning control strategy for a reactive polymer composite moulding process using batch-wise linearised models that are identified from process operational data. In rapid thermal moulding processes, {{the degree of}} cure {{is controlled by the}} applied <b>mould</b> <b>temperature.</b> Due to the model plant mismatches and the presence of unknown disturbances, a pre-set (off-line optimised) <b>moulding</b> <b>temperature</b> profile would not always lead to the desired degree of cure. The repetitive nature of batch moulding process allow the information of the previous batch (or cycle) being used to enhance the operation of the current batch through iterative learning control. The control policy updating is calculated by solving an optimisation problem using a model linearised around a reference batch. In order to cope with process nonlinearities, process variations, and disturbances, the reference batch is taken as the immediate previous batch and the model is re-identified from the updated historical batch data using principal component regression. The proposed method is tested on a simulated reactive polymer composite moulding process...|$|R
