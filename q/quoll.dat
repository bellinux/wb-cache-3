5|$|Four {{species have}} been {{recovered}} from Pleistocene cave deposits from Mount Etna Caves National Park near Rockhampton in central Queensland. Remains of the tiger <b>quoll</b> and the northern <b>quoll,</b> and a species either identical or {{very similar to the}} eastern <b>quoll,</b> as well as a prehistoric species as yet undescribed, all lived in what was a rainforest climate. The northern <b>quoll</b> is still found in the region. The fossil species D. dunmalli, described by Bartholomai in 1971, is the oldest species recovered to date. Its remains were found in Pliocene deposits near Chinchilla in southeastern Queensland. Known only from a lower jaw and some teeth, it was a relative of the tiger <b>quoll.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first species described, {{the eastern}} <b>quoll,</b> was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} American opossum genus Didelphis by an anonymous author, and named Didelphis maculata. This name is no longer considered valid, {{and the second part}} of the name is now given to a different species, the tiger <b>quoll,</b> Dasyurus maculatus, while the eastern <b>quoll</b> was renamed Dasyurus viverrinus by George Shaw in 1800.|$|E
5|$|Since 1770, all Australian <b>quoll</b> {{species have}} {{declined}} in number owing to habitat loss caused by urbanization. The northern <b>quoll</b> {{is threatened by}} toxic cane toads, but a University of Sydney project revealed in 2010 is teaching them to avoid eating the invasive amphibians.|$|E
40|$|<b>Quolls</b> (Dasyurus) are {{medium-sized}} carnivorous dasyurid marsupials. Tiger (3, 840 g) {{and eastern}} <b>quolls</b> (780 g) are mesic zone species, northern <b>quolls</b> (516 g) are tropical zone, and chuditch (1, 385 g) were once widespread through the Australian arid zone. We found that standard physiological variables of these <b>quolls</b> {{are consistent with}} allometric expectations for marsupials. Nevertheless, inter-specific patterns amongst the <b>quolls</b> are consistent with their different environments. The lower T ^sub b^ of northern <b>quolls</b> (34 °C) may provide scope for adaptive hyperthermia in the tropics, and they use torpor for energy/water conservation, whereas the larger mesic species (eastern and tiger <b>quolls)</b> do not appear to. Thermolability varied from little in eastern (0. 035 °C °C^sup - 1 ^) and tiger <b>quolls</b> (0. 051 °C ºC^sup - 1 ^) to substantial in northern <b>quolls</b> (0. 100 °C ºC^sup - 1 ^) and chuditch (0. 146 °C ºC^sup - 1 ^), reflecting body mass and environment. Basal metabolic rate was higher for eastern <b>quolls</b> (0. 662 ± 0. 033 ml O^sub 2 ^ g^sup - 1 ^ h^sup - 1 ^), presumably reflecting their naturally cool environment. Respiratory ventilation closely matched metabolic demand, except at high ambient temperatures where <b>quolls</b> hyperventilated to facilitate evaporative heat loss; tiger and eastern <b>quolls</b> also salivated. A higher evaporative water loss for eastern <b>quolls</b> (1. 43 ± 0. 212 mg H^sub 2 ^O g^sup - 1 ^ h^sup - 1 ^) presumably reflects their more mesic distribution. The point of relative water economy was low for tiger (- 1. 3 °C), eastern (- 12. 5 °C) and northern (+ 3. 3) <b>quolls,</b> and highest for the chuditch (+ 22. 6 °C). We suggest that these differences in water economy reflect lower expired air temperatures and hence lower respiratory evaporative water loss for the arid-zone chuditch relative to tropical and mesic <b>quolls...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Quolls</b> {{are mostly}} solitary creatures, {{limiting}} {{contact with other}} <b>quolls</b> to mating or other social activities such as using the latrines.|$|R
40|$|Exotic predators, {{particularly}} red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cats (Felis catus), {{have been}} implicated in the declines and extinctions of many Australian mammals and a recent incursion of foxes into Tasmania has therefore caused great concern. We tested the behavioural responses of eastern <b>quolls</b> (Dasyurus viverrinus) to acoustic cues of native (masked owl (Tyto novaehollandiae castanops) and Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus laniarius)) and non-native (fox and cat) predators and to non-predators (cow (Bos taurus) and control noise). Juvenile <b>quolls</b> treated fox vocalisations like those of cows (as measured {{by an increase in}} movement), in contrast to their responses (a decrease in movement) to sympatric predators. Cats are probably a lesser threat to eastern <b>quolls</b> than native predators or foxes, their impact probably being greatest on the juveniles. Juvenile <b>quolls,</b> but not adults, showed similar responses to cat vocalisations as they did to owls and devils. Adult <b>quolls</b> responded differently from juveniles to owls and devils, by increasing vigilance. This is consistent with the smaller body size, inexperience and the presumed greater vulnerability of juveniles to predation. The lack of appropriate anti-predator responses to foxes suggests that eastern <b>quolls</b> would be vulnerable to predation by foxes in Tasmania...|$|R
5|$|The bronze <b>quoll</b> (D. spartacus) is {{the only}} mammal found in the Trans Fly ecoregion, but not in {{northern}} Australia. It {{is found in the}} southern part of New Guinea south of the Fly River. Rising sea levels due to an increase in global temperature caused a land bridge that once connected Australia and New guinea to be covered up with water. A 2007 study conducted by the University of New South Wales suggests the bronze <b>quoll</b> is closely related to the western <b>quoll,</b> their ancestors diverging with the separation of land masses.|$|E
5|$|The western <b>quoll</b> or chuditch (D. geoffroii) is {{restricted}} to the Jarrah Forest and the central and southern Australian Wheatbelt. The western <b>quoll</b> {{is believed to have}} once occupied 70% of Australia, but because of cane toads, predators, habitat destruction, and poison baiting, it is now less abundant.|$|E
5|$|The eastern <b>quoll</b> (D. viverrinus) is now {{considered}} extinct on mainland Australia; the last sighting there was in the 1960s. But it does inhabit much of nearby Tasmania, {{where it can be}} found in rainforests, heathland, alpine areas, and scrubs. It can be found near farms, as it eats pasture food. The eastern <b>quoll</b> can also be seen in the Mount Field National Park.|$|E

40|$|The <b>quolls</b> {{are among}} {{the largest of the}} {{remaining}} carnivorous marsupials in the Australasian region, and thus occupy an important ecological niche as top predators and scavengers. All <b>quolls</b> are currently in decline and threatened to some degree yet the application of molecular information to the conservation and management of <b>quolls</b> has been unexplored until now. In this thesis I use two independent and highly variable genetic marker systems, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region and nuclear microsatellites, to explore various aspects of conservation genetics relevant to the management of <b>quolls.</b> These aspects include an examination of the phylogenetic or evolutionary relationships among all six species of <b>quolls,</b> an examination of the genetic diversity within populations and the degree of differentiation between populations of the four Australian species of <b>quolls,</b> and the definition of units for conservation within these species. The development of suitable nuclear markers was a vital first step in defining levels of genetic variability and differentiation within and between the different populations and species. These markers proved to be highly variable and provided a wealth of information of relevance to the conservation of these species, and will be extremely useful in further studies. The use of the mtDNA control region for phylogenetic analyses was a novel approach to examining this question in <b>quolls</b> and also proved to be highly informative. Results from these phylogenetic analyses highlight the necessity of 1) examining more than one exemplar of each species, as well as 2) finally bringing some consensus {{to the question of the}} evolutionary relationships among <b>quolls.</b> Results show that northern <b>quolls</b> form the earliest split from all other <b>quolls</b> and that western <b>quolls</b> are closely related to the two New Guinean species. Furthermore, there is evidence for distinct lineages within species, corresponding to geographically separate or isolated populations. Levels of genetic variability within populations were examined using the microsatellites developed previously. Genetic variation was significantly higher in western <b>quolls</b> than in any other species. This was surprising given the long term and widespread decline of this species. There were also significant differences between populations within species in the level of genetic variability. Low levels of variability were usually found in small or captive bred populations or populations in severe decline. Genetic differentiation between populations was also explored using microsatellites. Significant differentiation in allele frequency distributions was found between most pairwise population comparisons, indicating that each of these populations forms a separate management unit (MU) for conservation purposes. One notable exception was found among populations of tiger <b>quolls</b> from a highly localized area in the Barrington Tops region of New South Wales. Using microsatellites, these populations were not significantly subdivided and thus appeared to be one MU. Using mtDNA, however, these populations were significantly subdivided and thus should be considered separate MUs. Differences in the way these two genetic markers are inherited (mtDNA is maternally inherited, microsatellites are biparentally inherited) provides a clue as to the social structure and organization of these cryptic nocturnal species. Consequently, the use of different genetic marker systems shows that there is sex-biased migration within this species. Finally, the degree of genetic differentiation observed within tiger <b>quolls</b> does not conform to the currently recognized subspecific categories within this species. The major genetic split occurs between the Tasmanian and mainland populations of tiger <b>quolls,</b> not between Dasyurus maculatus maculatus and D. m. gracilis. Thus, the Tasmanian and mainland populations form two distinct evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) for conservation purposes, and I propose that the Tasmanian populations should be elevated to the subspecific status to account for this...|$|R

5|$|Two {{sites were}} chosen to {{study the effects of}} cane toads on the {{northern}} <b>quoll,</b> one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of Kakadu National Park. The other site was located {{at the north end of}} the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern <b>quoll</b> population. Monitoring of the <b>quoll</b> population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern <b>quoll</b> appeared to be extinct in this section of the park, as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the <b>quoll</b> population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline. The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the local extinction of the northern <b>quoll</b> is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female <b>quoll</b> has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby <b>quoll,</b> or pup, {{is the size of}} a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling on one of the mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female <b>quoll</b> is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

5|$|Predators such as foxes {{and cats}} prey on quolls and compete {{with them for}} food. For example, both quolls and foxes catch and consume rabbits. Since the {{introduction}} of foxes, <b>quoll</b> populations have dropped dramatically.

5|$|Quolls {{are mostly}} carnivorous. The smaller quolls {{primarily}} eat insects, birds, frogs, lizards and fruit; the larger species eat birds, reptiles, and mammals, including echidnas and possums. The tiger quoll's diet {{is dominated by}} mammals such as brushtail possums, rabbits and hares. The exact mix is variable depending {{on the availability of}} prey after bushfires, and can include carrion or bandicoots when food is scarce. The other species of <b>quoll</b> have also been known to eat carrion. The paws and vibrissae of quolls allow them to reach into small burrows to find prey. Quolls hunt by stalking. Depending on the size of its prey, a <b>quoll</b> may leap or pounce on it. Quolls pin small prey down with their front paws while devouring it, and jump onto larger prey, sinking in their claws and closing their jaws around the neck. Quolls can obtain all the water they need from their food, making them quite adaptable during droughts or other periods of water shortage.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} <b>quoll</b> (D. hallucatus) {{could be}} found in the northern third of Australia a century ago. Presently, it resides in high rocky areas and areas with heavy rainfall. It is abundant on the minor islands surrounding northern Australia. In 2003, northern quolls were translocated to Astell and Pobassoo Islands to isolate them from the toxic invasive cane toad. Genetic analysis indicates it is the earliest offshoot from the ancestors of other quolls.|$|E
5|$|Cane toads pose {{a serious}} threat to native species when {{introduced}} to a new ecosystem.

The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the northern <b>quoll,</b> as well as Mertens' water monitor, a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.|$|E
