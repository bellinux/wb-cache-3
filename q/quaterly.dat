40|$|One of {{the more}} {{important}} statistical tools for the monitoring and analysis of the economic activity evolution in the short term is the availability of estimations of the quarterly GDP components, whether the supply side or whether the demand side. The need for having this information with a short lag, makes it essential the use of quarterly distribution methods that allow distribute the annual information to quarter. The more applied tool, {{due to the fact that}} it allows to solve this problem in a very graceful way under an statistic point of view of optimal estimator, is the Chow-Lin method. Nevertheless, this method do not guarantee the coincidence between the GDP quarterly estimations by the supply side and the demand side. This leads to the need of a conciliation method. In this paper it is developed a multivariate extension of the Chow-Lin method that allows to solve the quarterly values estimation problem in an optimal way, subject to several restrictions. One of the potential applications of this method, that we have named the restricted Chow-Lin method, is the joint estimation of quarterly side, conditioned to the need that both GDP estimations have to be equal, avoiding the need of applying further conciliation methods. best linear unbiased estimation, <b>quaterly</b> distribution, chow-lin nethod, national accounts...|$|E
40|$|The Hungarian {{employment}} rate is about 10 percentage points below the EU average, {{even though it}} has been increasing since 1997. The paper describes the evolution of economic inactivity between 1992 and 2003 and the composition of the inactive population, focusing primarily on working-age men. Calculations are based on the <b>quaterly</b> Labour Force Surveys of the Hungarian Statistical Office, with sample sizes of around 30, 000. The decline in labour market participation was evenly distributed across all age groups during the transition. The slow increase in activity rates starting in 1998 has significantly changed the structure of activity: participation has increased among those aged 30 – 40, and remained low among older workers. In 2002, almost 30 per cent of men aged 40 – 59 were out of the labour force. Inactive men just below the pensionable age typically have less schooling than the employed population, and most of them suffer from some illness that constrains their ability to work. Regional variation in inactivity rates remains significant even after controlling for levels of education, which suggests that labour demand is a significant factor in explaining inactivity. However, in-cash transfers may be equally important in determining the willingness of older men to work. JEL Classification: P 23, J 6...|$|E

This corrective practice seems to shape learner expectations of the type of feedback that is most effective or useful to them (Hedgcock and Lefkowitz 1996). In the context of teaching academic writing, this may easily pose a problem for allocating teacher resources away from teaching writing as a process to taking care of the learner language issues. Nowadays, e-platforms designed specifically to cater for academic writing offer a new range of feedback possibilities for teachers. Tasks pertaining particularly to language use can, for example, be created so that the feedback is fully automated. The easy and immediate access to such feedback is beneficial for learners with different proficiency levels (Brandl 1995). In our course, in order to free teacher resources for feedback on students’ critical thinking, treatment of sources, structure and context, we used automated feedback, i. e. direct corrections with metalinguistic comments generated within the e-platform, to feedback on skill building exercises pertaining to grammar, style and idiomaticity. Previous research indicates that direct corrective feedback on mechanical errors is efficient in facilitating learning (see Sheen 2007 for an overview of the field). In a pilot study on student experience of the writing process, we noticed that the level of student satisfaction with this automated feedback was surprisingly high and valued as much as the extensive written teacher feedback on papers submitted for examination. In our current study, we explore the impact automated feedback has on student experience of learning skills pertaining to the mechanics of writing as described above from beginner to advanced students of academic writing. Some of the factors we consider are the immediacy/remoteness of the feedback, the extent of the metalinguistic comment and the connection of the skill building exercises to the teaching materials.

The inference is an NP-hard problem. There are several algorithms to make exact and approximate inference. One of the most popular, and that is also an exact method, is the evidence propagation algorithm of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [S. L. Lauritzen, D. J.

To serve such multi-center longitudinal patient-reported outcomes research, we designed an innovative system to support systematic data collection, management and quality monitoring for long-term outcome evaluation of care. Methods: The system structure design explicitly considered the continuum of study procedures, including patient enrollment, patient-reported baseline and follow-up surveys, joint implant components, and ambulatory record review for future potential adverse events. Patient enrollment process is recorded through a web-based data capture system. Patient-reported outcomes are completed by patients via scannable paper or web-based standardized surveys before and after surgery. Patient risk factors and implant components are collected from community-based orthopedic practices and hospital operating rooms. All data from the different sources are combined into a centralized database. Quality checks and monitoring processes are routinely conducted for each source of data. De-identified data are cleaned and scored for research analysis and surgeon quality reporting. Results: This system for the registry program was initiated in 2011. As of Feburary 2014, over 16, 000 patients have been enrolled from more than 130 surgeons in 22 states. The centralized database integrating data from patients, surgeons and hospitals is updated weekly.

We give an elementary introduction to congruent numbers and their conjectural characterisation, discuss local-to-global issues leading to the finiteness problem, and list a few results and conjectures in the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves. The area α of a right triangle with sides a, b, c (so that a 2 + b 2 = c 2) is given by 2 α = ab. If a, b, c are rational, then so is α. Conversely, which rational numbers α arise as the area of a rational right triangle a, b, c? This problem of characterising “congruent numbers ” — areas of rational right triangles — is perhaps the oldest unsolved problem in all of Mathematics.

Analysis of 18 genotypically related isolates selected on a <b>quaterly</b> basis demonstrated alterations in the two DNA topoisomerases II and IV (Thr 83 →Ile in GyrA and Ser 87 →Leu in ParC) and production of an ANT(2 ") -I enzyme. Although constitutively overproduced in these bacteria, the MexXY efflux system {{did not appear to}} contribute significantly to aminoglycoside resistance. β-Lactam resistance was associated with derepression of intrinsic AmpC β-lactamase (with isolate-to-isolate variations of up to 58 -fold) and sporadic deficiency in a 46 -kDa protein identified as the carbapenem-selective porin OprD. Of the 18 isolates, 14 were also found to overproduce the efflux system MexAB-OprM as a result of alteration of the repressor protein MexR (His 107 →Pro). However, complementation experiments with the cloned mexR gene demonstrated that MexAB-OprM contributed only marginally to β-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance. Of the four isolates exhibiting wild-type MexAB-OprM expression despite the MexR alteration, two appeared to harbor secondary mutations in the mexA-mexR intergenic region and one harbored secondary mutations in the putative ribosome binding site located upstream of the mexAB oprM operon. In conclusion, this study shows that many mechanisms were involved in the multiresistance phenotype of this highly epidemic strain of P. aeruginosa. Our results also demonstrate that the clone sporadically underwent substantial genetic and phenotypic variations {{during the course of the}} outbreak, perhaps in relation to local or individual selective drug pressures...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to explore and discuss the legacy of Kubrick in the post- 2000 work of Stephen Spielberg. The Kubrick-Spielberg {{relationship}} (at least in cinematic terms) is well known and several stylistic and formal parallels may and have been drawn between their work (spatial, in mise-en-scene, use of architecture, framing etc). Focusing mainly on Spielberg’s A. I Artificial Intelligence (2001), this paper will look at Kubrick {{as a source of}} adaptation rather than as one who adapts and drawing on a body of archival material I will look at the points in the film where the ‘Kubrickian’ and the ‘Spielbergian’ meet (or indeed appear to divest from each other). The paper will draw on a range of material relating to Kubrick’s own treatment for the film (itself an adaptation of Brian Aldiss Supertoys Last All Summer Long) – including a script from June 1993 in the Kubrick archive that appears to have been annotated by Spielberg and returned to Kubrick - and offer a close analysis of the film in terms of its Kubrickian influence and ask what remains of Kubrick’s vision for the film. The film will suggest A. I to be a lynchpin of the Kubrick/Spielberg relationship and Tim Kreider’s article ‘A. I Artificial Intelligence’ (published in Film <b>Quaterly,</b> Vol 56, No. 2) will provides a starting point for my investigation which I will expand to include a range of other (less studied) post 2000 Spielberg films where there is a visible and recognisable Kubrickian influence. Kubrick died on the cusp of the millennium. This paper will therefore, through close analysis, be interested in how Spielberg ‘adapts’ or imagines Kubrick to deal with a set of post millennial technological, spatial, architectural, political and cultural concerns and anxieties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{support the}} idea that {{temporal}} information processing may depend on an internal clock, Treis-man et al. proposed a pacemaker model (Treisman, M., Faulkner, A., Naish, P. L. N., Brogan, D., 1990. The internal clock: Evidence for a temporal oscillator underlying time perception with some estimates of its characteristics frequency. Perception 19, 705 - 743.) and a technique for interfering with it by introducing an external periodic phenomenon. Experimental results obtained by these authors on time estimation and production tasks support this model. In another study, Treisman et al. established that the pacemaker also affects reaction times (RT) (Treisman, M., Faulkner, A., Naish, P. L. N., 1992. On the relation between time perception and the timing of motor action: Evidence for a temporal oscillator controlling the timing of movement. <b>Quaterly</b> Journal of Experimental Psychology 45 A, 235 - 263.). In the present study, we addressed the question as to which information processing stage (Sanders, A. F., 1980. Stage analysis of reaction process, In: Stelmach, G. E., Requin, J. (Eds.). Tutorials in motor behavior. North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 331 - 354.) is affected by this internal clock. For this purpose, we used the Additive Factors Method (Sternberg, S., 1969. The discovery of processing stages: Extension of Donder's method. In: Koster, W. G. (Ed.). Attention and Performance II. Acta Psychologica 30, 276 - 315.). To vary sensorial processing time, we used two visual stimulus intensities. Stimulus response mapping was manipulated to enhance central processing time. To modify the duration of the motor stages, the two responses could be given by two fingers on the same hand (right ring vs. middle finger) or by two fingers of the different hands (right ring vs. left middle finger). Intensity of the stimulus, stimulus-response mapping, and repertoire of responses were found to be additive. We obtained RT modulations similar to those obtained by Treisman et al. in 1992. No first order interactions were observed between the periodical phenomenon and the other manipulated factors but only a third order one. Two possible interpretations of these results are proposed...|$|E
