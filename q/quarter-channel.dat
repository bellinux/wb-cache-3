The computed turbulence statistics show that the logarithm of the mean velocity gradient, normalized by its value at the <b>quarter-channel</b> height, {{is very close to}} symmetric with respect to this position. At this location, the ratio of the viscous transport term to the viscous stress is a minimum. The range of validity of this property increases with the Reynolds number and is between y=h¼ 0. 1 and y=h¼ 0. 9 for Rs¼ 2000. This property is a convenient tool in channel flow analysis since the velocity profile in the wall region can be accurately predicted from values much further away. We explore in some detail the properties that follow from this discovery...|$|E
