5|$|The New Industries Building was {{constructed}} in 1939 for $186,000 {{as part of a}} $1.1 million modernization scheme which also included the water tower, power house, officers' <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> remodeling of the D-block.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-governance}} purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, {{each of which has}} its own mayor (starosta) and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough. Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> localities.|$|E

50|$|Port Adelaide {{fought back}} in the third <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> outplayed the Eagles, but Port failed to {{capitalise}} due to inaccurate kicking for goal, scoring 2.6 (18) to 1.2 (8) for the <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> still trailing by 12 points.|$|R
25|$|The Engineers led 630 {{after the}} first <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> 1260 at halftime. Tech added 54 more points in the third <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> 42 in the final period. Cumberland's only {{effective}} defense was an extra point blocked {{with a sort of}} human pyramid.|$|R
5|$|For the album's {{striking}} front-cover image, Wilkes used a Kirlian {{photograph of}} Harrison's hand holding a Hindu medallion. The photo was taken at UCLA's parapsychology department, {{as was the}} shot used on the back cover, where Harrison instead holds three US coins: a couple of <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> a silver dollar.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{band and}} crew {{relocated}} from West Sussex to London. Their management rented a house at 13 Second Avenue, Acton Vale, {{which was used}} as living <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> for preparing the upcoming US tour when not away for gigs or promotion. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore went to live there with his German fiancée Babs Hardie.|$|E
5|$|Kharak Singh Haveli was the haveli of Kharak Singh, {{the heir}} to Ranjit Singh. It lies in the {{south-east}} of the Jahangir's Quadrangle.

5|$|Like Le Guin's earlier novel The Word for World Is Forest, {{this story}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished in Le Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve <b>Quarters</b> <b>and</b> Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, {{as well as in}} many other anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The base also {{contained}} a Noncommissioned Officers Club and an Officers Club. The Noncommissioned Officers Club, or Club 42 {{as it was}} known, allowed in all military members and civilians up the GS-7. Many varieties of food were also offered there, {{and it could be}} used for live entertainment, in addition to the booking of parties. As the Visiting Officers <b>Quarters</b> <b>and</b> the Unaccompanied Officers Quarters were nearby, the club was also a convenient stopover for transient officers as well.|$|E
5|$|The current El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park site sits between Anacapa and Garden Street on East Canon Perdido Street in {{downtown}} Santa Barbara.

5|$|There are two {{categories}} of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage, and free kicks. The free kicks are the kickoff, which starts {{the first and third}} <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the safety kick, which follows a safety.|$|E
5|$|These expeditions {{departed}} Egypt {{from the}} port of Ain Sukhna, on the western shore of the Gulf of Suez, as revealed by papyri and seals bearing Djedkare Isesi's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text mentioning yet another expedition to the hills of turquoise {{in the year of}} the seventh cattle count–possibly Djedkare's 14th year on the throne.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years in}} the making, The Homosexuals went through two {{producers}} and multiple revisions. The episode included interviews with several gay men, psychiatrists, legal experts and cultural critics, interspersed with footage of a gay bar and a police sex sting. The Homosexuals garnered mixed critical response. The network received praise from some <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> criticism from others for even airing the program.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{the program}} {{increased}} interest in <b>quarter</b> <b>and</b> general coin collecting. Large numbers of ads, <b>quarter</b> products <b>and</b> <b>quarter</b> information were available during the years the program ran. Home Shopping Network, Franklin Mint, and Littleton Coin Company {{were among the most}} prominent in ad space.|$|R

5|$|Two main {{divisions}} of quarters existed – the Warders' <b>Quarters</b> <b>and</b> the Indian Quarters. Before the war, the Warders' Quarters housed European warders, with large flats designed for one family each, and the Indian Quarters housed Indian prison guards, built with smaller flats. An average of thirty internees lived in each Warders' Quarters flat, {{and an average}} of six internees lived in each Indian Quarters flat.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, {{more than half}} a million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war may also have increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, as well as the stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{party is}} {{held for the}} team, and Dax and Kahn warm to one another's company once more. Afterward, they begin to socialize as they work {{together}} on Kahn's wormhole experiment aboard USS Defiant. They agree to have dinner, but to also bring Bashir along as a chaperone. At the dinner, Bashir feels out of place and is effectively ignored by the two Trills. Returning to the tests, Kahn creates the first artificial wormhole in history and Dax hugs her in celebration. Kahn's brother Bejal (Tim Ryan), {{who is on the}} science team, speaks to her separately and highlights his concerns regarding her contact with Dax. Despite this, Kahn goes to Dax's <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> a discussion between the two leads to a kiss; Kahn leaves before it goes any further.|$|E

5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records as American Construction Company. A temporary railway siding was created to aid in the delivery of building supplies. By 13 December 1918, several sheds had been completed, as were the Officers' Mess, sleeping <b>quarters</b> <b>and</b> the Navy and Army Canteen Board.|$|E
5|$|After bartering, {{he sells}} them {{the formula for}} liquid trellium-D, and also informs them that the Xindi {{recently}} visited a merchant nearby. Archer meets the merchant, Zjod, a slaver who tries to sell him a female called Rajiin. Archer refuses and leaves, but Rajiin chases after him. Following a fight between Archer and Zjod, the away team leave with Rajiin, and Archer promises to return her to her home planet. Later she approaches Archer in his <b>quarters,</b> <b>and</b> as she nears him she puts him in a trance, and he no longer remembers her visit. Meanwhile, T'Pol and Tucker attempt to replicate the chemical from B'Rat's formula but the first attempt fails.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living <b>quarters,</b> <b>and</b> neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
