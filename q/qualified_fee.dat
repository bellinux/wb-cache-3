40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the current tax {{treatment}} of athletic scholarships for U. S. federal income tax purposes from the perspectives of the scholarship-recipient, the college or university, and the parents/guardians. The paper also prescribes an approach that could effectively eliminate tax liability to the scholarship recipient and the institution. In general, only the portion of the "qualified" scholarship that covers the value of room and board is included in the gross income (earned income) of the scholarship recipient. The portion pertaining to <b>qualified</b> tuition, <b>fees,</b> books, supplies and equipment is entirely excludable (IRC Â§ 117). Strong evidence exists suggesting that the scholarship-recipient has entered into a valid "pay to remain eligible" employment contract with the scholarship-granting institution. If the scholarship requires the student athlete to live on campus and use the university meal plan, the value of the room and board would then be excludable from gross income under Â§ 119 - Meals and Lodging for the Convenience of the Employer. This interpretation has significant tax implications to the student-athlete and the institution since an exclusion from gross income under Â§ 119 also excludes the item from FICA tax, resulting in considerable tax savings. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In 2003, Médecins Sans Frontières, {{the provincial}} government, and the provincial health {{authority}} began a community project to guarantee financial access to {{primary health care}} in Karuzi province, Burundi. The project used a community-based assessment to provide exemption cards for indigent households and a reduced flat fee for consultations for all other households. Methods An evaluation {{was carried out in}} 2005 {{to assess the impact of}} this project. Primary data collection was through a cross-sectional household survey of the catchment areas of 10 public health centres. A questionnaire was used to determine the accuracy of the community-identification method, households' access to health care, and costs of care. Household socioeconomic status was determined by reported expenditures and access to land. Results Financial access to care at the nearest health centre was ensured for 70 % of the population. Of the remaining 30 %, half experienced financial barriers to access and the other half chose alternative sites of care. The community-based assessment increased the number of people of the population who <b>qualified</b> for <b>fee</b> exemptions to 8. 6 % but many people who met the indigent criteria did not receive a card. Eighty-eight percent of the population lived under the poverty threshold. Referring to the last sickness episode, 87 % of households reported having no money available and 25 % risked further impoverishment because of healthcare costs even with the financial support system in place. Conclusion The flat fee policy was found to reduce cost barriers for some households but, given the generalized poverty in the area, the fee still posed a significant financial burden. This report showed the limits of a programme of fee exemption for indigent households and a flat fee for others in a context of widespread poverty. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Louisiana {{is one of}} {{the easiest}} states to get on the ballot. Anyone may obtain a spot on the ballot by either paying a <b>qualifying</b> <b>fee,</b> or {{submitting}} petition signatures. For independent candidates for President (or non-recognized parties) the fee is $500 or 5000 signatures, with at least 500 from each Congressional district. Recognized Parties simply file their slate of Electors - their access is automatic, no fee or signatures required. For statewide office, the signature requirement is the same as that for President, but the fees are $750 for Governor and $600 for all other statewide offices. District and local office fees range from $40 or 50 signatures for a small town office, to $600 or 1000 signatures for US House. All signatures for district offices must come from within that district. If the office is for a political party committee, the signatures must be from people affiliated with that party. For Presidential Preference Primaries, the fee is $750 or 1000 signatures affiliated with that party from each Congressional district.(pdf) Present Louisiana law only allows for Presidential Primaries if a party has more than 40,000 registered voters statewide. Currently, this only applies to the Democratic and Republican Parties. Louisiana law changed in 2004 under efforts from the Libertarian Party of Louisiana to relax rules in place at that time for recognizing political parties in the state. There are now two methods to gain official recognition. Method A allows a party to be recognized if it pays a $1000 fee AND has 1000 or more voters registered under its label. To retain recognition, it must field a candidate at least once in any four-year period in a statewide election - with no requirement on performance in the election. Statewide election slots include Presidential Elector, Governor, Senator, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Comm. of Insurance, and Commissioner of Agriculture. To date, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have used this method to attain and retain official party recognition. Method B allows a party to be recognized if one of its candidates in a statewide race or for Presidential Elector achieves 5% of the vote. To retain recognition, it must repeat the 5% tally for statewide office or Presidential Elector at least once in any four-year period. To date, the Reform Party has used this method to gain and retain official party recognition. Due to their size, parties recognized by these methods are exempt from certain laws governing public elections of political committee offices and from certain financial reporting requirements until their membership reaches 5% of registered voters statewide. Recognized political parties in Louisiana are allowed to have their party name appear alongside their candidates on the ballot, and for their party to be offered as a specific choice on voter registration cards. Non-recognized parties appear as OTHER, and the party name must be written in on the registration card. Non-affiliated voters are listed as N for No Party. In the 2008 and 2010 Congressional elections, Louisiana experimented with closed primaries for House and Senate. Under this system, recognized parties participated in semi-closed primaries before the general election. Only one candidate from each party was allowed on the General Election ballot; there was no limit for OTHER or NONE. An attempt to pass a law differentiating [...] "minor" [...] parties similar to the rule for Presidential Primaries was defeated but made irrelevant by Louisiana reverting to its [...] "Jungle Primary" [...] system where all candidates, regardless of number from any party, all compete together on the same ballot. If no one achieves a majority, a general election is held as a run-off between the top two, also regardless of party affiliation.|$|R
40|$|In an {{application}} game, agents {{decide whether to}} apply for the prize, and reviewing applica- tions allows the decision maker to learn agent qualifications and award prizes to qualified agents. The decision maker finds reviewing applications costly, and prefers not to review applications from agents with sufficiently low probability of being <b>qualified.</b> Positive application <b>fees</b> and time delays can assure that only those with a high-enough probability of being qualified apply for prizes. Applied to the journal submission process, in which tenured and untenured academic authors are affected differently by time delays, the model shows that using time delays instead of higher submission fees benefits tenured authors at the expense of both untenured authors and journal quality. Applied to the process of applying for a permit when there are both rich and poor potential applicants, the model shows that the decision maker should impose both application fees and time delays (e. g., red tape). In this case, eliminating fees benefits poor agents, while it harms rich agents and the decision maker; eliminating red tape benefits rich agents, while it harms poor agents and the decision maker. journal submission, red tape, application fees...|$|R
40|$|In 2003 – 04 {{over half}} a million {{students}} attending the 109 California community colleges received about one billion dollars in financial aid to help meet their college expenses. Nearly all of the aided students received Board of Governors Fee Waivers to cover their enrollment fees. Less than one-half of the aided stu-dents also received federal Pell grants to help cover other educa-tion expenses, such as books and supplies, food, housing, and transportation costs, while enrolled. Both {{in terms of the}} number of students served and the total aid funds provided, the federal Pell grants and the Board of Governors Fee Waivers are the most important financial aid programs for California community college students. Both programs are need-based, which means that eligibility is primarily determined by income, and most of the awards go to lower income students. Pell grants require the student to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This long and complicated applica-tion form is used to calculate an index called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC index, which is largely based on family or personal income and assets (but considers other factors as well), is used to determine eligibility for Pell grants and other federal student aid programs. The federal aid application is also used to qualify applicants for a Board of Governors (BOG) Fee Waiver. However, students may choose to file the shorter and separate BOG fee waiver application instead of the federal form to <b>qualify</b> for a <b>fee</b> waiver. Since it is shorter and less complicated than the FAFSA, some students file only the BOG fee waiver application and skip the federal aid application...|$|R
