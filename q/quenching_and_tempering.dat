40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> shaft has been done. Prediction was done for two different manufacture processes. In the first manufacture process the shaft was made of steel and in second one the shaft was made of cast steel. The working stress was characterized by yield strength and impact toughness. The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of quenching using a finite volume method. Hardness of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steel can be expressed as function of maximal hardness of actual steel, hardness of steel with 50 % of martensite in microstructure, according to the time <b>and</b> temperature of <b>tempering.</b> The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and impact energy was based on hardness, HV. Starting point in studying of the mechanical properties of steel castings can be {{the fact that the}} mechanical properties of steel castings are derived from the mechanical properties of ordinary steel metal matrix reduced by the influence of the typical as-cast structure, i. e. casting defects on those properties. Hardness and yield strength will be unaffected by most defects. The only effect will be that due to the reduction in area. Coarse as-cast microstructure of cast steel lowers ductility and toughness. Impact energy of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> cast steel was predicted based on pouring temperature, temperature of mould during the pouring and fact that steel castings are not subjected to different metallurgical and mechanical processes of microstructure improvement in so far as wrought steels. Findings: It can be concluded that working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> shaft can be successfully predicted by proposed method.

50|$|As one of {{the last}} {{processes}} in fabricating a sword is <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> it.

50|$|Precise {{control of}} time and {{temperature}} during the tempering process is crucial to achieve the desired balance of physical properties. Low tempering temperatures may only relieve the internal stresses, decreasing brittleness while maintaining {{a majority of the}} hardness. Higher tempering temperatures tend to produce a greater reduction in the hardness, sacrificing some yield strength and tensile strength for an increase in elasticity and plasticity. However, in some low alloy steels, containing other elements like chromium and molybdenum, tempering at low temperatures may produce an increase in hardness, while at higher temperatures the hardness will decrease. Many steels with high concentrations of these alloying elements behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which produces the opposite effects under the conditions found in <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering,</b> and are referred to as maraging steels.|$|E
5000|$|During heat treating, a {{blacksmith}} causes phase {{changes in the}} iron-carbon system {{in order to control}} the material's mechanical properties, often using the annealing, <b>quenching,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> processes. In this context, the color of light, or [...] "blackbody radiation," [...] emitted by the workpiece is an approximate gauge of temperature. Temperature is often gauged by watching the color temperature of the work, with the transition from a deep cherry-red to orange-red (815 C to 871 C) corresponding to the formation of austenite in medium and high-carbon steel. In the visible spectrum, this glow increases in brightness as temperature increases, and when cherry-red the glow is near its lowest intensity and may not be visible in ambient light. Therefore, blacksmiths usually austenize steel in low-light conditions, to help accurately judge the color of the glow.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} metal alloys is a {{significant}} part of materials science. Of all the metallic alloys in use today, the alloys of iron (steel, stainless steel, cast iron, tool steel, alloy steels) make up the largest proportion both by quantity and commercial value. Iron alloyed with various proportions of carbon gives low, mid and high carbon steels. An iron-carbon alloy is only considered steel if the carbon level is between 0.01% and 2.00%. For the steels, the hardness and tensile strength of the steel is related to the amount of carbon present, with increasing carbon levels also leading to lower ductility and toughness. Heat treatment processes such as <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> can significantly change these properties, however. Cast Iron is defined as an iron-carbon alloy with more than 2.00% but less than 6.67% carbon. Stainless steel is defined as a regular steel alloy with greater than 10% by weight alloying content of Chromium. Nickel and Molybdenum are typically also found in stainless steels.|$|E
50|$|Martensitic transformation, more {{commonly}} known as <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering,</b> is a hardening mechanism specific for steel. The steel must be heated to a temperature where the iron phase changes from ferrite into austenite, i.e. changes crystal structure from BCC (body-centered cubic) to FCC (face-centered cubic). In austenitic form, steel can dissolve a lot more carbon. Once the carbon has been dissolved, the material is then quenched. It is important to quench with a high cooling rate so that the carbon does {{not have time to}} form precipitates of carbides. When the temperature is low enough, the steel tries to return to the low temperature crystal structure BCC. This change is very quick since it does not rely on diffusion and is called a martensitic transformation. Because of the extreme supersaturation of solid solution carbon, the crystal lattice becomes BCT (body-centered tetragonal) instead. This phase is called martensite, and is extremely hard due to a combined effect of the distorted crystal structure and the extreme solid solution strengthening, both mechanisms of which resist slip dislocation.|$|E

50|$|The fuel {{used was}} {{invariably}} charcoal, and {{the products were}} the bloom (a solid mass of iron) and slag (a liquid waste product). African ironworkers regularly produced inhomogeneous steel blooms, especially in the large natural-draft furnaces. The blooms invariably contained some entrapped slag, and after removal from the furnace had to be reheated and hammered to expel {{as much of the}} slag as possible. Semi-finished bars of iron or steel were widely traded in some parts of West Africa, as for example at Sukur on the Nigeria-Cameroon border, which in the nineteenth century exported thousands of bars per year north to the Lake Chad Basin. Although many African ironworkers produced steel blooms, there is little evidence in sub-Saharan as yet for hardening of steel by <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> or for the manufacture of composite tools combining a hard steel cutting edge with a soft but tough iron body.

5000|$|Metals can be {{heat-treated}} {{to alter}} the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and/or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, precipitation strengthening, <b>quenching,</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged {{so that when the}} metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel; the harder the steel, the less tough or impact-resistant it is, and the more impact-resistant it is, the less hard it is. Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.|$|E
5000|$|Diffusion {{hardening}} {{can be done}} in {{many different}} ways to achieve different hardnesses and different surface finishes on metal parts. Some of the different diffusion hardening operations include: Carburizing, Nitriding, Carbonitriding, Nitrocarburizing, Boriding, Titanium-carbon diffusion, and Toyota diffusion. While diffusion hardening is performed mainly on steel parts and carbon is mainly the element used for diffusion, diffusion hardening can also be performed with other diffusion elements and with other metals. In nitriding, nitrogen is diffused into the surface of steel, but can also be used with metals such as Aluminum, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Vanadium. [...] Besides metals and diffusion elements used, diffusion hardening processes differ in the temperature required for diffusion, the phase of the diffusion element, and additional treatments such as <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering.</b> These different factors greatly affect surface finish and dimensional accuracy of a part. A quenched and tempered part does not have the same dimensional accuracy as a part that has not undergone such a process. Also, they can affect the efficiency of the overall process. In carburizing, the carbon can be in any of the solid, liquid, or gas phases. Although using carbon in the solid phase is usually the safest and easiest of these to work with, the process is difficult to control and the heating is inefficient. All these things must come into consideration when choosing a diffusion hardening process.|$|E
