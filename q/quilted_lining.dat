50|$|Originally {{it was a}} mere {{stitched}} and <b>quilted</b> <b>lining</b> ("doubling"), worn under a hauberk or cuirass {{to prevent}} bruising and chafing. Doublets were frequently opened to the waistline in a deep V. The edges might be left free or laced across the shirt front. If there was space left it might be filled with a stomacher. By the 1520s, {{the edges of the}} doublet met at the center front. Then, like many other originally practical items in the history of men's wear, from the late 15th century onward it became elaborated enough to be seen on its own. A similar jacket, the sherwani, is worn today in India.|$|E

40|$|This {{coat was}} {{designed}} for a Hmong American woman who wants bring her culture with her by never forgetting the people who brought her to where she is and wants to forever embrace her heritage. The coat is made of wool with vintage Hmong embroidered textile and faux leather details. The Hmong fabric is sun worn, stained and has uneven stitches, things usually considered defects, but here they are a celebration of history, and culture. The jacket features welt pockets, machine <b>quilted</b> <b>lining,</b> notched collar, and asymmetrical hem. The pattern was created using flat pattern and draping techniques. This coat has {{a great sense of}} cohesion by showcasing the purpose of the coat with incorporating meaningful textile that tells a story.

5000|$|In 1977, James’s {{first solo}} {{exhibition}} of quilts was shown at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts and included Tossed Salad, Razzle Dazzle, Elaborated Tangram, and Night Sky I. With {{the exception of}} Night Sky I, the quilt tops were assembled with varied combinations of hand and machine piecing using straight-edged shapes—squares, triangles, and trapezoids. Night Sky I, however, was a whole cloth quilt that was quilted entirely with curvilinear lines. Influenced {{by the work of}} Robert and Sonia Delaunay, the sequel, Night Sky II, recreated the <b>quilted</b> <b>lines</b> of Night Sky I in a pieced top that incorporated curved seams, instead of straight-edged pieces, and marked a new approach in James’s technique and style. The piece was selected for the “Young Americans: Wood, Plastic, Fiber, Leather” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City in the fall of 1977. [...] Over the next couple of years, James continued to explore the possibilities of curved piecing in three other quilts that became a part of his Sky series: Aurora, Moonshadow, and Dawn Nebula. All were notable, as well, for having asymmetrical settings, {{despite the fact that they}} were assembled in the standard quilt block style.|$|R
50|$|Slavard armament, too, is {{not known}} for being {{intricate}} or adorned. This people often wears a felted, leather, or <b>quilted</b> jacket <b>lined</b> with metal plates or ring mail, as well as high-top boots, riveted bracers, gauntlets, and an open bevelled helmet with nose guards. Chainmail pieces are rare in the North, normally only worn by Jarls and their militiamen. In the Empire, though, nearly every Slavard, whether he be a professional warrior, a trader, or a craftsman, keeps chainmail at home.|$|R

40|$|Cloche of rose straw. The high, rounded crown is of finely braided rose/pink colored straw. At {{one side}} is an applique in green, beige, peach, and brown of a stylized floral design in silk taffeta with colored straw {{detailing}} and outlines. Around {{the base of the}} crown is a segment of rose satin <b>quilted</b> with <b>lines</b> of copper and tan straw, turned up at front to form a brim and turned downwards at back. The hat is lined in an iridescent red satin. There are no labels in the hat...|$|R
50|$|The 1970s / 1980s {{civilian}} {{version of}} the parka was made in many colours - navy blue, green, brown, black, maroon, grey, royal blue, sky blue and bright orange. Most having an orange diamond <b>quilted</b> nylon <b>lining.</b> Although {{a very small number}} did have alternative coloured linings such as yellow, pale blue and green. Whilst still manufacturing parkas to the military standard, Alpha Industries have more recently adopted the orange lining and a slimmer fit when producing their VF59 model parka which is now more popular than the military version.|$|R
6000|$|Yet--to {{anticipate}} here--when years after, an old Jew Clothesman rummaged over a surtout of Pierre's--which by some means {{had come}} into his hands--his lynx-like fingers happened to feel something foreign between the cloth and the heavy <b>quilted</b> bombazine <b>lining.</b> He ripped open the skirt, and found several old pamphlet pages, soft and worn almost to tissue, but still legible enough to reveal the title--"Chronometricals and Horologicals." [...] Pierre must have ignorantly thrust it into his pocket, in the stage, and it had worked through a rent there, and worked its way clean down into the skirt, and there helped pad the padding. So {{that all the time}} he was hunting for this pamphlet, he himself was wearing the pamphlet. When he brushed past Plinlimmon in the brick corridor, and felt that renewed intense longing for the pamphlet, then his right hand was not two inches from the pamphlet.|$|R
50|$|The deerstalker is {{most often}} made of cloth, often a light or heavy wool tweed, {{although}} deerstalkers made of suede, white cotton duck and even denim are not unknown. The cap is made of six (or eight) triangular panels with rounded sides which are sewn together. If {{the sides of the}} panels are cut in a way giving them slightly rounded shoulders midway, the crown will become more squared and flatter rather than hemispherical. The cap may be deep or shallow, barely touching the tops of the ears, according to the whim of the hatter. Either way it is usually lined with an inner cap of satin, polished cotton or similar lining fabrics. Occasionally one can find a deerstalker with a lightly <b>quilted</b> satin <b>lining.</b> The deerstalker's main features are a pair of bills or visors worn in front and rear. These are usually stiffened with pasteboard, cardboard or layers of heavy canvas.|$|R
50|$|The ayam {{generally}} {{consists of}} mobu (모부, a crown) and deurim (드림) which are shaped like daenggi (댕기) {{or a big}} ribbon. The upper 4-5 cm part of the mobu is finely <b>quilted,</b> the vertical <b>line</b> of the front shorter than the back's. On the bottom edge, the front part is more curved than the back. In addition, the vertical lines of {{the front and back}} are a little curvy, so that, when wearing an ayam, it fits well to one's head. Black or purple silk is used for the upper quilted part of the outer fabric, while black or dark brown fur is used {{for the rest of the}} mobu. The fabric for the inner is red cotton flannel.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, the band's uniform was {{identical}} to that worn by the RHA troops: khaki Service Dress with boots with puttees. The headdress was the khaki Service Dress cap, with a black leather chin strap, which continued to be worn by the Mounted Band until its last days. On the right arm forearm of the jacket, was a khaki worsted lyre, unique to artillery musicians.After the war, the band adopted, as its 'ceremonial' uniform, the No. 1 Dress jacket (blues) with scarlet facings, replaced the tunic. The corresponding No. 1 Dress trousers sporting a wide scarlet stripe on the outside seam were worn. Service stripes were permitted on No. 1 Dress jackets, and the RA stable belt continued to be worn. The busby was not reintroduced until the 1960s, the headdress of the time being the No. 1 Dress peaked cap. Interestingly, the Royal Artillery Woolwich Band continued to wear the band sword image of the sword can be found by following the link {{at the bottom of}} the page with this uniform. Standard pattern black leather shoes were worn. After the reintroduction of the busby, close-fitting cavalry-style trousers were adopted, and these were buckled under the instep of the 'George' boot, by the aid of leather straps. Silver dress spurs were screwed to the heel of the boot. The stable belt was no longer worn, but replaced by the standard officer pattern leather cross belt, worn over the left shoulder, which was covered in 18 carat gold wire, with a small black patent leather pouch, onto which a gilt RA gun badge was fastened.In preparation for the birthday parade for Her Majesty The Queen, on Horse Guards Parade, London (June 1986), musicians from the surviving RA (Woolwich), and RA (Alanbrooke) bands were measured for the new design of tunic, in navy with scarlet cuffs and collar, <b>quilted</b> silk <b>lining,</b> and additional 18 carat gold braiding. The braiding was more pronounced according to the rank of the wearer. This is the design that continues to be worn by the present Royal Artillery Band.|$|R
50|$|The {{suit was}} double-breasted, with six gold buttons and four square pockets, two on each side. The fabric {{was a light}} weight wool from Linton Tweeds in a nubby weave known as bouclé. The color was {{raspberry}} although most press reports described it as strawberry pink. The wide <b>quilted</b> collar, jacket <b>lining</b> along with the piping trim on the sleeves {{and at the top}} of each pocket was navy blue silk. There were two gold buttons on each sleeve. The suit came with a sleeveless navy silk shell blouse. For cool weather, Kennedy would wear a matching navy silk scarf knotted at the neck and tucked into the front of the jacket, which she did in Dallas. Accompanying the suit was a trademark pillbox hat in matching pink with a band of navy piping around the crown. Kennedy carried a navy handbag with gold buckle and gold chain handle. She wore low heeled navy shoes with a small gold ornament at the toe. A gold bangle bracelet on her left wrist and short white kid leather gloves with tiny wrist buttons completed her outfit. Most of the American public viewing pictures of the presidential couple on television and in newspapers between 1961 and 1963 would not have known the color of the suit, given {{that at the time of}} the assassination TV news was still in black and white and newspapers did not print color photographs. The color of the suit became widely known only after the publication of color photos in Life magazine's JFK memorial issue November 29,1963 and in Life's Warren Commission report issue October 2,1964.|$|R
