40|$|The modern queens {{maintenance}} {{systems are}} based on the use of artificial insemination, queens’ maintenance in the so called „queens bank”, in this way assuring an increased economic efficiency in beekeeping. This study aimed to compare the economic efficiency of the implementation of A. I. to various queen bees maintenance systems. Three alternatives have been taken into account: V 1 -a queen bee in a cage together with her bees, V 2 - a <b>queen</b> <b>bank</b> system and V 3 – a queen bee in a nucleus. For each queen bee maintenance alternative have been evaluated the most important indicators such as: expenses, incomes, profit, number of marketable inseminated and selected queen bees, honey production, cost/queen, revenue/queen, profit/queen, profit rate. The most effective alternative was the <b>queen</b> <b>bank</b> system assuring 2, 400 marketable queen bees and 20 kg honey delivered yearly, USD 12, 442 incomes, USD 3, 400 expenses, USD 9, 042 profit, that is USD 3. 77 /queen bee and 265. 72 % profit rate under the condition as A. I. costs are just USD 1, 058, representing 31. 1 % of total queen bees maintenance costs...|$|E
40|$|Main {{topics of}} this thesis are aging and social {{homeostasis}} in eusocial insects {{in light of}} the evolutionary biology. The keystone of studies presented here are questions how eusociality evolved and is maintained. Chapter 1 comprises a review of theories concerning evolution of eusociality, evolutionary theories of aging, as well as major issues regarding aging of eusocial insects and social homeostasis. Chapter 2 presents studies on sexual cooperation and longevity in honeybee (Apis mellifera). Contrary to solitary insects, in eusocial species insemination itself is expected to increase lifespan of a female. However testing this prediction on honeybee turned out to be impossible as (1) queens inseminated with non-viable sperm are recognized and killed by workers, and (2) they experience increased mortality when kept in semi-isolation (<b>queen</b> <b>bank</b> approach). Studies presented in chapter 3 exemplify mechanism protecting social insect colonies from the spread of pathogen. Moribund workers of the ant Temnothorax unifasciatus (Myrmicinae) show striking adaptation on the individual level: they cease all social contacts and leave nest to die in isolation. Chapter 4 presents how functional sterility of workers is achieved in colonies of different size and relatedness among individuals. In the ant T. unifasciatus the sterility is enforced by policing: reproducing workers are attacked by their nestmates, that induce workers to refrain from reproduction. I show that policing effectiveness (proportion of reproducing workers which are policed) is influenced by the group size and relatedness among colony members in manifold way. Chapter 5 discusses proximate and ultimate factors influencing evolution of labour division. I present data indicating that workers of the ant T. unifasciatus divide into low fecund foragers and high fecund intra-nidal workers. The reproductive aging of workers is not dependent on chronical age, but is an effect of phenotypic plasticity. The findings shed light on the evolution of eusociality suggesting that reproductive labour division could have evolved from differences in fecundity among related cooperative breeders...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dementia {{is one of}} the {{milestones}} {{of advanced}} Parkinson's disease (PD), with its neuropathological substrate still being a matter of debate, particularly regarding its potential mechanistic implications. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} review the relative importance of Lewy-related α-synuclein and Alzheimer's tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) pathologies in disease progression and dementia in PD. METHODS: We reviewed studies conducted at the <b>Queen</b> Square Brain <b>Bank,</b> Institute of Neurology, University College London, using large PD cohorts. RESULTS: Cortical Lewy- and Alzheimer-type pathologies are associated with milestones of poorer prognosis and with non-tremor predominance, which have been, in turn, linked to dementia. The combination of these pathologies is the most robust neuropathological substrate of PD-related dementia, with cortical Aβ burden determining a faster progression to dementia. CONCLUSION: The shared relevance of these pathologies in PD progression and dementia is in line with experimental data suggesting synergism between α-synuclein, tau and Aβ and with studies testing these proteins as disease biomarkers, hence favouring the eventual testing of therapeutic strategies targeting these proteins in PD. </p...|$|R
