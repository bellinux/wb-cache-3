50|$|We can notice {{from the}} {{equations}} above {{that the total}} ordering cost decreases as the <b>production</b> <b>quantity</b> increases. Inversely, the total holding cost increases as the <b>production</b> <b>quantity</b> increases. Therefore, {{in order to get}} the optimal <b>production</b> <b>quantity</b> we need to set holding cost per year equal to ordering cost per year and solve for quantity (Q), which is the EPQ formula mentioned below. Ordering this quantity will result in the lowest total inventory cost per year.|$|R

Video portals and online videos were at its infancy. Carlson stated that the Nerd popularized independent viral video reviews made from the perspective of an average gamer. It was a purely independent in nature, from the simple and old-school cinematography right down to the camcorder-based video editing.

Later episodes have alternated from straightforward game reviews to those with a narrative focus resembling a documentary, with Rolfe pointing out information about the game or gaming console under review.
