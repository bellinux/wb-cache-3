40|$|North Sea {{fisheries}} {{are managed}} by the European Union (EU) through a system of annual <b>quota.</b> Due to uncertainty about future fish stocks, yearly revisions of these policies lead to fluctuation in <b>quota,</b> which in turn affects harvest and investment decisions of fishermen. Determination of <b>quota</b> requires high management costs in terms of obtaining information and negotiations between experts and policy makers. To reduce both <b>quota</b> fluctuation and management costs, the EU has proposed a system of multiannual <b>quota.</b> In this paper we study the effect of multiannual <b>quota</b> on <b>quota</b> volatility and resource rents, while accounting for management costs. We develop a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model, where at level one, the EU determines the <b>quota</b> that maximizes resource rents. At level two, fishermen decide myopically on their harvest and investment levels, subject to the <b>quota.</b> Results show that policy makers can reduce <b>quota</b> volatility and improve resource rents from the fishery with multiannual <b>quota.</b> Important trade-offs {{are involved in the}} accomplishment of these objectives: fish stock and investments become more volatile, which leads to more overcapacity...|$|R
40|$|In Ireland, {{the trade}} of milk <b>quota</b> is subject to {{regional}} restrictions and a large variation in <b>quota</b> prices between regions has caused some controversy.

The analysis reveals that <b>quota</b> is undervalued in the border, midlands and west and south-west regions, while milk <b>quota</b> is overvalued in the east and south regions.

5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production <b>quotas</b> given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} individual {{workers to}} work hard and produce as much as they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a piece-rate; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual <b>quotas</b> for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage (stavka) by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a Stakhanovite spirit of overfulfillment of <b>quotas</b> among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.|$|E
