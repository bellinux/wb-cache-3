40|$|Austria's transit exports (foreign {{exchange}} receipts) totaled AS 90 {{billion in}} 1993, transit imports reached AS 79. 5 billion. The surplus in <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> was AS 10. 5 billion, {{an order of}} magnitude that has consistently been achieved since 1990. Thus, <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> is (following tourism) {{one of the most important}} positive items in Austria's current balance, covering about 10 percent of the deficit in the trade balance. Trade mediated by Austrian enterprises in international <b>trade</b> is called <b>transit</b> <b>trade.</b> Austrian enterprises buy merchandise abroad and sell it in a third country. Transactions of this kind are included in the balance of payments but not in the foreign trade statistics. In the past, Austria was mainly active in mediating trade flows between East and West. The demise of the centrally planned economies in the East eliminated important reasons for the existence of <b>transit</b> <b>trade.</b> Nonetheless, the turnover of Austria's <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> did not drop after the collapse of the Communist systems but has even shown a slight upward trend. Austria's <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> managed to find new tasks even under vastly changed circumstances. This includes, in particular, mediating foreign trade between the Eastern countries as well as functioning as wholesaler for small and medium-sized private enterprises in Eastern Europe. In 1993, 43 percent of Austria's transit exports were destined for Eastern Europe. The most important buyer was Hungary (11 percent), ahead of Russia (6 ½ percent), the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Poland (each about 5 ½ percent). 33 percent of Austria's transit exports were sold to Western Europe (Germany 13 percent). EFTA's share in 1993 (6 ½ percent) was only half as high as in 1982. 22 percent of goods in transit went to developing countries, with East-Asia an important market. Almost half of transit imports originated in Western Europe, with Germany (17 percent) the most important supplier. Almost one third of the transit merchandise was imported from the Eastern countries, mainly Russia (8 percent) and Hungary (6 percent). Merchandise from developing countries accounted for 15. 6 percent in 1993. The value of trade flows mediated by Austrian firms between the various regions can only be estimated. In 1993, West-East <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> may have totaled some AS 25 billion, and East-West <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> AS 11 to 12 billion. Intra-East <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> and trade from the East to developing countries each amounted to between AS 7 and 8 billion. Hungary's statistics on intermediary trade with the Eastern countries yield rough estimates of the size of Austria's <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> in intra-Eastern trade. About 30 percent of Hungary's exports to the Eastern countries and about 30 percent of Hungary's imports from the Eastern countries were mediated by third countries in 1991 and 1992. <b>Transit</b> <b>trade</b> has evolved in market economies as an instrument to surmount trade barriers. This suggests that Austria's role as middleman between the successor states of the Soviet Union and some successor states of Yugoslavia and the West, Eastern Europe, and the developing countries might not diminish but even increase in the near future. Austria's role in mediating trade between East-Central Europe and the West and also within East-Central Europe is likely to be maintained, however, only if <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> takes on additional functions.

50|$|The strategical {{importance}} of this project was reduced when Afghanistan offered Pakistan access to Central Asia via the Afghanistan-Pakistan <b>Transit</b> <b>Trade</b> Agreement. However, in recent years, Afghanistan insisted that India be included in their bilateral <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> {{as a condition for}} allowing Pakistan access to Central Asia, even threatening to cut off the agreement if it was not reciprocated. Pakistan's tensions with India made such an arrangement difficult. The QTTA provides Pakistan an alternative gateway to Central Asia by completely circumnavigating Afghanistan.

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate and provide an insight for monitoring and controlling the trade supply chain within and among different countries by using technological advancement (i. e. an electronic tracking system, etc.); furthermore, facilitate the local and intra-regional trade among countries through reviewing the recent trends and practical implementation of an electronic transit traffic and cargo that related to customs measures by introducing and supporting some case studies of several international and landlocked <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> countries. The research methodology employed in this study was described as qualitative by conducting few interviews with managers, transit truck drivers, and traders and reviewing the related literature to collect qualitative data from secondary sources such as statistical reports, previous studies, etc. The results in this study show that Jordan and other countries around the globe that used an electronic tracking system for monitoring <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> has led to a significant reduction in cost, effort and time in physical movement of goods internally and crossing through other countries. Therefore, there is no need to escort transit trucks by customs staff; hence, the rate of escort transit trucks is reduced by more than ninety percent, except the bulky and high duty goods. Electronic transit traffic has been increased; the average transit time journey has been reduced by more than seventy percent and has led to decrease in rates of smuggling up to fifty percent. The researcher recommends considering Jordan as regional and international office for tracking electronically and monitoring the <b>transit</b> <b>trade</b> for many considerations...|$|R
