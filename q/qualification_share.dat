40|$|The {{early years}} sector has seen {{considerable}} {{change over the}} last 15 years, and increased attention from government {{has led to the}} reframing of regulatory frameworks, an agenda for professionalising the workforce, and new employment and qualification opportunities for those wishing to work with young children, although little of this change has been driven by the workforce itself. This study explores what today’s practitioners consider to be their role and their professional identity through semi-structured interviews with 23 early years practitioners with Level 5 and 6 <b>qualifications,</b> <b>sharing</b> narratives about their own experience. A narrative approach offers the opportunity to make private experience public(Chase, 2008). It is this personal, private construction of self I wish to uncover - what practitioners consider to be the important, salient points about their roles, and their identity (Lieblich et al, 1998). Recent research into practitioners' experiences has focussed the impact of introducing a status for lead practitioners (Brock, 2012; Chalke, 2013), or has identified practitioner-articulated constructions of good practice and professional identity as unsophisticated and demonstrating limited agency in their perceptions of themselves as constructors of knowledge (Brownlee et al, 2000; Berthelsen et al, 2007). However, my own research focus is to identify, in a field where change has been driven by funders and policy makers, and there is much rhetoric about raising practitioners’ qualifications in order to claim a professional status, what practitioners consider their role to be, with what agency this is expressed, and if they are in fact articulating a definition of professionalism. Initial data analysis concurs with Oberhuemer’s (2005) concept of ‘democratic professionalism’. However, the language to articulate this is commonplace and although the role described includes much of Moss’ (2006 a) ‘discourse of pedagogy’, it is still expressed in terms of care, a feminised and instinctive personal disposition, rather than high level academic knowledge, undermining their social and cultural capital. Early years researchers including Moss (2006 b), Osgood (2010), argue that professionalism is evidenced by this workforce taking responsibility for constructing its own knowledge base, and questions its practice in order to improve. Whilst my own data support this perception, they also raise the issue of if, in the teaching of reflective practice to practitioners, we need to revise concepts of professionalism to recognise the skills and knowledge practitioners apply in the workplace, and support them in learning a new vocabulary to apply to their work...|$|R

The beliefs of 24 veterinarians in 5 practices in England were quantified as probability density functions. Classic multidimensional scaling revealed major variations in beliefs both within and between veterinary practices which included: confident optimism, confident pessimism and considerable uncertainty. Of the 9 veterinarians interviewed holding further cattle <b>qualifications,</b> 6 <b>shared</b> a confidently pessimistic belief in the efficacy of systemic therapy and whilst 2 were more optimistic, they were also more uncertain. A Bayesian model based on a synthetic dataset from a randomised clinical trial (showing no benefit with systemic therapy) predicted how each of the 24 veterinarians’ prior beliefs would alter as the size of the clinical trial increased, assuming that practitioners would update their beliefs rationally in accordance with Bayes’ theorem. The study demonstrated the usefulness of probabilistic elicitation for evaluating the diversity and strength of practitioners’ beliefs. The major variation in beliefs observed raises interest in the veterinary profession's approach to prescribing essential medicines. Results illustrate the importance of eliciting prior beliefs when designing clinical trials in order to increase the chance that trial data are of sufficient strength to alter the clinical beliefs of practitioners and do not merely serve to satisfy researchers...|$|R

ORSA recovery system, integrated into the ogive nose cone. With the intention to gain more independency from the North American market and the inherent procurement and ITAR regulations problems, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken initiative to contract industry for the development and built-up of a new European Recovery System (ERS) in 2006. For the design, manufacturing and <b>qualification</b> task <b>sharing,</b> a cooperation of DLR Moraba and the Kayser-Threde GmbH has been initialized. The ERS is designed to recover payloads of up to 450 kg mass and 17 inch (438 mm) diameter by a two-stage subsonic parachute system. It features a separating ogive nose tip with a forward deploying recovery parachute. The assembly incorporates a 3 : 1 fineness ratio ogive which forward portion is ejected exo-atmospherically to permit subsequent parachute recovery system operation. The aft ogive houses the parachute system, autonomous redundant pyrotechnic ignition system, housekeeping electronics, TM interface, beacon system, camera system and pyrotechnic and electronic batteries. The parachute system activation is controlled by barometric switches on the descent trajectory at a nominal altitude of 15 kft (4. 6 km) in the combination of an electronic timing activation unit (ignition unit). Together with the heat shield ejection the drogue parachute is deployed and the payload is mainly stabilized from flat spin and decelerated. After complete stabilization the drogue parachute is separated and extracts the main parachute out of the deployment bag. At fully opened main parachute the final sink rate is around 8 m/sec. ...|$|R

Given evidence that: (a) urban areas are more developed than rural areas, (b) development and educational quality correlate positively, (c) school characteristics {{account for about}} 80 percent {{of the variation in}} pupil achievement in less developed countries, and (d) learning assessment in Brazil is not centralized, the reported "pass rates" are paradoxical and call for clarification. This is the problem this thesis approaches from a quanti-qualitative focus. Survey data on achievement scores, school results and the correlations between these measures of pupil attainments indicate that "pass rates" enmesh teachers' set learning goals. High school results / lower achievement scores in rural areas, which lack significant correlations, suggest lower quality education geared towards rote-learning. Lower school results / higher achievement scores in urban areas, with weak-moderate positive correlations signal more complex cognitive demands and improvement of educational quality through content understanding. Therefore, "pass rates" have specific meanings and are not suitable as comparison of performance of different schools. The ethnography of an urban school illuminates the survey findings and unveil the meaning of "pass rates" from the viewpoint of "successful" classroom practices. In a context of similar <b>qualifications</b> teachers <b>share</b> a progressive pedagogical discourse but their classroom practices portray diversity of educational quality and corresponding learning achievement standards. Teaching approaches, displayed in a typology (based in textbook use and pupils participation in the lesson), represent a continuum from rote-learning to the recreation of knowledge. Options for teaching approaches are compromises between educational ideals and existing constraints. These include teachers' competence (rooted in their background), the ethos and culture of the school, and external demands on schooling. Pupils' responses to teaching approaches embody their appraisal of the process, the subjectmatter, and prevailing teacher-pupil affective ties. Ultimately learning outcomes expressed through "pass rates" represent distinctive teaching practices and learning results...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{ethics is}} a complex field of study {{that focuses on the}} sources and role of moral {{expectations}} among modern corporate stakeholders. While there has been significant theoretical development and adoption by practitioners on the topic over the past thirty years in the field, ethical scandals persist, almost at unprecedented levels. The pressure to meet short term shareholder financial targets, the lack of consistency and clarity of moral expectations among stakeholders, the corporation as an imperfect social environment, all contribute to the status quo where corporate ethics can be a familiar but elusive goal. At the same time, there have been fundamental changes in the flow of information recently. Information now flows as speeds and volumes unimaginable thirty years ago. More importantly, it now flows through very decentralized patterns such as social media which have changed the ability of corporations to manage their reputation and brand. This paper focuses on one concept within the broader field of ethics, virtue, in an attempt to better understand the role that it currently plays, but also could play, in business ethics by studying its application in persuasion. Chapter I provides an overview of the concept of ethos which can be roughly translated as moral character, and positions {{it in the context of}} the modern corporation. Corporate moral character is evidenced through the decisions a company makes via its decision-makers and actors, which often have an impact on the various stakeholders including customers, clients, the government etc. Chapter II traces the relationship between virtuous conduct and corporation reputation management. It proposes that virtue, through its role in ethos can be intrinsically beneficial to a corporation and a competitive advantage in the marketplace in terms of corporate reputation, which is increasingly viewed as a valuable asset. According to Aristotle, Ethos has three components; virtue, practical wisdom and goodwill towards others (Arist. Rhet I. 2, 1356 a). Ethos is a critical element to persuasion along with pathos (use of emotion) and logos (use of logic); speakers that embrace all three in a message will be more persuasive. Corporations routinely rely on persuasion to be effective and successful, from advertising to sales, to employee relationships. Chapter III then proposes corporate virtue as a form of Shared Value (SV), a theory proposed by Porter and Kramer (2011). While Shared Value has received critical acclaim over the years as an economic theory effectively and efficiently promoting the interests of the broader society at the same time as the interests of the modern corporation, the theory has been challenged more recently for its lack of clear definition and ability to be implemented properly. This chapter argues that corporate virtue meets the <b>qualifications</b> of <b>Shared</b> Value, and should be promoted within corporations in view of its influence on persuasion, positively benefitting the company, and the positive effects that virtue has on corporate stakeholders like society, employees, government etc. Chapter IV explores the concept of persuasion at a higher level, particularly as it can be related to organizational communications and organizational rhetoric. Persuasion is a concept that has likely existed as long as there has been communication [...] The study of persuasion can be traced back to ancient Greece where Aristotle put structure to the process as a means of creating an educated citizen, an element critical to emerging democracies. The chapter is framed around the notion that persuasion as a means of attitude change can be developed in a more instrumental manner characterized by one way communication such as traditional marketing and public relations efforts. The chapter proposes that persuasion can also be developed in a more deliberative manner, which is supported in the etymological root persuadere, emphasizing a more ethical discourse including two way communication and more equal bargaining position. It then looks at how persuasion is developed in the organizational context today, including advances in the social sciences to better understand the mechanisms of persuasion including the Elaboration Likelihood Model, inoculation theory model and expectancy value theory, suggesting that persuasion in a deliberative manner is underdeveloped in organizational rhetoric. Lastly, Chapter V describes the advent and implications of corporate reputation risk through the case study of Goldman Sachs in 2008. Reputation risk develops when actual corporate behaviour deviates from the reputation that the corporation has among its stakeholders in regards to any particular trait. To the degree there is a difference between a corporation’s reputation or how it is perceived in regards to a particular topic such as product quality, timeliness, altruism, truthfulness, and its actual behaviour, then reputational risk may develop to the degree that its reputation, an increasingly valuable asset to companies today, may be devalued. To the degree that ethical or virtuous conduct is a component of a corporate brand, which is critical particularly in service industries such as banking, any lack of consistency with actual conduct could have significant financial implications. Collectively these chapters demonstrate how virtue and its role in persuasion serves as a common denominator in business ethics, and a valuable vehicle to promote ethical conduct in a complicated social environment called capitalism...|$|R
40|$|IN THE FLURRY {{of concern}} over the {{appointments}} of vocal right-wingers to the ABC board - Ron Brunton, Janet Albrechtsen and now Keith Windschuttle - the broadcaster 2 ̆ 7 s supporters {{are in danger of}} losing focus. Demonising individuals doesn 2 ̆ 7 t help. The real dangers are in commercialisation, which the broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 supporters should do all they can to resist; and beyond that, in the new board members 2 ̆ 7 guiding concepts on nationality and history. With all its acknowledged value in nation-building, the ABC has survived 74 years in the teeth of recurrent political hostility, no matter which party was in power. Windschuttle?s anxieties about alleged Marxists and radicals come in a longer tradition than he may realise. It 2 ̆ 7 s more than 40 years since the RSL began alleging Communist influence inside the broadcaster - that was after Allan Ashbolt 2 ̆ 7 s legendary Four Corners, in August 1962, on the RSL 2 ̆ 7 s political strength. In late 1978, the outgoing commissioner Richard Harding told a press conference that the Fraser government had reduced the ABC to 2 ̆ 7 a timid, dispirited and punch-drunk organisation. 2 ̆ 7 In protest against funding cuts and the abolition of the position of staff-elected commissioner, held at that time by Marius Webb, the staff engaged in rolling strikes. ?Save the ABC? rallies were held in several cities; Friends of the ABC circulated a wonderful poster showing Aunty on the rampage in flying petticoats, stilt heels, brolly and handbag. The Commission survived further strictures and punishments through the prolonged period of the Dix Committee of Review, became a Corporation, endured the enmity of Labor governments ? the moment when presenter Jane Singleton pulled the plug on Bob Hawke remains an agreeable comic memory ? and lived to fight another day. Remember the Mansfield report? This is not to say plus ?a change, plus c?est la m?me chose. The broadcaster?s survival {{has a lot to do}} with the resilience of good liberal journalism and an unsinkable public demand for it. But while no government likes independent critical enquiry, our present masters like it even less than most. These appointments do constitute the threat of destruction from within, but not because Windschuttle and company amuse themselves with oldstyle Cold War games. (Reds under the Kath and Kim sofas, or Peter Cundall?s garden-beds? It?s a charade.) What matters is that they?re likely to promote advertising in or between programs. Opposition to ads on the ABC is generally read as nothing more than cultural snobbery, middle-class aversion to crassness. But for the ABC, commercials ? however limited and regulated, in however much bland good taste ? would be the thin end of a malignant wedge: increased dependence on chancy commercial revenue, further decreases in public funding, and the inevitable inhibition of critical content in line with advertisers? pressures and competition with other channels. With those threats looming, public broadcasting needs all the friends it can get. The kinds of supportive action taken 30 years ago mightn?t work now; a strike of program-makers would probably be ammunition for the enemy. Better to email the minister, her colleagues and your local members ? particularly to those on the Coalition side, to independents, and to those representing regional and remote Australia. Justice should be seen to be done. Ideally, nobody should be considered for board membership without a clear commitment to the principles in the ABC?s Charter, particularly those on independence for the purposes of ?adequate and comprehensive? programming. Neither Senator Coonan nor those she has appointed show any such allegiance. Challenged by Mark Colvin on PM about political balance, she evaded the issue, appealing to ?a mix of skills? and invoking Windschuttle?s past concerns with media and journalism. But it?s rather as though a Labor government had appointed John Pilger ? instead of, say, some more discriminating left-liberal like Stuart Macintyre or Judith Brett. It?s all further evidence on the government?s disquieting insulation from informed opinion at large. Coonan seems amazingly unaware of how far middle-class Australia is, and wishes to be, anti-racist; and their special take on race relations, along with intransigent hostility to liberal critique per se, is what links together her choices from the Quadrant lineup. Both Brunton and Windschuttle have campaigned strenuously against pro-Aboriginal treatments of history; Brunton most visibly through the Hindmarsh Island case, Windschuttle ? with support from Albrechtsen ? in the output of his Macleay Press. It?s on this score that Senator Coonan should have brought in at least one real opponent, and there?s no shortage. Here again, the senator is marvellously deaf; Windschuttle?s version in particular has been systematically discredited from positions right across the range, from Martin Krygier?s gentle conservativism to the Green Left Weekly. Among much else, James Boyce?s long essay ?Fantasy Island? in Robert Manne?s collection Whitewash (Black Inc., 2003) surveys the great spread of evidence ignored by Windschuttle on the Aboriginal Tasmanians; he finds ?a view of the past disconnected from the lives of real people who lived in Van Diemen?s Land. ? Elsewhere in the same volume, the indigenous scholar Greg Lehman, speaking for his Tasmanian kind, offers the clearest brief indictment I?ve seen of the Windschuttle project: ?We aspire to ? a future for ourselves where conflict, racism and separatism might become just steps along the way to something much better. This future is not to be found in the pages of The Fabrication of Aboriginal History. All Windschuttle offers us is an ignoble death in the past. He is consumed by the absurd task of telling the dead how to die. ? As that book and others demonstrate, we do owe Windschuttle a debt. He has incited a whole expansion of necessary analysis, and compelled anti-racist intellectuals in all corners of the field to know better what we?re about. That, however, is no <b>qualification</b> for a <b>share</b> in governing the ABC. By ironic default, these appointments suggest that Aboriginal issues, especially questions of historical understanding, are not merely contentious; they are central to the imagined community, the nation. In the absence of clear and full acknowledgement, Aboriginal history threatens the over-cherished positions of Gallipoli, Anzac, masculine mateship and the rest of John Howard?s private gallery (never say the man lacks imagination). There is a fear of deep human difference, and an attendant fear of serious national responsibility. Those fears underlie much of the government?s broad self-protective agenda, its program for the ABC included. Here once more, the denial of Aboriginal claims works rather like a boomerang. Sent off repeatedly, they keep on coming back. ? Sylvia Lawson has published widely on culture and politics.
