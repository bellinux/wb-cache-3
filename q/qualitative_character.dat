50|$|In {{modeling}} of psychological systems the systematization and classification {{play a very}} important role.With the development of statistics {{in the description of}} weight of the trait (or type) in society, the character of the trait (type) distribution becomes very important. It is also important, if the distinctions of trait have a quantitative or <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> for the adequate interpretation of practically every research in the field of differential psychology, understanding of certain fundamental statistical concepts is required."There are at least three various theories of the psychological types worked out by psychologists. Some authors represent types as separate classes that exclude each other. Some others psychologists accept the theory of types as more or less detailed trait theory, defining the types as poles of one and same continuum between which people may be ranked by the law of normal distribution. The adepts of the third view believe that the types differ from the traits by having multimodal distributions in which the people are grouped with in definite points, representing pure types".

5000|$|Sydney Shoemaker (born 1931) is an American philosopher. He was the Susan Linn Sage Professor of Philosophy at Cornell University. He holds a PhD from Cornell and BA from Reed. In 1971, he {{delivered}} the John Locke Lectures at Oxford University. He has worked {{primarily in the}} philosophy of mind and metaphysics, and has many classic papers in both of these areas (as well as their overlap). In [...] "Functionalism and Qualia" [...] (1975), he argues that functionalism about mental states can account for the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> (or 'raw feel') of mental states. In [...] "Self-Reference and Self-Awareness" [...] (1968), he argues that the phenomenon of absolute 'Immunity to Error Through Misidentification' is what distinguishes self-attributions of mental states (such as [...] "I see a canary") from self-attributions of physical states (such as [...] "I weigh 200 pounds"). In metaphysics, he has defended the view that laws are metaphysically necessary, a position that follows from his view of properties as clusters of conditional causal powers. He has also applied his view of properties to the problem of mental causation. He also has distinguished contributions to the literature on self-knowledge and personal identity, where he defended a Lockean psychological continuity theory in his influential paper [...] "Persons and their Pasts". In his recent work on the content of perception, he has argued for a distinctive version of internalist representationalism.|$|E

Sixteen sweet cassava accessions of the Regional Cassava Germplasm Bank of the Cerrado were evaluated under field conditions, for 13 quantitative and 33 <b>qualitative</b> <b>characters.</b> In the laboratory, the accessions were evaluated with RAPD markers.

40|$|Kriegel’s self-representationalist (SR) {{theory of}} phenomenal {{consciousness}} pursues two projects. The {{first is to}} offer a positive account of how conscious experience arises from physical brain processes. The second is to explain why consciousness misleadingly appears to be irreducible to the physical i. e. to ‘demystify’ consciousness. This paper seeks to determine whether SR succeeds on the second project. Kriegel trades on {{a distinction between the}} subjective character and <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of conscious states. Subjective character is the property of being a conscious state at all, while <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> determines {{what it is like to}} be in that state. Kriegel claims that SR explains why subjective character misleadingly appears irreducible, thereby neutralising the apparent irreducibility of consciousness. I argue that although SR credibly demystifies subjective character, it cannot explain why <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> also appears irreducible. I conclude that we should pursue the possibility of a hybrid position that combines SR with an account that does explain the apparent irreducibility of <b>qualitative</b> <b>character.</b> ...|$|E

(1) physicalism is true (2) the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of {{experience}} is real, as most naively understood [...] . so (3) the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of experience (considered specifically as such) is wholly physical. ‘How can consciousness possibly be physical, {{given what we}} know about the physical?’ To ask this question is already to have gone wrong.

40|$|When you gaze at {{a sunset}} or taste a peach, {{there is a}} {{subjective}} feel to be had. This subjective "feel" {{is referred to as}} the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of experience. My goal is to argue that a certain ontological theory of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of experience is more plausible than has been granted. The theory in question is called panpsychism. Roughly, panpsychists argue that in order to account for the <b>qualitative</b> <b>character</b> of experience, we must take the world to be, at its most fundamental level, "experiential. " In slogan form, panpsychism might be summed up as "If humans are subjects of experience, then electrons are subjects of experience. " There are three questions that the panpsychist proposal immediately raises. First: Why think that experiential phenomena cannot be novel phenomena but rather must be already present at the most fundamental levels of reality? Second: Precisely how are we to understand the claim that experiential phenomena are present at the fundamental level of reality? Third: Isn't it absurd to think that experiential phenomena are present at the fundamental level of reality [...] to think that there is something it is like to be an electron? I address each of these three questions in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{standard}} view {{in philosophy}} of {{mind is that}} qualia and phenomenal character require consciousness.
