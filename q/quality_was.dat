40|$|Earlier {{models of}} quality {{differentiation}} {{showed that the}} qualities, of differentiated products, were lowered below efficient levels. Recently, <b>qualities</b> <b>were</b> shown to be enhanced, not degraded, in some cases. This paper presents a complete characterization of quality choices under vertical product differentiation by incorporating and refining assumptions on consumer preferences and production technology. This paper shows {{that the decision to}} distort quality depends on where the firm's competition <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> located: <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> degraded below (enhanced above) the efficient level when the reservation (or competition) <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> lower (higher) than efficient <b>qualities</b> which <b>are</b> the levels of quality observed in a competitive market (i. e. where marginal willingness to pay equals marginal cost). If the reservation <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> between the two efficient <b>qualities,</b> there <b>is</b> no <b>quality</b> distortion. In competitive markets, the reservation <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> the <b>quality</b> of a substitute good offered by competitors, and thus <b>quality</b> distortion <b>is</b> always present if a multi-product firm competes only at the fringes of its product range. If the competition is in the middle, the firm loses any leverage to distort quality and increase profits. Introducing many levels of <b>quality</b> may <b>be</b> motivated by the desire to fill the gaps in the quality spectrum to maximize control over the quality space. This paper confirms the assertion that the quality distortion occurs at the quality level whose per unit profit margin is lower.

5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The test results indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; test results indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The test results confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|After a {{rejection}} of his poems by an eastern periodical, Riley began to formulate a plot to prove his work was of good quality {{and that it was}} being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem. The Dispatch published the poem and reported it as such. Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem to be authentic, the majority did not, claiming the <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> too poor to be authored by Poe. An employee of the Dispatch learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the Kokomo Tribune, which published an expose that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax.

Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs.

5|$|Attention {{to water}} <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
