This mother goddess was conceived as a virgin, one who has given birth to all and one, typically associated with Shaktism. The temples of the Sangam days, mainly of Madurai, seem to have had priestesses to the deity, which also appear predominantly a goddess. In the Sangam literature, there is an elaborate description of the rites performed by the Kurava priestess in the shrine Palamutircholai. Among the early Dravidians the practice of erecting memorial stones “Natukal or Hero Stone had appeared, and it continued for <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> after the Sangam age, down to about 16th century. It was customary for people who sought victory in war to worship these hero stones to bless them with victory.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century the eastward {{movement}} of Russian people was slowed by the internal {{problems in the}} country during the Time of Troubles. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. While Cossacks came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russian people came by the Arctic Ocean. These were Pomors from the Russian North, who already had been making fur trade with Mangazeya {{in the north of}} the Western Siberia for <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> In 1607 the settlement of Turukhansk was founded on the northern Yenisey River, near the mouth of the Lower Tunguska, and in 1619 Yeniseysky ostrog was founded on the mid-Yenisey {{at the mouth of the}} Upper Tunguska.|$|E

The two had known each other for <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> as Csizmadia served as a prison lieutenant in Puebla when Díaz was held as captive there. On one occasion Díaz refused to be taken to the bathroom by a low-rank prison guard when Csizmadia offered to personally escort him there, which was an unusual courtesy. He even invited the General for a lunch at his house, who accepted it. The lieutenant dealt with his inmate amicably and they even attended a bullfight together. Díaz only refused a closer friendship to evolve because he feared to having been labeled pro-Imperialist, and that would have ruined his image. On 20 September 1865 he successfully escaped from the prison using a rope and a dagger with the acquiescence and consent of the Hungarian officer. He praised Csizmadia's generous and noble attitude towards him several times in his later memoirs. This was the reason he was looking for the captured Csizmadia after the siege and allowed him and his Hungarian regiment to move to Vera Cruz and to be taken home {{on the board of the}} Austrian ship SMS Novara along with the rest of the Austrian corps. Csizmadia also helped to negotiate the same terms of surrender for the Austrians as well.|$|E

How far Zhangzhung stretched to the north, east and west is a mystery...
