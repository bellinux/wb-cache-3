Compared to 1990, by 2000 capital investment in the industry had decreased thirty percent and the number of specialists <b>qualified</b> in <b>fishing,</b> navigation and processing technologies had decreased 30 to 40 percent. The Barents Sea cod fishery {{is an example of the}} dominance of elderly and ineffective vessels. Between 2002 and 2005, forty percent of effort in the demersal fishery was by elderly freezing trawlers, which produced only twenty-five percent of the official catch. That is, they were 1.5 times less effective than the other vessels in the fleet. Equivalent modern trawlers are three to four times as effective. The low efficiencies of these elderly vessels also implicates them in involvements with IUU catch.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine support of marine recreational fishers for each of the various types of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the Northwest Atlantic. Further, to explore the extent that differences exist between those who strongly support MPAs {{and those who do not}} strongly support MPAs within a specific region of the Northwest Atlantic across a wide variety of demographic, behavioral, perceptual and attitudinal variables. The primary research instrument for this study was a mail questionnaire administered using a mixed method research design yielding 208 completed surveys by persons meeting <b>qualifying</b> characteristics (<b>fish</b> in open ocean). Our research found that roughly half of participat-ing marine recreational anglers support MPAs. However, the extent and strength of that support depends on the specific objectives of the MPA, the restrictions imposed on saltwater anglers and the specific location of the MPA. The research also suggests that anglers who support MPAs are more likely to believe specific benefits, such as increased size of fish stocks, will result from the MPA...|$|R

We {{studied and}} {{compared}} {{the effects on}} cell viability, sensitivity to the anti-tumor drug 5 -fluorouracil, and lipid composition, in colon cancer Caco- 2 cells after 24 h incubation with oils and hydrophilic extracts obtained from two bottarga samples stored at different conditions. The cellular absorption of bottarga lipids was assessed in cancer cells by the evaluation of lipid accumulation in cytoplasmic lipid droplets by fluorescence microscopy. Bottarga oil showed a significant in vitro inhibitory effect on the growth of cancer Caco- 2 cells {{and the ability to}} potentiate, at non-toxic concentration, the growth inhibitory effect of 5 -fluorouracil. Moreover, bottarga oil induced in cancer Caco- 2 cells marked changes in fatty acid composition, with a significant accumulation of the n- 3 PUFA EPA and DHA, and cytoplasmic lipid droplet formation. Also bottarga hydrophilic extract, characterized by means of 1 H NMR spectroscopy, exhibited a reduction in cancer cell viability, without affecting cell lipid profile. Cell cholesterol levels were unmodified by all treatments. The results showed interesting anti-tumor properties of bottarga lipids, and <b>qualify</b> this <b>fish</b> product as a food with nutraceutical properties and potential benefits in colon cancer prevention...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{entitled}} "The Anatomy of a Minimal Mind". By a "minimal mind" I mean the simplest kind {{of mind that}} could exist. As there is widespread philosophical disagreement about what a mind is, or what mental states are, I refrain from assuming {{at the outset that}} a minimal mind has to be phenomenally conscious, or subjectively aware. 0 f events in its surroundings. My objective is to identify the requirements that an organism would have to satisfy, before it could be credited with possessing a mind of any sort, however rudimentary. I then attempt to develop a detailed model of this minimal mind, using a conservative methodological approach: we should not interpret an organism's behaviour as a manifestation of underlying mental states unless doing so enables us to make better scientific predictions about its behaviour and/or explain its behaviour more fully. In section A, chapter one, I discuss the philosophical background to the contemporary discussion of minds and mental states. I defend the controversial claim that only living things can be said to have minds or mental states, and I argue that there are no convincing grounds for rejecting the common view that mental states are real phenomena. This in no way implies the more controversial view that all mental phenomena share some distinguishing feature that characterises them as mental. If, however, there is some distinguishing property which is common to all mental states, and only those states, then the two most promising philosophical candidates for this property would surely be consciousness and intentionality. I argue that the different varieties of consciousness distinguished by philosophers fail to "carve nature at the joints". I then analyse {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} three common definitions of intentionality. Lastly, I examine Dennett's intentional stance and argue that the two ways in which it can be formulated are in fact quite distinct. I propose that one of these formulations, which I refer to as the agent-centred intentional stance, can be used to help us identify creatures with minimal minds. In section B (chapters two to eight), I attempt to identify the necessary conditions for intentional agency in creatures, by examining several broad categories of behavioural and biological properties that have been proposed in the philosophical and scientific literature as relevant to having a mind, and sifting through them, all the while attempting to put together a constructive definition of a "minimal mind". In particular, I discuss sensory capacities (including discriminatory ability and perception); memory; flexible behaviour patterns; the ability to learn; self-directed movement and control; the ability to correct one's mistakes; and the ability to form concepts. Within each category of "mind-relevant" properties, I examine the different ways in which these properties are realised by different kinds of organisms, at various levels of complexity. The biological case studies that 1 discuss range from the relatively simple (viruses) to the most complex (vertebrates, especially birds and mammals). In section C, I list about a dozen detailed conditions that an animal has to meet before it can be said to possess this kind of "minimal mind", which, 1 argue, is the most basic kind of mind anything can have. Perhaps the most crucial condition is that the animal possess an internal "minimal map" by which it represents the means it has to adopt to achieve its ends, enabling it to steer itself around its environment. 1 argue that animals whose maps are of the right sort can be said to have beliefs, desires and intentions. Finally, 1 claim that these "minimal minds" come in no less than four different varieties. Operant agency, navigation using visual landmarks, tool use and the social practice of following a guide are all behaviours that manifest mental states. Although these states are not phenomenally conscious states, 1 argue that the intentionality they possess is fundamentally the same as that found in conscious mental states. In the end, I conclude that many insects and spiders, as well as octopuses and squid, and of course <b>fish,</b> <b>qualify</b> as having minimal minds.
