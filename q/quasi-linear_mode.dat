40|$|Design of {{electric}} motors which fulfill {{the needs of}} Thrust Vector Control (TVC) actuators used in large rocket propelled launch vehicles is covered. To accomplish this end the methodology of design is laid out in some detail. In addition a point design of a motor {{to fulfill the requirements}} of a certain actuator specified by MSFC is accomplished and reported upon. In the course of this design great stress has been placed on ridding the actuator of internally generated heat. To conduct the heat out of the motor use is made of the unique properties of the in house MSFC designed driving electronics. This property is that as along as they are operated in a <b>quasi-linear</b> <b>mode</b> the electronics nullify the effects of armature inductance as far as the phase of the armature current versus the rotor position is concerned. Actually the additional inductance due to the extended end turns in this design is of benefit because in the shorted armature failure mode the armature current in the fault (caused by the rotor flux sweeping past the armature) is diminished at a given rotor speed when compared to a more conventional motor with lower inductance. The magnetic circuit is analyzed using electromagnetic finite element methods...|$|E
40|$|Far-field" {{artifacts}} are {{presumed to}} contribute negligibly {{to the field}} potential activity recorded from brain slices maintained in vitro. While performing paired intracellular and field potential recordings from rat neocortical slices superfused with medium containing 4 -aminopyridine + GABA receptor antagonists, we identified: (i) epileptiform discharges characterized by concomitant field oscillations (amplitude = 2. 6 - 6. 4 mV) and intracellular depolarizations as well as (ii) smaller amplitude (0. 3 - 1. 3 mV) field epileptiform events that were not associated with any intracellular activity. By placing an additional extracellular recording electrode into adjacent slices, we discovered that large amplitude, epileptiform discharges were generated concomitant to those seen in the first slice at the field potential level only. In addition, We found in these slices small amplitude, field discharges that were synchronous with those recorded intracellularly in the original slice. Analysis {{of the changes in}} field potential amplitude over space demonstrated that this parameter was reduced by approximately 60 % when the recording electrode was moved from the slice generating the epileptiform activity to the bathing medium and further decreased in a <b>quasi-linear</b> <b>mode</b> when recordings were obtained from an adjacent slice. fit conclusion, these observations indicate that brain slices can, under appropriate conditions. produce field potentials that are of amplitude sufficient for being recorded from other slices in the tissue chamber. These findings suggest that caution should be taken in assuming that field potential activity seen in an in vitro brain slice is generated within the recorded tissue. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Tests {{of gravity}} at the galaxy scale {{are in their}} infancy. As a first step to {{systematically}} uncovering the gravitational significance of galaxies, we map three fundamental gravitational variables – the Newtonian potential, acceleration and curvature – over the galaxy environments of the local universe to a distance of approximately 200 Mpc. Our method combines the contributions from galaxies in an all-sky redshift survey, halos from an N-body simulation hosting low-luminosity objects, and linear and <b>quasi-linear</b> <b>modes</b> of the density field. We use the ranges of these variables {{to determine the extent}} to which galaxies expand the scope of generic tests of gravity and are capable of constraining specific classes of model for which they have special significance. Finally, we investigate the improvements afforded by upcoming galaxy surveys...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a mixed {{quadrilateral}} plane element with drilling {{degrees of}} freedom using Allman's interpolation scheme is developed. The assumed stress space includes three constant stress <b>modes</b> and four <b>quasi-linear</b> stress <b>modes</b> which are equilibrating for regular element geometry. Owing to the intrinsic orthogonality of the constant and higher order stress modes, the element is particularly efficient. Only a 4 × 4 symmetry matrix is required to be inverted while no incompatible displacement modes are involved. The element has two spurious kinematic modes which, however, can effectively be suppressed by using two very simple stabilization matrices. A number of popular benchmark problems are examined and the accuracy achieved is very satisfactory. © 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{structure}} surveys {{promise to}} be the next leading probe of cosmological information. It is therefore crucial to reliably predict their observables. The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) provides a manifestly convergent perturbation theory for the weakly non-linear regime of dark matter, where correlation functions are computed in an expansion of the wavenumber k of a mode over the wavenumber associated with the non-linear scale k_nl. Since most of the information is contained at high wavenumbers, it is necessary to compute higher order corrections to correlation functions. After the one-loop correction to the matter power spectrum, we estimate that the next leading one is the two-loop contribution, which we compute here. At this order in k/k_nl, there is only one counterterm in the EFTofLSS that must be included, though this term contributes both at tree-level and in several one-loop diagrams. We also discuss correlation functions involving the velocity and momentum fields. We find that the EFTofLSS prediction at two loops matches to percent accuracy the non-linear matter power spectrum at redshift zero up to k~ 0. 6 h/Mpc, requiring just one unknown coefficient that needs to be fit to observations. Given that Standard Perturbation Theory stops converging at redshift zero at k~ 0. 1 h/Mpc, our results demonstrate the possibility of accessing a factor of order 200 more dark matter <b>quasi-linear</b> <b>modes</b> than naively expected. If the remaining observational challenges to accessing these modes can be addressed with similar success, our results show that there is tremendous potential for large scale structure surveys to explore the primordial universe.

40|$|We reexamine {{interactions}} between the dark sectors of cosmology, {{with a focus on}} robust constraints that can be obtained using only mildly nonlinear scales. While {{it is well known that}} couplings between dark matter and dark energy can be constrained to the percent level when including the full range of scales probed by future optical surveys, calibrating matter power spectrum emulators to all possible choices of potentials and couplings requires many computationally expensive n-body simulations. Here we show that lensing and clustering of galaxies in combination with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is capable of probing the dark sector coupling to the few percent level for a given class of models, using only linear and <b>quasi-linear</b> Fourier <b>modes.</b> These scales can, in principle, be described by semi-analytical techniques such as the effective field theory of large-scale structure.

40|$|The {{nature of}} spin wave modes excited by spin-polarized direct current in a spin-torque auto-oscillator {{based on a}} {{magnetic}} nanocontact was studied by a micromagnetic simulation in the case when the external bias magnetic field was rotated from the in-plane to perpendicular-to-plane orientation. In qualitative agreement with the weakly-nonlinear analytical theory it was found, that at a certain critical angle, an abrupt switching from the self-localized nonlinear "bullet" mode to a propagating <b>quasi-linear</b> Slonczewski <b>mode</b> takes place, and is accompanied by an upward jump in generated microwave frequency. It was, also, found that the analytical theory overestimates the magnitude of a critical magnetization angle, corresponding to the mode switching, and that {{the magnitude of the}} frequency jump caused by the mode switching is inversely proportional to the nanocontact radius.

40|$|A {{theory for}} the spatial {{development}} of linearly unstable, coupled waves {{is presented in}} which both <b>quasi-linear</b> and <b>mode</b> coupling effects are treated in a self-consistent manner. Steady state excitation of two waves is assumed at the boundary x = 0, the plasma being homogeneous in the y and z directions. Coupled equations are derived for the x dependence of the amplitudes of the primary waves and the secondary waves, correct through second order terms in the wave amplitude, but without usual approximation of small growth rates. This general formalism is then applied {{to the case of}} coupled ion acoustic waves driven unstable by an ion beam streaming {{in the direction of the}} x axis. If the modifications of the ion beam by the waves (quasi-linear effects) are ignored, explosive instabilities (singularities in all of the amplitudes at finite x) are found, even when all of the waves have positive energy. If these wave-particle interactions are included, the solutions are no longer singular, and all of the amplitudes have finite maxima...|$|R
40|$|A {{theory of}} the ion heating due to {{electrostatic}} ion cyclotron (EIC) waves in the auroral zone is presented. Due to the slowly convecting nature of the EIC <b>mode,</b> <b>quasi-linear</b> plateau formation cannot stabilize the waves, and growth occurs until the nonlinear mechanisms of ion resonance broadening and electron trapping provide saturation. The large amplitude and coherent nature of the resulting wave imply that quasi-linear theory provides only a lower limit to the ion heating. An upper bound on the heating rate is derived using a time-average model of ion dynamics in the coherent waves. The effects of ion heating {{in the presence of}} the magnetic gradient force and parallel electric fields are considered, with the result that perpendicular energies over 100 eV are easily attainable from a 1 eV source plasma. Perpendicular heating in the absence of a parallel electric field yields conical ion distributions, which in the presence of an electric field become field-aligned beams...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, MRI-driven {{turbulent}} transport {{has been found}} to depend in a significant way on fluid viscosity ν and resistivity η through the magnetic Prandtl number Pm=ν/η. In particular, the transport decreases with decreasing Pm; if persistent at very large Reynolds numbers, this trend may lead to question the role of MRI-turbulence in YSO disks, whose Prandtl number is usually very small. In this context, the principle objective of the present investigation is to characterize in a refined way the role of dissipation. Another objective is to characterize the effect of linear (channel <b>modes)</b> and <b>quasi-linear</b> (parasitic <b>modes)</b> physics in the behavior of the transport. These objectives are addressed {{with the help of a}} number of incompressible numerical simulations. The horizontal extent of the box size has been increased in order to capture all relevant (fastest growing) linear and secondary parasitic unstable modes. The major results are the following: i- The increased accuracy in the computation of transport averages shows that the dependence of transport on physical dissipation exhibits two different regimes: for Pm ≲ 1, the transport has a power-law dependence on the magnetic Reynolds number rather than on the Prandtl number; for Pm > 1, the data are consistent with a primary dependence on Pm for large enough (∼ 10 ^ 3) Reynolds numbers. ii- The transport-dissipation correlation is not clearly or simply related to variations of the linear modes growth rates. iii- The existence of the transport-dissipation correlation depends neither on the number of linear modes captured in the simulations, nor on the effect of the parasitic modes on the saturation of the linear modes growth. iv- The transport is usually not dominated by axisymmetric (channel) modesComment: 11 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|In limiter H-modes of JIPP T-IIU, a {{new type}} of L-H {{transition}} preceded by an ELM is observed. The preceding ELM (pre-ELM) appears just prior to the L-H transition. This type of transition is usually observed in H-modes of JIPP T-IIU. The L-H transition without the pre-ELM is triggered only in the case when a sufficiently large rapid current ramp down is emploied. In H-modes with constant q(a) ~ 3. 5 - 4. 5, coherent magnetic oscillations with m= 3 /n= 1 destabilized during L-phase are further enhanced at the pre-ELM, and suppressed suddenly at the transition. This mode is situated in the region of the transport barrier. Propagation frequency of the m= 3 /n= 1 mode, which may be affected by plasma mass rotation, rises appreciably (by ~ 10 %) during H-phase with frequent ELMs, but remains unchanged for at least 200 mu s after the transition. Behaviours of the m= 3 /n= 1 and m= 2 /n= 1 modes are well explained by <b>quasi-linear</b> resistive tearing <b>mode</b> analysis for modelled toroidal current density profiles slightly detached from the limiter. These experimental results suggest that the transition is controlled by the change of a magnetic field structure relating to the modification of a toroidal current density profile near the edge. The possibility for the development of edge radial electric field {{as a consequence of the}} transition is discussed. ...|$|R
