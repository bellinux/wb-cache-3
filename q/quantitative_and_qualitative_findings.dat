40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{contribute}} to a better understanding of extreme response style in cross-cultural research by integrating <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> evidence in a mixed methods design. In the quantitative phase, indexes of extreme response style, derived from quality of life measures from different international studies, were compared between Spain and the Netherlands. Results indicated that extreme responding was more common among Spanish than among Dutch in endorsement of items, but that the opposite was found for frequency scales including never as a response anchor. In the qualitative phase, cognitive interviews were conducted with 25 participants in each country. The integration of <b>quantitative</b> results <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>findings</b> suggests that country differences in extreme response style may stem from various sources, including the more independent evaluation of each item by Dutch, the stronger connotations of never for Spanish and stronger emotions triggered by specific topics such as work satisfaction that was more strongly associated with insecurity for Spanish. It is concluded that the integration of <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> evidence can help to understand cross-cultural similarities and differences in extreme response style...|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} energy surface (PES) for bare, mono and di-hydrogenated nickel clusters is constructed using the extended-Hϋckel approximation. The parameters are optimized and good agreement with theoretical and experimental results is obtained without including a posteriori coordination dependent terms. The global minimum {{and the first}} few low-lying isomers of several nickel clusters are investigated {{using a variety of}} minimization techniques. The difference in energy between isomers is much smaller than the Ni-Ni dissociation energy. Both geometric and optical isomers are found for many cluster sizes. In some cases symmetric nuclear configurations give rise to orbital degeneracies in the adiabatic surface which lead to distortions. The hydrogen atom is most frequently found on the surface. All isomers of NinH 2 contain a dissociated hydrogen molecule. The results are in good agreement with <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> experimental <b>findings</b> on this system...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the advantages of}} combining <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>findings</b> concerning the wider benefits of adult learning. The research issue is a broad one that was under‐researched when the projects were conducted. Quantitative and qualitative projects addressed different facets of this issue. Mostly, they were designed and conducted separately, and combined only at the stage of interpreting findings. We therefore refer to the project as multi rather than mixed method research. The advantages of combining methods in this research fall into the five categories presented as purposes of mixed methods research by Greene, Caracelli, and Graham (1989) : initiation, triangulation, complementarity, development and expansion. I suggest that initiation, which refers to the new perspectives that are developed when researchers attempt to combine apparently contradictory <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>findings,</b> is conceptually distinct from the other advantages. Unlike the other four advantages, it is not associated with particular and concrete outcomes, such as additional evidence for validity (triangulation), developing a fuller picture of the research issue (complementarity) or expanding {{the scope of the}} research (expansion), its design and implementation (development). Rather, initiation is a process through which the reconciliation of apparently contradictory findings leads to triangulation, complementarity, development and expansion. The ease with which findings from different methods are reconciled is a dimension that applies to multi‐method research, which is highlighted by initiation. It bears on the creativity and innovation associated with triangulation, complementarity, development and expansion...|$|E

Based {{on a combination of}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> data, <b>findings</b> are presented in relation to ten well established traditional techniques and ten of the more prominent new techniques selected from a review of current literature. The findings indicate that traditional techniques continue to dominate management accounting systems, with heavy emphasis on financial measures of control and performance evaluation. Usage of new techniques is generally low, but tends to be highest in those companies reporting high usage of traditional techniques. It is therefore suggested that the main contribution of these techniques may be in supplementing, as opposed to replacing, traditional techniques. Significant differences were found based on company ownership and size, suggesting a high degree of tailoring to suit particular circumstances. The discussion highlights specific findings which appear inconsistent either with one another or with conventional wisdom, and suggests that these may offer valuable insights into current practice. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: To date, {{research}} has not sufficiently addressed {{the impact of}} personnel preparation programs on secondary special educators in relationship to specialized competencies needed to impact students during transition from school to adult life. This study sought to evaluate transition competencies gained by secondary practitioners involved in a transition teacher education program.

The issues and challenges of providingcoordinated transition services are com-plex and pressing; therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} secondary special education teachers might feel unprepared to provide effective services. Such a lack of preparation could be due in part to the limited number of courses devoted to transition offered within teacher educatio...|$|R
