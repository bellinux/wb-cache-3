40|$|Quantum dot lasers are {{becoming}} increasingly technologically important. It is therefore essential to understand the factors affecting their current performance {{and be able to}} predict future performance. The gain and unamplified spontaneous emission spectra have been measured for a selection of quantum dot devices and a <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> <b>device.</b> The quotient of the gain and spontaneous emission spectra were used to calculate the PF spectra and investigate the carrier distribution within the devices. Whilst the <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> <b>device</b> and devices with one or three layers of dots exhibited characteristics consistent with Fermi-Dirac statistics, devices with more layers dots produced an unusual set of spectra, determined to be due to a non-thermal distribution of carriers in the ground state by looking at the unamplified spontaneous emission spectra. A model was developed to investigate the effects of non-thermal carrier distributions on the calculated PF spectra. From this it was deduced {{that it was possible to}} use a fit of a thermal PF to the excited state PF to calibrate the measured unamplified spontaneous emission spectra. The resultant PF, gain and spontaneous emission spectra are sensitive to the exact balance between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings. This calibration was used to calculate the radiative current densities and compare the radiative efficiencies of different structures, including both Dots-in-Well (DWELL) and standard dot structures. There was no large difference in efficiency found due to improved carrier injection in the DWELL structures. Calculated gain-radiative current density curves were used to predict the minimum transparency and threshold current densities that may be possible in the future. It is clear that the limits of quantum dot device performance have not yet been reached and that a factor of 1. 7 improvement in threshold current density over state of the art devices could be achieved, even without reduced inhomogeneous broadening.

It is the situation of a biased <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> and the dynamics of electrons that this dissertation addresses. ^ The application of an electric field perpendicular to a <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> changes an otherwise closed system into an open system.

As the scattering of an electron via a polar optical phonon is a strong function of the location of the initial and final states, the resulting redistribution of the density of states has a large affect on the scattering rate of an electron. Furthermore, since the escape of an electron from a <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> relies upon the location of the electron in energy within the <b>quantum</b> <b>well,</b> any change in the density of states below the band offset affects the escape rate. Also, when light is incident upon a <b>quantum</b> <b>well,</b> the absorption coefficient of the electron {{is a function of the}} final states.

40|$|The photorefractive {{effect is}} a low intensity, nonlocal optical {{nonlinearity}} which has been studied extensively because of its potential uses. Photorefractive <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> exhibit record sensitivities and speeds, and are prime candidates for optical processing applications, both in the spatial (for images) and in the time domain (for the shaping of femtosecond pulses). For this latter application, multiple <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> <b>devices</b> have to overcome a large bandwidth mismatch with femtosecond pulses, which arises from the resonant nature of photorefractivity at the bandgap. By engineering the excitonic transition spectrum of multiple <b>quantum</b> <b>wells,</b> the bandwidth of photorefractive multiple <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> <b>devices</b> is increased to match that of ultrafast pulses. In superlattices, breaking of the spatial periodicity leads {{to the emergence of}} a wide distribution of critical points and transition energies; we have explored the effect of quasiperiodicity in Fibonacci superlattices, where excitonic interactions concentrate the oscillator strength at low energies and limit the useful diffractive bandwidth. Multiple <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> structures in which the <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> are isolated and the quantum confinement can be tuned along the thickness of the device offer a wide parameter space for bandwidth design. In <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> <b>devices,</b> almost dispersion-free diffraction can be achieved due to the Kramers-Kronig relationship between the real and imaginary parts of the electro-refraction, which makes the phase of the diffracted pulse linear in frequency.

In ZnMnSe epilayers, we demonstrate resonant photorefractive diffraction in the blue spectral region. Wide-gap II-VI semiconductors have characteristic properties (such as high absorption coefficients at the gap and low sensitivity to electric fields) which make the fabrication of resonant photorefractive devices in the transverse geometry particularly challenging.

Furthermore, our results reveal that the formation of fractional Quantum Hall states is not inhibited by the presence of magnetic impurities in a quantum structure. The second part of this thesis addresses an alternative route to realize efficient spin transistor action. Typically, spin transistor designs relying on spin-orbit interaction principally suffer from low signal levels due to limitations in spin injection efficiency and fast spin decay. Here we present an approach to realize spin transistor action in systems where spin information is protected by propagating it adiabatically. This is achieved by inducing tunable diabatic Landau-Zener transitions that lead to a backscattering of spins and hence allow controlling the transmission of spin-polarized charge carriers through the device, i. e. switching between `on' and `off' states.

In contrast to other spin transistor designs we find that our concept is exceptionally tolerant against disorder. ...|$|E
