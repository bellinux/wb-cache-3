But the traditional mode of financing is hard to meet the demands of construction funds, especially, the non-profit and <b>quasi-profit</b> municipal infrastructure. Analyzing and studying on the financing mode of western developed countries, this paper targeted and optimized the financing structure of city municipal infrastructure construction based on the item division theory, and looked forward to help to solve financing problems of municipal infrastructure construction in China...|$|E
40|$|We use a partial-equilibrium multi-market {{international}} {{model to}} analyze trade and agricultural policies affecting peanut/groundnut products markets. The model covers four goods (food and crush quality groundnuts, groundnut oil and cake) in 13 countries/regions including a large set {{of developing countries}} (Argentina, China, the Gambia, India, Malawi, Mexico, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa). Welfare is evaluated {{by looking at the}} consumer's equivalent variation, quasi-profits in farming (groundnut farming, livestock), <b>quasi-profit</b> in crushing, and taxpayers' revenues and outlays implied by distortions. We calibrate the model on recent historical data. We analyze several groundnut trade liberalization scenarios. The impact of the reforms is measured in deviation from the recent historical baseline. Trade liberalization in groundnut markets has a strong South-South dimension opposing two large developing countries (India and China) to smaller developing countries mainly located in Africa. Current Chinese and Indian policies substantially depress the world prices of edible groundnuts, groundnut oil and groundnut meal. Following the removal of these distortions, African exporters present in these world markets would gain because they are net sellers of the cash crops. Consumers in China and India would be better off as well with lower consumer prices resulting from the removal of high tariffs more than offsetting the higher world prices of groundnut oil. The cost of adjustment would fall on farmers in India and China who would have to shift to other crops or activities. Crushing in India would also decrease because crushing margins would deteriorate. Net buyers of groundnut products in OECD countries will be worse off. We draw implications for Doha negotiations. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

This work {{reports on}} the {{implications}} of an extreme climatic event among owners of fishing grounds in the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) fishery of Punta Allen, Mexico. This MSC certified small-scale fishery is co-managed through Territorial User Rights. Members of the fishing cooperative, have exclusive access to individual fishing grounds within Ascension Bay. The fishery {{is based on the}} use of artificial shelters. These bottom devices provide refuges for lobsters, reduce predation mortality, and facilitate harvesting by free diving and the use of hand nets. This allows under -sized individuals and berried females to be returned to their natural environment. The rainiest season in the region within 40 years occurred in 2013 and affected the spatial distribution of lobsters within the fishing grounds. The lobsters moved away from areas exposed to higher freshwater inflow to areas less exposed to this inflow. In order to determine and contrast the distributional effects in the fishery with and without this extreme climatic event, cooperative log books were used to calculate revenues and <b>quasi-profits</b> for fishing cooperative members (by Gini Index) in eight consecutive fishing seasons (including the fishing season affected by the extreme rainfall). Additionally, fisher interviews were performed to determine how cooperative members dealt with this climatic challenge. Results indicate that the extreme rainfall event had a spatial effect on the distribution of revenues and <b>quasi-profits</b> throughout the fishing grounds. Nevertheless, cooperative internal agreements successfully dealt with the climate challenge by keeping the <b>quasi-profits</b> for fishing trips positive...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} a bioeconomic analysis of artificial shelter {{performance in a}} fishery targeting a spiny lobster meta-population, with spatially allocated, individual exclusive benthic property rights for shelter introduction and harvest of species. Insights into fishers’ short-run decisions and fishing strategies are also provided. Spatiotemporal bioeconomic performance of shelters located in ten (10) fishing areas during four seasons was compared using two-way ANOVAs and Pearson correlations. Results show that there was spatiotemporal heterogeneity in bioeconomic variables among fishing areas, with mean CPUEs (kg/shelter) ranging from 0. 42 kg to 1. 3 kg per trip, mean <b>quasi-profits</b> of variable costs per shelter harvested ranging from $ 6. 00 to $ 19. 57 USD per trip, and mean <b>quasi-profits</b> of variable costs ranging from $ 338 to $ 1069 USD per trip. Positive moderate correlations between shelter density and CPUE (kg/shelter) per km 2 were found. Bioeconomic performance of the shelters was influenced by: spatiotemporal resource abundance and distribution, fishing area location {{in relation to the}} port, shelter density, heterogeneous fishing strategies and the management system. The results provide empirical information on the spatiotemporal performance of shelters and fishing strategies and can contribute to management at the local-scale of a meta-population distributed throughout the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} many sea {{cucumber}} fisheries in the world is overexploited. Some {{of the reasons}} are: an increase in demand from China, the distance of these fisheries to China, and {{the high rate of}} fisheries development. Most sea cucumber fisheries are small-scale with a simple management system. To overcome overexploitation, {{it is important to know}} the fisheries management systems. The research questions of this study are: What are the biological and economic factors that accelerate the development of these fisheries? What factors threaten the sustainability of these stocks? And what possible strategies could be implemented? With biological information of the species, fishermen behavior, and the economics, we developed a spatial dynamic bioeconomic model. The model explained the interactions between fishing effort allocation, <b>quasi-profits</b> and population depletion. Our results showed that the main factors that could lead the fishery to the collapse are: a) the spatial pattern, b) excess fishing capacity, c) high <b>quasi-profits</b> in the short term, d) density dependent catchability, and e) heavy density dependence of reproduction. Given the high prices, production, and low opportunity cost of fishers in tropical countries, they often prefer to maximize their short-term gains, regardless of long-term losses due to collapse. Ensuring sustainability requires community agreements and regulations like: minimum legal size, quotas, catch limit per trip, season closed to fishing and rotation of participants...|$|R
40|$|We use a new partial-equilibrium, multi-market {{international}} {{model to}} analyze trade and agricultural policies affecting markets for peanut/groundnut products. The model covers four goods in thirteen countries/regions, including a large set of developing countries. Welfare is evaluated {{by looking at}} consumers' equivalent variation, <b>quasi-profits</b> in farming, <b>quasi-profits</b> in crushing, and taxpayers' revenues and outlays implied by distortions. We calibrate the model on recent historical data and current policy information. We analyze several groundnut trade liberalization scenarios in deviation from the recent historical baseline. Trade liberalization in groundnut markets has a strong South-South dimension, opposing India and, to a lesser extent, China to smaller developing countries mainly located in Africa. In the former, current policies, exacerbated by their market size, depress the world prices of groundnut products. Under free trade, African exporters present in these world markets would gain because they are net sellers of groundnut products. In India, consumers would be better off, with lower consumer prices resulting from the removal of prohibitive tariffs and large imports of groundnut products. The cost of the adjustment would fall on Indian farmers and crushers. In China, crush margins would improve {{because of the large}} terms-of-trade effects in the oil market relative to the seed market. China's groundnut product exports would expand dramatically. Net buyers of groundnut products in OECD (Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development) countries would be worse off.

40|$|Groundnut {{products}} are of central economic importance {{to millions of}} smallholders in Africa, India and Southern China. The products generate 60 percent of rural cash income and account for about 70 percent of the rural labor force in Senegal and Gambia. Groundnut trade remains, however, heavily distorted, and this has affected the competitive position of various players in world markets. Using a new partial-equilibrium, multi-market, international model, we analyze the trade and welfare impacts of several groundnut trade liberalization scenarios compared with the recent historical baseline. Net welfare is evaluated as the sum of consumers' equivalent variation, <b>quasi-profits</b> in farming, <b>quasi-profits</b> in crushing, and taxpayers' revenues and outlays implied by distortions. We find that trade liberalization in groundnut markets has a strong South-South dimension with policies in India, {{and to a lesser}} extent China, heavily depressing the world prices of groundnuts at the expense of smaller developing countries mainly located in Africa. Under free trade, African exporters would gain because they are net sellers of groundnut products.
