This paper, which is adapted from a keynote lecture given during that conference, considers the role of <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcome</b> assessments in research.

Research suggests that patients can be categorized, based on <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcome</b> assessment, and over time might change category. This approach to assessment brings to our attention alternative ways of considering the future: future as currently being made or future as predictable, at least to some extent. Although general practice needs the evidence from research that predicts the future, it also needs to engage in research that seeks to understand patients as they make their future, and to understand the impact of clinical interventions on this process...|$|R

Most latent index models commonly applied to <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> in econometrics fail to satisfy these conditions, and monte carlo evidence on the bias of instrumental estimates of the average treatment effect in a bivariate probit model is presented. The evidence suggests that linear instrumental variables estimators perform nearly as well as the correctly specified maximum likelihood estimator. especially in large samples. Linear instrumental variables and the normal maximum likelihood estimator are also remarkably robust to non-normality. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper explores {{principles}} of contemporary aesthetics {{to suggest a}} basis for determining <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> of artistic works in two contexts: the arts industry and the academy setting of practice-led research. Commonly articulated measures of quality—creativity and innovation—are questioned as mere rhetoric if not framed in specific ways in the two discrete settings. The paper also interrogates generally held assumptions that a longer time to develop work and greater periods of self-reflexivity will produce higher calibre artistic outcomes. The unease produced by apparent differences in <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcomes</b> between art works created in an industry setting and those created through practice-led research is analysed through three interconnected framing devices: intention, contextual parameters and criteria for evaluation, {{in conjunction with the}} relationships between the art work, the artist and the audience/viewer/listener. Common and differentiated criteria in the two contexts are explored, leading to the conclusion that innovation {{is more likely to be}} revealed in the end product in an industry context whereas in practice-led research it may be in the methodological processes of creating the work. While identifying and acknowledging that the two contexts encourage and produce distinctive qualitative artistic outcomes, both of value to the arts and the academy, the paper recommends ways in which closer formal liaison between industry artists and practice-led artists and supervisors might occur in order to ensure ongoing mutual influence and relevance...|$|E

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} issue of the (non-) {{equivalence}} of period and continuous time analysis in macroeconomic theory and its implications for the existence of chaotic dynamics in empirical macro. We start from the methodological precept that period and continuous time representations of the same macrostructure should give rise to the same <b>qualitative</b> <b>outcome,</b> i. e. in particular, that the results of period analysis should not depend on the length of the period. A simple example where this is fulfilled is given by the Solow growth model, while all chaotic dynamics in period models of dimension less than 3 are in conflict with this precept. We discuss a recent and typical example from the literature, where chaos results from an asymptotically stable continuous-time macroeconomic model when this is reformulated as a discrete-time model with a long period length.
