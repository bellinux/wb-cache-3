Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, it is not as prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a <b>quick-freezing</b> plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E

40|$|Ultrastructure of glomerular {{basement}} membrane by <b>quick-freeze</b> and deep-etch methods. The glomerular {{basement membrane}} of rat kidneys were three-dimensionally observed by <b>quick-freeze</b> and deep-etch replica methods at high resolution. The middle layer (lamina densa) was composed of 6 to 10 nm fibrils which formed a meshwork structure. The space between the fibrils had polygonal shape. The average long dimension of the space between fibrils was 17 nm and the short one was 13 nm. At the outer layer (lamina rara externa), fibrils connected podocytes perpendicularly with the meshwork of the middle layer. At the inner layer (lamina rara interna), similar perpendicular fibrils also connected endothelial cells with the meshwork of the middle layer. This is the first report to visualize the three-dimensional meshwork structure of the middle layer (the lamina densa) in situ. The function of anchoring podocytes to the lamina densa was suggested in the perpendicularly arranged fibrils of the outer layer.

40|$|ABSTRACT Axons from rats {{treated with}} the {{neurotoxic}} agent ~,/ 3 '-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) were examined by <b>quick-freeze,</b> deep-etch electron microscopy. Microtubules formed bundles in the central region of the axons, whereas neurofilaments were segregated to the periphery.

The microtubule-associated strands were observed in fresh, saponin-extracted, or aldehyde-fixed tissue.

Heuser (born August 29, 1942) is an American Professor of Biophysics in the {{department}} of Cell Biology and Physiology at the Washington University School of Medicine as well as a Professor at the Institute for Integrated Cell-Matieral Sciences (iCeMS) at Kyoto University. Heuser created quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy, a pioneering technique that lets biologists take detailed pictures of fleeting events inside living cells. For decades, Heuser has used this technique to capture details of the molecular mechanisms that underlie many basic biological activities, including nerve cell signal transmission, muscle contraction, and most recently, the fusion of viruses with cells during the spread of infection. He compares quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy to using a stroboscopic flash to freeze the action in a photograph. To make it possible to image the frozen sample with an electron microscope, Heuser adds an ultra-thin film of metallic platinum that molds snugly against the sample's frozen surface contours. He and others in his lab have worked to make the equipment and procedures necessary for this process available to researchers around the world. Currently Heuser has patents pending on Washington University's behalf for even more advanced versions of his <b>quick-freezing</b> machines. Heuser graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1969 and joined the Washington University faculty as a professor of biophysics in 1980.

40|$|ABSTRACT Outer-arm dynein {{from the}} sperm {{of the sea}} urchin S. purpuratus was adsorbed to mica flakes and visualized by the <b>quick-freeze,</b> deep-etch technique. Replicas reveal {{particles}} comprised of two globular heads joined by two irregularly shaped stems which make contact along their length. One head is pear-shaped (18. 5 x 12. 5 nm) {{and the other is}} spherical (14. 5 nm diam). The stems are decorated by a complex of bead-like subunits. The same two-headed protein is found in the 21 S dynein- 1 fraction of sucrose gradients. The /]-heavy chain] intermediate chain 1 (beta[IC- 1) dynein subfraction, produced by low-salt dialysis and zonal centNfugation of the high-salt-extracted dynein- 1, contains only single-headed molecules with single stems. These heads are predominantly pear-shaped (18. 5 × 12. 5 nm).

To explore further the identity of the microtubule-associated strands, microtubules purified from brain tissue and containing the high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins MAP 1 and MAP 2 were examined by <b>quick-freeze,</b> deep-etch electron microscopy. The purified microtubules were connected by a network of strands quite similar in appearance to those observed in the IDPN axons. Control microtubule preparations consisting only of tubulin and lacking the MAPs were devoid of associated strands. To learn which of the MAPs were present in the microtubule bundles in the axon, sections of axons from IDPN- treated rats were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to MAP 1 A, MAP 1 B, MAP 2, and tubulin. Anti-MAP 2 staining was only marginally detectable in the IDPN-treated axons, consistent with earlier observations. Anti-MAP 1 A and anti-MAP 1 B brightly stained the IDPN-treated axons, with the staining exclusively limited to the microtubule domains. Furthermore, thin section-immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold-labeled second antibodies revealed that both anti-MAP 1 A and anti-MAP 1 B stained fuzzy filamentous structures between microtubules.
