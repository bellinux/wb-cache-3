40|$|An {{education}} promoting scientific literacy (SL) that {{prepares the}} citizens to a responsible citizenship has persisted as an argument across discussions on curricula design. The ubiquity {{of science and}} technology on contemporary societies and the ideological requirement of informed democratic participation led to the identification of relevant categories that drive curriculum reforms towards a humanistic approach of school science. The category ‘Science as culture’ acquires in the current work a major importance: it enlightens the meaning of scientific literacy. Looking closely to the French term, culture scientifique et tecnologique, turns science simultaneously into a cultural object and product that can be both received and worked at different levels and within several approaches by the individuals and the communities. On the other hand, nonformal and informal education spaces gain greater importance. Together with the formal school environment these spaces allow for an enrichment and diversification of learning experiences. Examples of nonformal spaces where animators can develop their work may be science museums or botanical gardens; television and internet can be regarded as informal education spaces. Due to the above mentioned impossibility of setting apart the individual or community-based experiences from Science and Technology (S&T), the work in nonformal and informal spaces sets an additional challenge to the preparation of socio-cultural animators. Socio-scientific issues take, at times, heavily relevance within the communities. Pollution, high tension lines, spreading of diseases, food contamination or natural resources conservation are among the socio-scientific issues that often call upon arguments and emotions. In the context of qualifying programmes on socio-cultural animation (social education and community development) within European Higher Education Area (EHEA) the present study describes the Portuguese framework. The comparison of programmes within Portugal aims to contribute to the discussion on the curriculum design for a socio-cultural animator degree (1 st cycle of Bologna process). In particular, this study intends to assess how the formation given complies with enabling animators to work, within multiple scenarios, with communities in situations of socio-scientific relevance. A set of themes, issues and both current and potential fields of action, not described or insufficiently described in literature, is identified and analysed in the perspective of a <b>qualified</b> <b>intervention</b> of animators. One of these examples is thoroughly discussed. Finally, suggestions are made about curriculum reforms in order, if possible, to strongly link the desired <b>qualified</b> <b>intervention</b> with a qualifying formation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: it is {{not known}} how {{acupuncture}} is used in midwifery care in Sweden and what kind of requirements health-care providers have for midwives and acupuncture training programmes. The aims of this study were to survey indications for the use of acupuncture in midwifery care in Sweden, and to examine the criteria and requirements used for purchase of acupuncture education programmes. Design: a postal survey using a structured questionnaire. Setting: 45 maternity units in Sweden. Participants: the midwife-in-charge of the units. Measurements and findings: the most common indications for the use of acupuncture were relaxation, pain relief, retained placenta, afterpains, milk stasis during lactation, hyperemesis and pelvic instability. Specific requirement for acupuncture education were provision of a short course during weekdays including a follow-up course. Key conclusion: acupuncture is widely used for many indications in Swedish maternity units despite weak or no evidence to support effectiveness in midwifery care. Requirements for acupuncture education {{did not seem to be}} in accordance with what might be expected for this type of <b>qualified</b> <b>intervention.</b> Implications for practice: the use of acupuncture in midwifery care should not persist until systematic evaluation of the effect of this method is carried through.

To <b>qualify,</b> <b>interventions</b> had {{to be based on}} the principles (1) that sexual health is intrinsic to individuals and their overall health and (2) that relationships reflecting sexual health must be positive for all parties concerned. Outcomes were classed in domains: knowledge, attitudes, communication, health care use, sexual behavior, and adverse events. We summarized data from 58 studies (English language, adult populations, 1996 - 2011) by population (adults, parents, sexual minorities, vulnerable populations) across domains. Interventions were predominantly individual and small-group designs that addressed sexual behaviors (72 %) and attitudes/norms (55 %). They yielded positive effects in that 98 % reported a positive finding in at least one domain; 50 % also reported null effects. The most consistently positive effects on behaviors and adverse events were found for sexual minorities, vulnerable populations, and parental communication. Whether via direct action or through partnerships, incorporating principles from existing sexual health definitions in public health efforts may help improve sexual health.

Expert systematic searches of the literature were undertaken for {{a broad range of}} health interventions. Cost-effectiveness results using Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) as the health outcome were standardized to 2012 US dollars. 149 individual studies of 93 <b>interventions</b> <b>qualified</b> for inclusion. <b>Interventions</b> for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn and Child Health accounted for 37 % of interventions, and major infectious diseases (AIDS, TB, malaria and neglected tropical diseases) for 24 %, consistent with the priorities of the Millennium Development Goals.

Important changes have occurred in rankings since 2006. Priorities have changed as a result of new technologies, new methods for changing behavior, and significant price changes for some vaccines and drugs. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals will require LMICs to study a broader range of health interventions, particularly in adult health.

40|$|SummaryIdiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease of unknown cause characterized by relentlessly progressive restrictive-ventilatory limitation, hypoxia, dyspnea, and cough. Both the incidence and prevalence of IPF {{appears to be}} increasing, with little impact on its dismal 3 -year median survival, despite two decades of clinical trials. Increasingly recognized are the serious associated comorbid illnesses, including pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, lung cancer, and depression that further contribute to the substantial rise {{in the use of}} IPF-related healthcare resources. At present, lung transplantation remains the sole viable treatment for the few who <b>qualify.</b> Pharmacologic <b>interventions</b> targeting lung function and survival have remained largely disappointing, and very few investigations have specifically targeted comorbid conditions, symptoms, quality-of-life, and healthcare resource utilization. In reviewing the burden of illness associated with IPF, including the epidemiology, comorbidities, quality-of-life and the physical, psychosocial, and economic costs of this devastating disease, we hope to highlight some of the unmet medical needs associated with IPF, and encourage both public support and further investigations into these and other patient-centered outcomes and not just that of survival and lung function...|$|R

This qualitative case study used interviews with 10 elementary and middle school administrators from 8 public schools to assess the influence of NCLB on schools with a high percentage of students of color and students in poverty. This study was viewed through the lens of Toffler 2 ̆ 7 s conceptual framework of how change occurs, and on the current school reform climate surrounding NCLB and how its accountability system of assessments for students of color and high poverty makes {{it difficult for them to}} participate in the American economy. The data analysis strategies included the use of data triangulation through the review of archival data, participant interviews and employing member checks to insure the trustworthiness of data. Results showed that administrators in the targeted schools have difficulty retaining highly <b>qualified</b> teachers. <b>Interventions</b> such as extending the school day, increasing test preparation, using test data to drive instruction, and using academic intervention services have met with mixed results.

40|$|Doctor of EducationProfound {{changes have}} taken place in policy and {{practice}} in early childhood intervention over the past few years. This signifies a paradigm shift from the traditional to the more sophisticated 'state of the art' approaches to service delivery in early childhood intervention. Central to the debate on early childhood intervention has been the purpose it serves and the involvement of families in early childhood programmes. While the review of early childhood intervention literature indicated widespread agreement on the importance of early intervention services, {{it is clear that the}} provision of services is still very low in some countries, especially developing countries like Botswana. The aim of this study was to investigate how early childhood intervention was addressed in the Revised National Policy on Education (1994) and how the policy has been implemented by the practitioners and how the family perspective has been incorporated in service delivery. To achieve the objectives, this study employed a mixed methods approach using one-to-one in-depth interviews with ministry officials and programme coordinators, two focus groups of parents and family members, and a questionnaire for 100 teachers. The main findings are that early childhood intervention services in Botswana are still very limited and unevenly distributed. Second, there is a limited number of <b>qualified</b> early <b>intervention</b> staff leading to inadequate services for families and children with disability. Third, coordination of service provision between the ministries involved is complex, weak and at times dysfunctional. This needs to be strengthened in addition to more active government participation rather than leaving this responsibility almost totally on NGOs. Fourth, there seems to be a general consensus that engaging families and local community could have significant advantages.

40|$|Introduction: We {{developed}} {{screening criteria}} to identify population health interventions with an equity focus for inclusion on the Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian Best Practices Portal. We applied {{them to the}} area of "healthy weights" specifically, obesity prevention. Methods: We conducted {{a review of the literature}} and obtained input from expert external reviewers on changes to midstream environments. Interventions had to identify outcomes for groups with an underlying social disadvantage. We included papers with a focus on equity and vulnerable populations, intervention and/or evaluation studies, social determinants of health and healthy weights or obesity prevention. We then appraised the shortlisted studies for quality of evidence to determine eligibility for inclusion as promising practices on the Canadian Best Practices Portal. Results: Few of the references reviewed passed the equity screening criteria (26 out of 2823 published papers reviewed, or 0. 9 %).

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a debilitating condition characterized by airflow limitation {{that is not}} fully reversible. It is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality and represents substantial economic and social burden throughout the world. A range of interventions has been developed that decrease symptoms and address complications associated with COPD. However, to date few interventions have been unequivocally demonstrated to modify disease progression. Assessment of the potential for interventions to modify disease progression is complicated by the lack of a clear definition of disease modification and disagreement over appropriate markers by which modification should be evaluated. To clarify these issues, a working group of physicians and scientists from the USA, Canada and Europe was convened. The proposed working definition of disease modification resulting from the group discussions was “an improvement in, or stabilization of, structural or functional parameters as a result of reduction in the rate of progression of these parameters which occurs whilst an intervention is applied and may persist even if the intervention is withdrawn”. According to this definition, pharmacologic interventions may be considered disease-modifying if they provide consistent and sustained improvements in structural and functional parameters. Smoking cessation and lung volume reduction surgery would both <b>qualify</b> as disease-modifying <b>interventions...</b>|$|R

A mixed methods approach using quantitative and qualitative data was used to test the hypothesis that parents who saw the video would be more empowered than parents who did not see the video. Multiple regression analyses showed that the video significantly predicted empowerment for parents when parent education and the interaction of video and parent education were included as predictors. Watching the video was associated with increased empowerment for parents with some college and decreased empowerment for parents with four or more years of college. Results suggest that parent education also moderates parent empowerment in the context of child gender and child disability. Content analysis of qualitative data indicated that parents who saw the video were not more empowered than the comparison group. Two major themes that emerged from the qualitative inquiry were restored confidence and inspired action.

CRF levels improved in direct proportion to the intensity of resistance exercise (b 0. 60, P 0. 01), a pattern that was stronger in higher quality studies (b 0. 23, P < 0. 05). CRF levels also reduced to a greater extent when interventions were theoretically driven (b 0. 48, P < 0. 001) or cancer survivors were older (b 0. 24, P 0. 04). Conclusions: Exercise reduced CRF especially in programs that involved moderate-intensity, resistance exercise among older cancer survivors and that were guided by theory. Impact: Our results indicate exercise interventions for adult cancer survivors should be multi-dimensional and individualized according to health outcome and cancer type.

There are a number of alternative modalities of intervention for preschool children with ASD in use with different theoretical background and orientation, each of which tend to use different trial designs and outcome measures. There is at this time an urgent need for comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses of intervention studies for preschool children with ASD, covering studies of adequate quality across different intervention types and measurement methods, with a view to identifying the best current evidence for preschool interventions in the disorde. Methods and analysis: The authors will perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials for preschool children with ASD aged 0 e 6 years, along with a meta-analysis of <b>qualifying</b> studies across <b>intervention</b> modality. The authors will classify the interventions for preschool children with ASD under three models: behaviour, multimodal developmental and communication focused. First, the authors will perform a systematic review. Then, the authors will conduct a meta-analysis by comparing the three models with various outcomes using an inverse variance method in a random effect model. The authors will synthesise each outcome of the studies for the three models using standardised mean differences...|$|R
40|$|Effective and {{appropriate}} hand-washing practice for schoolchildren {{is important in}} preventing infectious diseases such as diarrhoea, which {{is the second most}} common cause of death among school-age children in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of the review was to identify hand hygiene intervention strategies to reduce infectious diseases such as diarrhoea and respiratory tract infections among schoolchildren aged 6 - 12 years in developing countries. Published research articles were searched from databases covering a period from {{as far back as the}} creation of the databases to November 2015. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCT/CRCT) from developing countries met the inclusion criteria. The Jadad Scale for appraising RCT/CRCT studies revealed methodological challenges in most studies, such that 75 % (6 / 8) were rated as low-quality articles. The review found that hand hygiene can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea and respiratory conditions. Three hand hygiene intervention strategies utilized were training, funding and policy, with training and funding implemented more commonly than policy. These strategies were not only used in isolation but also in combination, and they <b>qualified</b> as multi-level <b>interventions.</b> Factors that influenced hand washing were contextual, psychosocial and technological. Findings can inform school health workers in categorizing and prioritizing activities into viable strategies when implementing multi-level hand-washing interventions. This review also adds to the existing evidence that multi-level hand-washing interventions can reduce the incidence of diarrhoea, respiratory infections, and school absenteeism. Further evidence-based studies are needed with improved methodological rigour in developing countries, to inform policy in this area.

40|$|The {{cadastral}} map represents an essential layer of any spatial data infrastructure, as well emphasized by the European directive INSPIRE. In this context, each cadastral parcel assumes a fundamental role, since it constitutes {{one of the}} key elements for carrying out an interoperable information system. The parcel represents the link among the legal domain information, the public restrictions, the private taxes, and further layers. The {{cadastral map}}, therefore, enlarges the required interoperable links to the complete available geo information tools like networks, plans, services and others. To fulfil this function, the cadastral map must satisfy a high level of accuracy, not reachable {{at the time of its}} implementation, often more than one century ago. Furthermore, the harmonization of a digital cadastral map into a spatial information system is complicated by further problems like fragmented reference systems, inaccurate upgrades, distorted and discontinuous representations. Accordingly, the cadastral map updating requires appropriate interventions. Sometimes the corrective actions prove to be empirical, not reproducible and of costly maintenance. Furthermore, the diversity of solutions hinders the database harmonization of the various administrations. This paper analyses the problems inherent in the Italian cadastral map, describes the methodology developed to update the digital map and recover the original geometric accuracy. Furthermore, the paper shows the results of a global and <b>qualified</b> set of <b>interventions</b> carried out by the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional administration, in cooperation with INSIEL Spa and the University of Udine, that make the cadastral data base fully harmonized and interoperable within the regional spatial data infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Over 80 % of all {{hepatocellular}} cancer (HCC) {{cases that}} {{present to the}} clinic do not <b>qualify</b> for surgical <b>intervention.</b> Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) therapy has gained increased attention as a relatively safe and effective alternative to surgical intervention. SBRT is a non-invasive highly conformal radiation therapy {{that is capable of}} delivering high doses of ionizing radiation to small treatment volumes. The high radiosensitivity of the liver requires strict radiation dose limits to maintain normal tissue complication probabilities to less than 5 %. However, the radiosensitivity across the HCC patient population is highly variable and not well characterized. Indeed, the tolerance dose limits for HCC patients could be underestimated, but more information is needed before the relationships between radiation dose, biological response, and normal tissue toxicities can be clearly defined. Currently, imaging techniques capable of providing both spatial and functional information regarding the radiobiological response of both normal and malignant liver tissue are needed. ^ The goal of this research is to investigate the feasibility of using three-dimensional (3 D) 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) to evaluate the metabolic changes in normal and malignant liver tissue 24 - 72 hours after the first SBRT treatment fraction. The relationship between the observed 31 P metabolic activity of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inorganic phosphate (Pi), phosphomonoesthers (PME) and phosphodiesthers (PDE) are compared to an independently quantified estimate of regional radiation dose, and compared to standard clinical methods of evaluating the therapeutic response of both normal and malignant liver. The resulting analysis will characterize the use of 31 P MSRI as an early predictor of normal tissue toxicity and/or treatment response and provide important data to determine if this method is feasible as a basis for individualized dose optimization strategies. ...|$|R
