40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} Monte Carlo {{model of}} the uniform relativistic runaway electron breakdown in air {{in the presence of}} static electric and magnetic fields is used to calculate electron distribution functions, avalanche rates, and the direction and velocity of avalanche propagation. We also derive the conditions required for an electron with a given momentum to start an avalanche {{in the absence of a}} magnetic field. The results are compared to previously developed kinetic and analytical models and our own analytical estimates, and it is concluded that the rates used in many early models [e. g., Lehtinen et al., 1997; Taranenko and Roussel-Dupr•, 1996; Yukhimuk et al., 1998; Roussel-Dupr • et al., 1998] are overestimated by a factor of •- 10. The Monte Carlo simulation results are applied to a fluid model of runaway electron beams in the middle atmosphere accelerated by <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> following a positive lightning stroke. In particular, we consider the case of lightning discharges which drain positive charge from remote regions of a laterally extensive (> 100 km) thundercloud, using a Cartesian two-dimensional model. The resulting optical emission intensities in red sprites associated with the runaway electrons are found to be negligible compared to the emissions from thermal electrons heated in the conventional type of breakdown. The calculated gamma ray flux is of the same order as the terrestrial gamma ray flashes observed by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment detector on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. 1...|$|R
40|$|When the enamel-like {{top layer}} of the desert soil is compromised, natural and {{man-made}} forces result in airborne dust particulate. This is of specific concern in Pu contaminated soil excavation. Conventional water-spraying techniques are effective in preventing large airborne dust particles but are ineffective for dust particles {{on the order of}} a few micrometers in diameter and smaller. One means of extracting these fine radio-nuclide particulate from the air is with a quasi-electrostatic air filter which charges, traps, transports, and collects them with the aid of electrostatic and <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>fields.</b> Human intervention is virtually eliminated. The air filter is divided into four sections: the charging region, the electrostatic trapping region, the transport region, and the collection region. This work focuses on the first three regions of the air filter. The charging region employs a photo-ionization mechanism to ionize the sand particle just below the breakdown of air. Large electrostatic fields precipitate the charged micron particles from the air flow in the charging region and direct them into the transport region. The dynamic fields in this region guide the particulate to a collection region. Combining a finite element method with an analytical theory to characterize the fields in the air filter, single-particle dynamics in the charging, electrostatic and the transport regions of the air filter are examined. Design constraints and limitations are studied. Air flow velocities and air viscosity contributions are incorporated into the simulation. Normalized expressions allow for a host of upscale and downscale designs...|$|R
40|$|Intense, {{transient}} <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> (QE) <b>fields,</b> which exist {{above the}} thunderclouds following a positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharge, can produce an upward travelling runaway electron (REL) beam. In the present work we calculate the REL density using the recently developed electrostatic heating (ESH) [Pasko et al., 1996] and QE models [Pasko et al., 1995]. The new two-dimensional REL-QE model expands the previously reported one-dimensional model [Bell et al., 1995], {{provides information on}} the lateral electron distribution in the beam and allows us to determine the ionospheric effects and the optical luminosities resulting from the simultaneous action of the QE fields on the ambient electrons and the runaway electrons. The REL beam radius changes with altitude, attaining its maximum value of 10 - 15 km at altitudes of 70 - 90 km. The model includes {{the effects of the}} divergence of the beam on the electron number density. Optical emissions [Bell et al., 1995] and γ-ray emissions [Lehtinen et al., 1996] are calculated and compared to experimental observations. ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for detecting and ranging lightning flashes up to approximately 100 km away is described. The technique uses a novel method of discriminating between lightning and non-lightning sources of <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> change by {{comparison of the}} signal strength measured simultaneously on two co-located antennas, which {{is a function of}} their different geometry and exposure to the atmospheric electric field. In addition to detection of all types of lightning within range, the system also has the capability of detecting and classifying other sources of rapid electric field change associated with thunderstorm or shower cloud activity, such as from nearby corona brush discharge, strong space charge variability and charged precipitation. Real-time lightning flash detection and ranging combined with monitoring of initial storm electrification processes provides a comprehensive method of local severe weather warning. Since the operating frequency of 1 – 50 Hz lies below man-made sources of radio signals, the technique is considered especially useful for sites with strong radio interference...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} human-area {{networking}} technology {{that uses the}} surface of the human body as a data transmission path and uses near-field coupling TRXs. This technology aims to achieve a "touch and connect" form of communication and a new concept of "touch the world" by using a <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> signal that propagates along {{the surface of the}} human body. This paper explains the principles underlying near-field coupling communication. Special {{attention has been paid to}} common-mode noise since our communication system is strongly susceptible to this. We designed and made a common-mode choke coil and a transformer to act as common-mode noise filters to suppress common-mode noise. Moreover, we describe how we evaluated the quality of communication using a phantom model with the same electrical properties as the human body and present the experimental results for the packet error rate (PER) as a function of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) both with the common-mode choke coil or the transformer and without them. Finally, we found that our system achieved a PER of less than 10 - 2 in general office rooms using raised floors, which corresponded to the quality of communication demanded by communication services in ordinary office spaces...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observational}} {{evidence has}} indicated that local current sheet disruptions are excited by an external perturbation likely associated with the kinetic ballooning (KB) instability initiating at the transition region separating the dipole- and tail-like geometries. Specifically a <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> pointing to the neutral sheet was identified in the interval between the arrival of KB perturbation and local current disruption. How can such a field drive the local current sheet unstable? This question is considered through a fluid treatment of thin current sheet (TCS) where the generalized Ohm's law replaces the frozen-in-flux condition. A perturbation with the wavevector along the current is applied, and eigenmodes with frequency much below the ion gyrofrequency are sought. We show that the second-order derivative of ion drift velocity along {{the thickness of the}} current sheet is a critical stability parameter. In an E-field-free Harris sheet in which the drift velocity is constant, the current sheet is stable against this particular mode. As the electrostatic field grows, however, potential for instability arises. The threshold of instability is identified through an approximate analysis of the theory. For a nominal current sheet half-thickness of 1000 km, the estimated instability threshold is E~ 4 mV/m. Numerical solutions indicate that the two-fluid theory gives growth rate and wave period consistent with observations...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{functionalities}} of electronic devices within a living environment constantly increased. Besides the personal computer, now tablet PCs, smart household appliances, and smartwatches enriched the technology landscape. The trend towards an ever-growing number of computing systems {{has resulted in}} many highly heterogeneous human-machine interfaces. Users are forced to adapt to technology instead of having the technology adapt to them. Gathering context information about the user is a key factor for improving the interaction experience. Emerging wearable devices show the benefits of sophisticated sensors which make interaction more efficient, natural, and enjoyable. However, many technologies still lack of these desirable properties, motivating me to work towards new ways of sensing a user's actions and thus enriching the context. In my dissertation I follow a human-centric approach which ranges from sensing hand movements to recognizing whole-body interactions with objects. This goal can be approached with a vast variety of novel and existing sensing approaches. I focused on perceiving the environment with <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>fields</b> by making use of capacitive coupling between devices and objects. Following this approach, {{it is possible to}} implement interfaces that are able to recognize gestures, body movements and manipulations of the environment at typical distances up to 50 cm. These sensors usually have a limited resolution and can be sensitive to other conductive objects or electrical devices that affect electric fields. The technique allows for designing very energy-efficient and high-speed sensors that can be deployed unobtrusively underneath any kind of non-conductive surface. Compared to other sensing techniques, exploiting capacitive coupling also has a low impact on a user's perceived privacy. In this work, I also aim at enhancing the interaction experience with new perceptional capabilities based on capacitive coupling. I follow a bottom-up methodology and begin by presenting two low-level approaches for environmental perception. In order to perceive a user in detail, I present a rapid prototyping toolkit for capacitive proximity sensing. The prototyping toolkit shows significant advancements in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. Due to some limitations, namely the inability to determine the identity and fine-grained manipulations of objects, I contribute a generic method for communications based on capacitive coupling. The method allows for designing highly interactive systems that can exchange information through air and the human body. I furthermore show how human body parts can be recognized from capacitive proximity sensors. The method is able to extract multiple object parameters and track body parts in real-time. I conclude my thesis with contributions in the domain of context-aware devices and explicit gesture-recognition systems...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{analytical}} formulation for the coupled partial differential equations governing electrostatically actuated constrained elastic structures of inhomogeneous material composition. We also present a computationally efficient numerical framework for solving the coupled equations over a reference domain with a fixed finite-element mesh. This serves two purposes: (i) a series of problems with varying geometries and piece-wise homogeneous and/or inhomogeneous material distribution can be solved with a single pre-processing step, (ii) topology optimization methods can be easily implemented by interpolating the material at each point in the reference domain from a void to a dielectric or a conductor. This is attained by considering the steady-state electrical current conduction equation with a `leaky capacitor' model {{instead of the usual}} electrostatic equation. This formulation is amenable for both static and transient problems in the elastic domain coupled with the <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> electric <b>field.</b> The procedure is numerically implemented on the COMSOL Multiphysics (R) platform using the weak variational form of the governing equations. Examples have been presented to show the accuracy and versatility of the scheme.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> electric <b>fields</b> from thunderclouds might produce whistler ducts by driving plasma interchange of geomagnetic flux tubes. Using lightning activity as a proxy for the presence of electrified clouds, the relation between thunderclouds and duct number was investigated through the study of two periods of 10 days, that is from June 13 – 22, 1993, and August 6 – 15, 1993. Typical duct numbers observed using NAA transmissions (24. 0 kHz, Cutler, Maine) received at Faraday during the nights of June and August 1993 were ∼ 7, while the maximum duct numbers were 9 – 12. Duct numbers dropped down to zero or near zero during the day. Times of increased duct number could not be clearly associated with increased thunderstorm activity in the duct footprint region. Duct numbers observed on the path from NLK (24. 8 kHz, Seattle, Washington) to Dunedin, New Zealand, were also studied, where very low thunderstorm activity levels imply that thundercloud-driven duct formation should not be significant. The typical nighttime peak was ∼ 5 at about 1000 UT (23 LT). The difference between duct numbers in areas with high thunderstorm activity and quiet areas might be thought to be due to thundercloud duct formation. However, the F region absorption on the NLK footprints at 1000 UT (23 LT) in June was found to be equivalent to 0000 UT (20 LT) in June on the NAA duct footprints. The typical number of ducts observable on the NAA path at 0000 UT in June is ≈ 5, very similar to the number observed on NLK at 0930 UT. The results found in this study are consistent with the idea that ionospheric absorption is a significant influence on the number of ducts observed. It does not appear that quasi-electronstatic fields from thunderclouds {{play a significant role in}} the formation of plasmaspheric whistler ducts. The similarity in quiet time midlatitude duct nuumbers at these two different locations suggest a globally consistent duct formation mechanism, such as the interchange of magnetospheric tubes of plasma induced by spatially varying electric fields in the E region...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{features of the}} strong quasi-electrostatic fields, generated in the region ionosphere-ground after a single lightning discharge, due to succeeding redistribution of capacitive spatial charges, are studied in this work. The investigation of these fields is of great importance, particularly since they {{are considered to be}} responsible for generation of red sprites in the mesosphere and lower ionosphere over thunderstorms. As experimental measurements show, these quasi-electrostatic fields can cause, more often than sprites, electron heating and conductivity modifications in the mesosphere and ionosphere as well. The temporal behavior and relaxation time of the quasi-electrostatic fields, as well as their spatial extent and orientation are studied. For this purpose an analytical model based on the Maxwell equations under conditions of curl-free electric field is proposed. Such conditions are fulfilled short (less than a millisecond) after beginning of a lightning discharge and last until another discharge. Isotropic conductivity in the region of interest is assumed. Computations are made for the time-course of the quasi-electrostatic fields up to the lower ionosphere. The dynamics of spatial charges in this region, responsible for the quasi-electrostatic fields, is analyzed also. The quasi-electrostatic fields at an altitude observed reach their maximum at a time close to the local relaxation time. Up to the ionosphere this maximum is of an order of V/m per 1 Coulomb of a charge transported by lightning. The field decreases immediately after reaching its maximum in the mesosphere; however, at stratospheric and tropospheric altitudes its maximum forms a plateau, which becomes wider at lower heights. The relaxation of the <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> at altitudes above 40 km is essentially slower than the local relaxation time of an electrical charge...|$|E
40|$|Red sprites, elves {{and blue}} jets are upper {{atmospheric}} optical phenomena associated with thunderstorms that {{have only recently}} been documented and investigated. Sprites are massive but weak luminous flashes that appear directly above an active thunderstorm system and are coincident with cloud-to-ground or intra-cloud lightning strokes. Lightning discharges produce electromagnetic radiation at all frequencies. At Extremely Low Frequencies (ELF) this radiation propagates in the earth-ionosphere wave-guide with little attenuation, traveling around the Earth {{a number of times}} before decaying. Hence, theoretically we can detect these waves at any location on the Earth’s surface. Furthermore, due to the constructive interference between ELF waves in the wave-guide, resonant standing waves exist. O. W. Schumann knows these resonant modes as the Schumann resonance after the theoretical prediction of their existence in 1952. The aim of our research is to determine the characteristics of the lightning responsible for generating and associating with sprites, based on the quantitative analysis of the distant (a few mega-meters) electromagnetic fields produced by the lightning and sprite event. Current theories suggest that {{the most important factor in}} sprite generation is the vertical charge moment change in a lightning stroke. The relatively sustained (~ 1 ms) <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> in the mesosphere after a lightning stroke is proportional to the lightning charge moment change, and it is this electric field that can drive electric breakdown and streamer development and runaway relativistic electron breakdown. We investigate ELF/VLF radiation of lightning, with a focus on improving methods to calculate the charge moments of distant lightning discharges. This parameter appears to be crucial in determining which lightning discharges produce sprites at the time of its initiation, and which do not...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a laser pulse of relativistic intensity (≥ 1 × 1018 Wcm− 2) {{with a solid}} target results {{in the creation of}} a <b>quasi-electrostatic</b> <b>field</b> at the rear surface of the target. This field is strong enough (TVm− 1) to ionise and accelerate ions from the target surface via the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism. The resulting beam has many desirable properties for a large range of potential applications. The work presented in this thesis aims at optimising and controlling the ion beam properties. Firstly, an investigation of laser driven ion acceleration using ultrahigh contrast (1010), ultrashort (50 fs) laser pulses focused to intensities up to 1021 Wcm− 2 on thin foil targets is presented. It is found that irradiation at normal (0 ◦) incidence produces higher energy ions than oblique incidence (35 ◦), contrasting sharply with previous work at lower intensities. These findings are confirmed by 1 D boosted PIC simulations and can be explained by the acceleration of fast electrons being dominated by a new absorption process. The effects of target composition and thickness on the acceleration of carbon ions are also discussed and compared to calculations using analytical models of ion acceleration. Next, an investigation of the transverse refluxing of fast electrons in targets of limited lateral size is reported. The targets were irradiated by high intensity (∼ 1 × 1019 Wcm− 2), picosecond laser pulses. The maximum energy of the resulting TNSA proton beams is found to increase with decreasing target surface area. This is explained by the presence of a laterally spreading electron population that reflects off the target edges and enhances the TNSA accelerating field. In addition it is demonstrated that this laterally refluxing electron population can be used to control the spatial intensity distribution of the TNSA proton beam, by changing the geometry of the target. This technique offers encouraging prospects for many applications of laser accelerated ions. Finally, a characterisation study of debris emission generated by the {{interaction of}} high power laser pulses with solid targets is presented. Targets of thickness ranging from 1 mm to 5 nm were irradiated by high intensity (∼ 1 × 1020 Wcm− 2), picosecond laser pulses. The resulting debris emission is found to be directed along the target normal axis at both the rear and front of the target. The front emission profile is found to be similar to a plasma expansion profile. Hollow debris depositions of radius increasing with target thickness are measured from the target rear surface. This emission profile is explained by the propagation and breakout of a laser driven shock at the rear of the target. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
