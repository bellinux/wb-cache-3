25|$|The {{doctrines of}} papal primacy and papal {{supremacy}} {{are perhaps the}} greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Roman Catholic Church and the other Christian churches. Most Eastern Orthodox Christians, for example, would be <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accord the Bishop of Rome the same respect, deference and authority as is accorded to any Eastern Orthodox patriarch, but resist granting him special authority over all Christians. Many Protestants are <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> grant the pope a position of special moral leadership, but feel that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., {{that there can be}} no intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ.|$|E
25|$|Hythe (Red Lion Square): Was first {{mentioned}} at the January 1928 meeting of Hythe Chamber of Commerce by Charles Duruz, a local nurseryman, who had contacted the railway company and who indicated they were <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> build this extension. Nothing came of the proposal however. In 1946 the possibility of extending the railway to Red Lion Square, Hythe was investigated again, but the East Kent Road Car Co Ltd agreed to extend their bus service from Folkestone to terminate at the original Hythe station and the extension idea was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Semmelweis' {{advice on}} {{chlorine}} washings was probably more influential than he realized. Many doctors, particularly in Germany, appeared <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> {{experiment with the}} practical hand washing measures that he proposed, but virtually everyone rejected his basic and ground-breaking theoretical innovation— that the disease had only one cause, lack of cleanliness. Professor Gustav Adolf Michaelis from a maternity institution in Kiel replied positively to Semmelweis' suggestions— eventually he committed suicide, however, because he felt {{responsible for the death}} of his own cousin, whom he had examined after she gave birth.|$|E

25|$|When Porter's friend Ulysses S. Grant became {{president}} in 1869, he appointed Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie as Secretary of the Navy. Borie {{had no knowledge}} of the navy and little desire to learn, so he leaned on Porter for advice that the latter was <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> give. In a short time, Borie came to defer to him even on trivial routine matters. Porter used his influence with the secretary to push through several policies to shape the navy as he wanted it; in the process, he made a new set of enemies who either were harmed by his actions or merely resented his blunt methods. Borie was strongly criticized for his failure to control his subordinate, and after three months he resigned. The new secretary, George Robeson, promptly curtailed Porter's powers.|$|E
25|$|By the 1920s Winter Carnaval {{celebrations}} were abandoned, and Summer Carnaval {{remained the}} only Carnaval in Santiago de Cuba. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays {{during the month}} of June, everyone in Cuba knew one could go to Santiago to party. The major patrons of these summer festivities were local industries: Polar, La Cristal and Hatuey beers; Bacardi rum; and Eden tobacco. Many of the participants in Summer Carnaval were the newly unemployed sugar and coffee workers, who were <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> remain in Santiago after the harvest and work for their commercial patrons in the jobs that the festival season created. This combination- the unemployed and the commercial sponsor- contributed to the popularity of Summer Carnaval. During the 1940s and early 50s, Carnaval in both Santiago de Cuba and Havana became more commercialized.|$|E

In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ...

500|$|The {{translator}} Ross Smith {{comments that}} while Tolkien was cautious about publishing his translations of Beowulf, [...] "he was <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> explain {{the approach that}} in his opinion should be taken towards such a monolithic task." [...] Smith points out that, unlike publishing a prose or verse translation, explaining his translation criteria did not expose Tolkien to aesthetic criticism. Smith remarks that Tolkien is [...] "somewhat disdainful" [...] of Clark Hall's version, such things being useful as study-guides and little else; putting Old English poetry into modern English prose inevitably creates something [...] "dull and flat", so Tolkien much prefers versions that try to preserve the original's rhyme and metre. Smith notes that the same opinion {{can be found in}} Tolkien's essay [...] "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight".|$|E
500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January {{was impressed by}} the [...] "grown-up" [...] vision of the novel, declaring [...] "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [...] makes the most impossible adventures appear true". This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> submit to the illusion.|$|E
500|$|Prices of durians are {{relatively}} high {{as compared with}} other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24(Sultan), and Musang King (Mao Shan Wang) has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit. With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15). The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "flesh" [...] or [...] "pulp", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit. Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> spend up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.|$|E

[...] The researchers findings revealed that people living in metropolitan areas where lower levels of happiness are reported are receiving higher real wages, and they suggest in their conclusion that [...] "humans are <b>quite</b> understandably <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice both happiness and life satisfaction if the price is right." ...|$|R

500|$|The two {{companies}} {{that emerged from}} this labour/management conflict are usually known respectively as the [...] "Patent Company" [...] (the no-longer-united United Company) and [...] "Betterton's Company", although Judith Milhous argues that the latter misrepresents the cooperative nature of the actors' company. In the following period of intense rivalry, the Patent Company was handicapped by a shortage of competent actors. [...] "Seducing" [...] actors (as the legal term was) {{back and forth between}} the companies was a key tactic in the ensuing struggle for position, and so were appeals to the Lord Chamberlain to issue injunctions against seductions from the other side, which that functionary was <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do. Later Rich also resorted to hiring amateurs, and to tempting Irish actors over from Dublin. But such measures were not yet in place for the staging of The Relapse in 1696, Rich's most desperate venture.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt had {{specifically}} requested Saint-Gaudens {{not to put}} [...] "In God We Trust" [...] on the new coin, {{feeling that}} the motto's presence on coins was a debasement of God's name, as the coins might be spent to further criminal activities. [...] Saint-Gaudens was <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> omit the motto, as he felt the words detracted from the design elements. [...] There was a public outcry about the omission of the motto, and what Breen describes as an [...] "outraged and furious" [...] Congress ordered the motto to appear. [...] Barber duly modified the coin to include the motto, taking {{the opportunity to make}} several minor changes to the design, which, according to Breen, do not improve the coin. [...] In 1912, two more stars were added to the obverse to reflect the admission of New Mexico and Arizona to the Union. [...] The existing stars were not adjusted in position; the two new ones were placed on the outcropping at the lower right.|$|E
500|$|Van Praag {{states that}} the Ming court {{established}} diplomatic delegations with Tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses. Wang and Nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all, that Tibetan areas were ruled by the Ming since Tibetan leaders were granted positions as Ming officials, that horses were collected from Tibet as a mandatory [...] "corvée" [...] tax, and therefore Tibetans were [...] "undertaking domestic affairs, not foreign diplomacy". Sperling writes that the Ming simultaneously bought horses in the Kham region while fighting Tibetan tribes in Amdo and receiving Tibetan embassies in Nanjing. He also argues that the embassies of Tibetan lamas visiting the Ming court were {{for the most part}} efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas' large, wealthy entourage and Ming Chinese merchants and officials. Kolmaš writes that while the Ming maintained a laissez-faire policy towards Tibet and limited the numbers of the Tibetan retinues, the Tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the Ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power. Laird writes that Tibetans eagerly sought Ming court invitations since the gifts the Tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter. As for the Yongle Emperor's gifts to his Tibetan and Nepalese vassals such as silver wares, Buddha relics, utensils for Buddhist temples and religious ceremonies, and gowns and robes for monks, Tsai writes [...] "in his effort to draw neighboring states to the Ming orbit so that he could bask in glory, the Yongle Emperor was <b>quite</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay a small price". The Information Office of the State Council of the PRC lists the Tibetan tribute items as oxen, horses, camels, sheep, fur products, medical herbs, Tibetan incenses, thangkas (painted scrolls), and handicrafts; while the Ming awarded Tibetan tribute-bearers an equal value of gold, silver, satin and brocade, bolts of cloth, grains, and tea leaves. Silk workshops during the Ming also catered specifically to the Tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring Tibetan Buddhist iconography.|$|E
