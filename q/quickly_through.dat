5|$|Hurricane Iniki made {{landfall}} on the south-central {{portion of}} Kauai island, bringing its dangerous inner core {{to the entire}} island. Upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.5–6feet (1.4–1.8m), with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet (5.5m). In addition, strong waves of up to 35feet (10.5m) in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours, causing a debris line of more than 800feet (250m) inland. Because it moved <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> the island, there were no reports of significant rainfall.|$|E

5|$|By 6:30am {{the fire}} was {{spreading}} very <b>quickly</b> <b>through</b> the building, although from the outside nothing was visible.

On the street there lay several dead and injured people, who had jumped from their hotel room windows. On the lower floor, the furniture store Inden was also on fire.

He was the Rangers' starting first baseman for 92 games in 2009 and hit 21 home runs, but a low batting average and a tendency to strike out left the Rangers dissatisfied with him. Because of this, the Rangers sent Davis back and forth between the minors and the majors over the next two years and left him off their playoff roster in 2010. On July 30, 2011, they traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Tommy Hunter for Koji Uehara.|$|E
