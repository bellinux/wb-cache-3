5|$|George Tillson, his sons, and his {{brother-in-law}} Benjamin Van Norman were the principal stockholders of the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Road Company, which they formed along with approximately 200 shareholders in September1849. Proceeding <b>quickly,</b> <b>the</b> company established eight toll booths along the new route, which {{became known as}} the Plank and Gravel Road due to the materials with which it was constructed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of open (not park) coursing, the (British) National Coursing Club {{evidence}} to the Burns Inquiry said that muzzled coursing can cause more suffering than unmuzzled if the coursing officials {{are not able to}} reach injured hares <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> Irish Council Against Bloodsports, an organisation that campaigns against hare coursing has video evidence that shows this happening, even in enclosed coursing.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1688, the sheet-copper roof of {{the church}} was {{destroyed}} in a fire, but the church was restored relatively <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> storm in 1726 destroyed the roof again. The decreased congregation could not afford the renovation {{and moved to the}} town church. In the 19th century, the reconstruction of the ruins into a romantic castle park was started.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quickly</b> Cavallino, <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> T, <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> TT and <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> TT/K {{did not use}} {{the same}} frame as <b>the</b> other <b>Quickly</b> models. <b>The</b> Cavallino had a tubular steel frame similar to a {{conventional}} motorcycle, but without a downtube. The T had a unique unit frame including a front tube and a rear fender [...] The TT and TT/K used the Cavallino frame.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> F/23, <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> F {{essentially}} replaced the L {{at the top}} of <b>the</b> traditional <b>Quickly</b> line. It was similar in styling and appearance to the S2/23, but it had rear suspension combining the swingarm from the L with the tall spring/damper units from the Cavallino and TT. <b>The</b> <b>Quickly</b> F was manufactured from 1962 to 1963.|$|R
5000|$|The TT {{used the}} frame from the Cavallino {{and the front}} {{suspension}} (including structural front fender) and high-compression motor unit from <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> T. <b>The</b> <b>Quickly</b> TT mopeds were manufactured from 1959 to 1963. [...] The TT/K, a TT with a kickstarter, was available from 1960 to 1961, in which time 12,200 TT/Ks were manufactured.|$|R
5|$|The new CSG International grew <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> {{convergence}} of phone, internet, on-demand movies, {{and other services}} created more complex billing arrangements between telecommunications companies and consumers, which led to more extensive use of billing services providers like CSG. Professional services and international clients, which were previously not {{a significant portion of}} revenues, grew to 22 percent of revenues by the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} kinetic properties of an enzyme are how <b>quickly</b> <b>the</b> enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate, and the maximum rate it can achieve. Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare them, {{see that they}} are identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton is in love with Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress <b>Quickly.</b> <b>The</b> act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quickly</b> Cavallino used <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> {{motor unit}} {{but had a}} more {{conventional}} motorcycle frame and appearance. The Cavallino had telescopic front forks, a dual seat, a three-speed transmission, and 23 &times; 2.25" [...] wheels. 21,584 Cavallino mopeds were manufactured from 1957 to 1960.|$|R

5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish <b>quickly</b> <b>the</b> means of acquiring this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E
5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered <b>quickly,</b> <b>the</b> Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E
5|$|Bent on {{securing}} Reedman's investiture <b>quickly,</b> <b>the</b> Rhodesian {{government made}} it publicly known on 19 June that, pursuant to British and Portuguese approval, Reedman would be appointed within seven days. Whitehall still took no action. Wilson and his Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Arthur Bottomley, were occupied at Chequers, the official country {{residence of the}} British Prime Minister, where they were entertaining the Commonwealth heads of state.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} early 1847, but {{relationships}} between the LB and SER broke down <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was unstable, and test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won <b>quickly,</b> <b>the</b> Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu {{are extremely}} rare over the Arabian Sea, and most storms {{in this area}} tend to be small and dissipate <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> cyclone caused 50deaths and about $4.2billion in damage (2007USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E

The decision was taken to abandon the Cliffe Hill Mineral Railway, and the last train ran in March of that year.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that Y chromosome diversity tends to change more <b>quickly</b> than <b>the</b> overall population, because at least sometimes, some male lines move more <b>quickly</b> than <b>the</b> general population, meaning that the most common Y chromosomes in areas will reflect relatively recent [...] "waves" [...] of human movement.|$|R
5|$|Jack {{surfaced}} {{again after}} dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers {{found that the}} Japanese escorts were alert, {{and was unable to}} penetrate the convoy. As a result, he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 torpedoes from long range into the mass of ships {{at the center of the}} convoy. These attacks sank the 5,425-ton freighter SS Yoshida Maru No. 1, which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division. All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski led {{a spring}} 1627 {{military}} campaign, {{trying to keep}} the Swedish army in the Duchy of Prussia from moving toward Danzig, while also intending to block their reinforcements arriving from the Holy Roman Empire. Moving <b>quickly</b> <b>the</b> Hetman recovered Puck, and then destroyed at the Battle of Czarne (Hammerstein) the forces intended for Gustavus. The Swedes themselves Koniecpolski's forces kept near Tczew, shielding the access to Danzig and preventing Gustavus Adolphus from reaching his main objective. At the Battle of Oliva the Polish ships defeated a Swedish naval squadron.|$|E
5|$|Military {{planners}} in Paris {{understood that}} the northern Rhine Valley, the south-western German territories, and Switzerland were strategically important {{for the defense of}} the Republic. The Swiss passes commanded access to northern Italy; consequently, the army that held those passes could move troops to and from northern and southern theaters <b>quickly.</b> <b>The</b> river was a formidable barrier to what the French perceived as Austrian aggression, and the state that controlled its crossings controlled the river itself. Finally, control of the Upper Danube would allow France to move its troops from Italy to the North Sea, or any point in between, offering immense strategic value.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} and most basic version of <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> was <b>the</b> <b>Quickly</b> N. It used {{the original version}} of the engine, with a 5.5:1 compression ratio, which produced [...] at 4600 rpm. The N had a two-speed transmission that was operated from the handlebar. It ran on 26 x 2.00" [...] wheels front and rear. 539,793 Quickly N mopeds were manufactured from 1953 to 1962.|$|R

5|$|Offshore, a ship called Southern Isle was wrecked by {{the high}} surf. It had been sailing from Puerto Rico with a full load of iron ore and, as it {{approached}} the hurricane, the vessel changed directions and slowed down. By October 5, winds were strong and the seas were moderately rough. Very <b>quickly,</b> <b>the</b> ship broke into two, which prevented any time to escape on lifeboats. By {{the day after the}} wreck, rescue boats and helicopters found seven people, one of whom later died from their injuries. Ultimately, 17people died in the event.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more <b>quickly</b> <b>the</b> film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator that pulls the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quickly,</b> <b>the</b> Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
50|$|For {{cyclical}} stocks it {{is recommended}} to purchase when the P/E ratio is High, and sell them when the P/E ratio is Low. The opposite of normal practice.
