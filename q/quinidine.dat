25|$|<b>Quinidine,</b> reduces urinary {{excretion}} of <b>quinidine,</b> hence {{increasing the}} potential for toxicity.|$|E
25|$|The fluoroquinolones {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the anticoagulant effect of Acenocoumarol, Anisindione, and Dicumarol. Additionally there is an increase the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias when co administered with drugs such as Dihydroquinidine barbiturate, <b>Quinidine,</b> and <b>Quinidine</b> barbiturate.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} prolong the QT {{interval}} such as <b>quinidine,</b> verapamil, amiodarone, sotalol and methadone may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce additive QT interval prolongation.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, <b>quinidine,</b> fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Histone {{antibodies}} {{are positive}} {{in up to}} 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. DIThe most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are hydralazine, procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, <b>quinidine,</b> and minocycline.|$|E
25|$|Drugs with {{a direct}} {{membrane}} action: the prototype was <b>quinidine,</b> and lignocaine {{was a key}} example. Differing from other authors, Vaughan-Williams describe the main action as a slowing of the rising phase of the action potential.|$|E
25|$|Escitalopram is a {{substrate}} of P-glycoprotein {{and hence}} P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil and <b>quinidine</b> may improve its blood-brain penetrability. In a preclinical study in rats combining escitalopram with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor enhanced its antidepressant-like effects.|$|E
25|$|Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent {{blockers}} {{of cardiac}} membrane sodium channels {{and are more}} potent than lidocaine, <b>quinidine,</b> and procainamide in this respect. As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have {{the characteristics of a}} Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the FDA {{approved}} the combination product dextromethorphan/quinidine {{for the treatment}} of pseudobulbar affect (emotional lability). Dextromethorphan is the actual therapeutic agent in the combination; <b>quinidine</b> merely serves to inhibit the enzymatic degradation of dextromethorphan and thereby increase its circulating concentrations via inhibition of CYP2D6.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people {{being treated for}} a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, {{the most common of}} which are procainamide, isoniazid, hydralazine, <b>quinidine,</b> and phenytoin.|$|E
25|$|DL-Methionine is {{sometimes}} given {{as a supplement}} to dogs; It helps to reduce the chances of stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of <b>quinidine</b> by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.|$|E
25|$|DXM has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of approximately}} 4hours in individuals with an extensive metabolizer phenotype; this is increased to approximately 13hours when DXM {{is given in}} combination with <b>quinidine.</b> The duration of action after oral administration is about three to eight hours for dextromethorphan hydrobromide, and 10 to 12 hours for dextromethorphan polistirex. Around one in 10 of the Caucasian population {{has little or no}} CYP2D6 enzyme activity, leading to long-lived high drug levels.|$|E
25|$|Chlorpromazine {{may also}} {{interact}} with epinephrine (adrenaline) {{to produce a}} paradoxical fall in blood pressure. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and thiazide diuretics may also accentuate the orthostatic hypotension experienced by those receiving chlorpromazine treatment. <b>Quinidine</b> may interact with chlorpromazine to increase myocardialdepression. Likewise it may also antagonize the effects of clonidine and guanethidine. It also may reduce the seizure threshold and hence a corresponding titration of anticonvulsant treatments should be considered. Prochlorperazine and desferrioxamine may also interact with chlorpromazine to produce transient metabolic encephalopathy.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} pharmacokinetics, {{cimetidine}} in particular interferes {{with some of}} the body's mechanisms of drug metabolism and elimination through the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP) pathway. To be specific, cimetidine is an inhibitor of the P450 enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4. By reducing the metabolism of drugs through these enzymes, cimetidine may increase their serum concentrations to toxic levels. Many drugs are affected, including warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, <b>quinidine,</b> propranolol, labetalol, metoprolol, methadone, tricyclic antidepressants, some benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, sulfonylureas, metronidazole, and some recreational drugs such as ethanol and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} for mild cases is simply reassurance and topical treatment with calcium-channel blocker (diltiazem, nifedipine) ointment, salbutamol inhalation and sublingual nitroglycerine.For persistent cases, local anesthetic blocks, clonidine or Botox injections can be considered. Supportive treatments directed at aggravating factors include high-fiber diet, withdrawal of drugs which have gut effects (e.g., drugs that provoke or worsen constipation including narcotics and oral calcium channel blockers; drugs that provoke or worsen diarrhea including <b>quinidine,</b> theophylline, and antibiotics), warm baths, rectal massage, perineal strengthening exercises, anti-cholinergic agents, non-narcotic analgesics, sedatives or muscle relaxants such as diazepam.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are highly}} metabolised by the {{cytochrome}} P450 hepatic enzymes. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (for example cimetidine, methylphenidate, fluoxetine, antipsychotics, and calcium channel blockers) may produce decreases in the TCAs' metabolism, leading {{to increases in}} their blood concentrations and accompanying toxicity. Drugs that prolong the QT interval including antiarrhythmics such as <b>quinidine,</b> the antihistamines astemizole and terfenadine, and some antipsychotics may increase the chance of ventricular dysrhythmias. TCAs may enhance the response to alcohol {{and the effects of}} barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Side effects may also be enhanced by other drugs that have antimuscarinic properties.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin {{should not}} be used within 14days of using a monoamine oxidase {{inhibitor}} (MAOIs) such as phenelzine due to the potential for hypertensive crisis or serotonin syndrome to develop. Its use in those taking potent CYP2D6 inhibitors such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion, and <b>quinidine</b> is recommended against due to the potential for its accumulation in the absence of full CYP2D6 catalytic activity. Hepatic enzyme inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates are advised against in patients receiving TCAs like doxepin due to the potential for problematically rapid metabolism of doxepin to occur in these individuals. Sympathomimetic agents may have their effects potentiated by TCAs like doxepin. Doxepin also may potentiate the adverse effects of anticholinergic agents such as benztropine, atropine and hyoscine (scopolamine). Tolazamide, when used in conjunction with doxepin has been associated with a case of severe hypoglycaemia in a type II diabetic individual. Cimetidine may influence the absorption of doxepin. Alcohol may potentiate some of the CNS depressant effects of doxepin. Antihypertensive agents may have their effects mitigated by doxepin. Cotreatment with CNS depressants such as the benzodiazepines can cause additive CNS depression. Co-treatment with thyroid hormones may also increase the potential for adverse reactions.|$|E
500|$|Alkaloids are bitter-tasting chemicals, very {{widespread}} in nature, and often toxic, {{found in many}} medicinal plants. There are several classes with different modes of action as drugs, both recreational and pharmaceutical. Medicines of different classes include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine (all from nightshade), the traditional medicine berberine (from plants such as Berberis and Mahonia), caffeine (Coffea), cocaine (Coca), ephedrine (Ephedra), morphine (opium poppy), [...] nicotine (tobacco), reserpine (Rauwolfia serpentina), <b>quinidine</b> and quinine (Cinchona), vincamine (Vinca minor), and vincristine (Catharanthus roseus).|$|E

2500|$|<b>Quinidine</b> sulfate {{affects the}} way the heart beats, and is {{generally}} used in people with certain heart rhythm disorders. It {{is also used to}} treat malaria. <b>Quinidine</b> sulfate, as a metabolic inhibitor, [...] "increases plasma levels of dextromethorphan by competitively inhibiting cytochrome P450 2D6, which catalyzes a major biotransformation pathway for dextromethorphan," [...] enabling therapeutic dextromethorphan concentrations.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Quinidine,</b> verapamil, and {{amiodarone}} increase plasma {{levels of}} digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered.|$|E
2500|$|Other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system: {{inducers}} such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and rifampicin decrease plasma {{levels and}} inhibitors such as <b>quinidine,</b> buspirone, and fluoxetine increase plasma levels ...|$|E
2500|$|The cardiac action {{potential}} {{plays an important}} role in coordinating the contraction of the heart. The cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart. The {{action potential}}s of those cells propagate to and through the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Action potentials from the AV node travel through the bundle of His and thence to the Purkinje fibers. [...] Conversely, anomalies in the cardiac action potential—whether due to a congenital mutation or injury—can lead to human pathologies, especially arrhythmias. Several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential, such as <b>quinidine,</b> lidocaine, beta blockers, and verapamil.|$|E
2500|$|Alkaloids are {{produced}} by a large variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. They can be purified from crude extracts of these organisms by acid-base extraction. [...] Alkaloids have {{a wide range of}} pharmacological activities including antimalarial (e.g. quinine), antiasthma (e.g. ephedrine), anticancer (e.g. homoharringtonine), cholinomimetic (e.g. galantamine), vasodilatory (e.g. vincamine), antiarrhythmic (e.g. <b>quinidine),</b> analgesic (e.g. morphine), antibacterial (e.g. chelerythrine), and antihyperglycemic activities (e.g. piperine). [...] Many have found use in traditional or modern medicine, or as starting points for drug discovery. [...] Other alkaloids possess psychotropic (e.g. psilocin) and stimulant activities (e.g. cocaine, caffeine, nicotine, theobromine), and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs. Alkaloids can be toxic too (e.g. atropine, tubocurarine). [...] Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste.|$|E
2500|$|Co-administration of <b>quinidine,</b> {{a potent}} CYP2D6 inhibitor, with tramadol, a {{combination}} {{which results in}} markedly reduced levels of desmetramadol, was found not to significantly affect the analgesic effects of tramadol in human volunteers. However, other {{studies have found that}} the analgesic effects of tramadol are significantly decreased or even absent in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. The analgesic effects of tramadol are only partially reversed by naloxone in human volunteers, hence indicating that its opioid action is unlikely the sole factor; tramadol's analgesic effects are also partially reversed by α2-adrenergic receptor antagonists like yohimbine, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron, and the 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 and SB-258719. Pharmacologically, tramadol is similar to tapentadol and methadone in that it not only binds to the MOR, but also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine due to its action on the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems, such as its [...] "atypical" [...] opioid activity.|$|E
2500|$|Clomipramine may {{interact}} {{with a number}} of different medications, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors which include isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine, antiarrhythmic agents (due to the effects of TCAs like clomipramine on cardiac conduction. There is also a potential pharmacokinetic interaction with <b>quinidine</b> {{due to the fact that}} clomipramine is metabolised by CYP2D6 in vivo), diuretics (due to the potential for hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) to develop which increases the risk for QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; due to both potential additive serotonergic effects leading to serotonin syndrome and the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with the SSRIs that inhibit CYP2D6 [...] ) and serotonergic agents such as triptans, other tricyclic antidepressants, tramadol, etc. (due to the potential for serotonin syndrome). Its use is also advised against in those concurrently on CYP2D6 inhibitors due the potential for increased plasma levels of clomipramine and the resulting potential for CNS and cardiotoxicity.|$|E

50|$|Quinimax and <b>quinidine</b> are the {{two most}} {{commonly}} used alkaloids related to quinine in the treatment or prevention of malaria. Quinimax is a combination of four alkaloids (quinine, <b>quinidine,</b> cinchoine and cinchonidine). This combination has been shown in several studies to be more effective than quinine, supposedly due to a synergistic action between the four cinchona derivatives. <b>Quinidine</b> is a direct derivative of quinine. It is a distereoisomer, thus having similar anti-malarial properties to the parent compound. <b>Quinidine</b> is recommended only for the treatment of severe cases of malaria.|$|E
50|$|The fluoroquinolones {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the anticoagulant effect of Acenocoumarol, Anisindione, and Dicumarol. Additionally there is an increase the risk of cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias when co administered with drugs such as Dihydroquinidine barbiturate, <b>Quinidine,</b> and <b>Quinidine</b> barbiturate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quinidine</b> {{intoxication}} {{can lead}} to a collection of symptoms collectively known as cinchonism, with tinnitus (ringing in the ears) being among the most characteristic and common symptoms of this toxicity syndrome. <b>Quinidine</b> toxicity can also invoke episodes of Torsades de Pointes - a rapid and dangerous ventricular rhythm.|$|E
5000|$|Intravenous <b>quinidine</b> is also {{indicated}} {{for treatment of}} Plasmodium falciparum malaria. [...] However, <b>quinidine</b> is not considered the first-line therapy for P. falciparum. The recommended treatments for P. falciparum malaria, according to the Toronto Notes 2008, are a combination of either quinine and doxycycline or atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone).|$|E
