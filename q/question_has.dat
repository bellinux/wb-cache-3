5|$|A {{conservative}} Washington D.C. think tank, and a Republican {{member of}} Congress, among others, {{have claimed that}} Gore has a conflict-of-interest for advocating for taxpayer subsidies of green-energy technologies {{in which he has}} a personal investment. Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity. Gore's spokesperson responded by stating that the Gores use renewable energy which is more expensive than regular energy and that the Tennessee house in <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been retrofitted to make it more energy-efficient.|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This <b>question</b> <b>has</b> attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E
5000|$|The 25 {{players in}} the winning block, along with one random {{audience}} member from the remaining 475 contestants, are placed on podiums {{in the middle of}} the set. Ten questions are given to the 26 players - the first three have two possible answers, the next three <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> three, and the final four <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> four. All players key in their answers. If a player answers correctly, they receive one point for each contestant who answered incorrectly. All players who choose a wrong answer receive nothing. The two highest scorers at the end of the round move on to the final quiz round, Round 5.There has also been a slight variation of this 26-player round where the contestants had to answer only six questions, with the first three <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> two possible answers and the last three <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> four options. Again, players who answered correctly scored one point for each incorrect answer of their opponents, and the two highest scorers advance to the final quiz round. (In a further variation of that round used in 2003, the players had to answer eight questions - the first four <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> two possible answers and the last four <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> four options each) ...|$|R

To determine Vietnamese <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> the equivalent meanings for a Vietnamese language based document retrieval system, we have to solve the problems: {{what is the meaning}} of a question? And, how can we determine the equivalent meanings of these questions? In this research, we established the method which can allows to determine the Vietnamese <b>questions</b> <b>having</b> the equivalent meanings...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three questions. Each <b>question</b> <b>has</b> three {{multiple}} choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their answers on their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E
5|$|The Tribunal {{consists}} of {{not less than}} three judges of the Supreme Court. Its opinions are binding on all other courts. Since the Tribunal was established in 1994, to date only one constitutional <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been referred to it. The Tribunal determined in 1995 that although Article 5(2A) was not in force, Article 22H(1) did not prevent Parliament from restricting the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. Since then, {{there have been several}} unsuccessful attempts to persuade Cabinet to invoke the Article 100 procedure.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} {{consists}} of two questions. In season 1, the first required the team to rank three answers in a stated order and started with a value of $15,000. The second had an opening value of $25,000 and {{any or all of}} the answers could have been correct; the contestants had select all correct answers, and only the correct answers in order to get credit. Starting in season 2, the $15,000 <b>question</b> <b>has</b> two or all three answers being correct, and the team must select all of the correct answers, and only the correct answers; the $25,000 question requires the team to rank the three answers in the correct order.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E

5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} <b>question</b> <b>has</b> been {{whether it was}} carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
