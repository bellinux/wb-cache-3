30|$|The {{high heat}} {{capacity}} of the water leads to rapid cooling of magma and hot rocks, and generates chilled margins, quenching fragments and other special morphology features in particle surfaces such as <b>quenching</b> <b>crack</b> and fracture (Yu et al. 2011).

Additionally, the bread-crusted structures (Fig. 1 b) and cauliflower-shaped surfaces are the result of quenching fragmentation when hot pyroclastics are interacted with cooled water. This interaction also produces brittle breaks and stepped fractures after cooling. These microtextures of quenching cracks, bread-crusted structures, cauliflower-shaped surfaces and irregular fractures of the Quaternary Nanlongwan volcano in Jilin Province can indicate that there may have been phreatomagmatic eruption with water involved.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{criterion}} for preventing <b>quench</b> <b>cracks</b> {{has not been}} established although much {{research has been conducted}} in this field. A few predictions of cracking have been recently reported using simulated results of heat treatment processes. However, these results were insufficient to predict crack generation clearly because the mechanism relates not only to stress distributions in the parts but also to material characteristics. Systematic studies by the combination of experiment and simulation are therefore required to reliably identify a {{criterion for}} crack prevention by computer simulation. As a preliminary work before starting the full-scale research, a review of <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> research was conducted and existing test methods were classified.

When modifying processing and chemistry of disk alloys to achieve this capability, it is important to preserve the ability to use rapid cooling during supersolvus heat treatments to achieve coarse grain, fine gamma prime microstructures.

30|$|The working {{conditions}} of the shearer walk gear are harsh, thus the shearer walk gear {{is one of the}} weakest parts in the shearer. In order to improve its work life, the electro-slag remelted steel material 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WE was used to make the shearer walk gear. The electro-slag remelting greatly reduces the harmful content of non-metallic materials (these ingredients are the causes of <b>quenching</b> <b>crack</b> and fatigue crack), increases the purity of materials, and maximizes material performance. As the gear modulus was large and there was no standard hob, the gear tooth was machined twice, the first machining cut using NC wire cutting, leaving 2 – 3  mm allowance. The second machining was precisely machined to its place using a processing center. In particular, in the last processes, the amount of feed and cutting speed should be strictly controlled to avoid obvious cutting marks (machining marks are the stress concentration source of gear’s tooth; currently fracturing of the shearer walk gear is often caused by these marks). To reduce the gear tooth’s early failure due to stress concentration, it should be treated by shot-blast after heat treatment.|$|E

40|$|Ever-growing {{requirements}} on combustion engine efficiency of motor vehicles demand increasing service loads in powertrain components. Optimization of component material is therefore inevitable. A major detriment with many forged transmission components is their anisotropic mechanical behavior, not least during cyclic loading. Any forging operation will introduce material flow and therewith orientation into the material. With the bulk material also non-metallic inclusions will be deformed. This {{orientation of the}} microstructure is held responsible for mechanical anisotropy. Manganese sulfides (MnS) in engineering steel are indigenous non-metallic inclusions which appear according to chemical specifications. These sulfides may generate benefits during component machining and are therefore widely accepted. Microstructural investigations on several materials showed that manganese sulfides deform excessively during any hot deformation operation of the steel. However, by solid solution hardening of the sulfides with calcium (Ca), original inclusion shapes can be maintained throughout a deformation operation. The present investigation {{is concerned with the}} examination of the influence of deformed MnS inclusions on fatigue anisotropy. Experimental as well as commercial medium carbon steels with standard and low sulfur (S) contents and therewith different sulfide populations have been hot deformed. Hardened test specimens of those steels, taken in short-transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the deformation direction, were then fatigue tested. For material with standard S content, fatigue limits in longitudinal test direction are generally twice as high as in short transverse direction. Fractographic investigations showed that fatigue crack initiation is dominated by sulfide inclusions which ultimately can be held responsible for material anisotropy. The very poor fatigue resistance in short transverse direction {{can be attributed to the}} appearance of clustered sulfides, where the geometry of such clusters is not accessible by any established metallographic procedure. Diminishing of sulfide inclusions did improve isotropy. Yet, the most powerful measure to increase isotropy of the material proved to be an additional Ca treatment of the sulfides. Thus, quasi isotropic material could be created. In-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope chamber showed that manganese sulfides bond very poorly to the steel matrix. Manganese sulfides in a steel matrix should therefore be seen as inherent micro-cracks. The nature of discoid sulfides being micro-cracks matters also during material hardening where current production material shows a considerably higher <b>quench</b> <b>crack</b> propensity as compared with low S material. <b>Quench</b> <b>cracks</b> initiate at flattened sulfides. Machinability of low S material did not show to be problematic at high cutting speeds.

40|$|In a {{previous}} disclosure, {{the use of}} 60 - NiTiNOL, an ordered intermetallic compound composed of 60 weight percent nickel and 40 weight percent titanium, was investigated as a material for advanced aerospace bearings due to its unique combination of physical properties. Lessons learned during the development of applications for this material {{have led to the}} discovery that, {{with the addition of a}} ternary element, the resulting material can be thermally processed at a lower temperature to attain the same desirable hardness level as the original material. Processing at a lower temperature is beneficial, not only because it reduces processing costs from energy consumption, but because it also significantly reduces the possibility of <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> and thermal distortion, which have been problematic with the original material. A family of ternary substitutions has been identified, including Hf and Zr in various atomic percentages with varying concentrations of Ni and Ti. In the present innovation, a ternary intermetallic compound consisting of 57. 6 weight percent Ni, 39. 2 weight percent Ti, and 3. 2 weight percent Hf (54 Ni- 45 Ti- 1 Hf atomic percent) was prepared by casting. In this material, Hf substitutes for some of the Ti atoms in the material. In an alternate embodiment of the innovation, Zr, which is close in chemical behavior to Hf, is used as the substitutional element. With either substitution, the solvus temperature of the material is reduced, and lower temperatures can be used to obtain the necessary hardness values. The advantages of this innovation include the ability to solution-treat the material at a lower temperature and still achieve the required hardness for bearings (at least 50 Rockwell C) and superelastic behavior with recoverable strains greater than 2 %. Most structural alloys will not return to their original shape after being deformed as little as 0. 2 % (a tenth of that possible with superelastic materials like 60 NiTiNOL). Because lower temperatures can be used in the heat treatment process, less energy will be consumed, and there will be less dimensional distortion and <b>quench</b> <b>cracking.</b> This results in fewer scrap parts, less material waste from large amounts of material removal, and fewer machining steps to rework parts that are out of specification. This material has a combination of properties that have been previously unobtainable. The material has a Young s modulus of approximately 95 GPa (about half that of conventional steels), moderate density (10 to 15 % lower than conventional steels), excellent corrosion resistance, and high hardness (58 to 62 HRC). These properties make this material uniquely suited for advanced bearings...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{turbine engine}} {{configurations}} using higher temperature combustor and airfoil concepts require compressor and turbine disks that can withstand temperatures {{higher than the}} 650 C typical of current engines. This requires disk alloy and processing improvements. A versatile disk alloy was needed that could be given either fine grain heat treatments for high strength and fatigue and creep resistance up to 704 C or given coarse grain heat treatments for high strength and creep and dwell crack-growth resistance at higher temperatures. This alloy could produce disks with uniform microstructures and properties, {{as well as with}} varied, optimized microstructures at disk bore and rim sections. A series of experimental disk alloys were designed and processed to give subscale disks about 13 cm in diameter and 4 cm thick. These alloys had varying levels of key elements to affect mechanical properties and change the "solvus" solution heat-treatment temperature necessary to produce coarse grain microstructures. Disks were given coarse grain heat treatments followed by rapid oil quenching and slower fan air quenching. These heat treatments were intended to simulate the cooling paths of rapidly cooled full-scale disks at the outermost rim and interior bore locations, respectively. Preliminary quench tests of tensile specimens and coin-size minidisks had indicated that alloys having high solvus temperatures were more prone to <b>cracking</b> during rapid <b>quenching</b> from coarse grain heat treatments. These findings were confirmed in the subscale disks, where such alloys did form undesirable <b>quench</b> <b>cracks.</b> Mechanical tests were performed on specimens from subscale disks given these coarse grain heat treatments, as well as on specimens given a fine grain heat treatment. Tensile, creep, and crack growth tests were performed at 704 C and higher temperatures. A versatile alloy was identified that had a low solvus temperature for resistance to <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> as well as an optimal combination of high levels of strengthening refractory elements that produced balanced high mechanical properties for both fine grain and coarse grain microstructures. This low-solvus, high-refractory (LSHR) alloy has been scaled-up to produce prototype full-scale turbine disks typical of regional jet turbofan engines. Disks were successfully heat treated to give uniform coarse grain and uniform fine grain microstructures. Additional disks were given a NASA dual microstructure heat treatment (DMHT) that intentionally varied the solution heat-treatment temperatures between the disk rim and bore (re f. 1). The disk rim was heated to a high enough temperature to produce a coarse grain microstructure, while the bore was maintained at a lower temperature to produce a fine grain microstructure (see the figure). This DMHT can produce optimal high strength, fatigue, and creep resistance up to 704 C in the cooler running disk bore, and high strength, creep resistance, and dwell crack growth resistance at higher temperatures for the hotter disk rim. Extensive mechanical testing is being initiated to compare the mechanical properties of the uniform and DMHT disks...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} Low Carbon Bainitic-Martensitic (LCBM) steels {{can be used as}} railway wheels since they are expected to provide significant benefits both in longer life and improved performance compared with conventional pearlitic-ferritic steels. Railway wheel standards require that compressive stresses are formed in the tread region of as- manufactured railway wheels to retard the initiation and propagation of cracks due to fatigue. However, when LCBM railway wheels are produced in a similar fashion as pearlitic-ferritic railway wheels, unfavourable tensile residual stresses are formed in the tread region rendering this process unsuitable. Dilatometric studies were undertaken to characterise the strains associated with volumetric changes during austenite to martensite phase transformation in LCBM steels. The results were incorporated in a thermo-mechanical Finite Element (FE) model to study changes in microstructure and stress distribution in LCBM railway wheels for different quenching conditions and configurations. A novel quenching method was developed and found to give the desired compressive residual stresses in the tread region of LCBM wheels. Experiments were undertaken to verify the predictions of the FE model which relied on estimated Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTCs). A full-size experimental railway wheel quenching rig was constructed and embedded with thermocouples to measure cooling rates in various locations of a LCBM wheel for different quenching conditions. Experimental values of HTCs were determined for different quenching spray intensities and the novel quenching process was optimised by preferentially quenching selected regions of the wheel and evaluating different spray intensities. vi Residual stress measurements were undertaken to confirm the presence of compressive stresses in the tread region of LCBM railway wheels, thereby validating the novel quenching process. The risks of <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> in LCBM railway wheels were investigated and the results showed that adopting a low coolant spray intensity with a low carbon grade LCBM steel is expected to reduce the likelihood of <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> without adversely affecting standard wheel requirements for compressive stresses in the tread region. A crack growth model was also developed to investigate the fatigue performance of LCBM railway wheels produced using this novel quenching process. The level and distribution of as- manufactured rim residual stresses were shown {{to play an important role}} in retarding stress reversal due to thermal stresses from tread braking. Under similar service loadings, LCBM wheels were found to possess longer fatigue lives (by approx. 50 %) compared to conventional pearlitic-ferritic wheels. There is potential for wider applications of LCBM steels if quenching processes can be developed to promote compressive stresses in fatigue prone regions. A critical review of large gear failures and mechanical requirements concluded that steels with good hardenability, core strength and toughness are beneficial for use in large gears. The FE model was used to develop a two-stage quenching process for LCBM large gears and the compressive stresses at the base of the teeth of the gear were predicted to exceed those of conventional induction hardened SAE gear steels, potentially extending the life and performance of large gears...|$|R

This plant is composed of 2 counter rotating belts that are supported, internally, by small steel rollers, connected to each other by small axes. The failure occurred prematurely on rollers. These components undergo to static and dynamic stresses below the yield strength of material. Low alloyed steel is employed for the production of the rollers and the components are carburized on the external surface. The rollers present cracks on the external surface, that is in contact with the wood panels, already after few hours in service. Other components did not undergo cracking even for very long service times (about 5000. h). Both rollers that failed in service and rollers without cracks were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy in order to evaluate the microstructure of the components. In particular, the microstructure of the rollers was investigated on the surface and in the core of the rollers. Vickers micro-hardness measurements were employed for the characterization of the mechanical properties of the rollers. Successively, a cross section of a broken roller was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) On the same sample, after microstructural characterization, a micro-hardness profile was acquired from external surface to the core in order to evaluate possible over carburizing or oxidation phenomena. The results obtained from both the microstructural and mechanical characterization of the failed rollers indicate that the possible causes of the in service failure are related to <b>quenching</b> <b>cracks</b> or fatigue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The Asososca Tephra {{comprises}} the asymmetrically distributed, well-stratified phreatomagmatic {{products of the}} 1245 + 125 /− 120 yr BP Asososca maar eruption West of Managua, Nicaragua. It is the youngest eruptive unit related to the monogenetic volcanism concentrated along the N–S trending Nejapa–Miraflores active fault and intersecting E–W to NE–SW and NW–SE minor faults. The close relationship between monogenetic volcanism and the structural-local tectonic framework {{is evidenced by the}} lineament domains and vent alignment patterns identified by remotely sensed images and DEMs of the research area. The Asososca maar lake bathymetry suggests that the crater was formed by coalescing vents migrating during the eruptive event. The Asososca Tephra dominantly consists of accidental lithics disrupted from the underlying stratigraphic units observed inside and around the maar crater. Dry base-surge bedsets are dominant throughout the eruptive unit, showing facies variation from proximal, cross-stratified beds to mid-distal plane-parallel and wavy-parallel beds. Grain-size analyses indicate that base surges transported dominantly − 1, 0, and 1 ϕ sized particles at the bedload in form of traction carpets, while fine ash material in continuous suspension was minimal. Juvenile fragments were only identified in the finer fractions, varying from vesiculated scoriae to dense sideromelane fragments. SEM analyses suggest that the Asososca eruption resulted from a highly efficient fuel–coolant interaction between a tholeiitic basaltic melt and an aquifer hosted in a shallow level (between 50 and 200 m) of olivine-bearing scoria ash and lapilli beds. The explosion triggered the country-rock comminution and the production of moss-like, fused-shaped, and blocky ash-shards with stepped surfaces, <b>quenching</b> <b>cracks,</b> pitting, alteration skins, and adhered particles, all indicative of phreatomagmatic fragmentation. The very recent age of the Asososca maar eruption confirms that the densely inhabited Managua area is volcanically active and that hazard studies should focus on the potential for phreatomagmatic eruptions...|$|R
40|$|Cast iron is an alloy of iron {{containing}} {{more than}} 2 % carbon as an alloying element. It has almost no ductility {{and must be}} formed by casting. ductile iron structure is developed from the melt of cast iron. The presence of Si in higher amount promote the graphitizarion inhibiting carbon to form carbides with carbide forming elements present the carbon forms into spheres when Ce, Mg, {{are added to the}} melt of iron with very low sulphur content having this special microstructure containing graphite in nodular form gives ductile irin thus the ductility and toughness superior to that of any cast iron and steel structure finding numerous success in industrial application however heat treatment is a valuable and versatile too for extending both the consistency and range of properties of ductile iron casting beyond the limits of those produced in as-cast condiotion. Thus to fully utilize the potentioal of ductile iron castings, the designer should be aware of wide range of heat treatment available for ductile irin and its response to this heat treatment. Although ductile iron and steel are superficially similar metallurgically, the high carbon and silicon level in ductile iron results in important differences in their respionses to heat treatment. The high carbon leels increase hardenibility, permitting heavier sections to be heat treated with lower requirements for expensive alloying or severe quenching media also may cause, <b>quench</b> <b>cracking</b> due to the formation of high C martensite. This undesireable phenomena maje the control of composition, austenitising temperature and quenching conditions more critical in ductile iron. Since the formation of martensite is accompanied byu internal stresses, tempering is necessary in order to relieve the internal stresses, decreases the amount of retained austenite and reduces the probability of cracking. Austempering is a critical heat treating process in which austenite transforms isothermally to lower bainite rather than martensite and thus objectively reduces distortion and cracks. It is possible to achieve much larger ranges of tensile strength, ductility with toughness by adopting austempering, heat treatment process of ductile iron...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{crucibles}} consisting {{mainly of}} metal-reinforced ceramic ampules {{have been developed}} for use in experiments in which material specimens are heated in the crucibles to various high temperatures, then quenched by, for example, plunging the crucibles into water at room temperature. In a traditional quench crucible, the gap between the ampule and the metal cartridge impedes the transfer of heat {{to such a degree that}} the quench rate (the rate of cooling of the specimen) can be too low to produce the desired effect in the specimen. One can increase the quench rate by eliminating the metal cartridge to enable direct quenching of the ampule, but then the thermal shock of direct <b>quenching</b> causes <b>cracking</b> of the ampule. In a quench crucible of the present improved type, there is no gap and no metal cartridge in the traditional sense. Instead, there is an overlay of metal in direct contact with the ampule, as shown on the right side of the figure. Because there is no gap between the metal overlay and the ampule, the heat-transfer rate can be much greater than it is in a traditional quench crucible. The metal overlay also reinforces the ampule against cracking...|$|R
