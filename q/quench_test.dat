Therefore a <b>Quench</b> <b>Test</b> is planned in the winter 2013 to estimate the quench limit in this timescale and revise the current models. This experiment was devoted to determination the LHC Transverse Damper (ADT) as a system for fast losses induction. A non-standard operation of the ADT was used to develop the beam oscillation instead of suppressing them. The sign flip method had allowed us to create the fast losses within several LHC turns at 450 GeV during the previous test (26 th March 2012). Thus, the ADT could be potentially used for the studies of the UFO ("Unidentied Falling Object") impact on the cold magnets. Verification of the system capability and investigations of the disturbed beam properties were the main objectives of this MD. During the experiment, the pilot bunches of proton beam were excited independently in the horizontal and vertical planes to induce beam losses on the primary collimators (TCPs). An asymmetrical configuration of collimator jaws provided losses on only one side of an aperture. This created the conditions of a 3 -corrector orbital bump <b>Quench</b> <b>Test</b> which is planned for winter 2013. The temporal loss distribution and the loss duration at 4 TeV were determined.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of alumina-based refractories have been investigated. Chamotte and bauxite were the raw materials, being molded using a system of aluminate cement and water or a phenol-formaldehyde resin, as binder. Different raw material's grain size, water content, molding pressure, and firing temperature were selected for {{the preparation of the}} specimens. The mechanical strength of all specimens was determined using compressive tests, where parameters with physical meaning, such as maximum stress, maximum strain, elasticity parameter, and viscoelastic parameter were obtained after modeling the collected stress-strain data. In addition, water <b>quenching</b> <b>test</b> was performed for both samples, in order to present their thermal stability and mechanical wear after certain cycles. Process conditions as well as the raw materials' characteristics were correlated with the compressive properties. More specifically, maximum stress seemed to increase when increasing all parameters except grain size both for bauxite and chamotte samples. The increment of bonding phase, grain size, and molding pressure caused an increment in maximum strain for both types of refractories. However, the higher the firing temperature was the higher the maximum strain of bauxite appeared, while the maximum strain of chamotte samples was decreased. Modulus of elasticity seemed to increase with bonding phase content and firing temperature and decreased with grain size for both types of refractories. For bauxite samples higher molding pressure caused a decrement in elasticity parameter while for chamotte in caused an increment. As far as the <b>quenching</b> <b>tests</b> are concerned chamotte samples seemed to be more tolerant to thermal shock. After data acquisition, the change presented in elasticity parameter (E) was also modeled with the number of cycles.
