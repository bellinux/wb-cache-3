5|$|In the end Taub is not fired, but Dr. Terzi is {{let go and}} House's {{request for}} a date is turned down. Cuddy and House watch an early cut of the documentary, which has been edited to portray House as a compassionate, {{sympathetic}} doctor. House is aghast and leaves the room, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> he can still trust Michael Moore movies. The documentary continues, revealing that the surgery was successful, and that Kenny thanks Dr. House.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Die Another Day, the media began <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> or not Brosnan would reprise the role for a fifth time. At that time, Brosnan was {{approaching}} his 50th birthday. Brosnan kept in mind that both fans and critics were very unhappy with Roger Moore playing the role until he (Moore) was 58, but he was receiving popular support from both critics and the franchise fanbase for a fifth instalment. For this reason, he remained enthusiastic about reprising his role.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> the plan had outgrown its usefulness. After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had {{protected}} it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped {{in the years that}} followed.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Sewell, much <b>questioning</b> {{inwardly}} <b>whether</b> {{he could}} be truly described as such. [...] "I wish to befriend him," [...] he added savingly. [...] "I knew him at home, and I am sure of his innocence." ...|$|R
50|$|Marshal GuiltorreThe supreme {{commander}} of Giganos. Though he declares {{war on the}} Earth Federation, he truly treasures the Earth for its beauty, eventually <b>questioning</b> himself <b>whether</b> declaring war was really the right option, moments before he was murdered by Dorchenov.|$|R
5|$|From 1992 onward, many {{bodies were}} {{discovered}} orbiting {{in the same}} volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto {{is part of a}} population of objects called the Kuiper belt. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. The Hayden Planetarium reopened—in February 2000, after renovation—with a model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.|$|E
5|$|Slowed by knee injuries, Motley {{left the}} Browns after the 1953 season. He {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 as a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers but was released {{before the end}} of the year. He then pursued a coaching career, but was turned away by the Browns and other teams he approached. He attributed his trouble finding a job in football to racial discrimination, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> teams were ready to hire a black coach. Motley was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to debate whether or not she survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{should get}} along," [...] she returned, Light-heartedly, but upon <b>questioning</b> herself <b>whether</b> she should turn to Miss Milray for help, or {{appeal to the}} {{vice-consul}} himself, she was daunted a little, and she added, [...] "But just as you say, Mr. Bennam." ...|$|R
60|$|Certainly {{these men}} who had so few {{spontaneous}} ideas might be very useful members of society under good feminine direction, if they were fortunate in choosing their sisters-in-law! It {{is difficult to say}} whether there was or was not a little wilfulness in her continuing blind to the possibility that another sort of choice was in question in relation to her. But her life was just now full of hope and action: she was not only thinking of her plans, but getting down learned books from the library and reading many things hastily (that she might be a little less ignorant in talking to Mr. Casaubon), all the while being visited with conscientious <b>questionings</b> <b>whether</b> she were not exalting these poor doings above measure and contemplating them with that self-satisfaction which was the last doom of ignorance and folly.|$|R
25|$|Mark McGwire {{admitted}} to using steroids throughout his professional baseball career. The admission of steroid use caused {{many cases of}} <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> or not his long list of accomplishments should be rebutted. His most famous accomplishment undoubtedly {{took place in the}} 1998 season when he broke the single season home run record previously held by Roger Maris.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or try to solve their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E
30|$|A final remark {{to observe}} that albeit the <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> {{entrepreneurship}} has a standing base to become a fully-fledged discipline, it is becoming evident that there a number of phenomena benefit from an entrepreneurial lens. Moreover, as the field progresses novel conceptual approaches and theories are likely to emerge to tighten the domain in a well bounded discipline.|$|R

50|$|The God of Animals {{refers to}} Alice's <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> {{or not a}} god exists. Mr. Delmar, Alice's 7th grade English teacher, {{discusses}} religion with Alice during one of their many nightly conversations about life. While both Alice and Mr. Delmar state {{that they do not}} believe in God, Alice believes there should be a God to watch over animals.|$|R

25|$|Two {{ruptures}} in a Shell Oil Co. pipeline in Altamont, California - one in September 2015 {{and another}} in May 2016 - had some <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> the Office of the State Fire Marshal, charged with overseeing the pipeline, was doing an adequate job.|$|E
25|$|One {{meta-analysis}} {{has suggested}} that PBL education produces graduates with no better factual or clinical knowledge than students from a lecture-based course, despite {{in some cases the}} graduates' belief that they are, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> PBL learning is merely a popular trend.|$|E

25|$|By far {{the most}} acrimonious of the debates has been that {{over the role of}} {{genetics}} in IQ differences, which led to Eysenck being punched in the face by a protestor during a talk at the London School of Economics, as well as bomb threats, and threats to kill his young children. This opposition came when he supported Arthur Jensen's <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> variation in IQ between racial groups was entirely environmental (see Race and intelligence).|$|R
50|$|Within {{days of the}} attack, {{merchandise}} featuring Je suis Charlie {{was available}} for sale around the world. This led to critical <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> businesses were profiting off the tragedy or simply responding to market demand. By 12 January, eBay had more than 5,000 items on its site, including T-shirts, mugs, artwork, pins, posters, hats, phone cases, keychains and dogtags. The auction company announced it would donate fees earned from Je suis Charlie-related sales in France.|$|R
25|$|Support {{for a more}} {{integrated}} course includes that by allowing patient interaction early, the course produces students who are more at ease with communicating with patients and better developed interpersonal skills. Criticisms include, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> students {{in the first year}} have a place in the healthcare environment, when actual clinical knowledge may be virtually nil.|$|E
25|$|Originally, many {{scholars}} {{believed that the}} were-jaguar was tied to a myth concerning a copulation between a jaguar and a woman. Although this hypothesis is still recognized as viable by many researchers, other explanations for the were-jaguar motif have since been put forward, several <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> the motif actually represents a jaguar at all.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> women's {{right to vote}} is a good thing, Coulter has also appeared on Fox News and advocated for a poll tax and a literacy test for voters (this was in 1999, and she reiterated her support of a literacy test in 2015). This is not a viewpoint widely shared {{by members of the}} Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|Brown remains {{controversial}} among traditionalist Catholics {{because of}} their claim that he denied the inerrancy of the whole of scripture and {{cast doubt on the}} historical accuracy of numerous articles of the Catholic faith. Some conservatives were angered at his <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> the virginal conception of Jesus could be proven historically. He was regarded as occupying the center ground in the field of biblical studies, opposing the literalism found among many fundamentalist Christians while not carrying his conclusions as far as many other scholars.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will start}} with you," [...] the servant said, [...] "and walk with {{you until you}} are past the guards. There are many {{soldiers}} about in the quarter this morning, and I hear they are <b>questioning</b> every one <b>whether</b> they have seen aught of a country lad." ...|$|R
25|$|Controversy erupted {{over the}} practice. Many people, {{both men and}} women from {{backgrounds}} of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of women and their rights. There was <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> in practice the hijab was truly a female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it. Many instances, such as a period of forced veiling for women in Iran, brought these issues to the forefront and generated great debate from both scholars and everyday people.|$|R
25|$|Sitting on a less-than-spectacular 8-4 {{record and}} having {{lost in his}} {{previous}} two matches, Hug was struggling with depression and felt {{at odds with the}} sport, <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> or not he had it in him to continue at the elite level. He persisted, however, after a rejuvenating unanimous decision win over Jérôme Le Banner at K-1 Hercules on December 9, 1995 and went into the 1996 campaign in good form.|$|E
25|$|With {{the cave}} {{thoroughly}} searched, some divers began <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> Ben {{was there at}} all. Perhaps his body had been secretly removed from the cave before searching began and disposed of on land or it had washed out through the spring's outlet. Others, including Cronin and Kelly, suggested he had staged his own disappearance to start his life over under another identity and escape his past troubles. Authorities began to consider these possibilities and adjust their search.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} pratītyasamutpāda {{has also been}} {{compared}} to the Western philosophy of metaphysics, {{the study of the}} nature of being and ultimate reality. Schilbrack states says that the doctrine of interdependent origination seems to fit the definition of a metaphysical teaching, by <b>questioning</b> <b>whether</b> there is anything at all. Hoffman disagrees, and asserts that pratītyasamutpāda should not be considered a metaphysical doctrine in the strictest sense, since it does not confirm nor deny specific entities or realities.|$|E
25|$|Moneyline premiered in 1980 and was CNN's main {{financial}} {{program for}} more than 20 years. As the show, hosted by Lou Dobbs, moved more towards general news and economic and political commentary, it was renamed Moneyline with Lou Dobbs, Lou Dobbs Moneyline and then Lou Dobbs Tonight. In 2010, Dobbs – the last remaining original host from the network's launch in 1980 – resigned amid controversy over his <b>questioning</b> of <b>whether</b> President Barack Obama was a native-born U.S. citizen – a qualification for the presidency required under the U.S. Constitution.|$|R
60|$|These well-considered and {{important}} verdicts {{were of a}} nature to restore public confidence, which had been disquieted by <b>questionings</b> as to <b>whether</b> so young a teacher would be qualified to take so large a class as 70,000,000, distributed over so extensive a schoolhouse as America, and pull it through without assistance.|$|R
60|$|There was {{not much}} time to fill up in this way before the sound of wheels, the loud ring, and the opening doors assured {{her that she was}} not by any {{accident}} to be disappointed. This slightly increased her inward flutter. In spite of her self-confidence, she dreaded Klesmer as part of that unmanageable world which was independent of her wishes--something vitriolic that would not cease to burn because you smiled or frowned at it. Poor thing! she was at a higher crisis of her woman's fate than in her last experience with Grandcourt. The <b>questioning</b> then, was <b>whether</b> she should take a particular man as a husband. The inmost fold of her <b>questioning</b> now was <b>whether</b> she need take a husband at all--whether she could not achieve substantially for herself and know gratified ambition without bondage.|$|R
