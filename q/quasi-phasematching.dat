40|$|Integrated optics-based {{approaches}} to beam steering, beam shaping, beam collimation, and <b>quasi-phasematched</b> (QPM) {{second harmonic generation}} (SHG) of light offer significant advantages over conventional approaches based on bulk optics. The research in this dissertation addresses the analysis and design of optical guided-wave devices for both efficient <b>quasi-phasematched</b> second harmonic generation in diffused channel waveguides, as well as Bragg deflection of beams in planar waveguides. It is known that the normalized SHG efficiency depends on the linear properties of the waveguide through the overlap of the modal fields at the fundamental and second harmonic wavelengths. To analyze the linear modal properties, a fast and accurate modeling tool, based on an improved, semi-vector, Fourier method of analysis, is presented. The tool incorporates the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) and effective index methods to accurately determine the computational parameters required for the numerical calculation in the Fourier method so that automatic variation of the waveguide parameters is permitted. Using the modeling tool, the dependence of the SHG process on the waveguide parameters is investigated in detail, leading to waveguide designs with improved mode confinement, and consequently higher SHG efficiency. The phasematching characteristics of these improved designs are also calculated, and {{it is found that}} non-critical phasematching, or phasematching with wide tolerances to variations in the waveguide parameters, is possible in certain cases. The analysis of the waveguide-SHG process also indicates that efficiency can be improved by utilizing thin films on the waveguide surface to ensure that the peaks of the fundamental and second harmonic modes are coincident. This contributes to higher SHG efficiency through improved mode overlap as well, but it is demonstrated that this approach is clearly distinct from and independent of the mode-confinement approach. The analysis of planar overlays is based on recursion relations for the phase shift upon reflection at interfaces. The significance of this approach is demonstrated through the "matching" of the diffused waveguide to an independently-designed, multilayer overlay for the purposes of obtaining specific modal characteristics in the "integrated" structure. On a different note but incorporating similar approaches for analysis and design, beam shaping, steering, and collimation in planar waveguides, using Bragg gratings with finite area and non-uniform depth variation, are also discussed...|$|R

The fiber has two holesrunning along the core in which electrodes are inserted.

We also explain SPDC, the physical process which we use to produce entangled photons. Finally, we give an overview of the methods which have been used to produce entangled photons in the past, both for two- and three-photon entanglement. The first experiment is the design of an efficient source of entangled photon pairs based on a polarizing Sagnac interferometer configuration. With this configuration, we can use <b>quasi-phasematched</b> materials which allow for higher efficiencies than standard bulk nonlinear materials. The source is pumped by a low-power continuous-wave laser diode, and produces degenerate photon pairs at 809 nm.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of several novel, nanosecond pulsed, intracavity optical parametric oscillators for the generation of terahertz radiation. The application of the intracavity approach {{in the context of}} terahertz optical parametric oscillators has been demonstrated for the first time, and the pump wave energy required was thereby reduced by an order of magnitude. The terahertz wave was tunable from under 1 THz up to 3 THz with a free running linewidth of ~ 50 GHz and pulse energies up to ~ 20 nJ (pulses were a few nanoseconds in duration). The terahertz beam profile was of Gaussian shape and could be focussed down to 2. 3 times the diffraction limited spot size (M² values of 2. 3 and 6. 7 in the components of the beam parallel and perpendicular to the silicon prism array output coupler respectively). Developments of this intracavity source with regard to the linewidth are also reported. Implementation of etalons in the optical (laser and OPO) cavities was shown to be a promising technique that brings the terahertz linewidth down below 1 GHz (close to the transform limit of nanosecond pulses) while retaining the tuning range and beam characteristics of the free running system. Close to Fourier transform limited pulses were obtained (< 100 MHz linewidth) via an injection seeding technique, although with significantly increased system complexity. A deleterious effect caused by the mode beating of a multimode host laser was also discovered, in that sidebands were induced on the seeded downconverted wave. This has wider implications in the field of intracavity OPOs. Finally, <b>quasi-phasematching</b> techniques implementing periodically poled lithium niobate were investigated as a way to lower the downconversion threshold energy requirement (by collinear propagation of the optical waves), and also to extract the terahertz wave rapidly from the (highly absorbing in the terahertz region) lithium niobate crystal. The existence of two phasematching solutions arising from the bidirectionality of the grating vector was identified as a serious design constraint {{in the context of an}} OPO where either solution can build up from noise photons, and so prefers the solution with the lowest walkoff of the downconverted waves - possibly resulting in unextractable terahertz radiation. <b>Quasi-phasematching</b> with an orthogonal grating vector (with identical but opposite phasematching solutions) was demonstrated and cascaded downconversion processes observed and characterised. These cascaded processes are permitted by the collinearality of the optical waves and may allow efficiency improvements through overcoming the quantum defect limit.

Spectral modulation and broadening were observed on the output fundamental spectrum and compared to predictions from pulsed second-harmonic generation theory under conditions of group-velocity mismatch (temporal walk-off) and group-velocity dispersion. Peak cascaded phase shifts of the fundamental of approximately π at 855 nm were inferred with 690 W of peak guided power. Peak cascaded phase shifts of approximately π/ 2 were inferred at 1. 585 μm with 760 W of peak power in the guide. Direct interferometric measurements of the magnitude and sign of the cascaded nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental were performed in temperature-tuned lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) channel waveguides at 1. 32 μm.

Peak cascaded phase shifts of + 0. 53 π and - 0. 13 π were measured for 86 W peak power in these waveguides. A non-uniform temperature profile along the waveguide led to a non-uniform wavevector-mismatch along the guide, resulting in an enhanced positive phase shift and an increased temperature bandwidth for the phase shift.

Photon pairs are also experimentally demonstrated from a third novel structure called a Bragg Reflection Waveguide (BRW). The new proposal to solve the phase matching problem is called Directional Quasi-Phase Matching (DQPM). It is a technique that exploits the directional dependence of the non-linear susceptiblity (χ^(2)) tensor. It is aimed at those materials that do not allow birefringent phase-matching or periodic poling. In particular, it focuses on waveguides in which the interplay between the propagation direction, electric field polarizations and the nonlinearity can change the strength and sign of the nonlinear interaction periodically to achieve <b>quasi-phasematching.</b> One of the new conceptual methods for generating entangled photon pairs involves a new technique that sandwiches two waveguides from two differently oriented but similar crystals together. The idea stems from {{the design of a}} Michelson interferometer which interferes the paths over which two unique photon pair processes can occur, thereby creating entanglement in any pair of photons created in the interferometer. By forcing or sandwiching the two waveguides together, the physical space that exists in the standard Micheleson type interferometer is made non-existent, and the interferometer is effectively squashed. The result is that the two unique photon pair processes actually occupy the same physical path. This benefits the stability of the interferometer in addition to miniaturizing it. The technical challenges involved in sandwiching the two waveguides are briefly discussed. The main result of this thesis is the observation of photon pairs from the BRW. By analyzing the time correlation between two single photon detection events, spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) of a picosecond pulsed ti:sapph laser is demonstrated. The process is mediated by a ridge BRW. The results show evidence for type- 0, type-I and type-II phase matching of pump light at 783 nm, 786 nm and 789 nm to down converted light that is strongly degenerate at 1566 nm, 1572 nm, and 1578 nm respectively. The inferred efficiency of the BRW was 9. 8 · 10 ^- 9 photon pairs per pump photon. This contrasts with the predicted type- 0 efficiency of 2. 65 · 10 ^- 11. This data is presented {{for the first time in}} such waveguides, and represents significant advances towards the integration of sources of quantum information into the existing telecommunications infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and the characterization of periodically-poled crystals for use in lasers to generate visible and UV radiation by second-harmonic generation (SHG) through <b>quasi-phasematching</b> (QPM). Such lasers are of practical importance in many applications like high-density optical storage, biomedical instrumentation, colour printing, and for laser displays. The main goals of this work were: (1) to develop effective monitoring methods for poling of crystals from the KTiOPO 4 (KTP) family, (2) to develop useful non-destructive domain characterization techniques, (3) {{to try to find}} alternative crystals to KTP for easier, periodic poling, (4) to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for optical damage in KTP. The work shows that the in-situ SHG technique used together with electro-optic monitoring, makes it possible to obtain reliable, real-time information regarding the poling quality over the whole crystal aperture during the electric-field poling process. Using this combined monitoring method, both KTP and Rb-doped KTP (RKTP) crystals were successfully poled. By comparing these two crystals, we found that a low-doped KTP has a substantially reduced ionic conductivity and, thus, a high-quality periodic poling can be obtained without otherwise affecting the properties of the crystal. RKTP is a good alternative candidate to KTP for poling purpose. We have also shown that Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is an informative tool for investigating domain nucleation, growth, and merging. Furthermore, we have demonstrated a simple technique for 3 D characterization of QPM samples. It utilizes a group-velocity mismatched, type-II SHG of femtosecond pulses for layer-by-layer monitoring of the effective nonlinearity along the propagation direction of the beam. The quality of these crystals was finally reflected in a number of SHG experiments with a variety of laser sources. High energies and high efficiencies were thus demonstrated using CW, mode-locked and Q-switched lasers. Gratings with pitches smaller than 3 µm, were demonstrated for first-order UV generation. Type-II QPM SHG was demonstrated as a technique for reducing the fabrication constraints. High intensity light in the visible and the UV leads to modification of the material properties and, eventually, to optical damage. In KTP and its isomorphs, the first sign of material change is an optically-induced absorption. We have used thermal-lens spectroscopy with a common-path interferometer for high-sensitivity measurements of green light-induced infrared absorption dynamics in single-domain and periodically-poled KTP (PPKTP). The saturated, green light-induced absorption {{has been shown to be}} consistently higher in periodically-poled crystals, and is attributed to the creation of stoichiometric and interstitial defects in the crystals during the poling process. Finally, irreversible bulk damage thresholds in PPKTP have been determined for pulsed frequency converters. As the characteristics of optical damage are closely related to the material quality, this investigation can provide useful information for crystal manufactures and will help to optimise the crystal growth conditions...|$|E
