We evaluated whether D 1, D 2 (<b>quinelorane),</b> or D 3 dopaminergic receptor agonists influence basal and secretin-stimulated choleresis and lumen expansion in intrahepatic bile duct units (IBDU) and cAMP levels in cholangiocytes in the absence or presence of BAPTA-AM, chelerythrine, 1 -(5 -isoquinolinylsulfonyl) - 2 -methyl piperazine (H 7), or rottlerin.

40|$|Abstract—Dopamine {{agonists}} {{with a high}} {{affinity for}} D 2 and D 3 receptors have a biphasic effect on rodent locomotion, inducing hypolocomotion at low doses and hyperlocomotion at higher doses. Controversy surrounds {{the role of the}} D 3 receptor in mediating the hypolocomotor response to low agonist doses. This study examines patterns of neuronal activation induced by varying doses of the D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist <b>quinelorane</b> using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI), and compares them with corresponding behavioural responses. <b>Quinelorane</b> (3 g/kg) induced hypolocomotion in rats naive to the testing environment, and in phMRI experiments increased neuronal activity within the anterior olfactory nuclei, nucleus accumbens and islets of Calleja, regions containing a high density of D 3 receptors. A 30 g/kg dose of <b>quinelorane</b> resulted in biphasic locomotor effects, with initial hypolocomotion followed by sustained hyperlocomotion. phMRI indicated that this higher dose increased cerebral activity within limbic and olfactory regions, as did the lower drug dose, but induced additional activation in the caudateputamen and globus pallidus, areas dense in D 2 receptors but containing few D 3 receptors. The more restricted pattern of activation at low agonist doses and close temporal relationship between behavioural and BOLD signal responses to <b>quinelorane</b> suggest that those nuclei most dense in D 3 receptors {{play a key role in}} mediating the hypolocomotor effects of <b>quinelorane.</b> However, the presence of D 3 receptors in activated brain regions may be coincidental, and further studies are required to show definitively which class of receptors mediates agonist-induced hypolocomotion. In contrast, the activation of D 2 receptors within the striatum appears necessary for quinelorane-induced hyperlocomotion. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO...|$|E

In the present study, we measured basal levels of amino acids in microdialysates from both the shell and core subterritories of the nucleus accumbens in freely moving rats using HPLC with fluorescence detection. The effect of the dopamine D(3) /D(2) receptor agonist <b>quinelorane</b> (30 microg/kg s. c.) was then investigated in both subregions. With the exception of glutamate, histidine, and serine, which showed similar levels in both subterritories, alanine, arginine, aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and tyrosine were significantly higher in the shell compared with the core. In contrast, taurine levels were significantly lower in the shell than in the core.

We examined the effect of the NOP receptor antagonists, Compound 24 and J- 113397, and the synthetic agonist, Ro 64 - 6198, on time function of (2 - 2000 ms prepulse-pulse intervals) of acoustic (80 dB/ 10 ms prepulse) and visual (1000 Lux/ 20 ms prepulse) prepulse inhibition of startle reflex (PPI), a pre-attentive sensory filtering mechanism that is central to perceptual and mental integration. The effects of the dopamine D 1 -like receptor agonist, SKF- 81297, the D 2 -like receptor agonist, <b>quinelorane,</b> and the mixed D 1 /D 2 agonist, apomorphine, were studied for comparison. When acoustic stimulus was used as prepulse, BALB/cByJ mice displayed a monotonic time function of PPI and consistent with previous studies apomorphine and SKF- 81279 induced PPI impairment, while <b>quinelorane</b> had no effect. None of the NOP receptor ligands was effective on acoustic PPI. When flash light was used as prepulse, BALB/cByJ mice displayed a bell-shaped time function of PPI and all dopamine agonists were active. Ro 64 - 6198 was also effective in reducing visual PPI. NOP receptor antagonists showed no activity but blocked disruptive effect of Ro 64 - 6198. Finally, co-administration of the typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, attenuated PPI impairment induced by Ro 64 - 6198 revealing involvement of a dopaminergic component. These findings show that pharmacological stimulation of NOP or dopamine D 2 -like receptors is more potent in disrupting visual than acoustic PPI in mice whereas D 1 -like receptor activation disrupts both.

Pelvic afferent nerve test stimulation (TS; 1 pulse/ 30 s for 30 min) evoked baseline reflex activity with single spikes in the external urethral sphincter electromyogram (EUSE), whereas, repetitive stimulation (RS; 1 pulse/s for 30 min) induced SRP. Intrathecal application of <b>quinelorane</b> dihydrochloride (Q 110; 10, 30, and 100 nM, 10 mu l, a selective DR 2 agonist) dose dependently inhibited the RS-induced SRP. Pretreatment with L 135 (100 nM, 10 mu L it, a selective DR 2 antagonist) antagonized the Q 110 -dependent inhibition (100 nM, 10 mu l it). Intrathecal AMPA (10 mu M, 10 mu l, a selective glutamatergic AMPA receptor agonist), and NMDA (10 mu M, 10 mu l, a selective glutamatergic NMDA receptor agonist) reversed the Q 110 -dependent inhibition.

Accordingly, the D 1 agonist SKF 38393 (5 - 20 mg/kg) and the D 2 agonist <b>quinelorane</b> (0. 1 - 1 mg/kg) both synergistically magnified the memory-improving effects of the D 4 agonist.

With the recently published structure of the more closely related β 2 adrenergic receptor, whose endogenous ligands are also biogenic monoamine neurotransmitters, {{we have been able to}} develop an in silico-activated model of this G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) based on Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the membrane-bound and solvated protein. From this system, improved homology models of the serotonin 5 -HT 2 A and dopamine D 1 receptors have been created that appear well suited for the qualitative and quantitative study of agonist properties. ^ For the dopamine D 1 receptor, the models were employed to: (1) elucidate the catechol hydrogen bonding network using the selective agonist A- 77, 636 and two analogs; (2) probe the steric space at the bottom of the binding site with analogs of dihydrexidine (DHX) methylated at the 7 and 8 positions; and (3) investigate the binding of analogs of DHX with substitutions at the pendant aromatic ring. ^ In the case of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor, the binding of different classes of ligands was studied, including phenylalkylamines, tryptamines, and ergolines. For the latter, the observations were used to determine the region of the binding pocket occupied by an 8 -diethylamide group. Additionally, free energy of binding calculations using the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) method were performed, obtaining a model that showed a squared correlation coefficient of 0. 7018, with an associated error of 4. 56 kJ/mol– 1. Validation of this model was performed with an independent test set, which showed a squared correlation coefficient of 0. 7080. Notably, electrostatic interaction energies were not significant for this model. ^ Finally, the models were used to study the binding profiles of newly synthesized ligands. During the course of this investigation, two sets of ligands were synthesized. The first group, targeted toward the D 1 receptor, involved replacing the catechol group of DHX with a pyrazole or an aminopyrimidine ring, based on the structures of quinpirole and <b>quinelorane.</b> Only the pyrazole compound could be synthesized, and it showed poor binding affinity (18. 3 μM), probably due to the incorrect orientation of the polar pyrazole proton. The second group of compounds, designed as 5 -HT 2 A agonists, consisted of piperidine-based rigid analogs of a superpotent N-benzylphenethylamine. The (S,S) - 2, 6 -disubstituted piperidine analog retained most of the affinity (2. 5 nM) of the original ligand (0. 19 nM), and showed dramatically increased selectivity for the 5 -HT 2 A over the 5 -HT 2 C receptor of up to 128 -fold, making it the most selective 5 -HT 2 A agonist synthesized to date. Molecular modeling revealed that the rigidified N-benzyl group occupied the same general location in the 5 -HT 2 A binding site as the original flexible compound. ^ A better understanding of the subtle details of the activation process, as well as the interactions of various agonists with these receptors, will lead to new insights into the basis of their action, laying the groundwork for the design of more efficacious ligands with potential therapeutic and research applications. ...|$|E
