40|$|<b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> (Oak bark) {{has been}} used in European folk {{medicine}} since medieval times for treatment of diarrhea, stomatitis, pharyngitis and skin inflammations. Its antimicrobial activity is a well-known therapeutic property of oak bark, and its novel anti-quorum sensing (QS) ability has also been described recently. In this study, we examined the bioactive compounds of <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> extract and compared their direct antibacterial and regulatory anti-QS effects against Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 in a biotest. Evaluation of the original <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> extract showed weak antibacterial and prominent anti-QS activities that were retained and completely restored when the samples were dried and re-hydrated. The one-step liquid chromatography result indicated that the anti-QS activity might be determined by hydrophobic compounds; however, the subsequent reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography led to dissipation and loss of the activity. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry gave excellent resolution between a majority of the compounds. Based on this result, 10 of the 35 identified small molecules were selected for further screening. The subsequent investigation indicated several compounds determined both the antibacterial and anti-QS activities of the <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> extract. Direct antibacterial activity was shown for 1, 2, 3 -benzenetriol and 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -benzenediol, while sub-inhibitory concentrations of these compounds led to anti-QS effects. Five compounds: 4 -(3 -hydroxy- 1 -propenyl) - 2 -methoxy-phenol; 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenol; 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzaldehyde; 7 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxy- 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2 -one and 2 H- 1 -benzopyran- 2 -one were characterized as QS inhibitors independent of any effect on bacterial growth. Biologically relevant concentrations of each single component showed weak activity only while reconstruction of the small molecule composition derived from the <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> extract provided comparable complementary activity against C. violaceum CV 026 in the biotest as the crude extract...|$|E

30|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections {{are a common}} occurrence in children. Such infections are {{a significant source of}} illness and pose a substantial economic burden on health services and society, in general [1]. Since most of these infections are of viral origin, usefulness of antibiotic therapy following recent guidelines on {{respiratory tract}} infections [2, 3] is not an option and overuse of antibiotic therapy must be avoided anyway. Plant-based medicines are a therapeutic option, especially because of their good tolerability. Since over 50  years now, the phytotherapeutic medicine, Tonsilgon® N (known as Imupret® N in some countries), is used worldwide to treat acute and recurrent infections of the respiratory tract [4]. Tonsilgon® N is an ethanolic-aqueous extract of seven medicinal plants, namely marshmallow root (Althaeae radix), chamomile flower (Matricariae flos), yarrow herb (Millefolii herba), oak bark (<b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex),</b> walnut leaves (Juglandis folium), horsetail herb (Equiseti herba), and dandelion herb (Taraxaci herba). These medicinal plants have established pharmacological effects including immune modulating, antiseptic, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties [4, 5].|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to screen extracts of twenty Eastern European medicinal plants, using wild-type and reporter Chromobacterium violaceum bioassays, for novel components that target bacterial cells and their quorum sensing (QS) communication systems. Three types of activity and their combinations were revealed: (i) direct antimicrobial growth-inhibitory activity, (ii) non-specific and specific pro-QS activities, (iii) anti-QS activity. Among seven plant extracts showing direct growth-inhibitory activity, the strongest effect was shown by Arctostaphylos uva- -ursi (bearberry) leaves. Many plants stimulated violacein production by wild-type C. violaceum ATCC 31532 in a non-specific manner, and only the herb Bidens tripartita (three-lobe beggarticks) contained compounds that mimic acyl-homoserine lactone and operated as a QS agonist. Anti-QS activity was found in eleven plants including <b>Quercus</b> robur (oak) <b>cortex,</b> Betula verrucosa (birch) buds and Eucalyptus viminalis (Manna Gum) leaves. Subsequent statistical analysis showed differences between antimicrobial and anti-QS activities, whereas both activities were defined by phylogenetic position of medical resource plant. Finally, extract from <b>Quercus</b> robur <b>cortex</b> revealed at least two fractions, showing different anti-QS mechanisms. These data confirm that multicomponent anti-infectious mechanisms are used by plants, which may be useful for drug developmen...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{specificity}} of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair as marker of alcohol consumption exceeds by far those of fatty acid ethyl esters. False positive cases are therefore very rare but not excluded as recent publications have shown. Especially, {{the use of}} plant extracts containing high percentages of ethanol can lead to EtG hair concentrations typically found in cases of chronic alcohol consumption. As proposed by Baumgartner et al., a nucleohilic substitution could most likely explain this phenomenon. Fresh and dried plants as well as commercial hair lotions based on plants extracts have been analysed for EtG presence or EtG formation. Methods: Urtica dioica, Plantago lanceolata, <b>Cortex</b> <b>Quercus,</b> Sempervivum, Armoracia rusticana, Juniperus communis, Brassica alba, Thymian vulgaris, Salvia officinalis, Majorana hortensis, Aloe vera, birch gingko and green tea leafs, ginger, lemon grass were extracted in water, water/ethanol (50 / 50) and ethanol (100 %). The extracts as well as diluted hair lotions were measured by immunological test (Microgenics DRI® EtG assay) and by LC-MS/MS on Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC coupled with an AB Sciex 4500 QTrap. Results: EtG could not be detected in water extracts of all tested plants. However, DRI® EtG assay indicated the presence of EtG in 66 % of the tested ethanolic plant extracts. That could only be confirmed by mass spectrometry {{in the cases of}} fresh thyme as well as in dried birch, oak and plantain extracts where EtG concentrations between of 0. 25 and 2, 09 mg/l were measured. In one hair lotion, the EtG concentration was 0, 76 mg/l. Conclusion: Ethanolic plant extracts represents a non-negligible risk for false positive EtG hair tests, especially when applied as lotion without following washing out. The use of hair care products must therefore be evaluated at every hair sampling. In case of doubt, the product should be analysed by mass spectrometric methods since the presence of EtG can't be proven by use of the DRI® EtG assay, only. Our results support Baumgartner's assumption of a nucleophilic substitution in presence of ethanol because EtG was only measured in the ethanolic extracts...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Bokusoku (BK) is {{an extract}} from the <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> used in folk {{medicine}} {{for treatment of}} skin disorders and convergence, and is present in jumihaidokuto, a traditional Japanese medicine that is prescribed for purulent skin diseases like acne vulgaris. The excess of sebum production induced by androgen {{is involved in the}} development of acne. Our aim is to examine whether BK and its constituents inhibit testosterone metabolism and testosterone-induced sebum synthesis. Methods. Measurements of 5 α-reductase activity and lipogenesis were performed using rat liver microsomes and hamster sebocytes, respectively. Results. BK dose-dependently reduced the conversion of testosterone to a more active androgen, dihydrotestosterone in a 5 α-reductase enzymatic reaction. Twenty polyphenols in BK categorized as gallotannin, ellagitannin, and flavonoid were identified by LC-MS/MS. Nine polyphenols with gallate group, tetragalloyl glucose, pentagalloyl glucose, eugeniin, 1 -desgalloyl eugeniin, casuarinin, castalagin, stenophyllanin C, (−) -epicatechin gallate, and (−) -epigallocatechin gallate, inhibited testosterone metabolism. In particular, pentagalloyl glucose showed the strongest activity. BK and pentagalloyl glucose suppressed testosterone-induced lipogenesis, whereas they weakly inhibited the lipogenic action of insulin. Conclusions. BK inhibited androgen-related pathogenesis of acne, testosterone conversion, and sebum synthesis, partially through 5 α-reductase inhibition, and has potential to be a useful agent in the therapeutic strategy of acne...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} effect of different sources of tannins on the in vitro rumen fermentation with focus on methane production. In {{the experiment}}, a rumen simulation system (RUSITEC) equipped with 4 fermenters (1 L) was used in three replicated runs (6 d of adaptation and 4 d of sampling) to study the effects of <b>Quercus</b> <b>cortex</b> extract (QC), Vaccinium vitis idaea (VVI) dried leaf extract and a mixture of VVI/QC on rumen microbial fermentation. Fermenters were fed 10. 9 g/d of dry matter (DM) of a 600 : 400 forage:concentrate diet. Treatments were control, QC (2. 725 mL), VVI leaves 0. 080 g) and mixture of QC/VVI (1. 362 mL+ 0. 040 g) and were randomly assigned to fermenters within periods. The equivalent of 2. 5 g of tannins/kg dietary DM from three sources of tannins was evaluated. All tannin sources decreased CH 4 and ammonia concentrations, as well as protozoa and methanogen counts (P< 0. 001). Vaccinium vitis idaea and QC/VVI tended (P= 0. 005) to reduce the acetate to propionate ratio. There were no changes in nutrient digestion. Results suggest that these sources of tannins, especially VVI have the potential to reduce rumen CH 4 production and ammonia concentration without negative effects on in vitro DM digestibility, total volatile fatty acids and pH...|$|E
