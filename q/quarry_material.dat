In particular, both white-on-red potsherds of the Orientalising period and high-value polychromes of the Archaic period were considered. The white pigment, a fundamental element in this class of artworks, was not clearly identified in previous archaeological and analytical studies, although the use of kaolin was tentatively proposed. Therefore, samples from the Monte Sughereto kaolin quarry in the Cerveteri area were also studied. The results of detailed analyses carried out using micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy first show that the <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> is a high-purity kaolin containing quartz. Raman results strongly suggest that {{the same kind of}} kaolin was employed in the polychromes of the Archaic period. As to white-on red potsherds, infrared results have a key role in showing that the white pigment is a kaolin closely corresponding to the <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> since a particular kaolin polytype (dickite) is dominant in both cases. The present work thus provides the first definitive identification of the white pigment used in Etruscan polychromes on terracotta from the Cerveteri area, and suggests that the source of kaolin might be the Monte Sughereto quarry.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} of the current world and Australia is sustainable waste management. The major proportion of waste material within landfills is Construction and Demolition material (C&D). C&D material can be a suitable alternative for <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> in pavement applications. Typically, quarried materials are used in pavement base/subbase layers. With the increasing demand for high quality pavement materials and greater limitation of economic natural resources {{in many parts of}} Australia, replacement of traditional quarried materials with alternative materials is increasingly preferred from both environmental and economic perspectives. Cement stabilization of pavement bases/subbases is increasingly used in high-traffic metropolitan roads in Australia and worldwide. This paper reports on an investigation of cement stabilization of recycled C&D material in pavement base/subbase applications. Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) and Repeat Load Triaxial (RLT) and other geotechnical characterization tests on three type of C&D material treated by cement, have been undertaken. The process of strength development has been studied to evaluate the properties of Portland cement and its' effect on the strength development of C&D material. The geotechnical properties obtained were compared with existing local and state road authority specifications for pavement base and subbase applications (Austroads, 2009, VicRoads, 2011).

40|$|Environmental offsets and {{environmental}} trading initiatives are being rapidly introduced into environmental regulatory regimes. These relatively new legal mechanisms {{are attempting to}} fill in the gaps left by command and control regulation. The introduction of environmental offset and trading policy in Queensland will need to be compatible with existing land tenure regulation. Who owns and who uses natural resources are controlled by a range of legislative reservations and restrictions. Reservations give the State ownership of certain natural resources such as minerals, <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> and, in some circumstances, forest products. Where there is a reservation in operation, the land holders rights are weakened. Restrictions in relation to uses prevent land holders from carrying out certain activities on the land. An example of a restriction of use is the operation of the Vegetation Management Act 1999 (Qld), which prescribes the manner in which vegetation is to be dealt with. This article explores the nature of freehold and leasehold land tenure in Queensland and examines the effect of reservations and restrictions upon the operation of environmental offset and trading initiatives. Presently Queensland legislation does not directly address the relationship between land tenure {{and environmental}} offset and trading initiatives. The stability of tenure required for the creation of environmental offsets can be at odds with the flexibility allowed for under leasehold arrangements. This flexibility may act to undermine the permanency requirement of environmental offset creation (i. e. the guarantee that the offset is created for the long term) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the characterisation of fine aggregates manufactured from waste <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> and their use in concrete supported by artificial neural network models of the fresh and hardened concrete properties. The reutilization of rock filler, a by-product of the sand manufacturing process, as a soil liming material is explored. A set of tests and techniques were identified to characterise fine aggregates manufactured from quarry dusts via a dry processing system. Granite, limestone, sandstone and basalt manufactured sands and their unprocessed counterparts “feed quarry dusts” were characterised with respect to their shape and texture, grading and quality of fines (presence of clays). The results showed that the reprocessing of quarry dusts improves the particle shape and grading irrespective of rock mineralogy. Plasticised and non-plasticised concrete mixes were developed and the fresh and hardened properties tested. Concrete consistency, compressive and flexural strength is correlated with the fine aggregate characterisation test results. The manufactured fine aggregates showed a higher water demand when compared with natural sand whereas compressive and flexural strengths were enhanced. Artificial neural network models were developed to enable the prediction of the consistency and compressive strength of concrete. These models used the fine aggregate properties and mix composition parameters as input variables and were validated using a separate testing dataset, additional concrete mixes and numerical evaluation. Artificial neural network models were shown to be able to predict fresh and hardened concrete properties based on the fine aggregate characteristics. The excess fillers created in the sand manufacturing process were evaluated for soil liming potential through standard tests and a soil incubation study. The main finding was that materials with high silicate content exhibit a potential for liming, however, a higher dosage is required when compared to the dosage of high purity limestone to achieve the same liming potential...|$|E
40|$|The world {{second largest}} mercury (Hg) mine and smelter, the Khaidarkan Mercury Plant (KMP) {{is located in}} Khaidarkan, a small city in a valley in Batken oblast, Kyrgyzstan. The smelter roasts locally mined {{cinnabar}} and captures the mercury by condensation. At the plant there are several slag deposits with over 500 millions tonnes of exhausted ores as well as <b>quarry</b> <b>material</b> from the mines,containing traces of Hg and associated contaminants, such as arsenic, antimony, cadmium, lead and zinc. A large tailing pond containing wastes from the smelter has also been generated. Slag heaps and tailing pond are open and exposed, potentially leading {{to the spread of}} pollutants and regional contamination of soils and waters. Lack of fences allows animals to access contaminated sites for drinking and grazing. Seepage water from the tailing drains into a tributary of the Syr Darya River, the Shaktnaya River. Soil samples were collected along an elevation gradient on the main valley slope, and soil, sediments and water were sampled downstream from the Hg tailing area. Background samples were collected from a monitoring site located more than 10 km upstream (south) of the plant. In this study the levels of Hg in water, sediments and soil has been measured with a direct mercury analyser (DMA- 80). A sequential extraction procedure was conducted in order to measure the main pools of Hg in the soil and thereby assess main mechanisms governing Hg mobility and transport. Water samples were collected in streams in the area. The water samples and extracts from the sequential extraction were analysed for concentration of Hg with a Millennium Merlin Hg analyser. In addition, the levels of heavy metals in the soil, sediment and water samples were measured with ICP-AES. The level of Hg in soil and sediment in Khaidarkan is high, ranging from 0. 4 to 8 795 μg g- 1. The highest value, which is somewhat extreme, was found in sediments in a small stream draining the slag heaps. Up the valley slope, values from 0. 4 to 53 μg g- 1 were found, while downstream from the tailing pond the level of Hg ranged from 3. 5 to 217 μg g- 1. The concentration of Hg in the tailing pond sediments was 353 μg g- 1. This concentration of Hg is quite high and exemplifies the poor efficiency of the waste management at the facility. The levels of other associated heavy metals are generally high, especially for antimony, cadmium and arsenic. Enhanced levels were found also for lead and zinc. It is hypothesised that the contamination of these heavy metals in the area {{is a result of the}} anthropogenic activity of the KMP. Interpretation of statistical analysis of the data(correlation matrixes, cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) supports this postulation. The sequential extraction procedure revealed that Hg is mainly present as residual Hg (as HgS or bound in silicates) in the soil and sediments. The soil samples up-valley from the slag heaps contain in addition a significant amount of strongly bound Hg (i. e. acid soluble). As the levels of Hg decrease as a function of distance from the source up-valley from the burners and slag heaps it is apparent that atmospheric emission and transport of Hg is significant. Even though a few of the downstream sediment samples contain some elemental Hg, it appears as Hg is mainly mobilised and transported from the slag heaps and tailing pond as residual Hg, in the form of colloids or particles. High level of Hg in a flooding area indicates that Hg is mobilised and transported in periodic peak flow events. The high level of dissolved Hg that was found in the drainage waters indicate that solved Hg species are also mobilised from the waste areas to the surrounding environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{offshore}} wind {{industry is a}} growing market in Europe due to the sustainable energy targets of European Union. In the coming years the Dutch government will invest in {{offshore wind}} farms at the North Sea. For a contractor like Boskalis the inclusion of favorable ecological conditions in designs is a unique selling point and can help to win tenders to build offshore wind farms and acquire projects. This was {{the starting point of}} this thesis. The thesis is split up in two parts. The first part is an extensive literature study and searches for opportunities and influencing parameters to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life. The second part of the thesis will explore one opportunity in detail, which can be included in bed protection design of offshore wind farms. The research question is formulated as follows: "How can technical aspects of bed protection designs of offshore wind turbines be altered to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life?" Part I: Literature review and parameter study In {{the first part of the}} thesis interviews with ecologists are conducted to gain knowledge about ecological systems, and to explore the social acceptability besides the motivation to win tenders. The ecologists don’t support installations of offshore wind farms, because it is not natural and anthropogenic interferences are in principal not good. However, in the past a significant part of the North Sea floor consisted of hard substrate, but due to trawling activities by humans this hard substrate is removed. Nowadays the North Sea floor consists of sand. By placing stones for the bed protection of offshore wind farms, hard substrate will be added which was present in the past. So, the hard substrate balance will more or less be restored. Furthermore, offshore wind turbines will be built, so then it is better to build them properly and in consultation with the environment. In the extensive literature study a technical analysis and an ecological analysis are conducted. During this literature study the context and scope of this research are defined. The scope is set to the bed protection of one offshore wind turbine. The technical analysis resulted in the structure, failure mechanisms, and design calculations of the bed protection. The ecological analysis focuses on the two key species, and biodiversity in general. The key species are the European lobsters and the European cod. The outcome of the literature study is a list of controllable parameters for functional requirements. This is a list with potential parameters in combining favorable ecological conditions and technical requirements. From this list the pore-size distribution is chosen to investigate in further detail. The pore-size distribution includes the cavity sizes and openings in which species can find shelter. The parameter study and selection of the parameter pore-size distribution is the outcome of the first part of this thesis. ? Part II: Model and interpretation The second part of the thesis focuses on the pore-size distribution and the pore openings, derived from a stone-size distribution. Furthermore, it focuses on the ecological interpretation of the derived distributions. First of all models are designed and evaluated to crack this problem. The chosen models are an analytical model of spheres and an experimental model. The analytical model of spheres is based on geometry and is derived to give indications and to validate the results of experimental model. The analytical model provides results to describe the pore size and the pore openings of uniform spheres. The pore-size distribution of multi-sized spheres could not be derived. However, the pore-opening distribution of multi-sized spheres is derived. The results of this distribution are approximated with a curve fit of a normal distribution. The experimental model is executed with a medical CT scanner and imaging software. First, a test scan is made to identify the possibilities and limits of this method. Secondly, a validation scan is made of glass balls to explore the errors and the accuracy of the medical CT scanner and the imaging software. The results of the validation scan are compared with the analytical results. Both models showed the same result. Therefore, an experimental program is designed and 8 scans are performed on stones (<b>quarry</b> <b>material).</b> The sieve curve of the stones is in advance specified and manufactured. The formula that describes the pore-size distribution, after analyzing the scans with the imaging program and post-processing of the data, is derived. Also a formula that describes the number of pores is found. The pore openings are also investigated during the same experiment. However, the constriction-size distribution is not derived using the experimental model. Most of the constrictions are connected using this model. Therefore, a few constrictions are manually investigated and the results could not falsify the analytical results. The derived formulas for the pore-size distribution and the pore opening distribution are applied on a brief case study of a bed protection of an offshore wind turbine. In this calculation example, the pore sizes are compared with the preferred pore sizes for the lobster. Targeted pore sizes can be created by applying another grading width, other stone sizes, or changing the porosity. In this way the bed protection could be adapted to the preferences of the lobster. The research question is answered within the scope of this research: the pore-size distribution is one of the technical aspects found, which can be included and altered in bed protection designs to provide favorable ecological conditions for marine life. The pore-size distribution has until now not been included in bed protection designs, while, in fact, it is always installed. This distribution can be derived, and future bed protections can be designed based on favorable cavity sizes for species, as well as technical stability. This holds for the constriction-size distribution. The main recommendation for the industry is: The pore-size distribution can be included in future designs to estimate the impact of the structure on the species. Moreover, designs of civil rock works can be based on the preferred pore sizes for native species. This fits perfectly in the philosophy of Building with Nature. The four main recommendation for further research are: * Testing this principle with an ecological pilot. * Scanning and analyzing more samples to make the formula statistical more reliable. * Further development of the experimental model. Extra properties of the pores, such as the shape, can be derived and included in the model. * Adding more species by describing the limiting conditions of these species in a matrix.
