5|$|Zukovsky's <b>quayside</b> caviar factory {{was shot}} entirely at the outdoor water tank at Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} Captain Matthew Moran was fatally injured while {{boarding}} at the Dublin <b>quayside,</b> when the gangway collapsed beneath him. He {{was replaced by}} Captain Eric Jones (see Crew).|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the <b>quayside</b> at Watchet were removed by 1920, but other features were removed or altered piecemeal over time. By 1940, for example, no trace remained of Washford station, but both sets of level crossing gates remained in place.|$|E
50|$|On July 17, 2005 he photographed almost 1,700 nudes on the <b>quaysides</b> at Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, {{including}} the Gateshead Millennium Bridge.|$|R
25|$|Public realm {{improvements}} of this regeneration include newly landscaped <b>quaysides</b> {{opened to}} the public and the first section of a new boulevard (Isambard Brunel Way) aimed at reconnecting city centre and waterfront, a long-held Plymouth planning policy aim.|$|R
50|$|Twelve Quays {{is named}} from the <b>quaysides</b> which served the {{adjoining}} Morpeth Dock, Egerton Dock, Alfred Dock, Wallasey Dock and East Float, {{as well as}} <b>quaysides</b> on the River Mersey. Wallasey Dock was infilled in 2001, to expand the land area of the site. The area was an artificial island, until the infilling of the Morpeth Dock entrance. Twelve Quays includes the former Wallasey Dock Impounding Station, and the Central Hydraulic Tower. Several bridges connect Twelve Quays to Birkenhead and Seacombe, two of these being along Tower Road and one {{at the entrance to}} Egerton Dock. Another of the bridges along Tower Road was removed, when the East Float entrance to Egerton Dock was infilled.|$|R
5|$|TheHeart and NumberOne are the {{residential}} {{elements of the}} development, providing 378 apartments in two tower blocks. TheHeart is a 22-storey apartment building on the <b>quayside</b> and NumberOne, another 22-storey building, is next to the studio facilities.|$|E
5|$|Once peace {{agreements}} {{had finally}} been settled – the French Governor of Bayonne being the last, on 26 April – the army left the Peninsula; the infantry marched to Bordeaux for transportation {{to their new}} postings. The 1/52nd were returned to England and, on 6 June 1814, stood on the <b>quayside</b> at Dover with their Light Division comrades from the 43rd and 95th {{as part of the}} official welcome for the Allied sovereigns visit to England.|$|E
5|$|The film {{concerns}} a middle-aged railway pointsman, Maloin (Miroslav Krobot), {{who lives in}} a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia (Tilda Swinton) and his daughter Henriette (Erika Bók). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark <b>quayside,</b> Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (János Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the <b>quayside,</b> and Maloin within.|$|E
50|$|Battery {{electric}} railcars used by British Rail {{included the}} British Rail BEMU and British Rail Class 419. The Class 419, operational from 1959 to 2004 could run either on batteries or a third rail {{being used for}} short unelectrified section on <b>quaysides.</b>|$|R
50|$|On September 11, 2005, he photographed 1,493 nudes in Lyon on the Rhône <b>quaysides</b> and {{footbridge}} resp. between containers. On March 19, 2006, Tunick photographed 1,500 nudes in Caracas, {{having people}} standing up, lying down, {{and on their}} knees beside the main Simón Bolívar statue.|$|R
5000|$|Stone <b>quaysides</b> are {{sometimes}} called moles. A well-known {{example is the}} Molo in Venice. It {{is the site of}} the Doge's Palace and two pillars which form a gateway to the sea. [...] It has been depicted numerous times by artists such as Canaletto.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Oxford, Hooper {{directed}} further television commercials, intending {{to break into}} the film industry the same way Ridley Scott, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson did. He was introduced by his father to the television producer Matthew Robinson, who mentored Hooper and gave him his first television directing work. For Robinson, Hooper directed episodes of the short-lived Tyne Tees Television soap opera <b>Quayside</b> in 1997, four episodes of the Children's BBC television series Byker Grove in the same year, and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera EastEnders in 1998.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the 7th century, the <b>quayside</b> {{settlement}} at Gipeswic (Ipswich) became an important estuarine trading centre, receiving imported goods such as pottery from other trading markets situated around the coasts of the North Sea. Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as a reflection of the personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
5|$|Kinkaid next became Executive Officer of , {{one of the}} navy's newest battleships, in February 1933. By {{coincidence}} {{the ship}} was at anchor in Long Beach, California when the 1933 Long Beach earthquake struck. Over {{the next few days}} thousands of sailors and marines participated in relief activities. Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected tarpaulins on the <b>quayside</b> to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from Colorado.|$|E
50|$|The centre {{occupies}} a curved glass {{and stainless steel}} building designed by Foster and Partners, Buro Happold (structural engineering), Mott MacDonald (building services) and Arup (acoustics), with views of Newcastle and Gateshead <b>Quaysides,</b> the Tyne Bridge and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge. Foster and Partners were selected following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions.|$|R
50|$|The River Barrow, {{historically}} {{a significant}} highway, was {{developed as a}} commercial navigation in the mid seventeen hundreds and Graiguenamanagh served as the main base for commercial barges operating on the river until barge traffic ceased in 1959. The barges {{that at one time}} lined the <b>quaysides</b> are now replaced by some one hundred pleasure craft.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Birkenhead Docks became an {{important}} flour milling centre, with numerous companies, including Joseph Rank Ltd and Spillers, located on the Great Float's <b>quaysides.</b> In the 1990s, long after the industry had gone into decline, most of these buildings were demolished. Two large warehouses remain, which have now been converted into residential apartments.|$|R
5|$|A diving stage, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the basket, or diver launch and recovery system (LARS), is a platform on which one or two divers stand which is hoisted into the water, lowered to the workplace or the bottom, and then hoisted up again to return the diver {{to the surface and}} lift him out of the water. This equipment is almost exclusively used by surface supplied professional divers, as it requires fairly complex lifting equipment. A diving stage allows the surface team to conveniently manage a diver's decompression as it can be hoisted at a controlled rate and stopped at the correct depth for decompression stops, and allows the divers to rest during the ascent. It also allows the divers to be relatively safely and conveniently lifted {{out of the water and}} returned to the deck or <b>quayside.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tenth of}} the city's {{workforce}} is employed at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard, which is directly linked to the city's biggest industry, defence, with the headquarters of BAE Systems Surface Ships located in the city. BAE's Portsmouth shipyard has been awarded {{a share of the}} construction work on the two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers, with both aircraft carriers set to enter Portsmouth Harbour upon completion. A £100 million contract was signed to develop the facilities at Portsmouth that will be necessary to support the vessels. There is also a major ferry port that handles both passengers and cargo, and the city has a dedicated fishing fleet consisting of 20 to 30 boats that operate out of the camber docks in Camber Quay, Old Portsmouth. They land fresh fish and shellfish daily, most of which is sold at the <b>quayside</b> fish market.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the <b>quayside.</b>|$|E
50|$|Below Argentat {{and around}} Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne, the valley widens to {{accommodate}} fertile farmland, well-watered pasture and orchards. In the towns, which are major tourist attractions {{because of their}} history and architecture, the <b>quaysides</b> are lined with eating and drinking places. In Périgord, the valley widens further to encompass one of France's main gastronomic regions, with vineyards, poultry farms and truffle-rich woodlands.|$|R
5000|$|Bellevueplatz ("Bellevue Square", {{from the}} French bellevue meaning [...] "beautiful sight") {{is a town}} square in Zürich, Switzerland built in 1856. Named after the former Grandhotel Bellevue on its north side, {{it is one of}} the nodal points for roads and public {{transportation}} in Zürich, as well as an extension of the <b>quaysides</b> in Zürich that were built between 1881 and 1887.|$|R
2500|$|Land {{transportation}} of bulky minerals like limestone and coal was {{difficult in the}} pre-industrial era due to the poor condition of the roads, so they were distributed by sea; the lime most often being manufactured at small coastal ports and then taken inland by carts.

5|$|Maloin {{calls to}} the butcher's and drags Henriette from the store against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife (Kati Lázár). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, {{revealing}} that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home {{to the consternation of}} Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the <b>quayside</b> below.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2005, Hardee's {{body was}} {{recovered}} from Greenland Dock, {{after he was}} reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January; he had been last seen late-night on 30 January. A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying {{to make his way}} home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the <b>quayside,</b> Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos on Campbeltown now disembarked: two assault teams, five {{demolition}} {{teams with}} their protectors and a mortar group. Three demolition teams were tasked with destroying the dock pumping machinery and other installations {{associated with the}} dry dock. The kilt-wearing Captain Donald Roy – 'The Laird' – and his 14-man assault troop were tasked with knocking out two pump-house roof-top gun emplacements high above the <b>quayside</b> and securing a bridge to provide a route for the raiding parties to exit the dock area. Roy and Sgt Don Randall used scaling ladders and grenades to accomplish the former, and a head-on rush to secure the bridge and form a bridgehead that enabled Capt. Bob Montgomery and Lt Corran Purdon and their demolition teams to exit the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Sechseläutenplatz and <b>quaysides,</b> there is also Café Odeon, where writers and the Zürich Bohème would meet, the Kronenhalle and Vorderer Sternen restaurants, and the Limmatquai and other attractions downstream along the Limmat.In the historic tram stop building, there are two snack bars and a kiosk, a public toilet ZüriWC, and the ticket store of the Zürcher Verkehrsverbund (ZVV) public transportation company.|$|R

5000|$|From the 17th and 18th centuries, old cannon {{were often}} used as {{bollards}} on <b>quaysides</b> to help moor ships alongside. The cannon would be buried in the ground muzzle-first to approximately half or two-thirds of their length, leaving the breech (rear end) projecting above ground for attaching ropes. Such cannon can still occasionally be found. Bollards from the 19th century were purpose-made, but often inherited a very similar [...] "cannon" [...] shape.|$|R
5|$|The {{high levels}} of poverty in the East End have, {{throughout}} history, corresponded with {{a high incidence of}} crime. From earliest times, crime depended, as did labour, on the importing of goods to London, and their interception in transit. Theft occurred in the river, on the <b>quayside</b> and in transit to the City warehouses. This was why, in the 17th century, the East India Company built high-walled docks at Blackwall and had them guarded to minimise the vulnerability of their cargoes. Armed convoys would then take the goods to the company's secure compound in the City. The practice {{led to the creation of}} ever-larger docks throughout the area, and large roads to drive through the crowded 19th century slums to carry goods from the docks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the dock afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of <b>quayside</b> was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained {{an integral part of the}} dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E
5|$|The West India Docks were {{established}} in 1803, providing berths for larger ships and a model for future London dock building. Imported produce from the West Indies was unloaded directly into <b>quayside</b> warehouses. Ships were limited to 6000tons. The old Brunswick Dock, a shipyard at Blackwall {{became the basis for}} the East India Company's East India Docks established there in 1806. The London Docks were built in 1805, and the waste soil and rubble from the construction was carried by barge to west London, to build up the marshy area of Pimlico. These docks imported tobacco, wine, wool and other goods into guarded warehouses within high walls (some of which still remain). They were able to berth over 300 sailing vessels simultaneously, but by 1971 they closed, no longer able to accommodate modern shipping. The most central docks, St Katharine Docks, were built in 1828 to accommodate luxury goods, clearing the slums that lay {{in the area of the}} former Hospital of St Katharine. They were not successful commercially, as they were unable to accommodate the largest ships, and in 1864, management of the docks was amalgamated with that of the London Docks. The Millwall Docks were created in 1868, predominantly for the import of grain and timber. These docks housed the first purpose built granary for the Baltic grain market, a local landmark that remained until it was demolished to improve access for the London City Airport.|$|E
50|$|As {{shipping}} transitioned from sail {{to steam}} methods, there became {{a need for}} places for seafarers to go while they were ashore, as ships could now dock at <b>quaysides</b> because they {{no longer had to}} anchor at sea waiting for a favourable wind. In response, the Mission gradually opened centres so that the men could be offered light refreshments, reading and games rooms, good cheap accommodation and a chapel. The Mission now operates over 250 centres in the world.|$|R
50|$|Quaianalagen (German, plural; quays, or quaysides; from des quais), or Seeuferanlagen (German, plural for lakeshore sites) on Lake Zürich (Zürichsee), is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a series of lakefronts in Zürich. Inaugurated in 1887, the <b>quaysides</b> are considered an important milestone {{in the development of}} Zürich. The construction of the lake fronts transformed the medieval small town on the rivers Limmat and Sihl to a modern city on the Lake Zürich shore. The project was managed by engineer Arnold Bürkli.|$|R
50|$|Wyllie was {{the most}} {{distinguished}} marine artist of his day and his work is still in great demand. From 1906, {{when he moved to}} Portsmouth, he became closely associated with the Royal Navy. So much so, indeed, that he was buried with full naval honours in 1931. In a moving ceremony, reminiscent of Nelson’s state funeral in 1806, his body was rowed up Portsmouth Harbour in a naval cutter past battleships with dipped colours and bugles calling and <b>quaysides</b> lined with dockyard workers.|$|R
