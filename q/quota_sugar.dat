40|$|The various {{assessments}} {{of the effects of}} a liberalization of world sugar markets are largely inconsistent. One cause seems to be the modeling of the EU supply response. We investigate three possible linkages between production <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> and the out-of-quota or "C" sugar supply: i/ the existence of fixed costs covered by the in-quota sugar; ii /the "overshooting" behavior as prevention against poor yields; iii/ the production of C sugar as "reference building" in view of expected reforms. Modeling these effects results in the introduction of an implicit cross-subsidy between in <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> and C sugar. The resulting specification is included in a detailed model of EU agricultural sector so as to account for intersectoral linkages. We simulate the effects of the reform of the sugar sector proposed by the EU Commission in July 2004 and the effects of a ban on sugar export subsidies. The cuts in production and prices required to eliminate export subsidies are larger than those proposed by the Commission. However, the reform proposal makes large a decrease in tariffs possible. The need to eliminate export subsidies appears more constraining than the constraints on tariffs reduction for the EU. As expected, different assumptions on the interaction between in-quota prices and C sugar supply {{have a significant impact on}} the results and explain some of the differences observed in the literature regarding the effect of sugar market liberalization.

40|$|Brazil, {{along with}} Australia and Thailand, {{formally}} requested on July 21 st 2003 {{the establishment of}} an arbitration panel on the basis of two challenges to the EU sugar regime. The challenge deals with: the 'cross subsidisation' of EU 'C' sugar exports through the high prices maintained for EU 'A' and 'B' <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> production, which allow 'C' sugar to be exported at prices below the EU's costs of production; the exclusion of 1. 6 million tonnes of EU sugar exports (equivalent to the EU's preferential imports, largely from ACP countries) from the subsidy reduction commitments which the EU has made under the Uruguay Round. Brazil and Australia have repeatedly stressed that the challenge is not aimed at the EU's system of preferential imports from ACP countries. The ACP nevertheless feel that the challenge is likely to directly affect ACP suppliers and have responded accordingly, appealing to Australia and Brazil to take ACP interests into account. Brazil claims its industry losses some US$ 900 million per annum {{as a result of the}} EU's sugar subsidies. Comment: Given the outcome of the earlier challenge to the Canadian dairy regime which consisted of similar features to the EU sugar regime, there would appear to be a good chance of the dispute arbitration panel finding in favour of the claimant.

Comment: With its low cost structure of production, Brazil is, not surprisingly, the largest world exporter. The EU, despite its high average productions costs, is the second largest exporter. This is a direct consequence of the 'cross subsidisation' of 'C' sugar exports from the prices paid for 'A' and 'B' <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> and the large volume of export refunds devoted to the sugar regime.

40|$|The WTO {{ruling on}} Canada's {{domestic}} support {{measures in the}} dairy sector, seeking to restrict cross subsidisation of exports would appear to carry important implications for the Brazilian and Australian challenges to the EU sugar regime. The WTO Appellate Body said milk sales by dairy farmers to processors of 'commercial export milk' were made at a price below their cost of production and therefore financed by the higher prices dairy farmers received from their sales at the price fixed by Canada for the domestic market. The Appellate body had earlier ruled that the subsidy effect should be judged by comparison with farmers' cost of production not by comparing export and domestic milk prices. The key to the decision was the assessment that Canadian government action is instrumental in providing {{a significant percentage of}} producers with the resources that enable them to sell 'commercial export milk' at below the costs of production. Significantly the Appellate body ruled that in such cases the burden of proof rested with the country seeking to refute the claim that it was exceeding export subsidy commitments rather than the countries bringing the complaint. Comment: This WTO Appellate Body finding would appear to have a direct relevance to the relationship between the intervention price for 'A' and 'B' <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> in the EU and the sale price of 'C' sugar exported to world markets without export refunds.

40|$|The European {{agricultural}} {{market has been}} criticized for its heavy regulations and subsidization. The sugar market {{is one of the most}} regulated ones; however, this will change radically in 2017 when the current system of production quotas will end. The aim of this paper is to present the basic characteristics of the EU <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> market. The analysis identifies the main drivers of EU sugar market and their position within the EU sugar market. The paper identifies especially those drivers/companies/alliances which take control over the EU sugar production realized under the quota production system. The paper also highlights the level of EU sugar market concentration and also identifies those countries and companies which are the main leaders in the sugar production area realized under the quota system. Based on the results deriving from the paper, it is possible to characterize the EU sugar market as a heavily concentrated one – nearly 75 % (10 mil. tonnes) of the quota is controlled by five multinational companies only; these companies are operating more than 50 % of all the available sugar plants located in the EU. These multinational alliances are also in control of the production capacities of their subsidiaries. In most countries, this causes serious problems as the given quota is controlled by one or two producers only. The EU sugar market is extremely concentrated especially if we take into consideration the location of each alliance’s headquarters. The majority of production capacities are under (the) control of especially German and French companies. These two countries are also the main beneficiaries in relation to the EU sugar production quota system...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 {{reform of}} the European Union (EU) sugar regime, {{national}} quotas on the supply of sugar for domestic human consumption (for which beet producers receive a supported price) were renewed only up to 2014 / 15. It is {{the intention of the}} European Commission that they should not be renewed beyond that date, although this position is currently coming under renewed discussion. Three recent studies (LEI, 2010; European Commission, 2011 a; Nolte et al., 2012) have examined the effects of sugar quota abolition on the EU market and its trade position. These studies suggest that the net importer status of the EU would be maintained, although net imports decrease. However, there exist no studies investigating changes in bilateral trade flows between EU and third countries. This paper analyses the impacts of <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> cessation on the bilateral trade flows between the EU and third countries in 2020 against a reference scenario in which quotas remain in force. The study uses the partial equilibrium model CAPRI, which covers 77 countries grouped into 40 trade blocks. It models bilateral trade flows and bilateral trade measures between the various trade blocks. The results show that, with the expiry of EU sugar quotas, total EU sugar imports would be 43 % lower in 2020, while total EU sugar exports would decline by 16 %. Sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly. However, Brazil suffers loss of market share in third countries, notably in Africa, due to trade diversion. The net result is that, despite its strong comparative advantage in the production and marketing of sugar, Brazil suffers a welfare loss of EUR 40 million, whereas most other non-EU sugar-producing countries experience negligible welfare effects or small welfare gains. The largest welfare gain occurs in the EU (+EUR 845 million). JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E
40|$|According to the USDA FAS semi-annual {{review of}} the EU sugar regime, {{released}} on October 15 th 2003, in 2003 / 04 EU 'A' and 'B' <b>quota</b> <b>sugar</b> production was reduced by 215, 000 metric tonnes to 13. 44 million metric tonnes, {{in order to meet}} WTO export-subsidy constraints. In comparison, the quota was reduced by 862, 475 metric tonnes in 2002 / 2003. The difficulties this could otherwise have created were eased by the hot and dry summer which reduced estimated sugar production to 16. 86 million metric tonnes, an 8 % reduction from the 18. 4 million tonnes produced in 2002 / 2003, mostly {{as a result of the}} 7 % drop in area planted to sugar beet. According to the USDA in 'Spain, Italy and France output fell 22 %, 27 % and 10 % respectively, due to a combination of reduced area planted to sugar beet as well as poor yields'. EU export forecasts for 2003 / 2004 were reduced by 0. 5 million tonnes to 4. 9 million tonnes. EU export subsidies as of September 12 th 2003 were approximately € 431 /tonne for raw sugar and € 476 /tonne for white sugar. According to the USDA 'in 2001 / 2002, just under € 1. 5 billion (€ 1. 493 bn) were used to subsidise the export of 3. 488 million tonnes of sugar at an average rate of € 428 /tonne (averaged across all types of sugar export refunds). For 2002 / 2003, provisional figures show 3. 133 million tonnes of sugar exported with the benefit of export subsidies at an average subsidy of € 467 /tonne, giving a total expenditure on sugar export subsidies of € 1, 463 million. In terms of imports for 2003 / 04, the maximum supply needs of EU refineries were reduced by 2, 392 tonnes to 1, 774, 074 tonnes white sugar equivalent. Formal proposals for sugar-sector reform are expected during the first half of 2004. The USDA analysis maintains that it is unlikely that any reform package can be finalised and approved before the end of 2004. This suggests that 'the new sugar regime, should agreement be reached, is likely to enter into force in 2006 '.
