500|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{becoming}} [...] "Dr." [...] Hubbard, he wrote to Helen O'Brien—who {{had taken over the}} day-to-day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion. As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics. His letter to O'Brien discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. The idea may not have been new; Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948: [...] "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really wants to make a million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion." [...] Scholar J. Gordon Melton notes, [...] "There is no record of Hubbard having ever made this statement, though several of his science fiction colleagues have noted the broaching of the subject on one of their informal conversations." [...] The Church of Scientology has denied that Hubbard said this and insists that it is a misattributed <b>quote</b> <b>that</b> was said instead by George Orwell.

Upon arriving at his mom's house, he got an acoustic guitar and worked the song out, finishing it within 2 days.

[...] "My Life for Hire" [...] {{was one of the first}} songs written for the album, but remained unfinished until shortly before recording sessions began. The lyrics refer to the music business and how the band were told that they couldn't [...] "be the band we wanted to be", as McKinnon commented.

Russell is universally seen {{as one of the best}} NBA players ever, and was declared [...] "Greatest Player in the History of the NBA" [...] by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America in 1980. For his achievements, Russell was named [...] "Sportsman of the Year" [...] by Sports Illustrated in 1968.

He used and echoed the language about [...] "the tree of liberty" [...] being refreshed by the blood of patriots and addressed his own family in the same regard– [...] "I have nine children ... it might be their blood [...] is needed." [...] A second review of the speech said Bevin [...] "urged young Americans especially to 'be bold' and to avoid the temptation to be silent {{in the face of}} left-wing ideologues attempting to remake America." [...] This review continued through [...] "Neville Chamberlains in the world" [...] contrasting with [...] "a Winston Churchill" [...] and [...] "It's a slippery slope.... First, we're killing [...] children , then it's 'Don't ask, don't tell,' now it's this gender-bending kind of 'don't be a bigot,' 'don't be unreasonable,' 'don't be unenlightened.'"
