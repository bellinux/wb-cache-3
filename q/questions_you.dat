500|$|Planescape: Torments {{gameplay}} often {{focuses on}} the resolution of quests through dialogue rather than combat, {{and many of the}} game's combat encounters can be resolved or avoided through dialogue or stealth; a review of the game in incite PC Gaming says that [...] "The game is almost entirely story driven, and by asking the right <b>questions</b> <b>you</b> should only have to get violent a handful of times." [...] The Nameless One carries a journal, which helps the player keep track of the game's numerous quests and subplots. Death of the player character usually imposes no penalty beyond respawning in a different location.|$|E
500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, and if you ask the right <b>questions,</b> <b>you</b> get interesting answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the <b>questions</b> <b>you</b> asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story and}} {{characters}} were well received. Electronic Gaming Monthly {{said it is}} [...] "rich in story and character development." [...] Game Informer and Next Generation agreed that the plot {{was one of the}} game's highlights, the former drawing comparisons to Star Wars, Star Blazers, the Old Testament, and many other Square games, making it [...] "a game every RPG fanatic must play." [...] IGN said the storyline is intricate, engrossing, [...] "deep, complex, {{and once in a while}} even confusing, until more of the real underlying plotline is uncovered." [...] GameSpot said the story is [...] "excellent" [...] and [...] "thought-provoking" [...] but said it can be [...] "a little preachy at times", but went on to say that the religious and existential themes [...] "enhance the story and [...] understanding of the game's deep characterizations". Game Revolution described the storyline as [...] "epic" [...] and [...] "fabulous" [...] with [...] "many twists and turns" [...] and a large cast of characters. RPGFan said [...] "the story is unique and probably the most complex and interesting of any RPG", giving it a 99% rating for the story. Retrospectively, Edge praised the plot's scope and ambition and the protagonist as the [...] "most complicated Freudian hero" [...] in video games, but said it has a [...] "flawed" [...] script and [...] "muddied" [...] translation, as well as too many cut scenes, especially on the second disc, where the use of the world map is restricted for an extended period and the amount of cut scenes increases. Years after the game's release, Jeremy Parish of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game's plot [...] "one of the wackiest game plotlines ever", but said that it [...] "actually makes sense" [...] if the player ignores all of the sideplots. IGN, however, stated that despite having too many cut scenes and a sometimes confusing plot, [...] "immersion is a key factor in Xenogears and the <b>questions</b> <b>you</b> may have about the storyline are all answered at some point in the game." [...] Following the PSN release, RPGFan's James Quentin Clark said Xenogears has [...] "hands down the best single story I have seen in any video game," [...] giving it a 100% rating for the story.|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt was {{ambivalent}} about Rome, the farthest {{point of his}} journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity.

[...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite".
