40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the effect of group music therapy on brain waves, behavior, and {{cognitive}} function among patients with chronic schizophrenia. Methods: A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used with nonequivalent control group. The potential participants were recruited from inpatients in a psychiatric facility in a metropolitan city, assigned either to the experimental group (n =  28) or to the control group (n =  27) according to their wards to avoid treatment contamination. The experimental group participated in the group music therapy for <b>13</b> <b>sessions</b> over 7 weeks while continuing their standard treatment. The control group only received a standard treatment provided in the hospitals. The outcome measures include brain wave by electroencephalography, behavior by Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation, and cognitive function by Mini-Mental State Examination. Results: After participating in <b>13</b> <b>sessions</b> of the group music therapy, alpha waves measured from eight different sites were consistently present for the experimental group (p = . 006 –. 045) than the control group, revealing that the participants in the music therapy may have experienced more joyful emotions throughout the sessions. The experimental group also showed improved cognitive function (F =  13. 46, p = . 001) and positive behavior (social competence, social interest & personal neatness) while their negative behaviors was significantly less than those of the control group (F =  24. 04, p < . 001). Conclusion: The group music therapy used in this study was an effective intervention for improving emotional relaxation, cognitive processing abilities along with positive behavioral changes in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our results can be useful for establishing intervention strategies toward psychiatric rehabilitation for those who suffer from chronic mental illnesses...|$|R

50|$|Tesser & Smith (1980) {{experimented with}} this theory. Men were {{recruited}} {{and asked to}} bring a friend with them. They were then put into groups of four, Man A and Man A's friend along with Man B and Man B's friend. Half the subjects were told that this activity was measuring important verbal skills and leadership. This was the high relevance group. The other two subjects {{were told that the}} task {{had nothing to do with}} verbal skills, leadership or anything important. This was considered the low relevance group. The activity was based on the game Password, where persons have to guess a word based on clues. Each man was given an opportunity to guess the word while the other three gave clues from a list. The other three can give clues that are easy or difficult based on their own judgment and basically whether or not they would like to help the other person guess the word. The clues given to the person were necessary to guess the word. The first pair of partners performed poorly (as instructed in the experimental design). The experiment was looking at the behavior of the second group of men. The next pairing was designed to partner a stranger with a friend. Researchers were trying to see when a friend was helped more than a stranger and when a stranger was helped more than a friend. The research was supported. In 10 out of <b>13</b> <b>sessions,</b> when relevance was high (told that this activity measures important verbal and leadership skills) the stranger was helped more than a friend. Also, in 10 out of <b>13</b> <b>sessions,</b> when relevance was low (subjects were told that this activity determined nothing of importance) the friend was helped more than the stranger. The prediction of the self-evaluation maintenance theory was strongly supported.|$|R
