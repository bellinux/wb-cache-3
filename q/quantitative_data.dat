5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing <b>quantitative</b> <b>data,</b> and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2010, Banister {{was named}} the Pirates' interim bench coach after Gary Varsho was fired by the organization. At {{the end of the}} 2010 season, the Pirates fired manager John Russell. Banister and Clint Hurdle were the two finalists for the position. The Pirates named Hurdle as their manager, and Banister {{was named the}}ir {{full-time}} bench coach. As the Pirates bench coach, Banister learned about sabermetrics from a quantitative analyst who traveled with the team. Banister learned to use <b>quantitative</b> <b>data</b> to inform his decisions on when the Pirates should employ defensive shifts in the field. He was initially chosen to manage Scottsdale in the AFL after the 2014 season, but he was replaced by Pirates' special assistant Frank Kremblas due to the possibility of the Pirates reaching the MLB postseason.|$|E

30|$|Data were {{collected}} and coded into Microsoft Access, and data {{analysis was performed}} using SPSS software version 18 under windows 7. Simple descriptive analysis {{in the form of}} numbers and percentages was used for qualitative data, while arithmetic means as central tendency measurement and standard deviations were used as measures of dispersion for <b>quantitative</b> parametric <b>data.</b> For <b>quantitative</b> parametric <b>data,</b> we used the Student’s t test to compare measures of two independent groups. Also, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used in comparing more than two independent groups. For <b>quantitative</b> non-parametric <b>data,</b> Kruskal-Wallis test was used in comparing more than two independent groups and Mann-Whitney test in comparing two independent groups. Finally, for qualitative data, chi-square test was used to compare two of more than two qualitative groups and bivariate Pearson correlation test to test association between variables.

25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>data</b> can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics experiments often involve {{large numbers of}} data analysts working together to extract <b>quantitative</b> <b>data</b> from complex datasets.

To remove this bias, the experimenters devise blind analysis techniques, where the experimental result is hidden from the analysts until they've agreed—based on properties of the data set other than the final value—that the analysis techniques are fixed.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature road safety campaign, Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>data</b> from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the most}} recent members of the omics family, {{large-scale}} <b>quantitative</b> metabolomics <b>data</b> are currently complementing our systems biology data pool and offer the chance to integrate the metabolite level into the functional analysis of cellular networks. Network-embedded thermodynamic analysis (NET analysis) is presented as a framework for mechanistic and model-based analysis of these data. By coupling the data to an operating metabolic network via the second law of thermodynamics and the metabolites' Gibbs energies of formation, NET analysis allows inferring functional principles from quantitative metabolite data; for example it identifies reactions that are subject to active allosteric or genetic regulation as exemplified with <b>quantitative</b> metabolite <b>data</b> from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the optimization framework of NET analysis was demonstrated to be a valuable tool to systematically investigate data sets for consistency, for the extension of sub-omic metabolome data sets and for resolving intracompartmental concentrations from cell-averaged metabolome data. Without requiring any kind of kinetic modeling, NET analysis represents a perfectly scalable and unbiased approach to uncover insights from <b>quantitative</b> metabolome <b>data...</b>|$|R
