40|$|Though {{there have}} been several works on the {{analysis}} of the association between genotype and phenotype, little can be found for the association analysis between a haplotype or haplotype sets and multivariate <b>quantitative</b> <b>responses.</b> For example, QTLmarc is available for the analysis of multivariate responses, but it cannot be applied to the case of stochastic diplotype configurations and complex genetic models. The present paper proposes a method of association analysis between diplotype configuration and multivariate <b>quantitative</b> <b>responses</b> assuming the dominant, recessive and additive models. A comparative study is performed between the proposed method and QTLmarc by applying the two methods to numerical examples and small size simulated data sets with actual genotype information taken from the data set of the Hapmap project and artificial quantitative phenotype data which follow multivariate normal distributions. The results show that the proposed method is superior to QTLmarc in finding the assumed association. Multivariate analysis <b>Quantitative</b> <b>responses</b> Haplotype Likelihood ratio test...|$|R

50|$|Now {{with one}} single local {{application}} using hydrogel scaffolds embedded with a 2-pair FRET/NSET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer/NanoSurface Energy Transfer) gold nanobeacons (also known as dark-gold nanobeacons) {{we are able}} to overcome drug resistance by detecting and silencing a multidrug resistance protein (MRP1), before chemotherapeutic drug delivery in vivo. Our platform contains hydrogel embedded with dark-gold nanoparticles modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-intercalated nanobeacons that serve as an ON/OFF molecular nanoswitch triggered by the increased MRP1 expression within the tumour tissue microenvironment. This nanoswitch can sense and overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) prior to local drug release. These nanoprobes comprise a thiol-DNA-hairpin labelled with a NIR dye and a thiol-DNA oligo labelled with a dark quencher (BHQ2), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and intercalated drug- all of which are conjugated to a gold nanoparticle core. These dark-gold nanobeacons are then loaded with 5-FU that intercalates in the beacon stem (dsDNA part) of the DNA-hairpin oligo. Under hairpin configuration, the proximity of the NIR dye to the dark quencher leads to fluorescence quenching. Hybridization of the DNA hairpin to a complementary mRNA target restores fluorescence emission due to the gold nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the quencher to part from each other, yielding a <b>quantitative</b> <b>response.</b> On the other hand, the release of the 5-FU drug can only occur when DNA hairpin hybridizes with the complementary target and can be measured once the distance from the 5-FU and the gold core increases, escalating the drug emission.To evaluate the efficiency of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes in sensing and in overcoming MDR in vivo, an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model was developed by injecting 5-FU resistant MDAMB-231 cells to the mammary fat pad of female SCID hairless congenic mice. Efficacious and local delivery of the dark-gold nanobeacon probes is achieved by the implantation of a hydrogel disk on top of the triple-negative breast tumours using a polyamidoamine (PAMAM G5) dendrimer cross-linked with dextran aldehyde, which provides enhanced stability of the embedded nanoparticles. Despite the cross-resistance to 5-FU, more than 90% tumour reduction is achieved in vivo, following 80% MRP1 silencing compared with the continuous tumour growth following only drug or nonsense nanobeacon administration.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{randomized}} response (RR) models deal primarily with surveys which usually require a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ {{response to a}} sensitive question, or a choice for responses from a set of nominal categories. As opposed to that, Eichhorn and Hayre (1983) have considered survey models involving a <b>quantitative</b> <b>response</b> variable and proposed an RR technique for it. Such models are very useful in studies involving a measured response variable which is highly ‘sensitive’ in its nature. Eichhorn and Hayre obtained an unbiased estimate for the expectation of the <b>quantitative</b> <b>response</b> variable of interest. In this note we propose a procedure which uses a design parameter (controlled by the experimenter) that generalizes Eichhorn and Hayre’s results.

Chapter 8 presented methods for analyzing association between two categorical variables. Chapters 9 and 11 presented regression methods for analyzing association between quantitative variables. Methods for comparing means for several groups relate to the association between a <b>quantitative</b> <b>response</b> variable and categorical explanatory variable. The mean of the <b>quantitative</b> <b>response</b> variable is compared among groups that are categories of the explanatory variable. For example, for a comparison of mean annual income among blacks, whites, and Hispanics, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>response</b> variable is annual income and the categorical explanatory variable is racial-ethnic status. The inferential method for comparing several means is called the analysis of variance, abbreviated by ANOVA.

Sections 12. 1 – 12. 5 present analyses for independent samples.

A two-level Plackett-Burman design was applied in which one qualitative and six quantitative factors were examined. Resolution, migration times and relative migration times to pyridoxine (selected as internal standard) were examined as qualitative responses to evaluate electrophoretic performance. A <b>quantitative</b> <b>response,</b> the content of R-timolol in S-timolol maleate sample, was also considered. Even though some significant factor effects were observed on the qualitative responses, it was still possible to quantify the R-timolol in the S-timolol maleate samples properly.
