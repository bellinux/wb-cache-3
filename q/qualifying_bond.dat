5000|$|Years {{after the}} Civil War, {{significant}} local debt was issued to build railroads. Railroads were private corporations and these bonds {{were very similar}} to today's industrial revenue bonds. Construction costs in 1873 {{for one of the}} largest transcontinental railroads, the Northern Pacific, closed down access to new capital. [...] Around the same time, the largest bank of the country of the time, which was owned by the same investor as that of Northern Pacific, collapsed. Smaller firms followed suit as well as the stock market. The 1873 panic and years of depression that followed put an abrupt but temporary halt to the rapid growth of municipal debt. Responding to widespread defaults that jolted the municipal bond market of the day, new state statutes were passed that restricted the issuance of local debt. Several states wrote these restrictions into their constitutions. Railroad bonds and their legality were widely challenged, and this gave rise to the market-wide demand that an opinion of <b>qualified</b> <b>bond</b> counsel accompany each new issue.|$|R

40|$|Composites are in high demand; however, {{fasteners}} {{are often}} required for joining process and can reduce their advantages. One solution is adhesive bonding, but uncertainty exists regarding long term durability {{and the ability}} to interrogate bonds noninvasively. One potential solution to <b>qualify</b> <b>bond</b> integrity over its service life is to dope an adhesive with magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs). MENs can yield output magnetic signatures that are influenced by bond quality and damage state. In this study, adhesives have been doped with MENs prior to bonding at 1 % volume concentration. For optimum implementation, this health monitoring system should be evaluated for effects of the MENs on the mechanical properties. Lap-shear testing was conducted to assess changes in the bond strength from addition of the nanoparticles. End-notched flexure (ENF) tests were also conducted for fracture mechanism evaluation. Results showed an increase of 12 % in shear strength as a function of MENs loading concentration.
