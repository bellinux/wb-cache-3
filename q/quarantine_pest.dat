50|$|The {{purpose of}} pest {{categorization}} {{is to determine}} whether a pest identified during the initiation stage satisfies the criteria of being a <b>quarantine</b> <b>pest.</b> A <b>quarantine</b> <b>pest</b> is a pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled. Pest categorization includes all the main elements considered in Step 2 of a pest risk assessment but the elements are considered in less detail and pest categorization is essentially a quick assessment of whether the analysis should continue. The categorization step provides an opportunity to eliminate a pest from analysis at an early stage in the pest risk analysis process thus avoiding unnecessary in-depth examination. Pest categorization can be done with relatively little information, provided that the information available is sufficient to carry out the categorization.|$|E

Bacterial Wilt of Carnation is also defined as an A2 <b>quarantine</b> <b>pest</b> by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO).

40|$|A Pest Risk Analysis was {{conducted}} on commodities imported as hand luggage from Cameroon, India and Kenya at O. R. Tambo International Airport. The initiation phase indicated that fruit, {{and to a lesser}} extent vegetables, are often imported concealed in hand luggage and not declared for inspection. Such undeclared commodities pose a risk to the South African agricultural industry and environment as it may serve as a pathway for <b>quarantine</b> <b>pests.</b> The qualitative pest risk assessment conducted on the commodities intercepted indicated that the risk is high, with the commodities serving as pathways for <b>quarantine</b> <b>pests</b> including insects, bacteria, mites, fungi, viruses and weeds. Bactrocera fruit flies were identified as a specific high risk and were further subjected to a quantitative pest risk assessment. Mitigation treatments for fruit flies were evaluated for efficacy and effect on the quality of the fruit.

40|$|In a pest risk {{assessment}} study (Anonymous 1992), the Now Zealand native huhu beetle {{was identified as}} one of seven major <b>quarantine</b> <b>pests</b> which would pose a risk if imported into the USA on New Zealand Pinus radiata. Huhu. infests dead parts of living trees, stumps, logs and untreated sawn timber. The larvae feed in sapwood and heart wood and may ultimately completely destroy the host wood leaving only a thin outer shell (Hosking 1978). Fumigation with methyl bromide (MeBr) is currently the only accepted quarantine treatment against huhu prior to export to markets uch as the USA. While North Asian markets do not require mandatory fumigation, substantial volumes of logs are fumigated with MeBr {{at the port of}} arrival. An estimated 4. 8 million m 3 of logs were with MeBr in 1996 against forestry <b>quarantine</b> <b>pests</b> (J. Maud, New Zealand Ministry of Forestry, pers. comm. 1997). MeBr has been identified as an environmentally hazardous toxic gas and as a major contributor to ozone depletion (WMO 1994). Due to world-wide concerns about its impact on human health and the environment, there is an urgent need to develop alternative disinfestation methods in order not to jeopardise New Zealand's wood exports. Our programme aims to develop alternative postharvest disinfestation methods to MeBr to control insects in forestry products, taking a broad approach by testing a range of promising technologies. Previous research has already identified gamma irradiation as a potential disinfestation method for huhu (Lester et al. 1997).

A total of 400 samples of potato plants showing symptoms of soft rot were obtained from several potato areas in Pangalengan and Garut (West Java), Dieng (Central Java), and Batu-Malang (East Java). Disease incidence was determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) using polyclonal antiserum. E. chrysanthemi was isolated from plant samples with positive ELISA results. Furthermore, bacterial isolates were characterized by GEN III OmniLog ID System and PCR using specific primers Ec 3 F/Ec 4 R, as well as the universal 16 S rRNA primer pair of 27 F/ 1429 R. The incidence of E. chrysanthemi based on ELISA was obtained. Based on physiological characters; Gram, catalase, oxidase, and oxidation-fermentation, there were 4 isolates similar to the genus of Erwinia. However, the results of Gen III OmniLog System, PCR, and nucleotide sequences analysis of 16 S rRNA confirmed that none of the isolates were identified as E. chrysanthemi. Otherwise, those 4 isolates were identified as Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas viridiflava.
