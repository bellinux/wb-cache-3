5|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), after the repeal of those amendments, the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Church of the SubGenius' {{ostensible}} beliefs defy categorization or {{a simple}} narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted. The group {{has developed an}} intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which is usually considered by observers to satirize other religions. Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah1, is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television. Jehovah1 gave him supernatural knowledge {{of the past and}} future, in addition to incredible power. Dobbs then posed deep <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> alien, receiving mysterious answers. Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as it usually is. The journalists also got to ask <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E

25|$|Hasdai ibn Shaprut, however, {{recalled}} Menahem to Cordoba {{and encouraged}} him to complete his life-work, a dictionary of the Hebrew language.

Menahem even included both his patron's and his names in an acrostic including the first letter of each line.

Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a deva living close to his former offices, {{as a result of the}} karma of having given knowledge to people. The talk was much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple stated that the talk was meant to illustrate the law of karma, not to defame Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state.|$|E
