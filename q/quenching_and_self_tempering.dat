40|$|A {{portion of}} the {{fluorescence}} spectrum of SO 2 has been studied using a narrow wavelength doubled dye laser as the exciting source. One {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the use of SO 2 resonance re-emission as a probe of SO 2 in the atmosphere. When the SO 2 is excited by light at 300. 2 nm, for example, a strong reemission peak is observed which is Stokes-shifted from the incident light wavelength by the usual Raman shift (the VI symmetric vibration frequency 1150. 5 /cm). The intensity of this peak is sensitive to small changes (. 01 nm) in the incident wavelength. Measurements of the N 2 <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>self</b> <b>quenching</b> of this re-emission have been obtained. Preliminary analysis of this data indicates that the quenching is weak but not negligible. The dye laser in our system is pumped by a pulsed N 2 laser. Tuning 'and spectral narrowing are accomplished using a telescope-echelle grating combination. In a high power configuration the resulting pulses have a spectral width of about 5 x 10 (exp - 3) nm and a time duration of about 6 nsec. The echelle grating is rotated by a digital stepping motor, such that each step shifts the wavelength by 6 x 10 (exp - 4) nm. In addition to the tunable, narrow wavelength uv source and spectral analysis of the consequent re-emission, the system also provides time resolution of the re-emitted light to 6 nsec resolution. This capability is being used to study the lifetime of low pressure S 02 fluorescence at different wavelengths and pressures...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} new {{materials}} for organic {{light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) synthesised in the Department of Chemistry at Durham University have been characterised and electroluminescent devices containing these materials have been optimised. High triplet oxadiazole based electron transport materials were tested in devices blended with the host material poly(9 -vinylcarbazole) (PVK). The materials exhibit comparable performance to standard OXD- 7 in electrophosphorescent devices, while emission from exciplex devices indicate the new materials have higher LUMO energies than OXD- 7. Single layer devices containing new sky-blue iridium(III) emitters were optimised. The improved solubility of these emitters over FIrpic, the standard sky-blue emitter, resulted in improved device efficiency and brightness due to reduced aggregation, concentration <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>self</b> absorption in film, and higher radiative yield. Derivatives of these new emitters, with emission shifted towards a deeper blue, were characterised. Increased trapping by the PVK host led to a reduction in the device efficiency for these materials. Two series of iridium(III) emitters with emission tuned from green to red by systematically substituted electron withdrawing or donating groups were characterised. Photophysical properties of these emitters, including the solvatochromic shift of photoluminescence spectra, correlate with theoretical values of the molecular dipole moment, thus linking changes in chemical structure with device performance. Finally, white electroluminescence was demonstrated from single copolymers exhibiting broadened blue-green intramolecular charge transfer emission due to the interaction of fluorene (F) and dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (S) units. Single layer and multilayer devices were optimised, and white emission with good spectral coverage and CIE coordinates of (0. 35, 0. 39) was achieved with the F/S copolymer. The emission colour varies significantly with emissive layer thickness and applied voltage. Addition of a thermally evaporated electron transport layer resulted in improvement in both device efficiency and colour stability...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> tempered shaft has been done. Prediction was done for two different manufacture processes. In the first manufacture process the shaft was made of steel and in second one the shaft was made of cast steel. The working stress was characterized by yield strength and impact toughness. The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of quenching using a finite volume method. Hardness of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> tempered steel can be expressed as function of maximal hardness of actual steel, hardness of steel with 50 % of martensite in microstructure, according to the time and temperature of tempering. The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and impact energy was based on hardness, HV. Starting point in studying of the mechanical properties of steel castings can be {{the fact that the}} mechanical properties of steel castings are derived from the mechanical properties of ordinary steel metal matrix reduced by the influence of the typical as-cast structure, i. e. casting defects on those properties. Hardness and yield strength will be unaffected by most defects. The only effect will be that due to the reduction in area. Coarse as-cast microstructure of cast steel lowers ductility and toughness. Impact energy of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> tempered cast steel was predicted based on pouring temperature, temperature of mould during the pouring and fact that steel castings are not subjected to different metallurgical and mechanical processes of microstructure improvement in so far as wrought steels. Findings: It can be concluded that working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> tempered shaft can be successfully predicted by proposed method. Practical implications: Estimation of hardness distribution can be based on time, relevant for structure transformation, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 °C (t 8 / 5).

40|$|AbstractThe controlled-forging and controlled-cooling {{has become}} the main process of the non-quenched and {{tempered}} steels now.

The simulated rapid cooling followed by <b>self</b> <b>tempering</b> after forging was tried to control the microstructure and mechanical properties of the steels. A new process of the non-quenched and tempered steels was proposed to ensure high strength and high toughness for the studied steels.
