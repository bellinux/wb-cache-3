25|$|The Institute for Behavioral Genetics (IBG) is a {{research}} institute within the Graduate School dedicated to conducting and facilitating research on the genetic and environmental bases of individual differences in behavior.

25|$|Most of the {{economic}} traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in <b>quantitative</b> <b>genetics</b> has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the quantitative trait loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species. In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.|$|E
25|$|Six {{criteria}} {{have been}} developed to establish character displacement as the mechanism for differences between sympatric species. These include: (1) differences between sympatric taxa are greater than expected by chance; (2) differences in character states are related to differences in resource use; (3) resources are limiting, and interspecific competition for these resources is a function of character similarity; (4) resource distribution are the same in sympatry and allopatry such that differences in character states are not due to differences in resource availability; (5) differences must have evolved in situ; (6) differences must be genetically based. Rigorously testing these criteria necessitates a synthetic approach, combining areas of research like community ecology, functional morphology, adaptation, <b>quantitative</b> <b>genetics</b> and phylogenetic systematics, While satisfying all six criteria in a single study of character displacement is not often feasible, they provide the necessary context for researching character displacement.|$|E

This model shows that "selfish" DNA sequences {{do not have to be}} selectively neutral at the organismic level; indeed, such DNA can produce major deleterious effects in the host organism and still spread through the population. The model can be used to explain the evolution of introns within eukaryotic genes; this explanation does not invoke a long-term evolutionary advantage for introns, nor does it depend on the hypothesis that eukaryotic gene structure may be an evolutionary relic. Transposable genes that carried information specifying sexual reproduction in the host organism would favor their own spread. Consequently, it is tempting to speculate that some of the genes controlling sex were originally selected as transposable elements...|$|R

5000|$|Castle's {{work was}} among the first to attempt to unify the {{recently}} rediscovered laws of Mendelian inheritance with Darwin's theory of evolution. Still, it would be almost thirty years until the theoretical framework for evolution of complex traits would be widely formalized. In an early summary of the theory of evolution of continuous variation, Sewall Wright, a graduate student who trained under Castle, summarized contemporary thinking about the genetic basis of quantitative natural variation: [...] "As genetic studies continued, ever smaller differences were found to mendelize, and any character, sufficiently investigated, turned out to be affected by many factors." [...] Wright and others formalized population genetics theory that had been worked out over the preceding 30 years explaining how such traits can be inherited and create stably breeding populations with unique characteristics. <b>Quantitative</b> trait <b>genetics</b> today leverages Wright's observations about the statistical relationship between genotype and phenotype in families and populations to understand how certain genetic features can affect variation in natural and derived populations.|$|R
