40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution is}} {{presented in this paper}} for the vibration response of a ribbed plate clamped on all its boundary edges by employing a travelling wave solution. A clamped ribbed plate test rig is also assembled in this study for the experimental investigation of the ribbed plate response and to provide verification results to the analytical solution. The dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of the ribbed plate are measured and compared to those obtained from the analytical solution and from finite element analysis (FEA). General good agreements are found between the results. Discrepancies between the computational and experimental results at low and high frequencies are also discussed. Explanations are offered in the study to disclose the mechanism causing the discrepancies. The dependency of the dynamic response of the ribbed plate on the distance between the excitation force and the rib is also investigated experimentally. It confirms the findings disclosed in a previous analytical study [T. R. Lin and J. Pan, A closed form solution for the dynamic response of finite ribbed plates. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 119 (2006) 917 - 925] that the vibration response of a clamped ribbed plate due to a point force excitation is controlled by the plate stiffness when the source is more than a <b>quarter</b> plate <b>bending</b> wavelength away from the rib and from the plate boundary. The response is largely affected by the rib stiffness when the source location is less than a <b>quarter</b> <b>bending</b> wavelength away from the rib...|$|R

40|$|Analytical {{and closed}} form {{solutions}} {{are presented in}} this paper for the vibration response of an L-shaped plate under a point force or a moment excitation. Inter-relationships between wave components of the source and the receiving plates are clearly defined. Explicit expressions are given for the quadratic quantities such as input power, energy flow and kinetic energy distributions of the L-shaped plate. Applications of statistical energy analysis (SEA) formulation in the prediction of the vibration response of finite coupled plate structures under a single deterministic forcing are examined and quantified. It is found that the SEA method can be employed to predict the frequency averaged vibration response and energy flow of coupled plate structures under a deterministic force or moment excitation when the structural system satisfies the following conditions: (1) the coupling loss factors of the coupled subsystems are known; (2) the source location is {{more than a quarter of}} the plate bending wavelength away from the source plate edges in the point force excitation case, or is more than a quarter wavelength away from the pair of source plate edges perpendicular to the moment axis in the moment excitation case due to the directional characteristic of moment excitations. SEA overestimates the response of the L-shaped plate when the source location is less than a <b>quarter</b> <b>bending</b> wavelength away from the respective plate edges owing to wave coherence effect at the plate boundar...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [48]- 49) Interlaminar shear failure, or delamination, is {{a prominent}} failure mode for brittle, polymer-matrix composite materials. Interlaminar shear stresses are routinely generated in composite structures {{as a result}} of free edges, ply drop-offs, three-dimensional stress fields, etc. The accurate characterization of a composite material?s resistance to interlaminar shear is therefore prerequisite to maximum utilization of the benefits of these important engineering materials. The four-point (<b>quarters)</b> <b>bending</b> of a SCS (steel/composite/steel) test sample, a sandwich beam obtained by adhesively bonding unidirectional HERCULES ? AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite/epoxy material to steel strips, was a test proposed for characterizing the interlaminar shear strength of the said composite in a previous research. It was known that the only potential failure inducing stresses are the interlaminar shear stress, t xz, and the through-thickness normal stress, ctz. However, due to stress analysis complications the role of the through-thickness normal stress, a z, was addressed in the previous research in a qualitative manner only. A new finite element model, the lumped parameter model is generated for the purpose of verifying the effect of the through-thickness normal stress, ctz. The shear stress/deformation characteristics of the interfacial layers between the plies of graphite/epoxy material are included by means of lumped epoxy (resin-rich regions existing between the plies of the composite). The effects of varying the distribution of the lumped epoxy is studied. The lumped parameter model is incorporated into a nonlinear analysis involving contact elements to study the state of stress in the failure zone of the specimen at the time of failure. Results show that the failures are initiated due to a predominant interlaminar shear stress with negligible through-thickness normal stress. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
