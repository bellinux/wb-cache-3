40|$|International audienceIn {{his various}} works Jérôme makes a large use of secular poetic quotations. Many {{scholars}} have already searched new ones or observed {{those who are}} recurring. Lots of studies concerning classical <b>quotations</b> <b>by</b> Jérôme are connected too to the vow of the famous dream of the Letter 22, 30. The present paper aims at showing how Jérôme makes use of such quotations in his Letters and what a rhetorical or dialectical place these take in his writing. The Letter 60, to Heliodore with his eight secular poetic quotations gives a good example on the subject. This {{is the reason why}} it allows suggesting a classification of various uses of these <b>quotations</b> <b>by</b> Jérôme in his Letters. This classification may be used, we hope so, for all kind of secular <b>quotations</b> <b>by</b> Fathers of the Church...|$|R
