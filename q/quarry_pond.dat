50|$|Six {{historic}} public nature {{areas are}} {{administered by the}} Athol Conservation Commission. The largest of these is Bearsden Forest in the northeastern part of Athol. It contains hiking trails, camping areas, bridges, paths, old <b>quarries,</b> <b>ponds</b> and brooks.|$|R
50|$|Wernau {{is located}} on the {{southeast}} bank of the Neckar river. The Bodenbach river flows through the city. In 1981 the Wernau Baggerseen (<b>quarry</b> <b>ponds)</b> were declared a wildlife preserve. Today it spans across 45 hectares. Another 5.5 hectares of wildlife preserve are located in an area of the city called the Wernau Lehmgrube (clay pits).|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} way to collect glassworms is by a plankton net. They {{can be found}} in almost all water, but most abound in fish-free <b>quarry</b> <b>ponds</b> during winter. Glassworms are very easy to store if the water is kept cold and aerated. They are very tolerant to bad water conditions, including chlorine. They are sometimes collected and sold as fish food.|$|R

40|$|Small water {{bodies of}} villages (SWBOV) are {{available}} aplenty {{in the state}} of Karnataka and have great potential for aquaculture, but absence of data on their magnitude could be a reason for their under-utilisation. An assessment of SWBOV in Karnataka was done during 2003 - 2005 by coining and defining a collective term for them, compiling documented information from government organisations and surveying in logically selected agro-climatic zones. SWBOV per se and water resources forming SWBOV include: open wells, rain water harvesting structures (RWHS), irrigation bore wells, gokatte, kunte, <b>quarry</b> <b>ponds</b> and irrigation canal-fed ponds. As documented information could be obtained only on the numbers of the first three, survey was conducted to derive their water spread area (WSA) and to estimate the numbers and WSA of the latter four. As the total potential and effective WSA of SWBOV are estimated to be 0. 063 million ha (mha) and 0. 048 mha respectively compared to 0. 008 mha of brackishwater area, SWBOV could be classified as a category of inland water resource for aquaculture...|$|R
5000|$|The park Seepark, {{which is}} located {{in the western part of}} Freiburg, was built in 1986 in context of the Landesgartenschau (federal state {{gardening}} exhibition). Its construction was based on the extension of an already existing <b>quarry</b> <b>pond.</b> Offering several recreational facilities as well as a community center with restaurant and an observation tower, it is Freiburg’s most visited park.|$|E
50|$|To attract {{passengers}} to the countryside, the Rhodes residence was {{converted into a}} trolley terminus, complete with wrap-around porch and belfry, and an elaborate turn-of-the-20th-century amusement park {{was built on the}} grounds, complete with carousel, roller coaster, fun house, dance hall, penny arcade, and golf course, as well as bath house, swimming area, and boat lake in the former <b>quarry</b> <b>pond.</b> The park remained a popular Richmond attraction until it closed in 1932, due to the economic constraints of the Great Depression.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, The University of Iowa {{constructed}} {{a new home}} for the School of Art and Art History.

Several new buildings were added to the arts campus in 1968 including a new printmaking wing, ceramics studios, sculpture foundry, and jewelry/metalsmithing studios. In 2006 Steven Holl designed a new building for the School adjacent to <b>quarry</b> <b>pond.</b> Art Building West received the RIBA International Award and the American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Abandoned <b>quarries,</b> {{and deep}} <b>ponds</b> will often have platforms, whether by design, or by {{improvisation}} {{of the people}} in the community. For example, platforms will often be affixed to towers in abandoned rail yards, overlooking a deep pond.|$|R
50|$|Nordhausen is {{situated}} at {{the border between the}} flat and fertile area of Goldene Aue in the south and the foothills of the Harz mountains in the north on a level of approx. 180 m of elevation. The Zorge river crosses the city from northwest to southeast and the bigger Helme river runs in west-eastern direction at the southern border of the municipality. Between them are some <b>quarry</b> <b>ponds</b> of former gravel mining near the Sundhausen and Bielen districts. To the north, the terrain is getting more hilly and part of a karst area south to the Harz mountains. The north-west of the territory is marked by the Kohnstein hill (335 m) and the north-east is the Rüdigsdorf Switzerland, a small area with a beautiful landscape up to 350 m of elevation around Rüdigsdorf district. South of Helme river, the terrain gets also hilly around the Windleite mountains between Nordhausen and Sondershausen. Most of the municipal territory is in agricultural use. The forests are located first between the city centre in the south and Rüdigsdorf in the north (with interruptions), second at Kohnstein hill and third in the east around Rodishain and Stempeda.|$|R
2500|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Interstate Commerce Commission, Franklin firebox doors were installed on the locomotives, and an automobile headlight was connected to a six volt storage battery {{to serve as a}} headlight.

50|$|The eleven meter deep pond Moosweiher {{emerged from}} the removal of gravel that was {{necessary}} to build the A5 between 1960 and 1962. At the time, the district Landwasser, in which the Moosweiher is located today, had not arisen yet. In 1966, the local county named the <b>quarry</b> <b>pond</b> Moosweiher, and in 1968, it was recultivated by the municipal parks department, by applying paths with benches, sunbathing lawns and a playground. A restaurant, a minigolf facility, public toilets and sports facilities with a club house were added later.|$|E
50|$|Berea {{sandstone}} {{is found}} from around 950 ft msl to roughly 1070 ft msl. However, {{at this point}} it should be mentioned that the rock structure around Gildersleeve Mountain is by no means uniform. Millions of years of glaciation and resulting erosion and fill have resulted in many ravines that have been subsequently filled with glacial till and alluvial clays. Still, Berea sandstone is found in outcroppings and in other areas on Gildersleeve Mountain. In the nineteenth century it was quarried from the Stannard Quarry, what is now <b>Quarry</b> <b>Pond,</b> near Chillicothe Road. This material was used to build Kirtland Temple and other local structures. Berea sandstone is still used as a local building material.|$|E

Zhao Di, the fourth daughter {{in the family and}} whose name means [...] "brings a younger brother", is given away to an uncle after her mother finally gives birth to a boy. He mistreats Ah Di like a maid. When she was little, Ah Di falls into a <b>quarry</b> <b>pond</b> and was saved by Huang Dake (Chen Hanwei). Love blossoms between them after they are reunited in adulthood but Ah Di is forced by her foster father, Liu Huoyan (Ye Shipin) to marry Xu Zhongzheng (Huang Wenyong), the boss of a garment factory.|$|E

40|$|Sloan’s Crossing Pond (SCP) is {{a popular}} visitor {{attraction}} in Mammoth Cave National Park (MCNP) that was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1939. In recent years, the pond has begun to shallow and fill with sediment. The National Park Service (NPS) is tasked with preserving landscapes in their pre-Colombian state. However, NPS is obligated to preserve all natural artifacts that are greater than 50 years old, such as Sloan’s Pond that was constructed by the CCC. Furthermore, the park service is required to provide recreation and entertainment to visitors. These conflicting management goals {{make it difficult for}} park officials to decide what action to take in regards to the pond. In order to help park managers with their decision, we began a biological survey of SCP and two nearby ponds. Our goal was to determine whether SCP provided a unique habitat not seen anywhere else in MCNP, or if there was a high level of functional redundancy between SCP and other ponds found within the park. We surveyed Sloan’s Crossing <b>Pond,</b> Joppa and <b>Quarry</b> <b>ponds.</b> We were limited by permit requirements and had to rely on observational sampling techniques, such as camera trapping and audio recording. We did not find any indication that Sloan’s Crossing Pond provided a unique habitat in the park. We will continue our survey throughout the spring and summer and extend it to more ponds throughout MCNP. We hope to use this preliminary data to guide our future research methods.

40|$|In 1909, {{the species}} Oophila amblystomatis Lambert ex Wille was {{described}} for green algae that symbiose with salamanders {{in the egg}} stage (Wille). There are two hypotheses about the source of algae: 1) that algae enter from the surrounding water once the egg clutch is laid in a pond, and 2) that they are acquired from the maternal reproductive tract. We developed a third hypothesis developed {{to account for the}} salamander reproductive cycle. Male salamanders lay spermatophores, which are protein-filled capsules, on plant matter in and around ponds. Spermatophores are exposed to the environment before use by females in internal fertilization. Thus, we investigated possible sources of the algae in <b>Quarry</b> <b>pond</b> in Connecticut, U. S. A., by comparing rbcL chloroplast sequences of algae cultured from spermatophores, cloacal swabs of male and female salamanders, egg jelly samples, and multiple eggs across clutches. Sequences of algae from eggs were distributed into five phylogenetic lineages; those from jelly, cloacal swabs, and spermatophores were found in three lineages, two of which were shared with those from eggs. In addition, all sequences from cloacal swabs aligned with sequences of free-living algae from the class Trebouxiophyceae. Most sequences from eggs aligned with free-living algae from class Chlorophyceae, order Volvocales, which was previously shown to symbiose with eggs of the Northwestern salamander Ambystoma gracile (Goff 2 ̆ 6 Stein 1978). We cannot exclude either the environmental acquisition or the maternal transmission hypothesis, suggesting that both sources may contribute to the presence of algae in salamander eggs...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer. The published article can be found at: [URL] Oregon’s Willamette Valley, remaining wetlands are at high risk to loss and degradation from agricultural activity and urbanization. With an increased need for fine temporal-scale monitoring of sensitive wetlands, we used annual Landsat MSS and TM/ETM+ images from 1972 to 2012 to manually interpret loss, gain, and type conversion of wetland area in the floodplain of the Willamette River. By creating Tasseled Cap Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness indices for MSS data that visually match TM/ETM+ Tasseled Cap images, we were able to construct a complete and consistent, annual time series and utilize the entire Landsat archive. With an extended time series we were also able to compare annual trends of net change in wetland area before and after the no-net-loss policy established under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act in 1990 using a Theil-Sen Slope estimate analysis. Vegetated wetlands experienced a 314 ha net loss of wetland area and non-vegetated wetlands experienced a 393 ha net gain, indicating higher functioning wetlands were replaced in area by non-vegetated wetland habitats such as agricultural and <b>quarry</b> <b>ponds.</b> The majority of both gain and loss in the study area was attributed to gains and losses of agricultural land. After 1990 policy implementations, the rate of wetland area lost slowed for some wetland categories and reversed into trends of gain in wetland area for others, perhaps representative of the success of increased regulations. Overall accuracy of land use classification through manual interpretation was at 80 %. This accuracy increased to 91. 1 % when land use classes were aggregated to either wetland or upland categories, indicating that our methodology was more accurate at distinguishing between general upland and wetland than finer categorical classes...|$|R
