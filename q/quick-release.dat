5|$|To {{remedy the}} causes of the fire, changes were made in the Block II {{spacecraft}} and operational procedures, the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch, and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials. The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plug-type hatch cover with a <b>quick-release,</b> outward opening door. NASA discontinued the manned Block I program, using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights. Crew members would also exclusively wear modified, fire-resistant A7L Block II space suits, and would be designated by the Block II titles, regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Chief Vintage {{shares the}} chassis, drivetrain, and styling of the Chief Classic, and adds tan leather <b>quick-release</b> saddlebags, {{matching}} tan leather two-up seat, additional chrome trim, <b>quick-release</b> windshield, and a six-speed transmission.|$|E
25|$|A sister ship, SS Sylvia L. Ossa, {{went down}} in heavy seas east of Bermuda on 15 October 1976; all that was {{recovered}} was debris and a lifeboat in which the <b>quick-release</b> mechanism was still intact.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} several <b>quick-releases</b> during one contraction of a pig urinary bladder smooth muscle preparation was developed. The force recovery following quick release in this muscle type was studied by fitting a multiexponential model to 926 responses measured {{during the first}} 700 ms after release, both in the stimulated and in the unstimulated muscle. It was concluded that the force recovery in this observation window was biexponential and that the two time constants result from two fundamentally different processes. The slower time constant {{in the order of}} 0. 45 s was ascribed to crossbridge cycling, and this hypothesis was supported by the considerable dependence of the amplitude associated with this time constant on the stimulus condition of the muscle. The faster time constant in the order of 0. 032 s was found to be largely independent of the degree of stimulation of the muscle and was ascribed to a passive, viscoelastic process...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{parachutist}} Marines {{were killed}} during SKI JUMP on January 17 at Case Springs, a high plateau and wooded area on Camp Pendleton. Severe winds suddenly appeared while the parachutists {{were in their}} descent. Corporal Ben Simpson and PFC Matthew J. O'Neill Jr., were dragged over 1000 ft. They were found dead by Major Bruce Meyers, their skulls were crushed and helmets gone due to the drag. Lieutenant Kenneth Ball, the jumpmaster in the stick, was knocked unconscious and wasn't able to attempt the quick-release; he later died at the Camp Pendleton hospital from multiple intrusions. The marines in the reconnaissance platoon were using the standard military-issued T-10 parachutes. One of the findings were that the T-10 safety [...] "quick-release" [...] {{on the front of}} the harness made it quite impossible to detach in case of emergencies, even after frequent practice by the parachutists. Dirt and small rocks fouled the <b>quick-releases</b> while the harnesses were dragged at 15 mph over the ground, making them ineffective.|$|R
25|$|A <b>quick-release</b> hook (controlled by the pilots) was provided, {{which enabled}} the captain to start, warm up and (when required) run all four engines up to full power for takeoff while the {{aircraft}} was {{still attached to}} the mooring buoy.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually <b>quick-release,</b> and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.|$|E
25|$|In surface-supplied diving, and {{particularly}} in saturation diving, the loss of weights followed by positive buoyancy can expose the diver to potentially fatal decompression injury. Consequently, weight systems for surface-supplied diving where the diver is transported to the worksite by a diving bell or stage, are usually not provided with a <b>quick-release</b> system.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Valentine Baker in an {{aircraft}} accident in 1942 prompted James Martin to investigate new methods for aircrew escape and survival. Martin had previous experience of aircraft survival systems and had designed a <b>quick-release</b> canopy system during the Battle of Britain, {{a very successful}} device that was later fitted as standard to all Spitfires during manufacture.|$|E
25|$|Controlled-nitrogen-release {{technologies}} {{based on}} polymers derived from combining urea and formaldehyde were first produced in 1936 and commercialized in 1955. The early product had 60 {{percent of the}} total nitrogen cold-water-insoluble, and the unreacted (<b>quick-release)</b> less than 15%. Methylene ureas were commercialized in the 1960s and 1970s, having 25% and 60% of the nitrogen as cold-water-insoluble, and unreacted urea nitrogen in the range of 15% to 30%.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually <b>quick-release,</b> and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back. The harnesses of many diving rebreathers made by Siebe Gorman included a large back-sheet of reinforced rubber.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} joint at {{the rear}} end of the main section could be broken on landing to facilitate in the rapid unloading of troops and equipment, for which ramps were provided. Initially the tail was severed by detonating a ring of Cordtex around the rear fuselage. But this {{was thought to be}} hazardous, especially if detonated prematurely by enemy fire. In early 1944, a method of detaching the tail was devised that used eight <b>quick-release</b> bolts, and wire-cutters to sever the control cables.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{were made}} to restore {{production}} but were abandoned in 1943, and a new plant was set up at Laupheim, near Ulm. The first Drache {{to emerge from the}} new factory, the V11, was flown by pilot Karl Bode for a series of information films made for the Air Ministry to demonstrate the Fa 223's abilities. Loads which included a complete Fieseler Storch aircraft and the fuselage of a Bf 109 were shown being lowered with great precision on to vehicles using the Drache's winch and special <b>quick-release</b> electrical cargo hook.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{can accept}} quick-detachable rails and adapters used to mount optics (STANAG 2324 compliant). The scope mounting system {{consists of a}} centering hole located on the front face of the rear sight assembly and a dovetail-like mounting point at {{the front end of}} the receiver. Swiss Arms (respectively Brügger & Thomet) offer several types of <b>quick-release</b> scope mounts and Picatinny rails. A version of the rifle with an integral receiver-mounted Picatinny rail is also offered; in this configuration the weapon is fitted with flip-up emergency battle sights—a rear aperture sight which folds down into a recess in the rail and a folding front blade.|$|E
25|$|The 2600s {{shared the}} engines and {{transmission}} of their GNR(I) predecessors, having two , 9.6-litre, six-cylinder, four-stroke engines driving the inner axles {{of the two}} bogies via fluid flywheels and Self-Changing Gears five-speed preselector gearboxes, with cardan shafts driving forward/reverse gearboxes {{on the ends of}} the axles. Multiple working was via 24-core jumper cables. The cars were fitted with two parallel vacuum brake systems—a conventional system and a second high-vacuum, <b>quick-release</b> system, based on reservoirs in which a vacuum was continually maintained, for use on services with frequent stops. Steam heating was originally fitted; even-numbered cars had a boiler in the guard's compartment, capable of supplying steam for up to four cars. Cars used on suburban services were subsequently fitted with a bus-type heating system that utilised the engines' cooling water.|$|E
25|$|The Morning Post was {{designed}} by Henri Julliot to the same principles as the earlier Lebaudy République and Lebaudy Patrie but was larger and faster. The envelope was made of panels of waterproof canvas with two valves at the bottom to allow the hydrogen to be released, either automatically or by hand. An additional manual valve {{on the top of}} the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope. Two long <b>quick-release</b> panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation. The gas bag had three ballonets, one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear ballonets could be used to fly the airship up or down. Two centrigual fans were used to inflate the ballonets. Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the enveleope.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two <b>quick-release</b> screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{options for the}} {{mounting}} of a pony bottle. The most common way a pony bottle is carried is by fixing it {{to the side of}} the primary (back gas) scuba cylinder by straps or clamps, which may include a <b>quick-release</b> system (as in the above picture). The most common alternative is [...] "slinging" [...] it between two D-rings on the diver's scuba harness or buoyancy compensator.|$|E
2500|$|The {{centering}} of side-pull brakes was {{improved with}} the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls (an old design re-discovered by Shimano {{in the early}} 1990s). These brakes offer a higher mechanical advantage, and result in better braking. [...] Dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and cannot accurately track an out-of-true rim, or a wheel that flexes {{from side to side}} in the frame during hard climbing. [...] It is common to see professional racers climbing mountains with the <b>quick-release</b> undone on the rear brake, to eliminate drag from this source.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{more of the}} {{competitors}} were also purchased by the Royal Flying Corps. These were the Blériot XI-2, the two Bristol Coanda monoplanes and the two Gnome-powered Deperdussins. Most of these aircraft saw little use, {{with one of the}} Deperdussins crashing fatally on 6 September 1912, followed by one of the Bristol-Coanda monoplanes on 10 September (with the Bristol crash being caused by inadvertent operation in flight of a <b>quick-release</b> catch which had been fitted to allow easy disassembly for the Trials). These crashes resulted in a ban being imposed on monoplane use by the RFC, which had a long-term effect on the course of British aircraft design. [...] The Cody Trials aircraft crashed fatally due to a structural failure in April 1913, and the second Cody biplane was withdrawn from use.|$|E
2500|$|Presented at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Super Trofeo Stradale was {{a limited}} (150 units) {{version of the}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Boasting a dry weight of , it is [...] lighter than a comparably {{equipped}} LP570-4 Superleggera. Essentially a road version of the Super Trofeo race car, equipped with the same adjustable rear spoiler that offers an aerodynamic load 3 {{times that of the}} standard Gallardo LP 560-4 for increased dynamic stability during tight, high-speed driving. Another element taken directly from the racing version was the removable engine hood with <b>quick-release</b> system. The vehicle included Rosso Mars (red) body colour, 6-speed E-gear transmission, carbon fibre and Alcantara interior upholstery with red stitching, double-A-arm suspension, 19-inch wheels, titanium bearing and bolts, Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. Optional equipment included carbon-ceramic brake discs, a tubular interior roll cage, 4-point safety belts and fire extinguisher, satellite navigation, with Bluetooth connection for mobile phones, an anti-theft system, and a lifting system that raises the front axle, grey or white brake caliper.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Caterham {{introduced}} the CSR Superlight. Based on the CSR260, this model adds a ‘Superlight’ lightweight specification to the CSR, further extending the CSR260’s already epic performance envelope. The 2.3 litre Cosworth-powered Caterham CSR260 Superlight brings all the performance credentials associated with its stablemate; performance {{is quoted as}} a 0-60mph time of 3.1 seconds and {{a top speed of}} [...] The Superlight swaps the windscreen, carpet, heater and weather gear on the standard car for a limited slip differential and a quicker steering rack. There is a 25 kilo weight reduction over the standard CSR260, this model variant also adds distinctive Superlight styling to the exterior, including a wind deflector, a carbon fibre dashboard and wings, a black powder coated cockpit and a <b>quick-release</b> MOMO steering wheel. Of particular note are ‘Dynamic Suspensions’ Damper units developed by specialist Multimatic for the car. The damper units lend the already capable CSR a further edge in terms of handling and cornering performance. It features the same 2.3 litre (260bhp) engine as the CSR260, but weighs only [...] and has a power-to-weight ratio of -per-tonne.|$|E

[...] It has a {{removable}} engine hood with <b>quick-release</b> system, rear wing and the hood made from carbon composite material, carbon-ceramic brake system, e-gear six-speed transmission with steering wheel paddles, decal strip along the flank displays green, white and red, {{the colors of the}} Italian flag; choice of 4 body colours (Giallo Midas (yellow), Bianco Monocerus (white), Grigio Thalasso (grey), in Rosso Mars (red)), matte black rear wing with contrasts in body color, hood, front air intakes, rear diffuser and 19-inch forged wheels in high-gloss black; choice of three brake calliper colours (red, black, yellow), carbon fiber (at door panels, racing seats and center console cover, handbrake frame, the middle of the center console, the lower rim of the steering wheel, the trim around the main and secondary instrument panels, the door handles, and the handle for opening the glove box) and Alcantara (at underside of the dashboard, central panel of the seat cushion and the backrest) interior upholstery, bucket seats (optional comfort seats). The rear wing was reported to produce three times more downforce than the standard Gallardo's spoiler.|$|E
2500|$|Late in 1940, a Martin-Baker {{designed}} <b>quick-release</b> canopy mechanism {{began to}} be retroactively fitted to all Spitfires. The system employed unlocking pins, actuated by cables operated by the pilot pulling a small, red rubber ball mounted on the canopy arch. When freed, the canopy was taken away by the slipstream. One {{of the most important}} modifications to the Spitfire was to replace the machine gun armament with wing mounted Hispano 20 mm cannon. In December 1938, Joseph Smith was instructed to prepare a scheme to equip a Spitfire with a single Hispano mounted under each wing. Smith objected to the idea and designed an installation in which the cannon were mounted on their sides within the wing, with only small external blisters on the upper and lower wing surfaces covering the 60 round drum magazine. The first Spitfire armed with a single Hispano in each wing was L1007 which was posted to Drem in January 1940 for squadron trials. On 13 January, this aircraft, piloted by Plt Off Proudman of [...] 602 Squadron took part in an engagement when a Heinkel He 111 was shot down. Soon after this Supermarine was contracted to convert 30 Spitfires to take the cannon armed wing; 19 Squadron received the first of these in June 1940 and by 16 August, 24 cannon armed Spitfires [...] had been delivered.|$|E
