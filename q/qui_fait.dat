2500|$|In 1931 the Union des {{chambres}} de commerce maritimes et des ports français commissioned Pinchon {{to create}} a painting representing the Port of Rouen. This work, a triptych, was exhibited at the Paris Colonial Exposition, which was visited by over 33 million {{people from around the}} world. In addition to the commissioned work, Pinchon took the opportunity to collaborate with the poet Francis Yard in a publication dedicated to [...] "La rivière, <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> de ce quartier de Rouen comme une ignoble petite Venise", as Gustave Flaubert referred to it in Madame Bovary.|$|E
2500|$|Prominent Academicians of {{the early}} 17th century, such as Andrea Sacchi, felt that genre and still-life {{painting}} did not carry the [...] "gravitas" [...] merited for painting to be considered great. An influential formulation of 1667 by André Félibien, a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement {{of the theory of}} the hierarchy of genres for the 18th century:Celui <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ...|$|E

2500|$|Mid 20th century Picasso's lithograph, La Colombe (The Dove), a traditional, {{realistic}} {{picture of}} a pigeon, without an olive branch, {{was chosen as the}} emblem for the World Peace Congress in Paris in April 1949. [...] The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the Communist Party and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period. At the 1950 World Peace Congress in Sheffield, Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves, concluding, [...] "I stand for life against death; I stand for peace against war." [...] At the 1952 World Peace Congress in Berlin, Picasso's Dove was depicted in a banner above the stage. [...] The dove symbol was used extensively in the post-war peace movement. Anti-communists had their own take on the peace dove: the group Paix et Liberté distributed posters titled La colombe <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> BOUM (the dove that goes BOOM), showing the peace dove metamorphosing into a Soviet tank.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{suffering}} a second serious car accident in 1970, Sylvie Vartan continued to perform and record extensively; and in 1972 she {{starred in the}} film Malpertuis. She sold millions of records on the RCA label, which made her its most prolific artist after Elvis Presley. Her most famous songs are [...] "J'ai un probleme", [...] "L'amour au Diapason" [...] (73), [...] "Parle moi de ta vie"(71), [...] "Petit Rainbow" [...] (77), [...] "Bye Bye Leroy Brown" [...] (74), [...] "Disco Queen" [...] and [...] "Nicolas" [...] (79), and [...] "Caro Mozart", an international hit in Italian (72). However, her annual world tours and Italian TV shows continued to include her biggest late-1960s hits. In 1976 she recorded [...] "Qu'est-ce <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> pleurer les blondes?", a disco-style cover of a John Kongos track, which topped the French chart for several weeks. Her disco era climaxed at the Dancing star TV show on TF1, produced by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier, on 10 September 1977. RCA published the show as the Dancing star [...] After a week of concerts in Las Vegas in 1982, she released a duet with John Denver: [...] "Love Again," [...] a #85 single on Billboard Hot 100 followed in 1985 by a new album in the USA with [...] "Double Exposure" [...] and [...] "One-Shot Lover." [...] In 1986 she took a break from show business; she returned in 1989 with [...] "C'est Fatal" [...] ("E' Fatale" [...] in Italy).|$|E

6000|$|However, in {{this same}} gown of shadow, I felt {{at home and at}} ease; an {{advantage}} I should not have enjoyed in anything more brilliant or striking. Madame Beck, too, kept me in countenance; her dress was almost as quiet as mine, except that she wore a bracelet, and a large brooch bright with gold and fine stones. We chanced to meet on the stairs, and she gave me a nod and smile of approbation. Not that she thought I was looking well--a point unlikely to engage her interest--but she considered me dressed [...] "convenablement," [...] "décemment," [...] and la Convenance et la Décence were the two calm deities of Madame's worship. She even paused, laid on my shoulder her gloved hand, holding an embroidered and perfumed handkerchief, and confided to my ear a sarcasm on the other teachers (whom she had just been complimenting to their faces). [...] "Nothing so absurd," [...] she said, [...] "as for des femmes mûres 'to dress themselves like girls of fifteen'--quant à la. St. Pierre, elle a l'air d'une vieille coquette <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> l'ingénue." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not here}} give at full length Professor Tiele's {{explanation}} {{of the meaning of}} a myth which I do not profess to explain myself. Thus, drops of the blood of Ouranos falling on Earth begat the Melies, usually rendered 'Nymphs of the Ash-trees.' But Professor Tiele says they were really bees (Hesychius, [Greek]=[Greek])--'that is to say, stars.' Everybody has observed that the stars rise up off the earth, like the bees sprung from the blood of Ouranos. In Myth, Ritual, and Religion (i. 299-315) I give the competing explanations of Mr. Max Muller, of Schwartz (Cronos=storm god), Preller (Cronos=harvest god), of others who see the sun, or time, in Cronos; while, with Professor Tiele, Cronos is the god of the upper air, and also of the underworld and harvest; he 'doubles the part.' 'Il est l'un et l'autre'--that is, 'le dieu <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> murir le ble' and also 'un dieu des lieux souterrains.' 'Il habite les profondeurs sous la terre,' he is also le dieu du ciel nocturne.|$|E
60|$|We here {{see that}} {{before he was}} one-and-twenty years old, Greg was possessed by the {{conception}} that haunted him to the very end. When the people complain, their complaint savours of rebellion. Those who make themselves the mouthpieces of popular complaint must be wicked incendiaries. The privileged classes must be ordained by Nature to rule over the non-privileged. The few ought to direct and teach, the many to learn. That was Greg's theory of government from first to last. It was derived at this time, I suppose, from Burke, without the powerful correctives and indispensable supplements {{that are to be}} found in Burke's earlier writings. Some one said of De Tocqueville, who afterwards became Mr. Greg's friend, and who showed in a milder form the same fear of democracy, 'Il a commencé à penser avant d'avoir rien appris; ce <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> qu'il a quelquefois pensé creux.' What is to be said for Mr. Greg, now and always, is that he most honourably accepted the obligations of his doctrine, and did his best to discharge his own duties as a member of the directing class.|$|E

6000|$|The unaccommodating and unaccommodated city remains {{none the}} less closely consecrated to one's fondest notion of her--the city too indifferent, too proud, too unaware, too stupid {{even if one}} will, to enter any lists that {{involved}} her moving from her base and that thereby, when one approached her from the alien positive places (I don't speak of the American, in those days too negative to be related at all) enjoyed the enormous [...] "pull," [...] for making her impression, of ignoring everything but her own perversities and then of driving these home with an emphasis not to be gainsaid. Since she didn't emulate, as I have termed it, so she practised her own arts altogether, and both these ways and these consequences were in the flattest opposition (that was the happy point!) to foreign felicities or foreign standards, so that the effect in every case was of the straightest reversal of them--with black for the foreign white and white for the foreign black, wet for the foreign dry and dry for the foreign wet, big for the foreign small and small for the foreign big: I needn't extend the catalogue. Her idiosyncrasy was never in the least to have been inferred or presumed; it could only, in general, make the outsider provisionally gape. She sat thus imperturbable in her felicities, {{and if that is}} how, remounting the stream of time, I like most to think of her, this is because if her interest is still undeniable--as that of overgrown things goes--it has yet lost its fineness of quality. Phenomena may be interesting, thank goodness, without being phenomena of elegant expression or of any other form of restless smartness, and when once type is strong, when once it plays up from deep sources, every show of its sincerity delivers us a message and we hang, to real suspense, on its continuance of energy, on its again and yet again consistently acquitting itself. So it keeps in tune, and, as the French adage says, c'est le ton <b>qui</b> <b>fait</b> la chanson. The mid-Victorian London was sincere--that was a vast virtue and a vast appeal; the contemporary is sceptical, and most so when most plausible; the turn of the tide could verily be fixed to an hour--the hour at which the new plausibility began to exceed the old sincerities by so much as a single sign. They could truly have been arrayed face to face, I think, for an attentive eye--and I risk even saying that my own, bent upon them, as was to come to pass, with a habit of anxiety that I should scarce be able to overstate, had its unrecorded penetrations, its alarms and recoveries, even perhaps its very lapses of faith, though always redeemed afresh by still fonder fanaticisms, to a pitch that shall perhaps present itself, when they expose it all the way, as that of tiresome extravagance. Exposing it all the way is none the less, I see, exactly what I plot against it--or, otherwise expressed, in favour of the fine truth of history, so far as a throb of that awful pulse has been matter of one's own life; in favour too of the mere returns derivable from more inordinate curiosity. These Notes would enjoy small self-respect, I think, if that principle, not to call it that passion, didn't almost furiously ride them.|$|E
