The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate the perception of intonation in cochlear implanted children and compare with normal hearing children.  Materials and methods: This study has been carried out on 25 cochlear implanted children and 50 children with normal hearing. An adult who her first language was Persian, expressed some <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>statement</b> sentences. These sentences were playing for child and was asked him/her to determine whether it was in a <b>question</b> form or <b>statement</b> one.

This paper reports on an initial study that examined the shared communications five year old children in three pre primary classrooms engaged in during whole group storybook reading sessions. Each teacher used communication categories containing directives, <b>questions,</b> <b>statements</b> <b>and</b> responses. However, differences were noted in emphasis and frequency of use. The children in each classroom engaged in collaborative communication when opportunities were presented to them. Differences identified in the children’s contributions were attributed to the approach taken by the teacher, the children’s’ background knowledge and experiences and the content of the storybook selected by the teacher.

We present a new approach called Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling. Using this approach, users create conversational models in a distributed manner. To do this, end-users interact with virtual humans to provide new stimuli (<b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements),</b> <b>and</b> domain-specific experts (e. g. medical/psychology educators) provide new virtual human responses. Using this process, users become the primary developers of conversational models. We tested our approach by creating an example application, Virtual People Factory. Using Virtual People Factory, a pharmacy instructor and 186 pharmacy {{students were able to}} create a robust conversational model in 15 hours. This is approximately 10 % of the time typical in current approaches and results in more comprehensive coverage of the conversational space.

40|$|Presidential {{election}} speeches, as {{one significant}} part of western political life, deserve people’s attention. This paper focuses {{on the use of}} interpersonal meaning in political speeches. The nine texts selected from the Internet are analyzed from the perspectives of mood, modality, personal pronoun and tense system based on the theory of Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar. It aims to study the way how interpersonal meaning is realized through language by making the contrastive analysis of the speeches given by Hillary and Trump. After making a minute analysis, the paper comes to the following conclusions: (1) As for mood, Trump and Hillary mainly employ the declarative to deliver messages <b>and</b> make <b>statements,</b> <b>and</b> <b>imperative</b> is used to motivate the audiences and narrow the gap between the candidates and the audiences, and interrogative is to make the audiences concentrate on the content of the speeches. (2) With respect to the modality system, the median modal operator holds the dominant position in both Trump’s and Hillary’s speeches to make the speeches less aggressive. In this aspect, Trump does better than Hillary. (3) In regard to personal pronoun, the plural form of first personal pronoun is mainly employed by the two candidates to close the relationship with audiences. (4) Regards to tense system, simple present tense are mostly used to establish the intimacy of the audiences and the candidates. Then two influential factors are discussed. One is their personal background and the other is their language levels. This paper is helpful for people to deeply understand the two candidates’ language differences...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the socially constructed context of whole group storybook reading in pre primary classrooms. The study is centred in the shared communications that occur between pre primary {{teachers and students}} before, {{during and after the}} storybook reading. In particular, insights are sought on {{the nature and extent of}} the pre primary teachers 2 ̆ 7 and the pre primary students 2 ̆ 7 communicative contributions and the opportunity provided for the inclusion of personal knowledge and personal experience in the communication. Whether there is a change in the nature of the contributions over time is also examined. The study seeks to extend current understanding of the situated nature of socially constructed classroom communicative repertoires beyond the descriptions of teacher dominated communicative strategies in order to develop an appreciation of the potential that whole group storybook reading has for student communicative constructions. Moreover, the capacity of whole group storybook reading for encouraging reciprocal communicative opportunities between the pre primary teacher and students in the classroom is examined, The study has been carried out in three phases. The initial phase involved the completion of an open-ended questionnaire by forty three pre primary teachers. The aim of the questionnaire was to establish an understanding of the importance pre primary teachers placed on the whole group storybook reading activity. Phase two was the pilot study containing a field of five pre primary classrooms where teachers were invited to share their whole group storybook reading sessions. The storybook reading sessions were videotaped and analysed and a coding structure was developed from the communications that occurred between the teacher and students. The coding structure provided a framework which was used in organizing and analyzing the classroom communication that occurred during the final case studies. Phase three involved year long case studies of teacher-student communication during whole group storybook reading in three pre primary classrooms. The three pre primary classrooms were drawn from high, middle, and low socio-economic suburbs in the Perth metropolitan area. The case studies involved videotaping a storybook reading session every fortnight in each of the classrooms totalling twenty. The whole year period was considered necessary to map changes that occurred to the context and communication exchange during storybook reading. A case study approach facilitated understanding of how teachers organize their whole group storybook reading and an appreciation of the repertoire of personal knowledge and experience pre primary teachers and pre primary students brought to the storybook reading context. The case study research found the physical organization of whole group storybook reading in each of the pre primary classrooms to be similar. The main differences between the storybook reading activity were derived from the different goals the pre primary teachers had for storybook reading and the individual differences the students brought to the storybook reading context. The teachers 2 ̆ 7 contributions to the whole group storybook reading activity were based on communications with the students that contained directives, <b>questions,</b> <b>statements</b> <b>and</b> responses. All three teachers used the categories of communication but with differences in emphasis and use. One teacher adopted an approach that was interactive and encouraged learning through shared communication. Another teacher concentrated on shared communication to promote confidence with speaking and competency in language and literacy development. The students 2 ̆ 7 contributions to the whole group storybook reading activity were based on requests, <b>questions,</b> <b>statements,</b> <b>and</b> responses. Students were not major initiators of the communication in any of the three pre primary classrooms, but contributed to collaborative communication when opportunities were presented to them. Differences noted in the students 2 ̆ 7 contributions could be attributed to the approach taken by the pre primary teachers, the students 2 ̆ 7 background knowledge and experience and the choice of book being read to the students. The strategies adopted by the teachers to create opportunities for the students to develop communications around experience and knowledge were based on teacher <b>questions,</b> <b>statements</b> <b>and</b> responses, <b>and</b> student <b>statements</b> <b>and</b> responses that referred to background experience and knowledge. All three teachers occasionally presented some of their personal experiences to enrich storybook events, whereas students were enthusiastic and spontaneous about sharing personal and family events that related to the storybook. Differences were noted in the teachers 2 ̆ 7 overall approach to the level of shared communication which occurred during whole group storybook reading. Teachers provided additional opportunities for student participation and shared communicative contributions. The differences in teachers 2 ̆ 7 and students 2 ̆ 7 contributions throughout the year could be related to changes in the teachers 2 ̆ 7 goals for the students and how that impacted on the communication and the increased skill level of the students. The students 2 ̆ 7 communication increased as the year progressed in each of the three pre primary classrooms...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePhonological {{models of}} {{intonation}} use abstract categories, such as pitch accents, {{to build a}} bridge between continuous modulations in f 0 contours (on the substantial side) and post-lexical meaning (on the functional side). However, recent research on Romance, Germanic and non-Indoeuropean languages shows that sentence modality contrasts (i. e. <b>question</b> vs. <b>statement)</b> are often realized not only with different f 0 contours, but also through differences in individual phone duration or global speech rate. If these durational differences were also used as a cue {{in the perception of}} sentence modality contrasts, phonological categories in current models of intonation would qualify as excessively underspecified, and they should be expanded in order to include phonetic information on the temporal dimension as well. In this paper we evaluate the role of durational differences as a cue to the perception of sentence modality contrasts in the Neapolitan regional variety of Italian. Read sentences were resynthesized by switching durational and intonational patterns of <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>statements,</b> <b>and</b> used in a forced-choice identification task. The results show that listeners exclusively rely on intonational cues, thus suggesting that, at least for this specific contrast in this specific variety, phonological representations of intonational contrasts {{do not need to be}} enriched with phonetic detail at the durational level...|$|R
