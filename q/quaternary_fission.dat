Pyatkov and Kamanin et al. in JINR Dubna are pursuing experiments on collinear ternary fission.

40|$|Ternary and {{quaternary}} spontaneous {{decay of}} " 2 " 5 " 2 Cf was studied with the NESSI detector, {{a combination of}} two 4 #pi# detectors for charged particles, neutrons and #gamma#-rays. The applied method of particle identification by measuring the energies and relative time-of-flights of the decay products is shown to be very effective {{for the study of}} rare decay modes. The energy and angular distributions of the decay products, the associated neutron multiplicities, the total energy of the prompt #gamma#-radiation as well as correlations between the various observables were measured {{for the first time in}} a single full-scale experiment. The characteristics of ternary fission known from previous investigations are confirmed in the frame of a methodically independent experiment. Preliminary estimates of the <b>quaternary</b> <b>fission</b> yield are presented. An attempt is made to determine the mechanism of <b>quaternary</b> <b>fission.</b> (orig.)

40|$|Complex fission {{phenomena}} are {{studied in}} a unified way. Very general reflection asymmetrical equilibrium (saddle point) nuclear shapes are obtained by solving an integro-differential equation without being necessary to specify a certain parametrization. The mass asymmetry in binary cold fission of Th and U isotopes is explained {{as the result}} of adding a phenomenological shell correction to the liquid drop model deformation energy. Applications to binary, ternary, and <b>quaternary</b> <b>fission</b> are outlined. Comment: 28 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|In the Rio Tinguiririca {{valley in}} the Main Cordillera of the Andes of central Chile, 35 ° south, {{parts of a}} stratigraphic section ranging from the late Jurassic to the <b>Quaternary</b> are exposed. <b>Fission</b> track {{analysis}} was carried out on samples from all the stratigraphic units exposed {{in the area in}} order to gain information on the low–grade metamorphic history of the Central Andes and to test older models for the metamorphic and tectonic evolution of the area. The sequence exposed in the Rio Tinguiririca valley is characterised by several distinctive features not found in other localities in the Central Andes; the deposits of the middle Cretaceous (Aptian – Albian) Colimapu Formation and of the middle to late Micoene Farellones Formation are completely missing in the study area. Instead, a volcanic tuff layer, the White Tuff, and a unit consisting of fan deposits and alluvial plane deposits, the Brownish–Red Clastic Unit, unconformably overlie the Late Jurassic deposits of the Ba˜nos del Flaco Formation. The fission track data give some indications on the style and timing of metamorphic events in the study area, enable more accurate constraint of the age of the Brownish–Red Clastic Unit and allow some statements on the tectonic evolution of the study area from the Late Jurassic to present. Burial metamorphism has been proposed by various authors as the main mechanism to produce large suites of rocks altered at low grades in the Central Andes. The results of this study indicate that, on the contrary, hydrothermal alteration connected to magmatic and/or volcanic activity was the main cause of alteration of the rocks and that burial metamorphism played at most a very minor role. Pulses of hydrothermal activity appear to have occurred from Cretaceous to almost recent times and led to alteration of the rocks at slightly varying metamorphic conditions at different times {{in different parts of the}} study area. A new model is proposed for the tectonic evolution of the study area. Fission track analysis of detrital zircons from the Brownish–Red Clastic Unit shows that the unit must have been deposited during the latest Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) and that it is certainly younger than the White Tuff. Thermal modelling shows that considerable exhumation of the lower part of the Rio Damas Formation occurred during the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary. This exhumation is thought to be connected to tilting and erosion of the Mesozoic units in the area prior to the formation of an extensional basin in the Late Eocene. Data from the Eocene to Miocene Coya Machali Formation imply that sedimentation within the Tertiary basin continued somewhat longer than hitherto supposed...|$|R

40|$|The rare {{ternary fission}} process (≃ 1 / 260 {{relative}} to binary fission, for 252 Cf) {{is of particular}} interest not only for the understanding of the fission process itself, but also as a source of various neutron-rich light nuclei [1]. The study of “exotic ” light nuclei is a major topic in modern nuclear structure physics with radioactive beams. The even rarer <b>quaternary</b> <b>fission</b> (QF) mode [2], when two light charged particles (LCP) are emitted simultaneously in addition to the main fission fragments, can originate either from a break-up of unstable species among the LCPs, e. g. 7 Li ∗, 8 Be, 9 Be ∗ (“pseud...|$|E
40|$|With {{the goal}} to measure angular {{correlations}} of fission fragments in rare fission decay (e. g. ternary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>fission),</b> a multi-detector coincidence {{system based on}} two and up to four position sensitive pixel detectors Timepix has been built. In addition to the high granularity, wide dynamic range and per pixel signal threshold, these devices are equipped with per pixel energy and time sensitivity providing more information (position, energy, time), enhances particle-type identification and selectivity of event-by-event detection. Operation of the device with the integrated USB 2. 0 based readout interface FITPix and the control and data acquisition software tool Pixelman enables online visualization and flexible/adjustable operation for {{a different type of}} experiments. Spatially correlated fission fragments can be thus registered in coincidence. Similarly triggered measurements are performed using an integrated spectrometric module with analogue signal chain electronics. The current status of development together with demonstration of the technique with a 252 Cf source is presented...|$|E
