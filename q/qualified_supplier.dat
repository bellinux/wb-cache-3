In many organizations, there is an approved supplier list (ASL) to which a <b>qualified</b> <b>supplier</b> is then added. If rejected the supplier is generally not made available to the assessing company's procurement team. Once approved, a supplier may be reevaluated on a periodic, often annual, basis.

As is common with a number of TPS materials, PICA faces a supply chain issue with the rayon precursor from which the carbon fibers used in the PICA preform are derived. PICA uses a non-woven form of the rayon, which once carbonized, is used in the low-density carbon FiberForm (carbon tile) preform utilized in PICA. Current PICA uses a NASA-qualified non-domestic rayon supplier (Sniace), however the <b>qualified</b> <b>supplier</b> is no longer manufacturing the rayon materials.

40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer using a Request For Quotes reverse auction {{in combination with}} supplier qualification screening to determine which <b>qualified</b> <b>supplier</b> will be awarded a contract. Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer, for example involving reference checks, financial audits, and on-site visits. The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i. e. the contract payment plus qualification costs. While suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (pre-qualification), we allow the manufacturer to delay {{all or part of}} the qualification until after the auction (post-qualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis we analytically explore the tradeoffs between varying levels of pre- and post-qualification. While using post-qualification causes the expected contract payment to increase (bids from unqualified suppliers are discarded) we find that standard industrial practices of pre-qualification only can be improved upon by judicious use of post-qualification, particularly when supplier qualification screening is moderately expensive relative to the value of the contract to the buyer...|$|E

NO REFERENCE TO MATERIAL CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE MADE WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE AUTHOR. With {{increasingly}} competitive global world markets, {{companies are}} {{under intense pressure}} {{to find ways to}} cut production and material costs to survive and sustain their competitive position in their respective markets. Since a <b>qualified</b> <b>supplier</b> is a key element and a good resource for a buyer in reducing such costs, evaluation and selection of the potential suppliers has become an important component of supply chain management. Hence, development of an effective and rational supplier selection model is naturally desirable. Several evaluation and selection models for supplier selection have been proposed and reported in the supply chain literature. This paper reveals the findings of a wide ranging literature review of supplier selection practices and models. Altogether 147 refereed academic journal articles are reviewed and classified into five categories. A list and summary of the papers falling into each category with brief annotations is provided.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2009, Medicare [...] a federal health insurance program that serves about 46. 3 million beneficiaries [...] spent approximately $ 8. 1 billion on durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies for 10. 6 million beneficiaries. DME includes items such as wheelchairs, hospital beds, and walkers. Medicare beneficiaries typically obtain DME items from suppliers, who submit claims for payment for these items to Medicare on behalf of beneficiaries. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has responsibility for administering the Medicare program. Both we and HHS's Office of Inspector General (OIG) have reported that Medicare and its beneficiaries [...] through their out-of-pocket costs [...] have sometimes paid higher than market rates for various medical equipment and supplies. To achieve Medicare savings for DME and to address DME fraud concerns, Congress, through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), required CMS to phase in a competitive bidding program (CBP) for DME suppliers in selected competitive bidding areas (CBA). In CBP, suppliers submit bid prices in the amounts {{they are willing to}} accept as payment to provide DME items to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS then enters into contracts with select DME suppliers to provide DME items at the prices determined by CBP. CBP is a fundamental departure from CMS's usual method of paying for DME, in which CMS pays any <b>qualified</b> <b>supplier</b> a set fee schedule. CBP also provides an incentive for DME suppliers to accept lower Medicare payment amounts in exchange for the ability to serve beneficiaries and to potentially increase their Medicare market share. CMS began implementing CBP in 2007 and 2008 [...] referred to as round 1. Concerns about CBP's round 1 bid submission and contract award processes were raised during two congressional hearings in May 2008. CBP's round 1 was stopped by the enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA), which terminated the contracts already awarded to suppliers, delayed the program's restart, and required CMS to repeat the competition. To compensate for the loss of the projected savings from the CBP delay, beginning January 1, 2009, MIPPA reduced Medicare payments by 9. 5 percent nationally for items in the 10 product categories that had been included in the CBP round 1. The CBP competition [...] referred to as the round 1 rebid [...] was repeated in 2009 and 2010. On January 1, 2011, CBP began with 356 suppliers awarded contracts to provide DME items in nine DME product categories in nine CBAs. CMS stated that the CBP payment amounts are projected to result in an average savings of 32 percent as compared to the current Medicare fee schedule payments for the same items. In contrast to CBP's supplier-level approach, some health care purchasers use a manufacturer-level approach to buy DME items directly from DME manufacturers to obtain savings by leveraging their purchasing power. CMS has not been required to develop a manufacturer-level approach, and there are no current proposals for it to do so. You expressed interest in obtaining information on health care purchasers that currently use a manufacturer-level approach and on issues that would need to be addressed if CMS implemented such an approach. In this report, we describe (1) efforts used by some non- Medicare purchasers to reduce DME spending by contracting with DME manufacturers or using purchasing intermediaries, and (2) issues that CMS might face if required to implement a DME manufacturer-level approach with broad authority to do so. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project specifically investigates {{the use of}} information processing strategies by organizational buyers {{in the first stage}} of the supplier selection process, the selection of an evoked set of <b>qualified</b> <b>suppliers.</b> In this selection process it is hypothesized that the buyer's use of evaluation functions or information processing strategies is influenced by the task faced by the buyer. The varying levels of risk, familiarity and informational requirements of the buying situation should impact the use of the information processing strategies. Structured protocols [...] written descriptions of compensatory and noncompensatory information processing strategies [...] were used to determine the evaluation function which organizational buyers use to <b>qualify</b> <b>suppliers</b> into an evoked set. The data was collected in a field study of 135 organizational buyers from 76 different organizations. The subjects were interviewed about purchases they were presently working on in which suppliers had been selected but the final purchase decision was still pending. Identification of the buying task, new task, modified rebuy, and straight rebuy also utilized the structured protocol technique. Written descriptions, based on the constitutive definitions of Robinson and Farris (1967), were used to address the following research question: Is there a difference in the decision rules or information processing strategies utilized by organizational buyers in the development of an evoked set of <b>qualified</b> <b>suppliers</b> when the buyer is <b>qualifying</b> <b>suppliers</b> for a new task, modified rebuy, or straight rebuy buying task? In addition to the information gathered via the structured protocols, information was gathered about the level of risk, familiarity and information requirements of the purchasing task. This was done {{to gain a better understanding}} of the use of information-processing strategies by organizational buyers. Analysis of the data indicates that the buying task is related to the choice of an information-processing strategy. The data also support the contention that the organizational buyer will utilize any of the information-processing strategies in the selection of an evoked set of suppliers. Although the buying task was found to significantly influence the use of the information-processing strategies, the study shows that all of the strategies were reported as being used for each of the buying tasks. In addition to finding that the buying task influences the choice of an information-processing strategy, the data support the model of information processing presented. The model addressed the impact that risk, familiarity, and information load had on the use of the evaluation functions. The risk node of the model was supported by two of the five risk variables included in the study: product homogeneity and supplier homogeneity. At the familiarity nodes of the model, the subjective measures of familiarity which support the model are supplier familiarity and frequency of product purchase. Supplier familiarity was found to be significantly different between the weighted and unweighted compensatory strategies. The significant difference in the level of familiarity found in the use of the conjunctive and disjunctive information processing strategies is associated with the frequency of product purchase. The final nodal section of the information-processing model which was supported is the comparison of the conjunctive and lexicographic strategies. The lexicographic strategy was found to be used when there was a higher perceived number of suppliers capable of supplying the needed product. In general this study has shown that the situation in which suppliers are selected impacts the use of an information-processing strategy. The findings are consistent with the research and hypothesizing associated with the use of information-processing strategies by consumers...|$|R

40|$|The average US {{manufacturer}} spends 40 - 60 % of {{its revenue}} to procure goods and services. Transcending its more tactical beginnings in vertically integrated firms, today the procurement function serves as a vital gatekeeper to low-cost and low-risk inputs for a firm. Strategic procurement involves operational processes such as supplier qualification screening to identify capable suppliers and also economic processes such as auctions and mechanism design to negotiate terms and prices with suppliers. Reflecting these challenges, the dissertation research studies how companies can simultaneously manage procurement costs and risks. The dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay adopts an optimal mechanism analysis to study how a buyer can best use a reverse auction in combination with supplier qualification screening processes to determine which <b>qualified</b> new <b>supplier</b> to contract with. The main takeaway for practitioners is that the standard industrial practice of fully <b>qualifying</b> all <b>suppliers</b> before the auction can be improved upon by judiciously delaying {{all or part of}} the qualification screening process until after the auction. The second essay extends the insights of the first essay to a setting where a buyer conducts an auction with her <b>qualified</b> incumbent <b>supplier</b> and a possibly unqualified entrant, and shows that the incumbent will strategically drop out of the auction early to forestall a bidding war if the buyer delays the entrant's qualification screening until after the auction. The third essay examines how a buyer can choose suppliers from different geographic regions to mitigate region-specific cost shocks to ``non-price costs" covering logistics, tariffs, shipping insurance and commissions. It shows that the buyer's optimal diversification decision depends on her degree of bargaining clout, i. e., her ability to impose auction mechanisms to curtail suppliers' windfall profit-taking. The more bargaining power the buyer has, the more she prefers a diversified supply base...|$|R

This paper investigates the problem of supplier selection under multi-source procurement for a type of divisible goods (such as coal, oil, and natural gas).

In the first stage, a multi-auction mechanism is established to determine the shortlist among all <b>qualified</b> <b>suppliers</b> based on four attributes (quality, price, quantity flexibility, and delivery time reliability) under a commercial criterion. In the second stage, seven risk attributes against the shortlisted suppliers are further considered, and a new ranking method based on grey correlation degree of mixed sequence is proposed to rank the finalists and to select the final winners. Moreover, the implementation, availability, and feasibility of the two-stage compound mechanism are highlighted by using {{an example of the}} multi-source procurement of electricity coal.
