These quantitative optical procedures are based on the quantitative measurement of light from a series of micro areas of the composite using either transmitted or reflected light. For aramid and fiberglass composites transmitted light techniques are used, and for graphite composites reflected light techniques are used. The techniques require analytical curves for each com-posite sample due to fiber type diffierences and variations in the polish. Analytical curves for the types of composites reported here were found to be linear when light intensity, I, is plotted against the number of fibers, N. The fiber volume is determined from the average intensity recorded from a fixed microscope field on a series of micro sections.

40|$|Evidence for {{morphological}} substrates {{of long-term}} changes in synaptic efficacy is controversial, {{partly because it}} is difficult to employ an unambiguous control. We have used a high-frequency stimulation protocol in vivo to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of aged (22 -month-old) rats and have found a clear distinction between animals that sustain LTP and those that fail to sustain it. The failure group was used as a specific/like-with-like control for morphological changes associated with the expression of LTP per se. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>optical</b> and electron <b>microscopy</b> was used to analyze large populations of dendritic spines and excitatory perforant path synapses; LTP was found to be associated with an increase in numbers of segmented (perforated) postsynaptic densities in spine synapses.

While <b>quantitative</b> asymmetric-detection time-stretch <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> (Q-ATOM) offers a unique optical platform for ultrafast and high-sensitivity quantitative phase cellular imaging, performing the computationally demanding backend QPI phase retrieval and image classification in real-time remains a major technical challenge.

Results show that our implementation on single FPGA card demonstrates a speedup of 9. 4 times over an optimized C implementation running on a 6 -core CPU, and 3. 47 times over the GPU implementation. It is also 24. 19 and 4. 88 times more power-efficient than the CPU and GPU implementation respectively. Throughput increase linearly when four FPGA cards are used to further improve the performance. We also demonstrate an increased classification accuracy when phase images instead of single-angle ATOM images are used.

40|$|This {{experimental}} program {{investigated the}} effects of cryogenic treatment on the mechanical properties and microstructures of AISI 4340 steel and aluminum alloy 7075. Mechanical tests including fatigue resistance, impact energy and hardness were carried out on both alloys, after they had undergone various heat treating conditions {{and the results were}} compared. Experimental results showed that the hardness and fatigue resistance of the cryogenically treated 4340 steel, in general, were a little higher than those of the conventionally treated steel. However, the toughness of the cryogenically treated steel was lower when compared to that of the conventionally treated steel. The quantitative assessment of retained austenite using neutron diffraction technique was also explored. It is concluded that the transformation of retained austenite to martensite is the determining factor which improved hardness and fatigue resistance of the cryogenically treated 4340 steel. In aluminum alloy 7075, the results indicated that after cryogenic processing the fatigue resistance was lower than for conventionally solution and precipitation heat-treated samples. However, the hardness and toughness of the cryogenically treated samples were slightly higher in comparison to the conventional T 6 treated specimens.

40|$|Almost 25 years ago, {{the unique}} electromotile {{activity}} of mammalian outer hair cells (OHCs) was discovered. This cylindrical neuro-epithelial cell {{is capable of}} transducing changes in transmembrane potential into whole-cell axial deformations. The resulting contractions and elongations feedback into the sound-induced vibrations of the basilar membrane, enhancing hearing sensitivity and frequency detection capabilities. Although the complete mechanism of electromotility is not presently understood, the discovery and localization of the putative motor protein, prestin, to the OHC plasma membrane promotes {{the importance of the}} membrane in both OHC and cochlear behavior. A thorough understanding of the constituents of the OHC membrane, both lipids and proteins, as well as their interactions, is then crucial to current and future analyses of OHC function. In this work, we describe the use of <b>quantitative</b> <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> to investigate protein-protein and membrane-protein interactions.

40|$|The Swedish {{mining company}} LKAB is using {{limestone}} as additives {{for the production}} of its iron ore pellets. The company is considering five new proposals of limestones since the Nordkalk Company is soon no longer able to provide limestone from the Storugns quarry which is the one that is used today. The first purpose in this study was to characterize and compare these five new limestones in respect to their texture and their disintegration during the transport from the quarry to the final destination in Malmberget, considering the Storugns limestone as a reference material. The second aim was to focus on finding any link between texture and disintegration properties of the limestones. Another intention is that the methodology which is used in this study will help the company to consider new proposals of limestones in the future. Six limestones from the Orsa, Storugns, Stucks, Vasalemma, Verdal and Võhmuta quarries were analyzed by an optical microscopy analysis of the textures. Two types of physical tests were also included in the study: a tumbler test and a breakage test. Six different textures were identified by a qualitative thin section analysis which shows similarities between the limestones from different origins but also a high variability of texture within a same quarry. A more <b>quantitative</b> <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> analysis led to the assumption of both the degree of lithification and the amount of initial micro-cracks for each sample. According to the physical test results, the limestones disintegrate as follows, from the less to the more disintegrated: Stucks (7, 6 %), Storugns (9, 4 %), Verdal (10, 3 %), Võhmuta (11, 1 %), Vasalemma (11, 8 %) and Orsa (17, 6 %). There is no evident textural parameter which is controlling directly the disintegration of limestone. However the samples with a rather high lithification and a rather low fracturing disintegrate less than samples with a rather low lithification and a rather high fracturing. It is assumed that the combination of degree of lithification together with the amount of initial micro-cracks is somehow controlling the disintegration of limestone. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{microscopy}} {{has brought}} powerful methods to biological research, {{in particular the}} possibility to assay dynamic molecular processes within living individual cells. This thesis deals with various aspects of fluorescence and Raman microscopy, such as the possibility of avoiding cellular damage or stress caused by illumination, how to manipulate single cells for spectroscopic analysis and how to quantify images automatically. Taken together, {{it is hoped that}} the results will help to establish guidelines for non-invasive imaging and spectroscopy and contribute towards the development of <b>quantitative</b> <b>optical</b> <b>microscopy</b> measurements. The question of how to perform non-invasive measurements was considered in three of the appended papers. In Paper I and II, a novel dual-beam Raman microscopy/optical tweezers set-up was evaluated by analyzing the oxygenation of hemoglobin in single, optically trapped, red blood cells. Photodamage was significant, but could be decreased by trapping at 830 nm rather than at 1064 nm and by exciting Raman spectra using 568 nm instead of 488 - 514 nm laser light. In Paper V, light induced stress caused by time lapse fluorescence microscopy of budding yeast was evaluated by studying the nuclear localization of a stress activated transcription factor, Msn 2 p-GFP. The method indicated stress at significantly lower illumination levels than what was revealed by growth defects or morphological changes, but no stress was found for light doses below ~ 0. 16 J/cm 2. Above this level, a given light dose caused more stress if it was distributed over a short than over a long exposure time. Paper III and VI dealt mostly with stress mechanisms in budding yeast. In Paper III, fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the salt sensitivity of deletion mutants in the golgi/endosome/vacuole transport process (vps mutants). With the hypothesis that the salt sensitivity is related to an improper production, processing and membrane integration of the sodium pump Ena 1 p, selected deletion mutants were transformed with a plasmid to express GFP-tagged Ena 1 p. Fluorescence imaging indicated that the salt sensitivity of some of the vps mutants is correlated to a delay of Ena 1 p arrival to the plasma membrane. In Paper VI, the mechanism behind tellurite and tellurium (Te) toxicity was investigated in budding and fission yeasts. Raman and optical microscopy revealed that Te plaques formed in tellurite stressed cells. A genome-wide screen in the S. cerevisiae gene knockout collection indicated that Te accumulation and tellurite detoxification is mediated via the sulphur assimilation and L-methionine biosynthesis pathways. The image analysis in Paper III was done manually, which proved to be both time consuming and difficult to perform in an unbiased manner. This provoked the development of an image analysis software package, which is presented in Paper IV. The algorithms presented can be used for cell contour recognition of non-stained cells and statistical analysis of fluorescence intensity and localization. The algorithms proved instrumental for the quantification of Msn 2 p localization in Paper V...|$|E
