50|$|The {{question}} of how many quantum numbers are needed to describe any given system has no universal answer. Hence for each system one must find the answer for a full analysis of the system. A <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> requires at least one quantum number. The dynamics of any quantum system are described by a quantum Hamiltonian, H. There is one quantum number of the system corresponding to the energy, i.e., the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian. There is also one quantum number for each operator O that commutes with the Hamiltonian. These are all the quantum numbers that the system can have. Note that the operators O defining the quantum numbers should be independent of each other. Often, {{there is more than}} one way to choose a set of independent operators. Consequently, in different situations different sets of quantum numbers may be used for the description of the same system.|$|E
50|$|A given atomic nucleus, {{defined by}} its proton and neutron numbers, is a <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> {{with a set}} of {{characteristic}} higher energy levels that it can occupy as a nuclear isomer. When the nucleus in its ground state is struck by a fast neutron with kinetic energy greater than that of its first excited state, it can undergo an isomeric transition to one of its excited states by receiving the necessary energy from the fast neutron through inelastic scatter. Promptly (on the order of picoseconds, on average) after excitation, the excited nuclear isomer de-excites (either directly or through a series of cascades) to the ground state, emitting a characteristic gamma ray for each decay transition with energy equal to the difference in the energy levels involved (see induced gamma emission). After irradiating the sample with neutrons, the measured number of emitted gamma rays of energy characteristic to the nucleus of interest is directly proportional to the number of such nuclei along the incident neutron beam trajectory. After repeating the measurement for neutron beam incidence at positions around the sample, an image of the distribution of the nuclei in the sample can be reconstructed as done in tomography.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a novel {{framework}} for robust stabil-ity analysis of <b>quantized</b> feedback <b>systems</b> is developed. For an uncertain <b>quantized</b> feedback <b>system,</b> {{it is difficult}} or sometimes impossible to employ the traditional small gain theorem to establish the robust stability of the feedback system: if the nominal part of the feedback system has a signal with finitely many quantization levels in the feedback loop, it is sometimes impossible to make it be finite gain ℓp stable. Furthermore, it is often too conservative to approximate the nonlinearity of the system including quantization errors with the traditional ℓ p gain bounded uncertainty. For such <b>quantized</b> feedback <b>systems,</b> we introduce a new stability notion of small ℓp signal ℓ p stability and derive conditions for robust stability of the feedback system based on this stability notion. We also give two illustrative examples to show {{the usefulness of the}} proposed {{framework for}} the stability analysis of some classes of <b>quantized</b> feedback <b>systems.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the characterization of}} qualitative behavior of a closed-loop <b>quantized</b> <b>system.</b> A <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> is a dynamical system, which instead of knowing its state x(t) and its input u(t) pre-cisely, their qualitative values [x(t) ] and [u(t) ] at a discrete time set T = {t 0, t 1, …, tk, …} are known. The qualitative state [x(t) ] and the qualitative input [u(t) ] are qualitative assessments of their precise values x(t) and u(t) respectively, {{and they can be}} related to each other via a non-deterministic automaton description. The aim is to charac-terize the state behavior of a <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> whenever its non-deterministic automaton description is given. The first result of the paper is derivation of a representation W(k + 1) = AW(k) for a non-deterministic closed-loop automaton. The second result of the paper shows that the state-behavior of a closed-loop <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> can be characterized according to the eigenvalues of matrix A in a similar manner with usual linear discrete-time systems...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} some $C^*$ [...] {{dynamical}} systems obtained by "quantizing" classical {{ones on the}} free Fock space, enjoy very strong ergodic properties. Namely, if the classical dynamical system $(X, T, \m) $ is ergodic but not weakly mixing, then the resulting <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> $(\gg,\a) $ is uniquely ergodic (w. r. t the fixed point algebra) but not uniquely weak mixing. The same happens if we quantize a classical system $(X, T, \m) $ which is weakly mixing but not mixing. In this case, the <b>quantized</b> <b>system</b> is uniquely weak mixing but not uniquely mixing.

40|$|Classical {{integrable}} Hamiltonian systems {{generated by}} {{elements of the}} Poisson commuting ring of spectral invariants on rational coadjoint orbits of the loop algebra gl^+*(2, R) are integrated by separation of variables in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in hyperellipsoidal coordinates. The canonically <b>quantized</b> <b>systems</b> are then shown to also be completely integrable and separable within the same coordinates. Pairs of second class constraints defining reduced phase spaces are implemented in the <b>quantized</b> <b>systems</b> by choosing one constraint as an invariant, and interpreting the other as determining a quotient (i. e., by treating one as a first class constraint and the other as a gauge condition). Completely integrable, separable systems on spheres and ellipsoids result, but those on ellipsoids require a further modification of order (ħ^ 2) in the commuting invariants in order to assure self-adjointness and to recover the Laplacian for the case of free motion. For each case - in the ambient space R^n, the sphere and the ellipsoid - the Schrödinger equations are completely separated in hyperellipsoidal coordinates, giving equations of generalized Lamé type.
