25|$|In the {{mathematical}} formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) {{is associated with}} a mathematical operator. The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable, i.e. it is possible to observe a particle with a momentum of 1kgm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1kgm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an eigenstate) with eigenvalue 1kgm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well-defined value of momentum of 1kgm/s, with no <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> If its momentum were measured, the result is guaranteed to be 1kgm/s.|$|E

40|$|Normally {{one thinks}} of {{the motion of the}} planets around the Sun as a highly {{classical}} phenomenon, so that one can neglect quantum gravity in the Solar System. However, classical chaos in the planetary motion amplifies <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainties</b> so that they become very large, giving huge quantum gravity effects. For example, evidence suggests that Uranus may eventually be ejected from the Solar System, but <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainties</b> would make the direction at which it leaves almost entirely uncertain, and the time of its exit uncertain by about a billion billion years.

To such an end we appeal to q-exponentials, {{that are the}} cornerstone of Tsallis' theory.

We then characterize these new Tsallis' special states by obtaining the associated i) probability distributions for a state of momentum $k$, ii) mean values for some functions of space an momenta, and iii) concomitant <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> The latter are then compared to the usual ones.

2500|$|A random variable's {{possible}} values might represent the possible outcomes of a yet-to-be-performed experiment, or the possible outcomes {{of a past}} experiment whose already-existing value is uncertain (for example, due to imprecise measurements or <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainty).</b> [...] They may also conceptually represent either {{the results of an}} [...] "objectively" [...] random process (such as rolling a die) or the [...] "subjective" [...] randomness that results from incomplete knowledge of a quantity. [...] The meaning of the probabilities assigned to the potential values of a random variable is not part of probability theory itself but is instead related to philosophical arguments over the interpretation of probability. [...] The mathematics works the same regardless of the particular interpretation in use.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, the {{uncertainty}} principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing {{something in a}} system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical [...] "explanation" [...] of <b>quantum</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> It has since become clearer, however, that {{the uncertainty}} principle {{is inherent in the}} properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.|$|E
