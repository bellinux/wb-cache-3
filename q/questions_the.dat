The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her <b>questions.</b> <b>The</b> pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing the general questions regarding science and induction, many philosophers of science are occupied by investigating foundational problems in particular sciences.

5000|$|The {{idea that}} Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> (i.e. assumes <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena.

Scarpia <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> Sacristan, and his suspicions are aroused further when he learns that Cavaradossi has been in the church; Scarpia mistrusts the painter, and believes him complicit in Angelotti's escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these questions were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E

5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask <b>questions.</b> <b>The</b> alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E

5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system was fun. In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was {{not by any means}} an outstanding game, it was one of few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E
5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted {{that this would}} happen, had already taught his family how to change their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E

Zama had tried to sneak the patient out of the country, but the government would rather see it destroyed than let their research fall into Japanese hands; the Red-Haired Man was sent to kill them both. Mulder, however, believes that the patient is an alien-human hybrid. With help from Scully, Mulder successfully unlocks the door of the railcar, but he is knocked unconscious by the Red-Haired Man. As the Red-Haired Man is about to leave, X appears and shoots him. Realizing that the bomb is about to explode and that there is not enough time to both save Mulder and secure the patient, X decides to save Mulder. X exits carrying the still unconscious Mulder shortly before the bomb explodes.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only <b>questions</b> <b>the</b> leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E
