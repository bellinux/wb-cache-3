This paper presents a method by which a limited class of random processes—random walks on undirected graphs—can be simulated by unitary <b>quantum</b> <b>computations</b> in a space-efficient (and time-efficient) manner. By means of such simulations, it is demonstrated that the undirected graph connectivity problem for regular graphs can be solved by one-sided error quantum Turing machines that run in logspace and require a single measurement {{at the end of}} their computations. It follows that symmetric logspace is contained in a quantum analogue of randomized logspace that disallows intermediate measurements...|$|R

25|$|Quantum-enhanced machine {{learning}} refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in {{machine learning}}, thereby improving a classical machine learning method.

25|$|Finally, upon {{termination}} of the algorithm, the result needs to be read off. In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000. Quantum mechanically, one measures the three-qubit state, which is equivalent to collapsing the quantum state down to a classical distribution (with the coefficients in the classical state being the squared magnitudes of the coefficients for the quantum state, as described above), followed by sampling from that distribution. This destroys the original quantum state. Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability. However, by repeatedly initializing, running and measuring the quantum computer's results, the probability of getting the correct answer can be increased. In contrast, counterfactual <b>quantum</b> <b>computation</b> allows the correct answer to be inferred when the quantum computer is not actually running in a technical sense, though earlier initialization and frequent measurements are part of the counterfactual computation protocol.|$|E
