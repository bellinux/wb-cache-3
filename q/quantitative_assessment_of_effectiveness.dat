40|$|Under certain {{conditions}} residual welding stresses greatly effect fatigue performance. Residual tensile stresses re-duce the fatigue life of welded joints {{in the region}} of multi-cycle loading by two to three times and more. The effect of tensile residual stresses on the fatigue limit of symmetrically loaded (R = minus 1) welded joints is equal to that of stress concentration factor. With an increase of the external load level the effect of the residual welding stresses decreases and at the stress level S = S~KL the fatigue resistance of welded joints with and without resid. ual stresses become identical. Residual stresses {{play an important role in}} welded attachments such as stiffness, ribs, diaphragms and also in welded joints with defects. A method of calculating the effect of residual stresses on the cyclic endurance of the welded joints, which makes it possible to estimate with an accuracy sufficient to practice the role of residual stresses in fatigue process in relation to the type of weld, mechanical properties of base metal and external loading parameters was developed. A new ultrasonic impact peening treatment is introduced. The fatigue improvement treatment is based on introduc-tion of compressive residual stresses into areas of high stress concentration, reduction in stress concentration as-sociated with welds local geometry and plastic deformat-ion strengthening of surface metal layer. A <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of fatigue imp-rovement treatments was developed. This paper briefly describes this assessment.

At Clayoquot Sound, habitat occurs in larger stands, and murrelets selected steeper slopes and patches with more platform trees, and shorter trees, than at random sites. At Desolation Sound, where smaller forest stands predominate, patch scale variables were less important; increased canopy complexity in the patch, and wetter/cooler landscape aspects distinguished nests from random sites.

Therefore, they are helpful to mitigate the urban microclimate by decreasing air and surface temperature when applied over building envelopes, i. e., roofs and walls, and urban paving surfaces.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{land use}} practices, altered climates, and {{shifting}} forest and fire management policies {{have increased the}} frequency of largewildfires several-fold.

We examined the landscape effects of more than 72 000 ha of wildland fuel treatments involved in 14 large wildfires that burned 314 000 ha of forests in nine US states between 2002 and 2010. Fuels treatments altered the probability of fire occurrence both positively and negatively across landscapes, effectively redistributing fire risk by changing surface fire spread rates and reducing the likelihood of crowning behaviour. Trade offs are created between formation of large areas with low probabilities of increased burning and smaller, well-defined regions with reduced fire risk...|$|R
40|$|Techniques such as rewetting, topsoil removal, {{diaspore}} transfer or {{combinations of}} these are increasingly applied in fen meadow and flood meadow restoration in Western Europe. In this paper, we present a <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> the commonly used meadow restoration methods. We use the change in ‘saturation index’ to evaluate the degree of success. The index reflects the completeness of restored communities in comparison to regional target communities. Meadow restoration has limited success in most cases, with an average increase in species richness below 10 % of the regional species pool. Restoration success was partly determinated by the starting situation. The more species-rich the starting situation, the higher the saturation index after restoration but, at the same time, the smaller {{the increase in the}} number of target species due to restoration. Top soil removal and diaspore transfer were found to contribute most to restoration success. A combination of top soil removal and diaspore transfer and a combination of all three techniques appeared to be the most effective measure and resulted in an increase in the saturation index of up to 16 %. Rewetting alone had no measurable effect on restoration success. ...|$|R

Hence, {{the aim of}} this study was to quantify the GHG mitigation potential of selected measures on two typical organic farms in Switzerland. We built a single-farm model which enabled us to calculate the GHG emissions and energy consumption at farm level using a life cycle assessment approach. The model was used to calculate the effects of 13 different {{mitigation measures}} on a Swiss organic dairy and a Swiss organic mixed farm. At the dairy and mixed farm, respectively, 5. 4 % and 5. 5 % of mitigation in relation to the farms’ total GHG emissions could be realized by technical means and 15. 4 % and 12. 9 % with agronomic measures. Technical measures include the use of photovoltaics and heat recovery from milk cooling devices. The agronomic measures include conversion to full-grazing systems, composting livestock manure, and the use of dual-purpose cattle breeds. The total mitigation potential of the analysed measures is 20. 8 % less GHG emissions for the dairy farm and 18. 5 % less for the mixed farm. However, some agronomic measures may result in yield decreases, which reduce the total mitigation effect of the analysed portfolio of measures from an LCA perspective...|$|R

This mixed-methods study (Part 1 and 2) evaluated the effects of facilitative (f) versus non-facilitative (nf) tutoring roles on knowledge-gain and group functioning in the field of endodontics. Methods: Part 1 was a <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> tutor <b>effectiveness</b> within a prospective, experimental, single-blind, stratified, randomized, two-group intervention study. Participants attended PBL {{in the context of a}} hybrid curriculum. A validated questionnaire was used and knowledge assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. External observers rated tutor performance. Part 2 was a qualitative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> tutor <b>effectiveness</b> and consisted <b>of</b> semi-structured expert interviews with tutors and focus group discussions with students. Results: Part 1 : f tutors obtained significantly higher scores than nf tutors with respect to learning motivation and tutor effectiveness (p[*]≤[*] 0. 05). nf tuition resulted in a slightly larger knowledge gain (p[*]=[*] 0. 08). External observers documented a significantly higher activity among facilitative tutors compared to non-facilitative tutors. Part 2 : Tutors found the f role easier although this led to a less autonomous working climate. The students rated f tutoring as positive in all cases. Conclusions: With respect to PBL-group performance, students felt that groups guided in a non-facilitative fashion exhibited a higher level of independence and autonomy, especially with increasing PBL experience. In addition, students reported that more preparation was necessary for sessions guided by a non-facilitative tutor.

Large regions {{all over the world}} are in need of integrated conservation strategies that sustainably prevent and remediate soil erosion. Therefore, quantitative and globally interpretable data are needed in support of models and decision making. The effects of various soil and water conservation techniques (SWCT) on runoff and soil loss in Europe have been extensively studied over the last 60 years. Runoff plots are the most widely used measurement technique to study the effects of SWCT on runoff and soil loss by water erosion. Hence, many data are available. However, the insights gained hereby remain mostly local and aften qualitative whereas the full potential of the available data is not exploited yet. This is mainly due to the fragmentation of knowledge and extrapolation difficulties inherently linked with this type of data.

40|$|Our {{ability to}} respond {{appropriately}} to infectious diseases is enhanced by identifying differences in the potential for transmitting infection between individuals. Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i. e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [0 < R eff < 1) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis {{is based on a}} branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that R eff has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in R eff, suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases.

The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a web-based test to measure {{the learning}} <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> KM education among medical students (MSs). We used an open-source Moodle platform to test 30 multiple-choice questions classified into 8 -type fields (eight basic concepts of KM) including “qi-blood-fluid” and “five-element” theories, on 117 fourth-year MSs. The mean (±standard deviation [SD]) score on the web-based test was 30. 2 ± 11. 9 (/ 100). The correct answer rate ranged from 17 % to 36 %. A pattern-based portfolio enabled these rates to be individualized in terms of KM proficiency. MSs with scores higher (n= 19) or lower (n= 14) than mean ± 1 SD were defined as high or low achievers, respectively. Cluster analysis using the correct answer rates for the 8 -type field questions revealed clear divisions between high and low achievers. Interestingly, each high achiever had a different proficiency pattern.

40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) are ubiquitous and generalized {{consumers of}} insects in soil food webs, occurring widely in and agricultural ecosystems on all continents. Augmentative releases of EPN {{have been used}} to enhance biological control of pests in agroecosystems. Pest managers strive to achieve a trophic cascade whereby natural-enemy effects permeate down through the food web to suppress host herbivores and increase crop production. Although trophic cascades have been studied in diverse aboveground arthropod-based systems, they are infrequently investigated in soil systems. Moreover, no overall <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> EPN in suppressing hosts with cascading benefits to plants has been made. Toward synthesizing the available but limited information on EPN and their ability to suppress prey and affect plant yield, we surveyed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of 35 published studies. Our analysis found that effect sizes for arthropod hosts as a result of EPN addition were consistently negative and indirect effects on plants were consistently positive. Results held across several different host metrics (abundance, fecundity and survival) and across several measures of plant performance (biomass, growth, yield and survival). Moreover, the relationship between plant and host effect size was strikingly and significantly negative. That is, the positive impact on plant responses generally increased as the negative effect of EPN on hosts intensified, providing strong support for the mechanism of trophic cascades. We also review the ways in which EPN might interact antagonistically with each other and other predators and pathogens to adversely affect host suppression and dampen trophic cascades. We conclude that the food web implications of multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN are poorly studied, but, as management techniques that promote the long-term persistence of EPN are improved, antagonistic interactions are more likely to arise. We hope that the likely occurrence of antagonistic interactions in soil food webs should stimulate researchers to conduct field experiments explicitly designed to examine multiple-enemy interactions involving EPN and their cascading effects to hosts and plants...|$|R

We investigate this weakness by aggregating the annotations of an entire community of users to alleviate the annotation requirements on the individual user. The second weakness is the hit-or-miss nature of exact keyword matching used in many existing image retrieval systems. We explore this weakness by using linguistics tools (WordNet and the OpenMind Commonsense database) to locate image keywords in a semantic network of interrelated concepts so that retrieval by keywords is automatically expanded semantically to avoid the hit-or-miss problem. Such semantic query expansion further alleviates the requirement for exhaustive manual annotation. The third weakness of keyword-based image retrieval systems {{is the lack of}} support for retrieval by subjective content. We investigate this weakness by creating a mechanism to allow users to annotate images by their subjective emotional content and subsequently to retrieve images by these emotions. This thesis is primarily an exploration of different keyword-based image retrieval techniques in a real image retrieval system. The design of the system is grounded in past research that sheds light onto how people actually encounter the task of describing images with words for future retrieval. The image retrieval system's front-end and back- end are fully integrated with the Treehouse Global Studio online community - an online environment with a suite of media design tools and database storage of media files and metadata. (cont.) The focus of the thesis is on exploring new user scenarios for keyword-based image retrieval rather than <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> retrieval <b>effectiveness.</b> Traditional information retrieval evaluation metrics are discussed but not pursued. The user scenarios for our image retrieval system are analyzed qualitatively in terms of system design and how they facilitate the overall retrieval experience. James Jian Dai. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} an attempt at {{improving}} the quality of schools through determining how much the internal effectiveness is, with an emphasis on quantitative indexes, in Dezful's technical and art schools, in comparison with the average internal <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> Khozestan's, the Province in which Dezful city is located, and the whole country's schools. In this study, Frank Hikler's comparative method which is absolute and subjective was used.. Population of the study incorporated Dezful's technical and art schools’ students. The authors investigated the grades of these schools’ current students, and also tried to get statistics of the students from 2001 to 2006. Descriptive statistics (chart, frequency distribution, percentage) and inferential statistics (independent t-test, analysis of variance and so on) were used for <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the internal <b>effectiveness.</b> A researcher- made questionnaire was also used as the data collection tool and Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient for the instrument was 0. 7266. A sample of 260 students, out of 800 junior students of these schools, were selected through simple random sampling to complete the researcher-made questionnaire. Some students and managers were interviewed and also facilities of these schools were considered for the qualitative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> these schools’ internal effectiveness. Qualitative assessment showed that the internal <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> Dezful's schools is 0. 97,of Khozestan’ schools is 1. 038,and of the whole country's schools is 0. 83. The results revealed that the percent of graduated students in Dezful's schools from 2001 to 2006 were 13. 25 percent lower than the percent of the graduated students from technical and art schools of Isfahan Province, Iran from 1991 to 1996. Furthermore, the results revealed that the quality of technical and art schools can be improved through proper planning for in-service training and through equipping the schools with modern equipments and facilities. Analysis and investigation <b>of</b> the internal <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> technical and art schools would enable the government to plan properly and to reduce unnecessary cost, and the government thus would invest properly and the wealth of a country can’t be wasted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ensuring {{the success}} of {{conservation}} through protected areas relies on understanding whether management actions are successful or whether {{they need to be}} changed. Such management effectiveness evaluations are becoming increasingly common globally and are being used to adapt management actions and guide strategic planning and resource allocation within protected areas. Due to a lack of data about protected area management, generally evaluations are based on the knowledge of protected area managers. While this expert knowledge is a potentially plentiful and cost-effective option, {{it is important to consider}} the precision and accuracy of these data to understand the confidence that should be placed in this information before they are used to make significant changes to protected area management. However, this is the first study to examine the precision and accuracy <b>of</b> management <b>effectiveness</b> evaluations based on expert knowledge. To examine the confidence that can be placed in expert management effectiveness evaluation, this study focused on the State of the Parks evaluation tools, used by the Australian protected area management agencies Parks Victoria and the New South Wales Department of Conservation and Climate Change. Both the accuracy and precision <b>of</b> <b>assessments</b> are considered using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. By establishing an independent reference point through on-ground data collection or a systematic review of existing data, the accuracy <b>of</b> park manager’s <b>assessments</b> were evaluated. An analysis of the data sources available to park managers to support their assessments revealed that the majority of park managers did not use quantitative data. The accuracy <b>of</b> <b>assessments</b> was therefore measured for a sample of reserves where quantitative data were reportedly used and where practitioners had only experience to inform their assessments. The precision, or the consistency, of State <b>of</b> the Parks <b>assessments</b> was also examined. Two likely sources of inconsistency within State of the Parks data were considered: those arising from the use of language and those resulting from personal differences between managers. The magnitude of these errors was evaluated through a questionnaire and a series of interviews with park managers. These errors were then modelled to assess the factors that influence the error within assessments. This study demonstrates that over half of park managers accurately assess the conditions within their reserves with reference only on their personal management experience. This analysis also revealed that many park managers who report research and monitoring data as the basis <b>of</b> their <b>assessments</b> do not genuinely have data, thus artificially inflating the already low levels of quantitative data reported. A systematic review of the data available to support State <b>of</b> the Parks <b>assessments</b> revealed that even when data were genuinely available to managers these data were insufficient to support the assessment and so required interpretation of the basis of personal experience. This provides strong evidence that even <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> management <b>effectiveness</b> are actually experience-based. Yet, experience is sufficient for accurate assessments in many cases. While many park managers can accurately asses the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> their management, inaccuracies appear to arise from inconsistency in how park managers interact with the State <b>of</b> the Parks <b>assessment</b> tool. Park managers were found to be inconsistent in how they interpreted the language used in assessments when terms were not clearly defined, introducing error into the data set. Likewise, where the answers to assessments could be framed in various ways, park managers varied in the scope, scale and timeframe considered for assessments. While these framing errors were common, they did not account for a significant error in the dataset, but are likely to vary between evaluation datasets collected in different years. Considering the combined effects of these errors in State of the Parks data (the total error), the most reliable assessments were made by park rangers with moderate amounts of experience and the managers of nature reserves if they had a tertiary level education. The results of this study should be viewed as a positive outcome for management effectiveness assessments based on expert knowledge. Over half of park managers made accurate <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> their reserves and many of the inconsistencies recorded may be easily resolved through more careful elicitation <b>of</b> <b>assessments.</b> For example, the undefined terms used within the assessments currently cause park managers confusion, but using explicit management standards to eliminate personal interpretations should eliminate much of this bias. Likewise, where park managers frame with <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> management differently, more explicit guidelines could ensure they understand what they should evaluate. These simple changes would result in higher levels of precision and more robust evaluation data sets, increasing the confidence with which they can be used to guide management. The findings of this research should encourage other management agencies to analyse the validity of their evaluation data sets and provide guidance for those wishing to develop similar assessment tools...|$|R
40|$|The UN has {{declared}} 2005 to 2014 the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. However, education is {{often viewed as}} an unalloyed good and consequently, {{there have been few}} empirical studies on {{the costs and benefits of}} different forms of education within the fields of environmental conservation and sustainable development. Likewise, studies quantifying success of conservation and sustainable development projects are also limited. Without quantitative data on either of these aspects it is difficult to translate research into action, which is vital if conservation and sustainable development strategies are to succeed. This study explores educational policies at global and local scales based on conservation interventions funded by the DEFRA Darwin Initiative. At the global scale, I carry out an analysis of the role of educational activities in projects funded by the Darwin Initiative since its inception. At the local scale, I carry out an in-depth case study of the success of a Darwin-funded project for the conservation of the saiga antelope (Saiga tartarica) conservation in Kalmykia, Russia. The geographically small area studied meant that cultural and demographic influences could be controlled, allowing for an in-depth exploration of a media-based public awareness campaign in comparison with other conservation interventions. Fieldwork was carried out over three months, using willingness-to-pay (WTP) as an indicator of behavioural intention. Analysis involved generalised linear modelling techniques. To expand the study from a case-by-case scenario to a global comparative analysis, a database was developed of Darwin Initiative project reports, as the scheme has been promoting biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use worldwide for many years and emphasises the importance of education within its remit. It therefore offers a range of education initiatives both in terms of scale and strategy providing the variance required for such a meta-analysis. The study involved a combination of quantitative statistical and cost-benefit analyses alongside qualitative in-depth interviews with project leaders. This may be one of the few studies on environmental conservation and sustainable development success in which intervention effectiveness has been properly quantified and robustly examined. WTP, as an indicator of behavioural intention, was established as a practical measure of conservation success at field-level. At the larger scale, consistent measures of success can be developed that can be used to analyse large datasets in a quantitative manner. These measures have been used successfully to establish education as a useful tool for environmental conservation and sustainable development and to demonstrate important distinctions in cost-effectiveness of different educational strategies. It is hoped that this comprehensive and <b>quantitative</b> comparative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effectiveness</b> and success <b>of</b> different conservation interventions will be used in future implementation of conservation, and in particular environmental education policies, to ensure that sustainable development and environmental conservation strategies are both cost-effective and successful.
