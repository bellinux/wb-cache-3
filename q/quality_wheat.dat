25|$|The {{economy of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire was based on agriculture, mining, {{traditional}} crafts, and trade. Agriculture and livestock breeding remained the mainstays of the Bulgarian economy between the 12th and 14th centuries. Moesia, Zagore, and Dobrudzha were known for rich harvests of grain, including high <b>quality</b> <b>wheat.</b> Production of wheat, barley, and millet was also developed in most regions of Thrace. The main wine-producing areas were Thrace, the Black Sea coast, and the valleys of the Struma and Vardar rivers in Macedonia. Production of vegetables, orchards, and grapes became increasingly important {{since the beginning of}} the 13th century. The existence of large forests and pastures was favorable for livestock breeding, mainly in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions of the country. Sericulture and especially apiculture were well developed. Honey and wax from Zagore were the best-quality bee products in the Byzantine markets and were highly praised. The forests produced wood for cutting (бранища); there were also fenced forests (забели), in which wood-cutting was banned.|$|E

40|$|Greater sophistication among buyers inthe {{wheat market}} has increaseddemands for higher <b>quality</b> <b>wheats.</b> As demand for higher <b>quality</b> <b>wheats</b> has increased, {{attention}} {{has focused on}} quality variability or consistency of wheat purchased. Concerns over the quality consistency of hard wheats have been voiced in both domestic and export markets. Other {{studies have indicated that}} importers perceive United States imports as less consistent than Australian and Canadian wheat imports. Many factors affect the variability of wheat produced and exported. These include differences in varietal development and release mechanisms, marketing practices, handling practices, grading systems, and environmental effects which can in turn impact the <b>quality</b> of <b>wheats</b> produced. Changes are also occurring in the way wheat is purchased. The grades and classes of wheat imported are changing and many importers are increasing the specificity of characteristics in import tenders. For example, Japan and Taiwan have been lowering the maximum dockage allowable in import tenders over time. Finally, wheat purchases are generally made based on protein levels which are correlated with end-use quality parameters, but are subject to some uncertainty. This study is a summary of a larger report that examines the variability of wheat at different points in the wheat marketing chain (variety, farm production, and export levels).

40|$|Kenkel, Anderson, and Attaway {{found that}} Oklahoma country {{elevators}} tended to overestimate test weight and underestimate dockage and undesirable grade factors, such as damaged kernels, shrunken and broken kernels, and foreign material for hard red winter wheat in the 1995 and 1996 harvests. This reflects an apparent pricing inefficiency in the Oklahoma wheat market in that elevators {{paid more than}} they should have for low <b>quality</b> <b>wheat</b> and less than they should have for high <b>quality</b> <b>wheat.</b> Measuring quality characteristics more accurately will cost elevators more, but will help them to increase price received from next-in-Iine (NIL) buyers and facilitate supplying products that meet consumers ' needs.

40|$|The {{demand for}} high <b>quality</b> hard <b>wheats</b> has been increasing. In this paper, factors {{affecting}} the supply and consistency of high <b>quality</b> <b>wheats</b> in Canada and North Dakota were compared and contrasted. Differences {{exist in the}} development and release of new varieties which affect the number and <b>quality</b> of hard <b>wheats</b> produced. Variety numbers and concentration were examined with a range of measures. Wheat area in Canada was found to be concentrated in fewer varieties than in North Dakota. These results were more apparent for durum than for hard red spring wheats. However, there was a trend toward more concentration in North Dakota and less in Canada. Protein, yield, and trade-offs were compared. Alberta appears to have a comparative advantage in the production of higher protein wheats. Farmers there have less of a yield loss penalty for increasing protein, compared to other regions. Varietal selection models were developed to analyze factors affecting variety choice. In Canada, agronomic factors including, relative yields, were significant variables affecting variety choice. In North Dakota, agronomic factors other than years since release generally had less effect on adoption rates. Varieties in North Dakota and Manitoba were found to have shorter life cycles and reached their maximum utilization by farmers faster than in Alberta or Saskatchewan.
