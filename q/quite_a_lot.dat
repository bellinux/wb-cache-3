5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing to be happy, was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|Khánh and a {{group of}} younger {{officers}} called the Young Turks—led by chief of the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, commander of I Corps General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and IV Corps commander Thiệu—wanted to forcibly retire officers with more than 25 years of service, as they thought them to be lethargic and ineffective, but most importantly, rivals for power. Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles robbery-homicide {{sergeant}} Vincent Hanna (Plank) is on {{the trail}} of a gang of ruthless professional criminals, led by the methodical Patrick McLaren (McArthur), whose only mistake in the last heist was the killing of armored car guards by the new recruit, Waingro (Berkeley), who is a loose cannon. But Hanna is soon surprised when he discovers that he and McLaren have <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in common. While McLaren and his gang plan another heist, Hanna and his colleagues keep surveillance. Hanna is facing a personal problem, as the police work is straining his relationship with his wife, Lillian (Pouget). Moreover, McLaren is also facing a similar problem when he finds himself falling in love with Eady (Harrington), which he personally condemns due to the commitment required to his profession.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the strong}} {{influence}} of Hong Kong soap operas, Guangdong provincial television programs and Cantonese pop songs, many young Chaoshan peoples can understand <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Cantonese even if they cannot speak it in certain degrees of fluency.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{constant}} and relatively low speed, a cable car's potential to cause harm in an accident can be underestimated. Even with a cable car traveling at only 9 miles per hour, {{the mass of the}} cable car and the combined strength and speed of the cable can do <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of damage in a collision.|$|E

5000|$|Knapsack Cryptosystems are cryptosystems which {{security}} {{is based on}} the hardness of solving the knapsack problem. While such systems have been existing for <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> long time, they remain <b>quite</b> unpopular because <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of such systems have been broken. However that type of cryptosystem is a good candidate for post-quantum cryptography ...|$|R
25|$|An {{account of}} profits is the {{appropriate}} remedy when, for example, a senior employee has taken advantage of his fiduciary position by conducting his own company {{on the side and}} has run up <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of profits over a period of time, profits which he wouldn't have been able to make otherwise. The fiduciary in breach may however receive an allowance for effort and ingenuity expended in making the profit.|$|E
25|$|In the Finnish writing system, {{some basic}} Latin letters are {{considered}} redundant, and other letters generally represent sounds {{that are not}} inherent in the Finnish language. Thus, they are not used in established Finnish words, but they may occur in newer loanwords {{as well as in}} foreign proper names, and they are included in the Finnish alphabet in order to maintain interlingual compatibility. The pronunciation of these letters varies <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} diffeomorphisms of a manifold. <b>Quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{is known about}} the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle. Its Lie algebra is (more or less) the Witt algebra, whose central {{extension}} the Virasoro algebra (see Virasoro algebra from Witt algebra for a derivation of this fact) is the symmetry algebra of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Diffeomorphism groups of compact manifolds of larger dimension are regular Fréchet Lie groups; very little about their structure is known.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy on 13 April 2009, lead singer KG said of the split and any prospects of a reunion: [...] "Around 1998 and 1999 we did our last European shows. We were {{at the end of}} our deal with Sony and weren't really sure what we wanted to do. We decided to take a break and think things through. <b>Quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot's</b> happened in the past few months actually. We're in tentative talks about maybe putting MN8 back together and doing a tour. The thing about MN8 is that we never did the sort of music we should have done. We had the right aesthetic but the potential to do so much more. If you look at the commercial side of R&B these days, we would have fitted in better. We were kind of ahead of our time in some ways." ...|$|R
25|$|Though {{typical of}} epic, his {{vocabulary}} features some significant differences from Homer's. One scholar has counted 278 un-Homeric words in Works and Days, 151 in Theogony and 95 in Shield of Heracles. The {{disproportionate number of}} un-Homeric words in W & D is due to its un-Homeric subject matter. Hesiod's vocabulary also includes <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of formulaic phrases that are not found in Homer, which indicates {{that he may have}} been writing within a different tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Oto-Manguean {{languages}} {{have changed}} <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{from the very}} spartan phoneme inventory of Proto-Oto-Manguean. Many languages have rich inventories of both vowels and consonants. Many have a full series of fricatives, and some branches (particularly Zapotecan and Chinantecan) distinguish voicing in both stops and fricatives. The voiced series of the Oto-Pamean languages have both fricative and stop allophones. Otomian also have full series of front, central and back vowels. Some analyses of Mixtecan include a series of voiced prenasalised stops and affricates; these can also be analysed as consonant sequences {{but it would be}} the only consonant clusters known in the languages.|$|E
25|$|The coat is medium {{length and}} can be straight, wavy, or curly. There is {{frequently}} feathering on the legs and tail, {{as well as on}} the ear. As a working dog, the coat should be easy to keep, requiring very little grooming. Dirt tends to just fall away. English shepherds tend to shed <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> and fur may be found on and under furniture, clothes, and carpeting. The primary coat colors are: sable and white (clear and shaded), tricolor, black and white, and black and tan. Other variations such as solid dogs of any color, piebalds, and red nosed tricolors and sables also exist but are not common.|$|E
25|$|Jamaican {{iced tea}} {{is a popular}} herbal tea made of the flowers and leaves of the Jamaican {{hibiscus}} plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa), known as flor de Jamaica in Mexico. It is served cold and <b>quite</b> sweet with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ice. The ruby-red beverage is called hibiscus tea in English-speaking countries and called agua de Jamaica (water of Jamaica) in Spanish.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{was really}} {{enthusiastic}} over {{the plan and}} not only approved his granddaughter's proposition to give her surplus jewelry but went over the house with her and selected <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> imposing <b>lot</b> of odds and ends which were not in use and could readily be spared. Eager to assist the girls, the old colonel next morning went to town and ordered a big sign painted, to be placed over the store entrance, and he also induced {{the editors of the}} two newspapers to give the Liberty Girls' latest venture publicity in their columns, inviting the cooperation of the public.|$|R

25|$|Another most {{important}} {{property of the}} heterostyly system is physiological. If thrum pollen is placed on a thrum stigma, or pin pollen on a pin stigma, the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set. Effectively, this ensures out-crossing, as described by Darwin. <b>Quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> is now known about the underlying genetics; the system is controlled {{by a set of}} closely linked genes which act as a single unit, a super-gene. All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there are <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
50|$|I {{knew that}} there was a whole {{dimension}} of me that I had never had an opportunity to express: emotions or feelings, or maybe instincts. I also felt <b>quite</b> inhibited <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the time, though I was reasonably good at hiding my shyness. It was as though the 'full me' wanted to break out, and I knew this 'me' was never going to emerge through talking. So when I heard of his Wolfsohn's approach to singing, it immediately appealed to me, and though I only went {{for a short period of}} time, it helped enormously. It gave me confidence in other areas of my life.|$|R

25|$|Despite the tribulations {{created by}} the Second World War, Richmond was able to {{maintain}} a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence {{in his role as}} playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action {{a few weeks before the}} match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.|$|E
25|$|Earth: The earth {{signs are}} Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn. A native with mainly earth signs will be {{practical}} and cautious, sensible and capable {{and will be}} happier with concrete things than abstract ideas. They move slowly and carry out their work in a thorough and unhurried manner. Earth subjects are shrewd and careful and need emotional and material security, and will put up with <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to get it. They are generous to those they love, but are otherwise careful not to waste time or money, though {{there can be a}} tendency towards meanness. Earth subjects tend to be shy in social situations, and to be slow to commit in love relationships, but are serious when they do. A subject lacking earth signs will lack common sense and practicality and find it difficult to finish anything they start. They may be scatty, unrealistic and clumsy, hopeless with money and unreliable. Planets in the 2nd, 6th and 10th houses and an emphasis on fixed signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Pilot whale hunt is an {{integral}} part of Faroese social culture. As the attenders of a grindadráp usually are men, women do usually not actively take part in it, but are bystanders or onlookers. This is part of the traditional division of labor concerning pilot whaling which is centuries old, and has only changed little over time, though the method has changed <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot,</b> considering that the boats nowadays have engines and most of the original weapons used to slaughter the whales are now forbidden. It is not allowed to hurt the whales in any way, and the killing must be done as fast as possible and can according to the new grind law only be done by using a new kind of weapon which in Faroese is called mønustingari. Another tool which is allowed and must be used is a round hook, which is put into the blow hole of the whale in order to drag the whale ashore. The whale must be ashore or at least be stuck on the seabed before it can be put down.|$|E
5000|$|According to Steve Pooch, deputy {{general manager}} of the State Fair, [...] "..Once she {{attained}} her level of expertise, there wasn't anybody that could compete. ... <b>Quite</b> frankly, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people didn't want to compete against her." [...] As a result she retired from the State Fair competition in 1983 [...] "to let others have a chance at winning ribbons". She continued {{to be part of the}} show, though with [...] "at least 50 of seed art pictures" [...] displayed in the Fair's Horticulture Building and was hired by the fair to do live demonstrations of crop art techniques for fairgoers. She died of congestive heart failure at her home in Owatonna, MN.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk of it!" [...] said Dr. May hastily; [...] "this is no {{time for}} such things. After all, I am glad that the funeral is not here--Flora and Meta might be rather {{overwhelmed}} with these three incongruous sets of relations. By their letters, those Riverses must be <b>quite</b> as queer <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> as George's relations. After all, if we have nothing else, Ethel, we have the best of it, in regard to such relations as we have." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding the albums composition, Faulkner stated, in 2009, {{that the}} album was [...] "{{actually}} <b>quite</b> rushed in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ways. Dream Catch Me was actually released before we finished the album, {{so we had to}} move really fast to complete Hand Built By Robots. The album wasnt the culmination of ten years worth of writing, but was a few months of panic, and a couple of things I had lying around - a couple of older songs that were still good enough to be used. ... <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of Hand Built By Robots songs were written {{in the last few months}} leading up to recording, as I became better at writing." ...|$|R
