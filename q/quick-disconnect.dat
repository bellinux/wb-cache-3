2500|$|Insulin {{pumps are}} drug {{delivery}} devices {{used to treat}} patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The Minimed Paradigm REAL-Time and Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system, which received FDA clearance in 2006, uses tubing and a reservoir with rapid-acting insulin. This [...] "infusion set" [...] is patient-connected via a catheter to the abdomen region. The infusion set can remain in the place for 3 days while the pump is clip-belt worn. There is a <b>quick-disconnect</b> feature for the tubing. The pump delivers insulin in two modes. In Basal rate mode, the delivery is continuous in small doses similar to a pancreas, for example 0.15 units per hour throughout the day. Basal rates are set to meet individual metabolic rates. In Bolus mode, the delivery is programmed to be a one-time delivery prior to eating or after an unexpected high, for example 18 units spread out to several hours. This type of continuous treatment {{is in contrast to}} traditional multiple daily injections (MDI) that use slower-acting insulin. Continuous treatment reduces glucose variability.|$|E

40|$|Astronaut cooling during extravehicular {{activity}} {{is a critical}} design issue in developing a portable life support system that meets the requirements of a space station mission. Some of the requirements are that the cooling device can be easily regenerable and nonventing during operation. In response to this, a direct-interface, fusible heat sink prototype with freezable <b>quick-disconnects</b> was developed. A proof-of-concept prototype was constructed and tested that consists of an elastic container filled with normal tap water and having two <b>quick-disconnects</b> embedded in a wall. These <b>quick-disconnects</b> are designed {{so that they may}} be frozen with the ice and yet still be joined to the cooling system, allowing an immediate flow path. The inherent difficulties in a direct-interface heat sink have been overcome, i. e., (1) establishing an initial flow path; (2) avoiding low-flow freeze-up; and (3) achieving adequate heat-transfer rates {{at the end of the}} melting process. The requirements, design, fabrication, and testing are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Designers {{strove to}} ease the maintainer's job, {{equipping}} most cables, hoses, and mechanical systems with <b>quick-disconnecting</b> mechanisms. The engine and transmission can be removed and reinstalled in approximately two hours, allowing repairs to the turbocharger and many other components to be done outside the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In computing, an {{electrical}} connector {{can also be}} known as a physical interface (compare physical layer in OSI model of networking). Cable glands, known as cable connectors in the US, connect wires to devices mechanically rather th{{an electrical}}ly and are distinct from <b>quick-disconnects</b> performing the latter.|$|R

25|$|Planned {{operations}} on the ISS were interrupted {{through a series}} of EVAs to address the cooling system issue. A first EVA on 7 August 2010, to replace the failed pump module, was not fully completed because of an ammonia leak in one of four <b>quick-disconnects.</b> A second EVA on 11 August successfully removed the failed pump module. A third EVA was required to restore Loop A to normal functionality.|$|R
5000|$|Many designs have {{combined}} {{the advantages of}} a light truss tube and a collapsible design. Collapsible [...] "truss tube" [...] Dobsonians appeared in the amateur telescope making community as early as 1982 and allow the optical tube assembly, the largest component, to be broken down. As the name implies, the [...] "tube" [...] of this design is actually composed of an upper 'cage assembly', which contains the secondary mirror, and focuser, {{held in place by}} several rigid poles over a ‘mirror box’ which contains the objective mirror. The poles are held in place by <b>quick-disconnecting</b> clamps which allow the entire telescope to be easily broken down into its smaller components, facilitating their transport by vehicle or other means to an observing site. These truss tube designs are sometimes incorrectly called a Serrurier truss, but since the main truss is not built with an opposing mirror cell truss it only performs one function of that design, i.e. keeping the optics parallel.|$|R
40|$|Electric wrist {{rotation}} {{has been}} available with electric hands for approximately 20 years. Although it is integrated with the Otto Bock electric hand, via their <b>quick-disconnected</b> wrist component, the electric wrist {{has been used in}} only a fraction of electric prostheses because of four perceived problems: 1) the additional length required in he forearm, which could eliminate mid-to-long transradial amputees as candidates, 2) the additional weight of the component, although only about 100 gm, 3) the speculation of most prescribing MD's and prosthetists that the function of electric writs rotation is unnecessary and unused by amputees, and 4) the difficulty of using the tiaditional wrist control methods. The introduction in 1989 of a proportional controller, which allows a simple switching method using muscles cocontraction, possibly makes an impact on problems # 3 and # 4 above. The control method is speculated to be easier to learn and to use, and also allows proportional control of the wrist rotation Powered by a 9 volt battery, or 12 volt in above-elbow applications, greater speed of wrists rotation is also provided. The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the actual usage of electiic wrist by the wearers of proportional systems, and to document the functions in which electric wrist rotation has proved valuable, if any. Also, the stuvey hopes to provide indications of the present drawbacks which remain, and provide direction for future improvements. The results to-date of the survey will be presented, and any conclusions which are warranted by the data. Future developments which could impact upon electric prosthesis usage will also be discussed.

50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / <b>quick-disconnect</b> / spade-foot type terminals, wire splices, or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for splicing wires in-line is called a butt splice connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special crimping pliers. A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum is {{delivered}} to the work-pieces by manifolds and individual tubes fitted with quick-disconnects on the interior walls. The simplest vacuum system consists of a pump and gauge {{on the outside and}} a single <b>quick-disconnect</b> port on the inside. In more elaborate arrangements, there may be a dozen or more individual vacuum supply lines going into the machine, each to a separate QD port, with as many gauge lines coming back out to vacuum sensors wired to the control system, and an inert gas backfill under controlled pressure for when the pump is shut off and the vacuum lines vented during the cure cycle.|$|E
50|$|Some audio {{multicore}} cables are {{fitted with}} hermaphroditic multipin <b>quick-disconnect</b> connectors {{for ease of}} use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets. The advantage to the user {{is that it does}} not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.|$|E

The wings are strut-braced with a single spar and are made from fibreglass and foam with a 15.5% CAGI.R3 airfoil. The wing has a span of 31 [...]5 feet and an area of 127.4 sq ft, which gives it a wing loading of 9.5 lbs/sq ft at gross weight. The aircraft has removable wings, with single locking pins and <b>quick-disconnect</b> controls which can be easily hooked up and inspected from inside the cockpit.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A two-phase flow experiment package was used to collect pressure drop data for corrugated flexible tubes and <b>quick-disconnect</b> attachments. Single-phase pressure drop measurements were taken on the ground and two-phase reduced gravity measurements were obtained on the NASAKC- 135. The purpose of this work was to evaluate pressure drop information from the corrugated tubes and <b>quick-disconnect</b> component and develop correlations and prediction methods for two-phase pressure drops in reduced gravity. Results show it is possible to predict pressure drops through the corrugated tubes using the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model and single-phase, groundbased pressure drop measurements. It was also found that a good prediction of pressure drop through the <b>quick-disconnect</b> attachment could be obtained using the Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (with single-phase ground-based measurements) coupled with an orifice pressure drop model by Chisholm. The use of single-phase, ground-based experiments to predict two-phase, reduced gravity component performance could yield significant savings and increased reliability of reduced gravity fluid systems...|$|E
