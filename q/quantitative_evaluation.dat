2500|$|In 2016, utility scale solar contributed 36.76 TWh to the grid, with 33.367 TWh from {{photovoltaics}} and 3.39 TWh from thermal systems. In 2014, 2015, and 2016, EIA {{estimated that}} distributed solar generated 11.233 TWh, 14.139 TWh and 19.467 TWh respectively. While utility-grade systems have well documented generation, distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled. Therefore, <b>quantitative</b> <b>evaluation</b> of distributed solar {{to the overall}} US electric power sector has been lacking. Recently, the Energy Information Administration has begun estimating that contribution. Before 2008, most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems, however by 2011 photovoltaics had overtaken thermal.|$|E
2500|$|... {{also gave}} a careful analysis, {{including}} {{an application of}} Maxwell's law of the particle velocities in a gas. He distinguished between a gravitational and a luminiferous aether. This separation of those two mediums was necessary, because according to his calculations {{the absence of any}} drag effect in the orbit of Neptune implies a lower limit for the particle velocity of 5 · 1019 cm/s. He (like Leray) argued that the absorbed energy is converted into heat, which might be transferred into the luminiferous aether and/or is used by the stars to maintain their energy output. However, these qualitative suggestions were unsupported by any <b>quantitative</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the amount of heat actually produced.|$|E

40|$|Distributed Constraint Optimization (DCOP) {{is rapidly}} {{emerging}} as a prominent technique for multiagent coordination. However, despite agent privacy being a key motivation for applying DCOPs in many applications, rigorous <b>quantitative</b> <b>evaluations</b> of privacy loss in DCOP algorithms have been lacking. Recently, [Maheswaran et al. 2005] introduced a framework for <b>quantitative</b> <b>evaluations</b> of privacy in DCOP algorithms, showing that some DCOP algorithms lose more privacy than purely centralized approaches and questioning the motivation for applying DCOPs. This paper addresses {{the question of whether}} state-of-the art DCOP algorithms suffer from a similar shortcoming by investigating several of the most efficient DCOP algorithms, including both DPOP and ADOPT. Furthermore, while previous work investigated the impact on efficiency of distributed contraint reasoning design decisions (e. g. constraint-graph topology, asynchrony, message-contents), this paper examines the privacy aspect of such decisions, providing an improved understanding of privacy-efficiency tradeoffs...|$|R

Biomechanics of socket-residual limb interface, especially the pressure and force distribution, have effect on patient satisfaction and function. This paper aimed to review and evaluate studies conducted in the last decades on the design of socket, in-socket interface pressure measurement, and socket biomechanics. Literature was searched to find related keywords with transtibial amputation, socket-residual limb interface, socket measurement, socket design, modeling, computational modeling, and suspension system. In accordance with the selection criteria, 19 articles were selected for further analysis. It was revealed that pressure and stress have been studied in the last decaeds, but <b>quantitative</b> <b>evaluations</b> remain inapplicable in clinical settings. This study also illustrates prevailing systems, which may facilitate improvements in socket design for improved quality of life for individuals ambulating with transtibial prosthesis.
