25|$|Excavations were {{undertaken}} {{to establish the}} Memorial from July 1995 to November 1998; these are considered the most important urban archaeological investigations in Vienna. Uncovered on {{the eastern half of}} the square were <b>quarrystone</b> walls, a well and cellars of a whole block from the time of a medieval synagogue. Controversy arose over the placing of the memorial over the archaeological excavations, which resulted in moving the memorial one meter from its original position on the site. The complete reorganization of the square and its transformation to a pedestrian plaza were completed in the autumn of 2000 with the inauguration of the Holocaust memorial.|$|E
25|$|Another church closely {{resembling}} the Church of the Transfiguration is the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Kozhevniki. It {{was constructed in}} 1406, and the primary difference is in building material. The detail {{is focused on the}} west and south facades. New ornamental motifs in the brick appear at this time. Brick was also used for the pilasters which delineate the façade. It was originally plastered, but underwent restoration after it was damaged during World War II. Its apse points towards the river, which provides a welcome sight for ships approaching from the Baltic. The shingled roof resembles the bochka roofs popular at the time. The walls were built from local <b>quarrystone,</b> which contrasted with the red bricks. The ground plan of the church is almost square with four pillars, one apse and one dome.|$|E

5000|$|In old documents, the Dalberger Turm is {{described}} as the [...] "Wasserhaus" [...] (“Waterhouse”), {{because there was a}} moat around the tower, fed by the nearby village dyke.

50|$|Anyone seeing Saint Remaclus's in the {{outlying}} centre of Cond {{for the first}} time might be surprised at how recently it was built (1964-1967). The plain, clear and also mighty shape, the slate <b>quarrystones</b> used in its building that are so typical of local construction and the way the church fits so well among its neighbours {{at the foot of the}} steep vineyards would lead many visitors to believe that its building date must lie quite far back in history.|$|R
50|$|Bundenbach {{is known}} internationally for its slate mining and {{important}} fossil finds. The use of slate in the Bundenbach area has a demonstrably long history: the Celtic hill castle’s defensive wall was built of slate <b>quarrystones.</b> The first slate mining lease agreement is witnessed on Saint Walpurga’s Day 1519: The Lords of Wiltberg leased their “Laienkaul unden an Prorschitt uff der Bach gelegen” (“Laienkaul down below at Bruschied, {{lying on the}} brook”) for four years to, among others, the two Bundenbach residents Peter and Niklas Huppen.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, crudely worked slate <b>quarrystones</b> {{were used as}} a {{building}} material. Given {{the low level of}} processing that this stone required, it was mined in pits on the surface rather than underground, despite the problematic geological structure of Hunsrück slate. In 1824, when the Oldenburg government issued a ban on thatches, there was suddenly a great demand for a roofing material that did not burn. The thin sheets of slate used for this could only be mined underground because of the difficulty of processing the stone.|$|R

50|$|On 13 August 1938, in {{the time}} of the Third Reich, the first {{building}} firms came. On the heights, 11 Siegfried Line bunkers were built. On both sides of Oberdorfstraße, buildings went up: two buildings to lodge non-commissioned officers, and a Flakhalle - literally “anti-aircraft hall” - with personnel rooms. As part of these measures, a new drainage ditch reinforced with <b>quarrystones</b> was built along the road, and the road itself was also fortified. Dickesbach thus became a community {{on the edge of the}} newly laid out Baumholder troop drilling ground. In 1939, the municipality had 256 inhabitants.|$|R
