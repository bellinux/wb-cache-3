50|$|<b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> is a {{mechanical}} {{process in which}} steel and cast iron alloys are strengthened and hardened. These metals consist of ferrous metals and alloys. This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or through-hardening varying on {{the rate at which}} the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> process. Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks.|$|E
50|$|Typically, large ovens {{are used}} for the {{annealing}} process. The inside of the oven {{is large enough to}} place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired conveyor furnaces are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are removed from the oven. Once removed from the oven, the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as <b>quench</b> <b>hardening.</b> Typical methods of <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of brine (salt water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water air bubbles form {{on the surface of the}} object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of air bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. <b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys.|$|E

5000|$|Polybius (2.33) {{reports that}} the Gauls at the Battle of Telamon (224 BC) had {{inferior}} iron swords which bent at the first stroke {{and had to be}} straightened with the foot against the ground. Plutarch, in his life of Marcus Furius Camillus, likewise reports on the inferiority of Gaulish iron, making the same claim that their swords bent easily. These reports have puzzled some historians, since by that time the Celts had a centuries long tradition of iron workmanship. In 1906 a scholar suggested that the Greek observers misunderstood ritual acts of sword-bending, which may have served to [...] "decommission" [...] the weapon. Such bent swords have been found among deposits of objects presumably dedicated for sacred purposes. The speculation has been repeated since. Radomir Pleiner, however, argues that [...] "the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point. To judge from the swords examined in this survey, only one third could be described as conforming to the quality which he ascribed generally to Celtic swords. Even so, {{it is quite possible that}} even some of the better quality swords would have failed in battle." [...] Nevertheless, he argues that the classical sources are exaggerated. Plutarch's claim that Celtic swords would bend completely back is implausible, as only a slight bending would be likely. Pleiner also notes that metallurgical analysis performed on Celtic swords suggests that they were only work hardened and only very few were quench hardened, even though they frequently contain enough carbon to be hardened (in particular the swords made from Noric steel). <b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> takes the full advantage of the potential hardness of the steel, but leaves it brittle, prone to breaking. Quite probably this is because tempering wasn't known. Tempering is heating the steel at a lower temperature after quenching to remove the brittleness, while keeping most of the hardness.|$|E

50|$|As one of {{the last}} {{processes}} in fabricating a sword is quenching and tempering it. <b>Quenching</b> <b>hardens</b> the metal so it holds an edge longer but this also makes it very brittle. To restore some ductility and durability the sword is tempered.

25|$|There {{are other}} {{variations}} of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed {{after it has}} solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die.

50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is <b>quenched,</b> <b>hardening</b> only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the lower hardness. The knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially <b>quenched,</b> flame <b>hardening</b> creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.|$|R
40|$|<b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{the process}} of {{strengthening}} and hardening ferrous metals and alloys by heating the material to a specific temperature to form austenite (austenitization), followed by rapid cooling (quenching) in water, brine or oil to introduce a hardened phase called martensite. The material is then often tempered to increase toughness, as it may decrease from the <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> process. The austenitization process is highly energy-intensive and many of the industrial austenitization furnaces were built and equipped prior to the advent of advanced control strategies and thus use large, sub-optimal amounts of energy. The model computes the energy usage of the furnace and the part temperature profile as a function of time and position within the furnace under temperature feedback control. In this paper, the aforementioned model is used to simulate the furnace for a batch of forty parts under heuristic temperature set points suggested by the operators of the plant. A model predictive control (MPC) system is then developed and deployed to control the the part temperature at the furnace exit thereby preventing the parts from overheating.

On the other hand, the saturation of austenite impacts its transformation in the ausferritizing process of a metal matrix and forming of microstructure. Ductile cast iron with the ferrite matrix was hardened with isothermal transformation {{in the range of}} ausferritizing in temperature tpi = 400 i 300 0 C and the range of time τpi = 7, 5 �� 240 min. Specimens were gradually austenitized. They were soaked in the nominal temperature tγ = 950 0 C, then precooled to the temperature tγ’ = 850 and 800 0 C. Microstructure was investigated, there were also defined the proportion of austenite in the matrix of the cast iron and the content of carbon in it and hardness and impact strength in unnotched specimens. It was stated, that the precooling temperature deciding on the content of carbon in austenite influences kinetics of the ausferritic transformation, the content of carbon in the γ phase and impact strength and, in a less degree, hardness. As a result of gradual austenitizing the cast iron after <b>quench</b> <b>hardening,</b> in some conditions of treatment, reached mechanical properties corresponding, according to the ASTM A 897 standard, with high grades of ADI.

5000|$|Induction {{hardening}} is {{a surface}} hardening technique which uses induction coils {{to provide a}} very rapid means of heating the metal.

In this study, the collision of drops of an aqueous solution of polymer with a hot sapphire solid surface was investigated using strobe photography. A solution of 10 wt% polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene glycol, with an average molecular weight of approximately 20, 000, {{was used as the}} test polymer quenchant.

30|$|During <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> process, {{the surface}} heat {{transfer}} conditions between the steel part and the quenchant {{are the most}} important factors controlling the microstructural evolution, generation of stresses and distortion [1]. Kobasko showed that very fast and uniform part cooling within the martensitic range actually reduces the probability of part cracking and distortion, while improving the surface hardness and durability of steel parts [123]. The enhanced CHF of the nanofluids during pool boiling revealed that nanofluids may be suitable for cooling at high heat flux applications [124]. According to Kim et al. the use of nanofluids can afford a significant acceleration of quenching by means of premature destabilization of film boiling due to nanoparticle deposition [125]. The quenching of 304 stainless steel probe into different concentration of nanofluids yielded varying peak heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and Grossmann severity of quenching [126]. Jagannath and Prabhu measured the interfacial peak HTC of water was 1280 W/m 2 K and the peak HTC decreased from 1400 to 965 W/m 2 K with increases in Al 2 O 3 nanoparticle concentration from 0.01 to 4 wt% when copper is quenched [103]. Similarly Babu and Kumar observed that the peak heat flux during quenching in CNT nanofluids increases with an increase in the CNT concentration until 0.50 wt.% and starts decreasing with further increase in the CNT concentration [105]. These results suggest that for the same base fluid there is an optimum level of nanoparticle concentration to enhance/decrease the heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids. The enhancement and deterioration of pool boiling heat transfer of nanofluids could be utilized in quenching heat treatment in two ways either to promote or decrease the rate of heat transfer depending upon the section thickness of the part to be heat treated and the desired microstructure. Hence {{there is a need for}} development of nanofluids having (i) high quench severity for enhancement of heat transfer for thick sections with low quench sensitivity and (ii) low cooling severity for thin sections with high quench sensitivity [127].|$|E

As a result of cross-sectional morphology, the martensitic structure was clearly observed on the surface region of each solid-carburized S 15 C sample after <b>quenching.</b> <b>Hardened</b> layer depth of most samples solid-carburized with various carbonized organics were comparable to the sample treated with commercial solid-carburizing powder, or more. These results indicate that the carbonate in solid-carburizing compounds acts as energizer for solid-carburizing process and carbonized organics and milled egg shell powder can also be used as compounds and energizer for solid-carburizing process, respectively. 本文はJ-STAGEにリンクしていま...|$|R
50|$|Differential {{tempering}} (also called graded tempering, selective tempering {{or local}} tempering) is the inverse of differential hardening, to ultimately produce similar results. Differential tempering begins by taking steel {{that has been}} uniformly <b>quenched</b> and <b>hardened,</b> and then heating it in localized areas to reduce the hardness. The process is often used in blacksmithing for tempering cutting instruments, softening the back, shaft, or spine, but simultaneously tempering the edge to a very high hardness. The process was very common in ancient Europe, for making tools, but soon was applied to knives and swords as well.|$|R
