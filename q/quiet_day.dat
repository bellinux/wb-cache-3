5|$|The Browns won the AAFC's Western Division {{with their}} perfect record {{and faced the}} Buffalo Bills, {{the winners of the}} Eastern Division, in the AAFC {{championship}} game. The Bills had tied with the Colts for the lead in the Eastern, forcing a playoff that the Buffalo won on December 12 in Baltimore. The championship game took place in Cleveland in 35-degree weather and was sparsely attended. The Browns were expected to win the game, having beaten the Bills twice in the regular season and possessing a significantly better record than the 7–7 Bills. The scoring began with a late-first-quarter Edgar Jones touchdown run, followed by a fumble return for a touchdown by George Young in the second period that put the Browns ahead 14–0 at halftime. Cleveland scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter on runs by Jones and Motley before Buffalo scored its first points. Aided by a roughing the kicker penalty on the Browns, the Bills capped an 80-yard drive with a short touchdown pass from Jim Still to Al Baldwin. Motley scored two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, however, and Lou Saban ran back an interception for a third to make the final score 49–7. Motley and Edgar Jones led the Browns offense in the game, accounting for a large share of the team's offensive production. Graham had an uncharacteristically <b>quiet</b> <b>day,</b> passing for just 118 yards on 11 completions. The victory made the Browns the first professional team to win three league championships in a row, following AAFC titles they won in 1946 and 1947. It was also the first time a professional football team finished a full season unbeaten and untied since a championship game was instituted in the NFL in 1933. The Chicago Bears had finished with perfect records in 1934 and 1942, but lost the NFL championship both times. The Browns had won 18 consecutive games stretching to the 1947 season, a professional record that stood until 2004.|$|E
25|$|The World at One, a lunchtime news programme, {{began on}} 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, {{and the year}} before News Review had started on television. News Review was {{a summary of the}} week's news, first {{broadcast}} on Sunday, 26 April 1964 on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings–the difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition ("super") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a <b>quiet</b> <b>day</b> for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981).|$|E
500|$|Yogo City {{was briefly}} known as Hoover City, after Jake Hoover. Hoover {{was part of}} a {{partnership}} that had been placer mining for gold and is credited as the discoverer of Yogo Sapphires. For several years, he also owned a ranch in nearby Pig-Eye Basin. He later prospected for gold in Alaska and was a deep-sea fishing guide in Seattle before eventually returning to the Judith Basin. [...] Western painter C.M. Russell arrived in the area in 1880 as a young cowhand and was hired by Hoover. Russell stated that he learned most of his frontier skills from Hoover, and the two men remained lifelong friends. Millie Ringold, a former slave born in 1845, settled in Fort Benton, Montana after having worked as a nurse and servant for an army general. When gold was discovered at Yogo Creek, Ringold sold her boarding house in Fort Benton and left for the Yogo gold fields, setting up a hotel, restaurant, and saloon in Yogo City where she sang and played music. Ringold later cooked for the English mine, but also worked her own gold claims, even after gold mining was on the decline. She was known as a superb cook and ultimately died in Yogo City in 1906, the last resident of the community. [...] The nearby town of Utica was featured in Russell's 1907 painting A <b>Quiet</b> <b>Day</b> In Utica, which was originally known as Tinning a Dog. Hoover, Ringold, store owner Charles Lehman, and Russell himself are all depicted in the painting, placed between the hitching post and door of the general store.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the aa index series {{presented in this paper}} clearly shows that during the last century (1900 to 2000) the number of <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> (Aa&lt; 20 nT) drastically diminished from a mean annual value greater than 270 days per year {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century to a mean value of 160 <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> per year one hundred years later. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease of the number of very <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> (Aa&lt; 13 nT). We show that the so-evidenced decrease in the number of <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> cannot be accounted for by drift in the aa baseline resulting in a systematic underestimation of aa during the first quarter of the century: a 2 – 3 nT overestimation in the aa increase during the 20 th century would lead to a 20 – 40 % overestimation in the decrease of the number of <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> during the same period. The <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> and very <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> correspond to periods during which the Earth encounters slow solar wind streams flowing in the heliosheet during the period where the solar magnetic field has a dipolar geometry. Therefore, the observed change in the number of <b>quiet</b> <b>days</b> is the signature of a long term evolution of the solar coronal field topology.
