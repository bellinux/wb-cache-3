Visitors can see American and Chilean flamingos and other waterfowl just outside the Primate Panorama exhibit. Denver Zoo’s Pioneer Train is the first natural gas-powered zoo train in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The first {{passenger}} train of the New Haven Railroad steamed into town on New Year’s Day, 1849, {{and within a}} few decades rail service was suitable for daily travel. As a result, many of the former vacationers began planting roots in the community - the wealthy building summer estates, the middle-class families purchasing homes in developing residential parks. The train also brought new immigrants to town – the New Rochelle station was the first stop on the New Haven line and a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> from the ferry dock off Ellis Island. By 1865, 30% of the town's population was foreign-born. Of New Rochelle's 3,968 residents, 800 were Irish and 200 were German.|$|E

50|$|In 1902, the Moe Brothers sold Dauntless to L.B. Hastings and Captain Mann, of Port Townsend. They put Dauntless on the Port Townsend-Irondale run. A {{steel mill}} at Irondale caused that town to boom, and Dauntless, {{still capable of}} 11-knot speed, made <b>quick</b> <b>trips</b> on this route.|$|R
50|$|The 1960s saw {{an influx}} and {{expansion}} of local businesses. A shopping center was built, which combined the hardware, drug store, grocery, barber shop, plus the local doctor and dentist in one building. By 1965, Interstate 90 was open, allowing a <b>quicker</b> <b>trip</b> into Cleveland, Ohio.|$|R
25|$|Southwest Airlines, {{founded in}} 1971 and {{headquartered}} at Love Field, built its business on selling quick, no-frills trips between Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The company {{felt that the}} notion of a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> would be destroyed by a long drive to the new airport. Prior to the opening of DFW, Southwest Airlines sued for the right to remain at Love Field. In 1973 the courts ruled that the City of Dallas could not restrict Southwest Airlines from operating out of Love Field, so long as it remained open as an airport. This ruling effectively granted Southwest the right to continue to operate its existing intrastate service out of Love Field. The airlines operating from Love Field at the time DFW was conceived executed agreements with DFW stipulating that no airline could operate at the new airport if it continued to operate any flights out of Love Field. Southwest, created after the other carriers had signed on to the DFW operating agreements, was not a signatory and remained as the only airline operating at Love Field.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later he formed part of a politico-commercial {{expedition}} to Constantinople to establish business relations with Turkey, Poland, and Russia. After a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to Cuba in 1787, he was chosen by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra {{to go to the}} Pacific Coast of Mexico and the naval base of San Blas, the headquarters for the exploration of the Pacific Northwest. He was a Frigate Lieutenant (Teniente de Fragata) at the time. Alongside went his brother-in-law, Francisco de Eliza, who would distinguish himself as Governor of Fort San Miguel on Vancouver Island's Nootka Sound. On their ship to Mexico was the recently named Viceroy of New Spain, Don Juan Vicente de Güemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo. On February 3, 1790, Caamaño took part on an expedition to the Pacific Northwest. He was commanding the Nuestra Señora del Rosario (also known as the La Princesa), a 189-ton frigate built in San Blas for the exploration of the North. He did not go beyond Nootka on this voyage, but on his next one, in 1792, came as far as Bucareli Bay commanding the frigate Aránzazu, a corvette built at Cavite in the Philippines. By this time he had been promoted to Ship Lieutenant (Teniente de Navío). This expedition did a thorough study of the coast from Bucareli to Nootka, marking the map of Alaska and British Columbia with many names which are there today. Sailing from Nootka on June 13, 1792, Caamaño explored Bucareli Bay, off Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, and anchored in Dixon Entrance on July 20. Then he explored southward, passing through Principe Channel, Nepean Sound, Whale Sound, near the Estevan Group archipelago, then into Caamaño Sound and south through Laredo Channel, between Aristazabal Island and Princess Royal Island, returning to Nootka on September 7, 1792. He named Principe Channel, Laredo Channel, Campania Island, Campania Sound, Aristazabal Island, and Gil Island. George Vancouver adopted these names for his chart.|$|E
500|$|On 2 May 1910 Massachusetts {{was placed}} in reduced {{commission}} so she {{could be used for}} the annual Naval Academy midshipmen summer cruise. Despite her modernizations the battleship was now regarded as [...] "obsolete and worthless, even for the second line of defense" [...] by Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer. She saw little use other than summer cruises and was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet when it was formed in 1912. After a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to New York for a Presidential Fleet Review in October 1912, the warship returned to Philadelphia and stayed there until she was decommissioned on 23 May 1914.|$|E

In 1872 the Far West made the <b>quickest</b> <b>trip</b> on record from Sioux City, Iowa, to Fort Benton, Montana - seventeen days, twenty hours - with Mark Coulson as master.|$|R
5000|$|A sizable {{amount of}} the station's {{ridership}} comes from across the Connecticut state line given the <b>quicker</b> <b>trips,</b> shorter headways, and (outside peak hours) lack of a mid-trip transfer to Grand Central as opposed to taking the Danbury Branch of the New Haven Line. Because of this, Housatonic Area Regional Transit (the Danbury-area mass transit provider) has a route and a shuttle connecting Danbury to Brewster station.|$|R
50|$|Some {{cities have}} {{introduced}} {{bus rapid transit}} services or limited stop lines on long, overcrowded routes. This {{involves the use of}} part of the route's budget to operate another line on the same route that stops only at key points. While the overall frequency of the original route is reduced, riders traveling over a longer distance have the option of obtaining a <b>quicker</b> <b>trip</b> on the limited-stop line.|$|R
500|$|A {{few months}} later, in December 1925, Hemingway {{and his wife}} spent the winter in Schruns, Austria, where he began {{revising}} the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January, and—against Richardson's advice—urged him to sign a contract with Scribner's. Hemingway left Austria for a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to New York {{to meet with the}} publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pauline. He returned to Schruns to finish the revisions in March. In June, he was in Pamplona with both Richardson and Pfeiffer. On their return to Paris, Richardson asked for a separation, and left for the south of France. In August, alone in Paris, Hemingway completed the proofs, dedicating the novel to his wife and son. [...] After the publication of the book in October, Richardson asked for a divorce; Hemingway subsequently gave her the book's royalties.|$|E
500|$|With {{his wife}} Hadley, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, {{where he became}} fascinated by bullfighting. It is {{at this time that}} he began to be {{referred}} to as [...] "Papa." [...] The Hemingways returned to Pamplona in 1924 and a third time in June 1925; that year they brought with them a group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb. A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (July 21), he began to write the draft of what would become The Sun Also Rises, finishing eight weeks later. [...] A few months later, in December 1925, the Hemingways left to spend the winter in Schruns, Austria, where Hemingway began revising the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January and against Hadley's advice, urged Hemingway to sign a contract with Scribner's. He left Austria for a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pfeiffer, before returning to Schruns to finish the revisions in March. [...] The manuscript arrived in New York in April; he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926, and Scribner's published the novel in October.|$|E

5000|$|In {{evaluating}} the prototype in 2004, pilot Bill McCleary said, [...] "the Barr 6 {{is not like}} a Beech Bonanza or Piper Lance, but rather a big utility airplane with a 4500 pound gross weight and large cabin. It is like flying a Cessna 210 with 400 hp, and has an excessive amount of power on takeoff, climb and cruise flight ranges. A Cessna 172 or Skylane is a much easier type to fly for <b>quick</b> <b>trips</b> and no requirement of a large cabin useful load or higher speed. The Barr 6 certainly stands by itself." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{living in}} Newport Beach, California on June 14, 1925, Kahanamoku rescued eight men from a fishing vessel that capsized in heavy surf while {{attempting}} to enter the city's harbor. 29 fishermen went {{into the water and}} 17 perished. Using his surfboard, he was able to make <b>quick</b> <b>trips</b> back and forth to shore {{to increase the number of}} sailors rescued. Two other surfers saved four more fishermen. Newport's police chief at the time called Duke's efforts [...] "the most superhuman surfboard rescue act the world has ever seen". It also caused U.S. lifeguards to begin using surfboards in their water rescues.|$|R
2500|$|Madame de Sévigné {{travelled}} {{three times}} to Provence (that is to say, Aix and Grignan) in order {{to spend time with}} her daughter and son-in-law: a 14-month stay beginning in 1672; another 14-month stay beginning in 1690 taken before a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to Brittany; and a third stay of 22 months leading right up to her death in 1696. [...] In other words, Madame de Sévigné spent only a little less than four years total in the part of France which occupied so much space in her heart and letters.|$|E
2500|$|He {{became a}} regular {{member of the}} royal council in 1530. In 1535 he set up the Chambre Ardente. In 1536 he was {{entrusted}} with an embassy to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

[...] He spent three days with the Emperor explaining the concessions which Francis I was prepared to make, but Charles was prepared for war, and rejected the French overtures. [...] After a <b>quick</b> <b>trip</b> to Rome to inform the Pope {{of the situation and}} to discover what the Pope's intentions were, Jean de Lorraine headed back north toward Bologna to try one last time to argue peace to the Emperor. [...] The Pope, who was trying to maintain neutrality, sent legates to both sovereigns on 29 April to argue for peace, but it was without effect.

25|$|Because the <b>quickest</b> <b>trip</b> to Beijing takes {{around six}} and a half hours despite the close {{distance}} of the cities, plans for high-speed rail has been discussed for years, and construction of a high-speed railway station began in 2008. The station was completed in 2011 and initially serviced only ordinary lines. In January 2015, CRH opened its first D-series (dongchezu) route in Inner Mongolia in the Baotou-Hohhot-Jining corridor, shortening travel time between Inner Mongolia's two largest cities a mere 50 minutes. This line reached a maximum speed of 200km/h between Hohhot and Baotou. Another high-speed rail linking Hohhot to Zhangjiakou and the planned Beijing-Zhangjiakou 200km/h railway is due for completion in 2017, and designed to operate at 250km/h.|$|R
