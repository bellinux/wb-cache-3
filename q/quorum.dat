40|$|Distributed {{consensus}} {{is integral to}} modern distributed systems. The widely adopted Paxos algorithm uses two phases, each requiring majority agreement, to reliably reach consensus. In this paper, we demonstrate that Paxos, which lies at the foundation of many production systems, is conservative. Specifically, we observe {{that each of the}} phases of Paxos may use non-intersecting <b>quorums.</b> Majority <b>quorums</b> are not necessary as intersection is required only across phases. Using this weakening of the requirements made in the original formulation, we propose Flexible Paxos, which generalizes over the Paxos algorithm to provide flexible <b>quorums.</b> We show that Flexible Paxos is safe, e cient and easy to utilize in existing distributed systems. We discuss far reaching implications of this result. For example, improved availability results from reducing the size of second phase <b>quorums</b> by one when the system size is even, while keeping majority <b>quorums</b> in the first phase. Another example is improved throughput of replication by using much smaller phase 2 <b>quorums,</b> while increasing the leader election (phase 1) <b>quorums.</b> Finally, non intersecting <b>quorums</b> in either first or second phases may enhance the efficiency of both...|$|R

However, due to the formidable difficulties of long-distance travel in 18th century America, they did not commence until several weeks later. Although the House of Representatives and the Senate convened on the prescribed date, both soon adjourned due to lack of a <b>quorum.</b> As a result, the presidential electoral votes could not be counted or certified. On April 1, the House convened with a <b>quorum</b> present for the first time, and the representatives began their work. The Senate first achieved a <b>quorum</b> on April 6.

Legislators quickly adjourned to Staunton and fled for their horses. Days later, they completed the session's business there. Breckinridge stayed at his mother's house between sessions, rejoining the legislature in Richmond in November 1781. Much of the session consisted of adopting resolutions of thanks for individuals who had made that city safe by defeating Cornwallis at Yorktown.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's <b>Quorum</b> of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the <b>Quorum</b> of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the <b>Quorum,</b> and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E
