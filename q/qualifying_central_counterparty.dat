40|$|Intraday margin is a {{generally}} accepted risk management tool of <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> to cover increased risk exposure during the day. <b>Central</b> <b>counterparties</b> may call for intraday margin {{on a routine}} basis, but also in case of extreme price volatility or large changes in positions of clearing members. An increase {{in the use of}} a routine intraday margin call can be seen at <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> in the EU. Three <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> have recently introduced a routine intraday margin call and two <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> intend to do so. This article explores the concept of intraday margin and its role within the risk management framework of the <b>central</b> <b>counterparty.</b> In addition, an overview is given of the benefits, cost and side effects of intraday margining to the <b>central</b> <b>counterparty,</b> its clearing members and the capital market in general. Finally, the article examines the practice of intraday margining of <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> in the EU and the differences in intraday margining policies.

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{has brought the}} problems of regulatory failure and unbridled counterparty risk to the forefront in financial discussions. In the last decade, <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> have been created in order to face those insidious problems. In Mexico, both the stock and the derivatives markets have <b>central</b> <b>counterparties,</b> but the money market has not. This paper addresses the issue of creating a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> for the Mexican money market. Recommendations that must be followed {{in the design and}} the management of risk of a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty,</b> given by international regulatory institutions, are presented in this study. Also, two different conceptual designs for a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty,</b> appropriate for the Mexican market, are proposed.

40|$|Clearing {{houses have}} often been {{in the shadows of}} the {{derivatives}} exchanges with which they are typically associated. But this may be changing. There are signs that the <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> services that clearing houses provide could be an increasingly important part of the modern financial landscape, alongside exchanges and other trading mechanisms. The London Clearing House (LCH), for example, is about to extend its services to new markets, previously uncleared in the UK. Before the end of 1999, LCH plans to launch a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> service for the over-the-counter derivatives market (Swapclear) and for the bond repo market (RepoClear); the latter is one of several plans for clearing European government bond repos. In addition, it is envisaged that trades on the joint London Stock Exchange/Deutsche Börse trading platform will be cleared by some form of <b>central</b> <b>counterparty.</b> <b>Central</b> banks have a core interest in understanding the ways in which these developments change the distribution of risk and the possibility of systemic risk within financial markets. 1 This article, taking a general perspective, considers why demand for <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> services has arisen from market participants, how <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> alter the distribution and form of risk, the characteristics of markets for which they might be suitable, and their implications for financial stability more generally.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether risk-based regulation is an efficient approach to the regime of <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> (CCPs) in the OTC derivatives market. The discussions below will first attempt to throw some light on the way risk-based regulation operates.

The core of the study in this paper is the analysis concerning the parameters that risk-based regulation offers to assess the current regime of <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> in the OTC derivatives market in the UK. The paper explores the UK risk-based model of regulation and supervision governing OTC derivatives. It is specifically focused on prudential supervision and conduct of business rules governing OTC derivatives transactions and the increasing tendency to use <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs. Additionally, this study will identify and assess the risks to the regulator’s objectives that are posed by the <b>Central</b> <b>Counterparties</b> CCPs, and to address those using various regulatory tools...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{estimate}} the benefits from adopting close-out netting to decrease the exposure to counterparty risk across the world markets and to establish the additional benefits from <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> towards decreasing counterparty risk. The novelty of the approach is to estimate a figure for counterparty credit risk (CCR) grouping together most of the financial transactions that generate counterparty risk and to analyze the benefit of netting possibilities in reducing the overall risk exposure, using three different scenarios. In the first scenario, counterparty credit risk is calculated assuming that no close-out netting is possible across different contracts. The second scenario assumes bilateral negotiations and netting across contracts. The third scenario contemplates the existence of a <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> as the center of transactions. Benefits from netting and <b>central</b> <b>counterparty</b> are assessed by comparing the risk exposure in each scenario. Results from the model show that netting provides a decrease in world counterparty risk of over $ 17 trillion. Netting is thus a powerful tool available in the world markets to manage counterparty risk while decreasing systemic risk, and as such policies to facilitate and standardize netting procedures across different jurisdictions should be encouraged. Moreover, results show that the use of <b>central</b> <b>counterparties</b> for settling the outstanding contracts would additionally decrease CCR by over $ 2 trillio...|$|R
