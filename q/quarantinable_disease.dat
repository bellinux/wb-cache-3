40|$|Abstract Background Cholera {{has claimed}} many lives {{throughout}} history {{and it continues}} to be a global threat, especially in countries in Africa. The disease is listed as one of three internationally <b>quarantinable</b> <b>diseases</b> by the World Health organization, along with plague and yellow fever. Between 1999 and 2005, Africa alone accounted for about 90 % of over 1 million reported cholera cases worldwide. In Ghana, there have been over 27000 reported cases since 1999. In one of the affected regions in Ghana, Ashanti region, massive outbreaks and high incidences of cholera have predominated in urban and overcrowded communities. Results A GIS based spatial analysis and statistical analysis, carried out to determine clustering of cholera, showed that high cholera rates are clustered around Kumasi Metropolis (the central part of the region), with Moran's Index = 0. 271 and P Chi square for trend analysis reflected a direct spatial relationship between cholera and urbanization (χ 2 = 2995. 5, P χ 2 = 1757. 2, P χ 2 = 831. 38, P Conclusion The results suggest that high urbanization, high overcrowding, and neighborhood with Kumasi Metropolis are the most important predictors of cholera in Ashanti region. </p...|$|R

40|$|Isolation and {{quarantine}} {{are public}} health practices used to stop or limit {{the spread of}} disease. Isolation is used to separate ill persons who have a communicable disease {{from those who are}} healthy. Isolation restricts the movement of ill persons to help stop the spread of certain diseases. For example, hospitals use isolation for patients with infectious tuberculosis. Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of well persons who may have been exposed to a communicable disease to see if they become ill. These people may have been exposed to a disease and do not know it, or they may have the disease but do not show symptoms. Quarantine can also help limit the spread of communicable disease.

40|$|The {{gross product}} from sea culture in Japan was about USD 3. 4 billion in 2013 with kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus constituting 2 % {{of the total}} {{production}}. In recent years, annual shrimp production has reached about 1, 600 metric tons (MT) and 99 % of the species produced comprised of M. japonicus. Kuruma shrimp is highly traded at market price of USD 40 - 60 per kg. At present, 65 % of cultured kuruma shrimp are produced in Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures. To increase or maintain kuruma shrimp fishery in the natural environment, 200 million fry have been annually released into the sea {{along the coast of}} Japan. In addition, whiteleg shrimp Penaeus vannamei has also been produced in a private farm since 2007 with an annual production of approximately 40 MT. Recently, the number of farms that ventured into whiteleg shrimp culture has increased. The most serious obstacle faced by the kuruma shrimp industry in Japan in the 1990 s was the outbreaks of white spot disease (WSD) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The seed production of kuruma shrimp has been dependent on captured wild broodstocks. However, broodstocks obtained from the wild could be carriers of WSSV that may vertically transmit the virus to fertilized eggs. To prevent the spread of WSD, measures for disinfecting WSSV-infected fertilized eggs of shrimp and detection of the causative virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been developed. Lately, with the application of an improved technology for broodstock rearing, production losses ascribed to WSD have significantly decreased because majority of the hatcheries have been using specific WSSV-free shrimps. In the last decade, in kuruma shrimp hatcheries and grow-out ponds, vibriosis due to Vibrio penaeicida has been frequently encountered. Fusariosis caused by Fusarium solani is also common. The first cases of vibriosis and fusariosis in Japan occurred in 1973 and 1972, respectively. Taking the case of Okinawa prefecture as example, production losses in 2005 due to vibriosis and fusariosis were 66 % and 34 %, respectively. Cleaning of the pond bottom prior to the commencement of grow-out culture has been recommended to prevent vibriosis. Some antibiotics have also been orally administered to reduce mortality of shrimps affected by vibriosis. However, farmers have been properly cautioned regarding their use as emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria could consequently arise. Because no practical treatment for fusariosis is currently available, farmers either dispose or harvest infected shrimps followed by disinfection of ponds with 10 ppm chlorine. Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has not yet been detected in Japan. As kuruma shrimp is also susceptible to the disease, the Government of Japan plans to designate AHPND as Specific Disease. Under Japanese law, enlistment of AHPND as a <b>quarantinable</b> <b>disease</b> will also be instituted to prevent the introduction of this disease into Japanese hatcheries and grow-out facilities. However, in case an AHPND outbreak inadvertently occurs, Prefectural Fisheries Experimental Stations (PES) could immediately conduct preliminary diagnosis using the AP 4 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. In addition, confirmatory diagnosis using AP 4 nested PCR method and sequencing could be conducted at the National Research Institute of Aquaculture (NRIA), a central laboratory for aquatic animal health. NRIA s task is not only to perform confirmatory diagnosis but likewise disseminate diagnostic techniques to the staff of the National Quarantine and PES...|$|E

40|$|This book is {{published}} annually by the Division of Quarantine, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), {{for use as}} a reference by health departments, physicians, travel agencies, international airlines, shipping companies, and other private and public agencies that advise international travelers concerning the risks they might encounter when visiting other countries. It specifies the vaccinations required by different countries and includes information on measures for travelers to take to protect their health and facilitate their travel. The purpose of the International Health Regulations (IHR) adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) is to ensure maximum security against the international spread of diseases with minimum interference with world traffic. In addition to the <b>quarantinable</b> <b>diseases</b> (cholera, yellow fever, and plague), covered by the IHR, there are other conditions of importance to travelers, their families, and to the community when the travelers return home. Because some countries require vaccination against yellow fever only if a traveler arrives from a country infected with this disease, it is essential that current information regarding infected areas be taken into consideration in determining whether vaccinations are required. The Division of Quarantine publishes a biweekly "Summary of Health Information for International Travel" (also known as the Blue Sheet) to show where cholera and yellow fever are being reported. The 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 Blue Sheet 22 ̆ 0 ac? is available by fax by calling (404) 33222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 4565 and requesting document 220022 #. Official changes in individual country vaccination requirements reported by WHO are published in the Blue Sheet. These changes should be entered in the Vaccination Certificate Requirements section of this book (pp. 17 - 77) to keep information on vaccination requirements current. This book, when kept up-to-date with changes in individual vaccination requirements, and utilized in conjunction with the Blue Sheet provides accurate information on vaccinations required for international travel. Occasionally, the Division of Quarantine issues an Advisory Memorandum containing special recommendations or information about newly identified health problems associated with international travel. International travelers are advised to contact their local health department, physician, or private or public agency that advises international travelers at least 6 weeks prior to departure to obtain current health information on countries they plan to visit. They may also call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention automated travelers' hotline accessible from a touchtone phone 24 hours-aday, 7 days-a-week at (404) 332 - 4559. This system provides information on requirements and recommendations for the international traveler and is updated as needed. This information is also available by facsimile at (404) 332 - 4565.
