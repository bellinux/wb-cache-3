In recent years, many efforts have been focused on stability problems of geotechnical structures with the limit analysis method. The limit analysis method includes {{the upper and lower}} bound theorems. By using the two theorems, the range, in which the true solution falls, can be found. In this paper upper bound finite element limit {{analysis is}} used for calculate active earth force on retaining walls in non-homogeneous soils. Elements with linear strain rates cause to eliminate the necessity of velocity discontinuities between the elements.

(Zoology) Paratrichodorus meyeri De Waele & Killian, 1992 is {{extremely}} sensitive to surface sterilization; therefore in vitro culture {{could not be}} utilized for the mass culture of this nematode and another method had to be developed. Hermetically sealed glass containers were employed successfully for the reproduction of Paratrichodorus meyeri. With this method an average 12 times increase was achieved on tomatoes {{over a period of}} 60 days. Certain crops were evaluated in the greenhouse to establish their status as hosts for Paratrichodorus meyeri. The aim of this experiment was to determine which plants could be used as hosts for the reproduction of the nematodes in the greenhouse. It was found that tomatoes (cultivar Roma VF) and wheat (cultivar Gamtoos) were excellent hosts, tobacco (cultivar K 51 E) and onions (cultivar Bon accord) good hosts, tobacco (cultivar TL 38) and lettuce (cultivar Great Lakes) average hosts and sweetcorn (cultivar Golden Bantam), beetroot (cultivar Formanova) and cabbage (cultivar Sugar Loaf) unsatisfactory hosts for this nematode species. The aim was also to determine the effect of this nematode species on tobacco and cotton. Various inoculation levels of Paratrichodorus meyeri were tested on tobacco cultivars K 51 E, TL 33 and RK and the cotton cultivar Acala 1517170.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISILitter {{extraction}} (LE) is {{a common}} practice in many forests of the world. This process can cause long-term depletion of C substrates, thereby affecting ecosystem balances. The effects of LE on soil properties such as soil respiration (Rs), soil water content (<b>q),</b> <b>soil</b> temperature (T), microbial activity, and dissolved organic C (DOC) are not well understood in various forests ecosystems. We investigated the short and medium-term effects of LE on these soil properties in a sclerophyll forest of central Chile. A completely randomized block design was set with three blocks and two treatments, i. e., a control (no LE) and LE totaling six 10 - by 10 -m plots. The Rs, q, and T were determined immediately after LE and then at Days 4, 12, 16, and 20. The same properties were determined in the medium term (between Days 448 – 853). Soil organic C (SOC), basal respiration (Cmin), microbial biomass C (Cbio), and microbial (qCO 2, qMic) and mineralization (qMin) quotients were determined at Day 711 after LE from soil cores obtained at depths intervals of 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 9 cm. Soil pore water was extracted from suction lysimeters during the rainfall season of 2011 and analyzed for DOC, specific ultraviolet absorbance, the ratio between the absorbance at 465 and 665 nm in water extracts, and electric conductivity. Litter extraction caused large reductions in Rs {{in the short term}} (33 %) and smaller reductions in the medium term (21. 2 %). In addition to the effect of LE, Rs was governed by q. The SOC, Cmin, qCO 2, qMic, and qMin were unaffected by LE, but DOC significantly decreased with LE by 59. 6 % (10 -cm depth) and 48. 8 % (30 -cm depth).

The objectives {{of this study}} were to investigate: (1) the kinetics of the transfer of P from soil to soil solution and assessing P buffering capacity of soils (PBC), as a function of soil solution P; (2) the effect of PBC on soil P status fitted to environmental targets for water quality; (3) the effect of PBC on crop response. PBC was derived from the non-linear Q-I curve describing the time-dependent relationship between plant-available reserve of <b>soil</b> P (<b>Q)</b> versus <b>soil</b> solution P (I). The Q-I curve was determined in soil suspension using sorption and isotopic dilution methods for soil samples from French, Swedish, and Dutch field trials. Soils with low PBC values were more sensitive to the loss of P to the environment, required higher critical value in soil solution P to comply with P demand of maize, and had higher change in soil solution P per unit of P budget. In different soils, both the critical soil solution P for maize and the change in soil solution P per unit of P balance varied inversely with PBC. It is concluded that (1) PBC {{plays a key role in}} determining the agronomic and environmental threshold levels of available P content in the soils, and (2) PBC is a prerequisite for the development of more environmentally oriented fertilization recommendation systems...|$|R

The SRWA for three dendrochronologies (Las Bayas and Banderas in Durango and El Gato in Zacatecas) from 1665 to 2001 addressed these questions. Instrumental measurements of P and E (1947 - 2007) and, using parameterized sub-models for the rainfall interception of Gash model (I) and Et, a mass balance approach evaluated Q and q for a forest site near El Salto, Durango, Mexico. SRWA oscillations of several timescales had spectral peaks every 2 - 3; 3 - 7; and 9 - 12 years. The ENSO indices explained most of the total SRWA variation for all three chronologies (1990 - 2001).

A mass balance approach estimated daily variables of the water cycle using sub-models for I and Et to calculate Q and θ for a time series from 1945 to 2007. Regression and auto-regressive and moving averaging (ARIMA) techniques evaluated the statistical significance of trends. The cumulative standardized z value magnified and ARIMA models projected statistically similar monthly and annual time series data of all variables of the water cycle. Regression analysis and ARIMA models showed monthly and annual P, I, E, and Et, Q, and θ do not follow consistent up or downward linear tendencies over time with statistical significance; they rather follow oscillations that could be adequately predicted by ARIMA models (r 2 ≥ 0. 70). There was a consistent statistical association (p ≤ 0. 05) of θ with the number of wildfires and the area burned regardless of the different spatial scales used in evaluating these variables. The analysis shows seasonal variability is increasing over time as magnifying pulses of dryness and wetness, which may be the response of the hydrological cycle to climate change.

As a directly measurable parameter, RQ is free of empirical assumptions and provides an additional tool {{that can be used}} in conjunction with constants derived from fitted Arrhenius or exponential equations, to help understand shifts in microbial use of C substrates and how changes in vegetation might affect <b>soil</b> processes. <b>Q</b> 10 did not change significantly over the course of a 120 -day incubation for any of our studied soils. RQs varied with vegetation type and were consistently lower in grassland soils than woodland soils. RQs also varied during long-term incubations and declined consistently with time for grassland soils. RQs declined towards the end of the 120 -day incubation for woodland soils. The generally low Ea for these soils from sub-alpine vegetation types in Australia, and the fairly rapid decline in RQ during incubation, suggest the likely greater temperature sensitivity of recalcitrant C relative to labile C could provide a strong positive feedback to increases in Mean Annual Temperature...|$|R
40|$|Latent {{heat flux}} {{at the surface}} is largely {{dependent}} on the roughness length for water vapor (z 0 q). The determination of z 0 q is still uncertain because of its multifaceted characteristics of surface properties, atmospheric conditions and insufficient observations. In this study, observed values from the Fluxes Over Snow Surface II field experiment (FLOSS-II) from November 2002 to March 2003 were utilized to estimate z 0 q over various land surfaces: bare soil, snow, and senescent grass. The present {{results indicate that the}} estimated z 0 <b>q</b> over bare <b>soil</b> is much smaller than the roughness length of momentum (z 0 m); thus, the ratio z 0 m/z 0 q is larger than those of previous studies by a factor of 20 - 150 for the available flow regime of the roughness Reynolds number, Re* > 0. 1. On the snow surface, the ratio is comparable to a previous estimation for the rough flow (Re* > 1), but smaller by a factor of 10 - 50 as the flow became smooth (Re* < 1). Using the estimated ratio, an optimal regression equation of z 0 m/z 0 q is determined as a function of Re* for each surface type. The present parameterization of the ratio is found to greatly reduce biases of latent heat flux estimation compared with that estimated by the conventional method, suggesting the usefulness of current parameterization for numerical modeling...|$|R

The experimental plot was about 350 m wide by 1000 m long, at an elevation of 1374 m. Height of the dense saltcedar ranged from 5 to 7 m. A north (n) tower and a south (s) tower were placed about 685 m apart on the N-S centerline of the plot to support flux sensors at 15 m height. Each instrument package included a CSI data logger, a radiometer for net radiation <b>Q,</b> discs for <b>soil</b> heat flux G, and two sets of one-propeller eddy correlation (OPEC) sensors. OPEC systems measure sensible heat flux H with a sensitive, vertically oriented, propeller anemometer and a fine-wire thermocouple.

40|$|Piping {{has been}} {{observed}} in natural and anthropogenic landscapes, in different lithologies and climates, and under different types of land uses and vegetation covers. Despite its importance, no standard widely-applied methodology exists to assess susceptibility of soil to piping. The pinhode test, originally developed by Sherard et al. in 1976 is an empirical test based on the qualitative evalution of the dispersibility (colloidal erodibility) of compacted fined-grained soils. This study aims at evaluating the pinhole test for assessing the susceptibility of soils to piping and establishes recommendations to use the pinhole test, and assesses the effects of hydraulic head, water quality and soil moisture content on the hydrological and erosion responses. Topsoil Ap horizon samples with different moisture contents were taken in Central Belgium. Four hydraulic heads (50, 180, 380 and 1020 mm) and two water qualities (tap and distilled water) {{were used in the}} laboratory. The results show: (i) a linear incrase in pipe flow discharge (Qw) and sediment discharge (Qs) with increasing hydraulic head, (ii) a negative trend (not significant) for Qw and <b>Qs</b> with increasing <b>soil</b> moisture content, and (iii) significantly higher Qw and Qs for distilled water than for tap water. This study indicates that the pinhole test is suitable for assessing the susceptibility of soil horizons to piping in a quantitative way (Qw Qs, the time to flow out and the hole size after the test). We recommend the use of : (i) two different and contrasting hydraulic heads (i. e. 180 and 1020 mm), (ii) distilled water, and (iii) different soil moisture contentsstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the spatial}} {{variation}} of temperature sensitivity (i. e. <b>Q</b> 10) of <b>soil</b> respiration (R s) and its controlling factors, is critical to improve the precision of carbon budget estimations at regional scales. In this study, data from 2 - 3 continuous years of R s measurements over 15 ecosystems of ChinaFLUX were summarized to analyze the response of R s to soil temperature. Moreover, we improved our dataset by collecting previously published Q 10 values from 34 ecosystems in China. The ecosystems studied were located in the main climatic zones of China, spanning from alpine via temperate to tropical. Spatial variations of Q 10 and its controlling factors were analyzed. The results showed that soil temperature at a 5  cm depth satisfactorily explained the seasonal variations in R s of the 15 ChinaFLUX ecosystems (R 2 varying from 0. 37 to 0. 83). Based on the overall data, the Q 10 values of R s in China ranged from 1. 28 to 4. 75. The spatial variations in Q 10 were primarily determined by soil temperature during measurement periods, soil organic carbon (SOC) content, and ecosystem type. Ecosystems in colder regions and with higher SOC content had relatively higher Q 10 values. Moreover, ecosystems of different vegetation types showed different Q 10 values. A temperature- and SOC-dependent function for Q 10 is suggested, which could be a valuable reference for improving the regional-scale models of R s and ecosystem carbon cycles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} the first-order representation of microbial decomposition as {{a major source of}} uncertainty in simulations and projections of the terrestrial carbon balance. Here, we use a reduced complexity model representative of current state-of-the-art models of soil organic carbon decomposition. We undertake a systematic sensitivity analysis to disentangle the effect of the time-invariant baseline residence time (k) and the sensitivity of microbial decomposition to temperature (<b>Q</b> 10) on <b>soil</b> carbon dynamics at regional and global scales. Our simulations produce a range in total soil carbon at equilibrium of ∼ 592 to 2745 Pg C, which is similar to the ∼ 561 to 2938 Pg C range in pre-industrial soil carbon in models used in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5). This range depends primarily on the value of k, although the impact of Q 10 is not trivial at regional scales. As climate changes through the historical period, and into the future, k is primarily responsible for the magnitude of the response in <b>soil</b> carbon, whereas <b>Q</b> 10 determines whether the soil remains a sink, or becomes a source in the future mostly by its effect on mid-latitude carbon balance. If we restrict our simulations to those simulating total soil carbon stocks consistent with observations of current stocks, the projected range in total soil carbon change is reduced by 42 % for the historical simulations and 45 % for the future projections. However, while this observation-based selection dismisses outliers, it does not increase confidence in the future sign of the soil carbon feedback.

40|$|Inaccurate {{estimate}} of the largest terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, is {{the major source of}} uncertainty in simulating feedback of climate warming on ecosystem–atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange by process-based ecosystem and soil carbon models. Although the models need to simplify complex environmental processes of soil carbon sequestration, in a large mosaic of environments a missing key driver could lead to a modeling bias in predictions of SOC stock change. We aimed to evaluate SOC stock estimates of process-based models (Yasso 07, <b>Q,</b> and CENTURY <b>soil</b> sub-model v 4) against a massive Swedish forest soil inventory data set (3230 samples) organized by a recursive partitioning method into distinct soil groups with underlying SOC stock development linked to physicochemical conditions. For two-thirds of measurements all models predicted accurate SOC stock levels regardless of the detail of input data, e. g., whether they ignored or included soil properties. However, in fertile sites with high N deposition, high cation exchange capacity, or moderately increased soil water content, Yasso 07 and Q models underestimated SOC stocks. In comparison to Yasso 07 and Q, accounting for the site-specific soil characteristics (e. g. clay content and topsoil mineral N) by CENTURY improved SOC stock estimates for sites with high clay content, but not for sites with high N deposition. Our analysis suggested that the soils with poorly predicted SOC stocks, as characterized by the high nutrient status and well-sorted parent material, indeed have had other predominant drivers of SOC stabilization lacking in the models, presumably the mycorrhizal organic uptake and organo-mineral stabilization processes. Our results imply that the role of soil nutrient status as regulator of organic matter mineralization has to be re-evaluated, since correct SOC stocks are decisive for predicting future SOC change and soil CO 2 efflux...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} sensitivity (<b>Q</b> 10) of <b>soil</b> heterotrophic respiration (Rh) {{is an important}} ecological model parameter and may vary with temperature and moisture. While Q 10 generally decreases with increasing temperature, the moisture effects on Q 10 have been controversial. To address this, we conducted a 90 -day laboratory incubation experiment using a subtropical forest soil with a full factorial combination of five moisture levels (20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 % water holding capacity [...] WHC) and five temperature levels (10, 17, 24, 31, and 38 °C). Under each moisture treatment, Rh was measured several times for each temperature treatment to derive Q 10 based on the exponential relationships between Rh and temperature. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial community structure and soil nutrients were also measured several times to detect their potential contributions to the moisture-induced Q 10 variation. We found that Q 10 was significantly lower at lower moisture levels (60 %, 40 % and 20 % WHC) than at higher moisture level (80 % WHC) during the early stage of the incubation, but became significantly higher at 20 %WHC than at 60 % WHC and {{not significantly different from}} the other three moisture levels during the late stage of incubation. In contrast, soil Rh had the highest value at 60 % WHC and the lowest at 20 % WHC throughout the whole incubation period. Variations of Q 10 were significantly associated with MBC during the early stages of incubation, but with the fungi-to-bacteria ratio during the later stages, suggesting that changes in microbial biomass and community structure are related to the moisture-induced Q 10 changes. This study implies that global warming's impacts on soil CO 2 emission may depend upon soil moisture conditions. With the same temperature rise, wetter soils may emit more CO 2 into the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration...|$|R
40|$|Summary—Carbon {{dioxide and}} methane are {{important}} greenhouse gases whose exchange rates between soils {{and the atmosphere}} are controlled strongly by soil temperature and moisture. We made a labora-tory investigation to quantify {{the relative importance of}} soil moisture and temperature on fluxes of CO 2 and CH 4 between forest soils and the atmosphere. Forest floor and mineral soil material were col-lected from a mixed hardwood forest at the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Site (MA) and were incubated in the laboratory under a range of moisture (air-dry to nearly saturated) and tem-perature conditions (5 – 258 C). Carbon dioxide emissions increased exponentially with increasing tem-perature in forest floor material, with emissions reduced at the lowest and highest soil moisture contents. The forest floor Q 10 of 2. 03 (from 15 – 258 C) suggests that CO 2 emissions were controlled pri-marily by soil biological activity. Forest floor CO 2 emissions were predicted with a multiple polynomial regression model (r 2 = 0. 88) of temperature and moisture, but the fit predicting mineral soil respiration was weaker (r 2 = 0. 59). Methane uptake was controlled strongly by soil moisture, with reduced fluxes under conditions of very low or very high soil moisture contents. A multiple polynomial model accurately described CH 4 uptake by mineral soil material (r 2 = 0. 81), but only weakly (r 2 = 0. 45) predicted uptake by forest floor material. The mineral <b>soil</b> <b>Q</b> 10 of 1. 11 for CH 4 uptake indicates that methane uptake is controlled primarily by physical processes.
