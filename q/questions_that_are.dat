5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> deemed to be hard but underconfident on <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> considered easy.|$|E
5|$|Ex situ {{research}} (or off-site research) is also {{popular among}} researchers looking to answer <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> difficult to {{test in the}} field. For example, efforts to sequence the genome of the gray mouse lemur will help researchers understand which genetic traits set primates apart from other mammals and will ultimately help understand what genomic traits set humans apart from other primates. One of the foremost lemur research facilities is the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina. It maintains the largest captive lemur population outside of Madagascar, which it maintains for non-invasive research and captive breeding. Many important research projects {{have been carried out}} there, including studies of lemur vocalizations, basic locomotor research, the kinematics of bipedalism, the effects of social complexity transitive reasoning, and cognition studies involving a lemur's ability to organize and retrieve sequences from memory. Other facilities, such as the Lemur Conservation Foundation, located near Myakka City, Florida, have also hosted research projects, such as one that looked at lemurs' ability to preferentially select tools based on functional qualities.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these questions may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the other}} odes, [...] "To Autumn" [...] {{is written in}} iambic pentameter (but greatly {{modified}} from the very beginning) with five stressed syllables to a line, each usually preceded by an unstressed syllable. Keats varies this form by the employment of Augustan inversion, sometimes using a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable {{at the beginning of}} a line, including the first: [...] "Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness"; and employing spondees in which two stressed syllables are placed together at the beginnings of both the following stanzas, adding emphasis to the <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> asked: [...] "Who hath not seen thee...", [...] "Where are the songs...?" ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E

2500|$|Analytical Marxism is an {{approach}} to Marxist theory that was prominent amongst English-speaking philosophers, Jose Acosta and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the September Group of academics, so called because of their biennial September meetings to discuss common interests. Self-described as [...] "Non-Bullshit Marxism", the group was characterized, {{in the words of}} David Miller, by [...] "clear and rigorous thinking about <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> usually blanketed by ideological fog."

2500|$|Some Court {{decisions}} {{have been criticized for}} injecting the Court into the political arena, and deciding <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> the purview of the other two branches of government. The Bush v. Gore decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election and effectively chose George W. Bush over Al Gore, has been criticized extensively, particularly by liberals. Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting: in Baker v. Carr, the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions; Justice Frankfurter in a [...] "scathing dissent" [...] argued against the court wading into so-called political questions.|$|E

He was opposed to the doctrine of total depravity and adopted a semi-Pelagian position, holding that man is the [...] "child of reason" [...] and therefore not, as the Puritans held, of a completely depraved nature. He argued that there are some <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> beyond the ability of reasonable and religious people to solve, and therefore he argued for religious toleration. He was accused at various times by various persons of being an Arminian, Socinian, and Latitudinarian.|$|E
2500|$|Iacobucci was {{critical}} of the Court of Appeal's consideration of the accuracy and correctness of the committee's decisions. On a standard of reasonableness the reviewing court should not be re-weighing the evidence or re-trying the case. The standard inquiry involves asking whether [...] "after a somewhat probing examination, can the reasons given, when taken as a whole, support the decision?". This is so because [...] "there will often be no single right answer to the <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> under review against the standard of reasonableness. For example, when a decision must be taken according {{to a set of}} objectives that exist in tension with each other, there may be no particular trade-off that is superior to all others." ...|$|E
