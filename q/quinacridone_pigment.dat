50|$|Quinacridone is {{an organic}} {{molecule}} {{used in the}} formation of organic pigments. It is an organic compound with the molecular formula C20H12N2O2. Numerous derivatives of quinacridone constitute the <b>Quinacridone</b> <b>pigment</b> family, which finds extensive use in industrial colorant applications such as robust outdoor paints and inkjet toners.|$|E
30|$|The violet colours {{present in}} samples S 6 and S 7 from Kiosk back {{were made by}} mixing PB 15 with the red <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigment</b> PR 122. This pigment {{is known for its}} use as a tinting and shading pigment [24] but is also found in house paint used for mural {{paintings}} [28]. PR 122 is characterised by the Raman bands at 1650, 1594, 1567, 1313, 720 542 and 308  cm− 1 [26 – 28] as seen in Fig.  6 d where bands assigned to PB 15 (marked PB) are also present.|$|E
40|$|C. I. Pigment Red 209 (PR 209) is {{a mixture}} of three kinds of {{isomeric}} dichloroquinacridones, 3, 10 -, 1, 8 -, and 1, 10 -derivatives. The colorant has attracted attention for its yellow shade of red, which is unusual for a <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigment.</b> Elucidation of the pigment's crystal structure revealed that, of the three derivatives, only 3, 10 -DClQA was isolated as single crystals. X-ray analysis showed that 3, 10 -DClQA crystallizes in P space group and that NHO intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the [10] direction and which constitute a two-dimensional, hydrogen bond network. However, whilst 3, 10 -DClQA was found to lack the yellowish hue of PR 209, the color can be attributed to 1, 8 - and 1, 10 -DClQAs which possess absorption bands at shorter wavelengths than 3, 10 -DClQA...|$|E
5000|$|Rose madder lake, {{originally}} from {{the root of}} the madder plant, is also known as alizarin crimson in its synthetic form. Since rose madder is fugitive when exposed to light, its use has been largely superseded, even in synthetic form, by <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{synthetic}} alizarin {{could be}} produced {{for a fraction}} of the cost of the natural product, and the market for madder collapsed virtually overnight. The principal synthesis entailed oxidation of anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid with sodium nitrate in concentrated sodium hydroxide. Alizarin itself has been in turn largely replaced today by the more light-resistant <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> developed at DuPont in 1958.|$|R
40|$|We present {{terahertz}} spectroscopy {{and analysis of}} commercially available <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> in the 0 - 5 THz range. Our results show clear distinction between the β and γ crystalline phases responsible for the deep violet (β) to red (γ) colour pigments. We reveal {{a large number of}} absorptions in the terahertz regime shown to depend on the constituent phase as well as temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} {{properties of}} derivatives of linear trans- quinacridone, an archetypal pigment, have been explored {{in two and}} three dimensions. The sparse solubility of the parent <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigment</b> in common organic solvents {{can be traced back}} to the formation of a network of hydrogen bonds. Introducing aliphatic substituents on specific positions of the quinacridone core leads to an increased solubility without hampering the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds. With UV-Vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence, and infrared spectroscopy, the aggregation behavior of these substituted quinacridone derivatives is studied. On the basis of these data, models are proposed for the aggregate structure in solution. In addition, the two-dimensional ordering on graphite of these compounds and N,N'-dialkylated analogues has been investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy. The comparison between the two-dimensional organization and the solution data allows one to identify the extent of intermolecular interactions involved in the aggregation process...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} organic nanopigments are {{an increasingly}} important class of functional nanomaterials that possess physical properties ranging between molecular and bulk materials. These nanomaterials have been utilized {{in a variety of}} important commercial applications including coatings, printing, information storage, and display technologies [1]. We will discuss our recent work in developing a bottom-up approach for preparation of 3 different classes of high-performance organic nanopigments: 1) azo-laked Pigment Red 57 : 1 (LAK), 2) <b>quinacridone</b> <b>Pigment</b> Red 122 (QUIN), and 3) azobenzimidazolone (BZI) Pigments Yellow 151 and Red 175. The physical characteristics of the nanopigments were characterized by electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), while their coloristic spectral properties, and dispersion thermal stability were investigated in various matrices. We identified relationships between pigment particle size and their coloristic as well as thermal stability properties for these nanopigments. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) provided clear images of lattice fringes, and enabled us to determine the crystal orientation of the molecules packed within the QUIN and BZI pigment nanoparticles.

5000|$|Quinacridones are {{a family}} of {{synthetic}} pigments used to make high performance paints. Quinacridones are considered [...] "high performance" [...] pigments because they have exceptional color and weather fastness. Major uses for quinacridones include automobile coatings {{as well as other}} industrial coatings. They can also be used in artist's paints, including oils, acrylics, and watercolors. Nanocrystalline dispersions of <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> functionalized with solubilizing surfactants are the most common magenta printing ink.|$|R
5000|$|Because this {{synthetic}} alizarin dye {{could be}} produced {{for a fraction}} of the cost of the natural madder dye, it quickly replaced all madder-based colorants then in use (in, for instance, British army red coats that had been a shade of madder from the late 17th century to 1870, and French military cloth, often called [...] "Turkey Red"). In turn, alizarin itself has now been largely replaced by the more light-resistant <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> originally developed at DuPont in 1958.|$|R
40|$|We present {{terahertz}} spectroscopy {{and analysis of}} two commercially available <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> in the 0. 5 - 4. 5 THz range. Our results show {{a clear distinction between}} quinacridone red and magenta pigments. We reveal four definite absorptions in the terahertz regime common to both pigments, but offset between the pigments by ∼ 0. 2 THz. The lowest-energy line in each pigment is observed to increase in frequency by ∼ 0. 1 THz as the temperature is reduced from 300 to 12 K...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>quinacridone</b> <b>pigments</b> {{were added}} (0. 01; 0. 05; 0. 1; 0. 5; 1; 2 [*]wt%) to {{isotactic}} polypropylene (iPP), and {{their influence on}} mechanical and thermomechanical properties were investigated. Complex mechanical and thermomechanical iPP properties analyses, including static tensile test, Dynstat impact resistance measurement, and hardness test, as well as dynamic mechanic thermal analysis (DMTA), were realized in reference to morphological changes of polymeric materials. In {{order to understand the}} differences in modification efficiency and changes in polymorphism of polypropylene matrix caused by incorporation of pigments, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments were done. Both pigments acted as highly effective nucleating agents that influence morphology and mechanical properties of isotactic polypropylene injection molded samples. Differences between polypropylene samples nucleated by two pigments may be attributed to different heterogeneous nucleation behavior dependent on pigment type. As it was proved by WAXS investigations, the addition of γ-quinacridone (E 5 B) led to crystallization of polypropylene in hexagonal phase (β-iPP), while for β-quinacridone (ER 02) modified polypropylene no evidence of iPP β-phase was observed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While CVD {{has been}} {{extensively}} used for the preparation of thin films of inorganic materials, apart from its application to plasma polymerisation, very little has been reported on the formation of organic layers. In this paper we report the first CVD preparation of an organic <b>pigment,</b> <b>quinacridone.</b> A two-step CVD method {{and the effects of}} various deposition conditions on the deposition process are described. The characterisation of deposits by FTIR, Raman, XRD and chemical microanalysis analysis shows that they have very similar compositions and structures to commercial samples of the pigment. 1...|$|R
40|$|The nanocrystalline α^II-phase of the industrially {{produced}} organic <b>pigment</b> <b>quinacridone</b> was {{studied by}} 3 D electron diffraction of its crystals with a thickness of only 10 nm. The diffraction data showed strong diffuse scattering along one direction indicating severe stacking disorder. The average crystal structure {{was obtained from}} electron diffraction data using direct methods. In α^II-quinacridone, the molecules are connected {{by a pair of}} hydrogen bonds thereby forming molecular chains, which are stacked, resulting in the formation of layers. The layers exhibit a stacking disorder with a mixture of herringbone and parallel arrangements, which explains the diffuse scattering. The crystal structure was confirmed by dispersion-corrected DFT calculations...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{formation}} of electronic interfaces between living cells and semiconductors hinges on {{being able to}} obtain an extremely close and high surface-area contact, which preserves both cell viability and semiconductor performance. To accomplish this, we introduce organic semiconductor assemblies consisting of a hierarchical arrangement of nanocrystals. These are synthesised via a colloidal chemical route that transforms the nontoxic commercial <b>pigment</b> <b>quinacridone</b> into various biomimetic three-dimensional arrangements of nanocrystals. Through a tuning of parameters such as precursor concentration, ligands and additives, we obtain complex size and shape control at room temperature. We elaborate hedgehog-shaped crystals comprising nanoscale needles or daggers that form intimate interfaces with the cell membrane, minimising the cleft with single cells without apparent detriment to viability. Excitation of such interfaces with light leads to effective cellular photostimulation. We find reversible light-induced conductance changes in ion-selective or temperature-gated channels.

40|$|In this work, surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) and surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF) {{were employed}} {{in the study of}} the adsorption and detection of the <b>pigments</b> <b>quinacridone</b> (QA) and 2, 9 -dimethylquinacridone (2, 9 -DMQA). These pigments are of great relevance in artwork and textile, plastic, and photochemical industries due to their condition as high performance pigments since they possess a high tinting strength. Due to this fact, they have been employed at relatively low concentrations. Therefore, the analysis and detection of these pigments requires the application of a highly sensitivity technique, such as SERS and SEF. The adsorption of QA and 2, 9 -DMQA on silver nanoparticles was extensively studied by means of SERS at different surface coverages. This study was completed by carrying out an in depth vibrational (Raman and IR) analysis of these pigments in solid state by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, UV-vis spectroscopy was employed to investigate the aggregation undergone by both pigments in solid state and in solution. 2, 9 -DMQA was demonstrated to have a lower tendency toward aggregation due to the presence of methyl groups. Even so, this molecule follows a BET adsorption mechanism on the metal nanoparticles due to its high tendency toward intermolecular interaction. From the analysis of the adsorption mechanism of this molecule, the limit of detection was deduced to be ca. 55 ppb. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
