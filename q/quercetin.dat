5|$|Apples are a {{rich source}} of various phytochemicals {{including}} flavonoids (e.g., catechins, flavanols, and <b>quercetin)</b> and other phenolic compounds (e.g., epicatechin and procyanidins) found in the skin, core, and pulp of the apple; they have unknown health value in humans.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, <b>quercetin</b> and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. butyric acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
25|$|In red grapes, {{the main}} {{flavonol}} is on average <b>quercetin,</b> followed by myricetin, kaempferol, laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main flavonol is <b>quercetin,</b> followed by kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, {{indicating that the}} enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{flavonoid}} {{category is}} a subcategory known as flavonols, {{which includes the}} yellow pigment - <b>quercetin.</b> Like other flavonoids, the concentration of flavonols in the grape berries increases as {{they are exposed to}} sunlight. Some viticulturalists will use measurement of flavonols such as <b>quercetin</b> as an indication of a vineyard's sun exposure and the effectiveness of canopy management techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{red color}} of the juice is due to betalains, (betanin and indicaxanthin). The plant also {{contains}} flavonoids, such as <b>quercetin,</b> isorhamnetin and kaempferol.|$|E
25|$|Extracts of {{ginkgo leaves}} contain {{phenolic}} acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin and <b>quercetin,</b> and the terpene trilactones, ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, {{as well as}} alkylphenols and polyprenols.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{produced}} from muscadine grapes may contain more than 40mg/L, an exceptional phenolic content. In muscadine skins, ellagic acid, myricetin, <b>quercetin,</b> kaempferol, and trans-resveratrol are major phenolics. Contrary to previous results, ellagic acid and not resveratrol {{is the major}} phenolic in muscadine grapes.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{thiamine}} antagonists are heat-stable and {{occur as}} both the ortho- and para-hydroxyphenols. Some examples of these antagonists are caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and tannic acid. These compounds interact with the thiamine to oxidize the thiazole ring, thus rendering it unable to be absorbed. Two flavonoids, <b>quercetin</b> and rutin, have also been implicated as thiamine antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Other {{compounds}} {{found in}} passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides {{have been found}} in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), <b>quercetin,</b> rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.|$|E
25|$|BPV-4 causes {{squamous}} cell carcinomas of the alimentary tract, and BPV-1/2 causes carcinomas and haemangioendotheliomas of the urinary bladder, {{in both cases}} in animals that have fed on bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Such cancers are common in locations where grazing land is infested with bracken, such as the western Scottish Highlands, southern Italy and the Nasampolai Valley in Kenya. Bracken contains several immunosuppressants and mutagens, including <b>quercetin</b> and ptaquiloside. Consumption of large quantities by cattle leads to an acute poisoning syndrome with symptoms of bone marrow depletion, while at lower levels of long-term consumption it acts as a cancer cofactor. Carcinogenesis is a multistep process; tumours also contain activated Ras, as well as mutation or downregulation of the tumour suppressor genes p53 in alimentary tract cancers and fragile histidine tetrads (FHIT) in urinary bladder cancers. Viral particles are not produced in either alimentary tract or urinary bladder tumours.|$|E
500|$|Blockade of COX-1 by aspirin {{apparently}} {{results in}} the upregulation of COX-2 {{as part of a}} gastric defense and that taking COX-2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion. Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any [...] "natural" [...] supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, genistein, <b>quercetin,</b> resorcinol, and others.|$|E
2500|$|High {{dietary intake}} {{of fruits and}} {{vegetables}} is associated with reduction in cancer, and some scientists, such as Gian Luigi Russo at the Institute of Food Sciences in Italy, suspect <b>quercetin</b> may be partly responsible. [...] Research shows that <b>quercetin</b> influences cellular mechanisms in vitro and in animal studies. According to the American Cancer society, [...] "there is no reliable clinical evidence that <b>quercetin</b> can prevent or treat cancer in humans".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Quercetin</b> is a {{principal}} flavonoid compound and an excellent free-radical-scavenging antioxidant that promotes apoptosis. In vitro it shows some antitumor activity in oral cancer and leukemia. Cultured skin and prostate cancer cells showed significant mortality (compared to nonmalignant cells) when treated {{with a combination of}} <b>quercetin</b> and ultrasound. [...] Note that ultrasound also promotes topical absorption by up to 1,000 times, making the use of topical <b>quercetin</b> and ultrasound wands an interesting proposition.|$|E
2500|$|According to the NCCIH, the {{evidence}} is relatively strong that saline nasal irrigation and butterbur are effective, {{when compared to other}} alternative medicine treatments, for which the scientific evidence is weak, negative, or nonexistent, such as honey, acupuncture, omega 3's, probiotics, [...] astragalus, capsaicin, grape seed extract, Pycnogenol, <b>quercetin,</b> spirulina, stinging nettle, tinospora or guduchi.|$|E
2500|$|In hens, {{tamarind}} {{has been}} found to lower cholesterol in their serum, and in the yolks of the eggs they laid. Due to a lack of available human clinical trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend tamarind for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Different parts of tamarind (T. indica) are recognized for their various medicinal properties. A previous study reported that the seed, leaf, leaf veins, fruit pulp and skin extracts of tamarind possessed high phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The presence of lupanone and lupeol, [...] catechin, epicatechin, <b>quercetin</b> and isorhamnetin [...] in the leaf extract could have contributed towards the diverse range of the medicinal activities. On the other hand, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analyses revealed that tamarind seeds contained catechin, procyanidin B2, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, chloramphenicol, myricetin, morin, <b>quercetin,</b> apigenin and kaempferol. The treatment of tamarind leaves on liver HepG2 cells significantly regulated the expression of genes and proteins involved with consequential impact on the coagulation system, cholesterol biosynthesis, xenobiotic metabolism signaling and antimicrobial response.|$|E
2500|$|Regular {{green tea}} is 99.9% water, {{provides}} 1 Calorie per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table) and contains phytochemicals, such as polyphenols and caffeine. Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which have antioxidant, anticarcinogen, anti-inflammatory, and anti-radiation biochemical effects in vitro. [...] Other components include {{three kinds of}} flavonoids, known as kaempferol, <b>quercetin,</b> and myricetin. A remarkably higher content of myricetin is detected in tea and its extracts than in many other plants, and this high concentration of myricetin may have some implications for the experimentally-observed bioactivity of tea and its extracts in vitro.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin C is {{available}} in tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25mg to 1500mg per serving. The most commonly used compounds are ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate. Timed release versions are available, as are formulations containing bioflavonoids such as <b>quercetin,</b> hesperidin, and rutin. In some countries, vitamin C as ascorbic acid crystals {{is available}} in bottles containing 300g to 1kg of powder. The bottles are usually airtight and brown or opaque {{in order to prevent}} oxidation. Vitamin C molecules can be bound to fatty acids, creating a compound described as esterified vitamin C. This is not the same process used to create a commercial product [...] "Ester-C" [...] which neutralizes ascorbic acid with calcium carbonate to create calcium ascorbate. Lastly, commercial supplements of liposomal vitamin C are marketed, but the bioavailability of such products is not sufficiently studied to determine any difference from other forms of vitamin C.|$|E
50|$|The anthraquinones chrysophanol, parietin and emodin, the {{flavonoids}} <b>quercetin,</b> fisetin, <b>quercetin</b> 3-0-rhamnoside, <b>quercetin</b> 3-0-galactoside and <b>quercetin</b> 3-0-rutinoside {{were isolated}} from the shoots of Syrian rhubarb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quercetin</b> 3-sulfate is a plasma human {{metabolite}} of <b>quercetin.</b> It is the sulfate conjugate of <b>quercetin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase is {{an enzyme}} that uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and <b>quercetin</b> 3-sulfate to produce {{adenosine}} 3',5'-bisphosphate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,3'-bissulfate. Quercetin-3-sulfate 4'-sulfotransferase is an enzyme that uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and <b>quercetin</b> 3-sulfate to produce adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,4'-bissulfate. Both enzymes {{can be found}} in Flaveria chlorifolia. Quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase is an enzyme that uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,3'-bissulfate to produce adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,7,3'-trissulfate. The enzyme {{can be found in}} Flaveria sp.|$|E

50|$|Minor UV {{blockers}} include <b>quercetin</b> 7-O-glycoside, <b>quercetin</b> itself, kaempferol glycoside, and feruloyl ester.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Quercetin</b> also {{activates}} or inhibits {{the activities}} {{of a number of}} proteins. [...] For example, <b>quercetin</b> is a non-specific protein kinase enzyme inhibitor. <b>Quercetin</b> has also been reported to have estrogenic (female sex hormone like) activities by activating estrogen receptors. <b>Quercetin</b> activates both estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ) with binding IC50s of 1015 nM and 113 nM respectively. Hence <b>quercetin</b> is somewhat ERβ selective (9 fold) and is roughly two to three orders of magnitude less potent than the endogenous estrogenic hormone 17β-estradiol. In human breast cancer cell lines, <b>quercetin</b> has also been found to act as an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER).|$|E
50|$|The enzyme <b>quercetin</b> 3-O-methyltransferase uses S-adenosyl {{methionine}} and <b>quercetin</b> {{to produce}} S-adenosylhomocysteine and isorhamnetin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quercetin</b> is the {{aglycone}} form of {{a number}} of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin and quercitrin, found in citrus fruit, buckwheat and onions. <b>Quercetin</b> forms the glycosides quercitrin and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose, respectively. Likewise guaijaverin is the 3-O-arabinoside, hyperoside is the 3-O-galactoside, isoquercitin is the 3-O-glucoside and spiraeoside is the 4′-O-glucoside. CTN-986 is a <b>quercetin</b> derivative found in cottonseeds and cottonseed oil. Miquelianin is the <b>quercetin</b> 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,3'-bissulfate, whereas its two {{products are}} adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,7,3'-trissulfate.|$|E
50|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>quercetin</b> {{in humans}} {{is low and}} highly variable (0-50%), and is rapidly cleared with an elimination half-life of 1-2 hours after ingesting <b>quercetin</b> foods or supplements. Following dietary ingestion, <b>quercetin</b> undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism that makes the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies unlikely to apply in vivo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quercetin</b> {{has been}} studied in basic {{research}} and small clinical trials. While <b>quercetin</b> supplements have been promoted {{for the treatment of}} cancer and various other diseases, {{there is no evidence that}} <b>quercetin</b> (via supplements or in food) is useful to treat cancer or any disease. The US FDA has issued warning letters to emphasize that <b>quercetin</b> is neither a defined nutrient nor an antioxidant, cannot be assigned a dietary content level, and is not regulated as a drug to treat any human disease.|$|E
50|$|In red onions, higher {{concentrations}} of <b>quercetin</b> {{occur in the}} outermost rings and in the part closest to the root, the latter being {{the part of the}} plant with the highest concentration. One study found that organically grown tomatoes had 79% more <b>quercetin</b> than non-organically grown fruit. <b>Quercetin</b> is present in various kinds of honey from different plant sources.|$|E
50|$|Quercetin-3-sulfate 3'-sulfotransferase is {{an enzyme}} that uses 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and <b>quercetin</b> 3-sulfate to produce {{adenosine}} 3',5'-bisphosphate and <b>quercetin</b> 3,3'-bissulfate. The enzyme {{can be found}} in F. chlorifolia.|$|E
50|$|In rats, <b>quercetin</b> did not undergo any {{significant}} phase I metabolism. In contrast, <b>quercetin</b> did undergo extensive phase II (conjugation) to produce metabolites {{that are more}} polar than the parent substance and hence are more rapidly excreted from the body. The meta-hydroxyl group of catechol is methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Four of the five hydroxyl groups of <b>quercetin</b> are glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The exception is the 5-hydroxyl group of the flavonoid ring which generally does not undergo glucuronidation. The major metabolites of orally absorbed <b>quercetin</b> are quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide, and quercetin-3'-sulfate.|$|E
