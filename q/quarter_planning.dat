It is developed using Java {{object oriented programming}} language and targeting at configuring the tower-type apartment in a dense area during early design stage. Rules are analyzed and formulated based on building code and zone ordinance. Moreover we develop an agent-based modelling with multi-objective optimization algorithm. In this modelling, each agent acts independently {{according to the rules}} that are designed to solve the complex geometric problems that are related to physical constraints. At the end, we present a simulation outcome of a case study...|$|E

40|$|Social {{ideas of}} the 20 th century, that {{had an impact on}} town-planning concepts, have lost their relevance. We have {{inherited}} huge urban territories built up in the form of microdistricts, which do not currently correspond to the idea of safe and decent life. Transition from building microdistricts to quarter site development has become the most radical change in the Russian urban policy. At the same time, there are certain problems of designing modern quarters both in the historical environment and in new territories. Unbuilt sites will likely house hybrids of microdistrict and <b>quarter</b> <b>planning.</b> In the historical centers of cities, building of quarters requires solution of transport problems, provision of pedestrian areas and creation of new architecture of high quality, which never copies buildings of previous epochs. Designing buildings ‘in the styles’, which is typical of the historical center development, does more harm to the cities than brand new architectural decisions of built-in structures...|$|E
40|$|The Big Sky Carbon Sequestration Partnership, led by Montana State University, is {{comprised}} of research institutions, public entities and private sectors organizations, and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Nez Perce Tribe. Efforts under this Partnership fall into four areas: evaluation of sources and carbon sequestration sinks; development of GIS-based reporting framework; designing an integrated suite of monitoring, measuring, and verification technologies; and initiating a comprehensive education and outreach program. At the first two Partnership meetings the groundwork {{was put in place}} to provide an assessment of capture and storage capabilities for CO{sub 2 } utilizing the resources found in the Partnership region (both geological and terrestrial sinks), that would complement the ongoing DOE research. During the third <b>quarter,</b> <b>planning</b> efforts are underway for the next Partnership meeting which will showcase the architecture of the GIS framework and initial results for sources and sinks, discuss the methods and analysis underway for assessing geological and terrestrial sequestration potentials. The meeting will conclude with an ASME workshop (see attached agenda). The region has a diverse array of geological formations that could provide storage options for carbon in one or more of its three states. Likewise, initial estimates of terrestrial sinks indicate a vast potential for increasing and maintaining soil C on forested, agricultural, and reclaimed lands. Both options include the potential for offsetting economic benefits to industry and society. Steps have been taken to assure that the GIS-based framework is consistent among types of sinks within the Big Sky Partnership area and with the efforts of other western DOE partnerships. Efforts are also being made to find funding to include Wyoming in the coverage areas for both geological and terrestrial sinks and sources. The Partnership recognizes the critical importance of measurement, monitoring, and verification technologies to support not only carbon trading but all policies and programs that DOE and other agencies may want to pursue in support of GHG mitigation. The efforts begun in developing and implementing MMV technologies for geological sequestration reflect this concern. Research is also underway to identify and validate best management practices for soil C in the Partnership region, and to design a risk/cost effectiveness framework to make comparative assessments of each viable sink, taking into account economic costs, offsetting benefits, scale of sequestration opportunities, spatial and time dimensions, environmental risks, and long-term viability. Scientifically sound information on MMV is critical for public acceptance of these technologies. Two key deliverables were completed in the second quarter [...] a literature review/database to assess the soil carbon on rangelands, and the draft protocols, contracting options for soil carbon trading. The protocols developed for soil carbon trading are unique and provide a key component of the mechanisms that might be used to efficiently sequester GHG and reduce CO 2 concentrations. While no key deliverables were due during the third quarter, progress on other deliverables is noted in the PowerPoint presentations and in this report. A series of meetings held during the second and third quarters have laid the foundations for assessing the issues surrounding carbon sequestration in this region, the need for a holistic approach to meeting energy demands and economic development potential, and the implementation of government programs or a market-based setting for soil C credits. These meetings provide a connection to stakeholders in the region and a basis on which to draw for the DOE PEIS hearings. A third Partnership meeting has been planned for August 04 in Idaho Falls; a preliminary agenda is attached...|$|E

The 1998 Bull Ring and Markets <b>Quarter</b> <b>Plan</b> contained guidance to the Digbeth and Deritend area. Large scale projects which involved the renovation, demolition and reparation of the area started to be aired to the public. The first of these projects to be completed was Millennium Point which was completed in 2002 to replace the Birmingham Science Museum. On 1 February 2002, a masterplan for the Eastside was developed by HOK International and this set out the basic developments.|$|R

The relaxed system is approximated using an upwind scheme converging for fixed relaxation time and vanishing discretization mesh. Further, we use Chapman-Enskog expansion to obtain a viscous scheme for the equilibrium law and prove its convergence to the physical solution. Boundary information is carefully handled in an appropriate inequality linking the entropy numerical flux and the flux function. An extension to general conservative schemes is also investigated...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, debate {{surrounding}} depictions of a ‘British disease’ of binge drinking in contrast to civil European drinking cultures has been a central feature of popular and political debate in the UK. This paper investigates {{the ways in which}} these drinking categories have been constructed and identifies how they have become key elements in the production and consumption of public space. Empirical findings are presented from a city in the UK to show how these labels are being translated into policy agendas through the construction of models of citizenship and ways of behaviour and operationalised through the designation and regulation of particular spaces via exclusion zones, <b>quartering,</b> <b>planning</b> and policing. The paper also highlights the ways in which discourses relating to British binge- and European-drinking are being adopted and interpreted by consumers and unpacks how this impacts on perception and experience of public space...|$|R

40|$|For new coal {{gasification}} systems, zinc-based sorbents {{are being developed}} to remove sulfur from the hot product gas prior to its use in combined-cycle gas turbines and high- temperature fuel cells. In general, the properties of these sorbents {{are considered to be}} very attractive, but there are still concerns about degradation of mechanical properties and sulfur capacity over many sulfidation- regeneration cycles. It is believed that containing zinc titanate in a matrix of excess titania could solve both problems, which is the objective of this project. During this <b>quarter,</b> <b>plans</b> were made for United Catalysts, Inc. to produce two batches of the sorbent using a commercial extrusion process. A subcontract was just issued to the Research Triangle Institute for sorbent characterization and for a 50 - cycle performance test designed to simulate the General Electric Company`s moving-bed reactor conditions.

40|$|In cloud computing, cloud {{providers}} {{can offer}} cloud consumers two provisioning plans for computing resources, namely reservation and on-demand plans. Reservation plan is cheaper than that provisioned by on-demand plan, since cloud consumer {{has to pay}} to provider in advance. By using reservation plan, the consumer can reduce the total resource provisioning cost. Even though, the best advance reservation of resources is difficult to be achieved due to uncertainty of consumer’s future demand and providers’ resource prices. Due to this problem, an optimal cloud resource provisioning (OCRP) algorithm is proposed by formulating a stochastic programming model. The OCRP algorithm can provision computing resources for being used in multiple provisioning stages {{as well as a}} longterm plan, e. g., four stages in a <b>quarter</b> <b>plan</b> and twelve stages in a yearly plan. The demand and price uncertainty is considered in OCRP. In this paper, different approaches are measured including deterministic equivalent formulation, sample-average approximation, and Benders decomposition in OCRP algorithm...|$|R
