25|$|This {{acceleration}} of the current {{takes place in the}} direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.|$|R

Microscopic and statistical analysis revealed that the general shape and the oral diameter remained practically constant in the whole area surveyed, despite a continuous length fluctuation of ca. 300 µm, which includes the entire range present in eight previously reported species. Consequently, we consider that the genus may be represented only by H. subulata, whose strong fluctuations in length (mostly attributed to an increase in the collar length), density and biomass seem to respond to temperature, food availability and front-related processes. In Buenos Aires coastal waters associated with a <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> estuarine front (40 - 40. 5 °S), mixed conditions would favour moderate abundances of long loricae, whereas in northern (42. 5 - 45. 5 °S) and southern (46 - 54. 5 °S) Patagonian waters, high (103 ind.

This area is characterized by a <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> background of terrigenous material from direct inputs, or resuspension effects, and by relatively intense spring phytoplankton blooms (mainly diatoms and the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis globosa). The bbp/bp surface values range between 0. 0024 and 0. 0417, with a mean value of 0. 0138 ± 0. 0083. In order to interpret such a great variability, simultaneous water samples were collected for the biogeochemical characterization of the bulk suspended particle population. We show that the bbp/bp variability is closely related to the composition of the particulate assemblage expressed by Chl, the POC/SPM and POC/Chl ratios, where Chl, POC, and SPM are the concentrations of chlorophyll a, particulate organic carbon and suspended particulate matter, respectively. The expected decrease of bbp/bp from mineral to phytoplankton dominated waters is confirmed from biogeochemical measurements, for the first time.

40|$|Bay of Bengal (BOB) is a semi {{enclosed}} tropical basin {{located in}} the north {{eastern part of the}} Indian Ocean with high influence of fresh water discharge from major rivers and rainfall. Bay of Bengal (BOB) is highly influenced by monsoons and represents a natural laboratory to study the effect of fresh water fluxes on the marine ecosystem. Bay of Bengal (BOB) is very low in productivity often with the observations of Phytoplankton Blooms. Phytoplankton blooms are one of the prominent features of biological variability in the coastal ecosystems such as estuaries, lagoons, bays, and tidal rivers with rapid production and accumulation of phytoplankton biomass in the ocean. These blooms usually respond to changing physical forcings originating in the coastal ocean like tides, currents and river runoff and to the atmospheric forcing like wind. These physical forcings have different timescales of variability, so algal blooms can be short-term episodic events, recurrent seasonal phenomena, or rare events associated with exceptional climatic or hydrologic conditions. Bloom events and their variability on spatial & temporal scales monitoring through field measurements is difficult. Based on this key hypothesis an effort is made to understand the seasonal and spatial variability of Phytoplankton Blooms along the East Coast of India. In this paper we present the bloom dynamics in their context to the chlorophyll concentration along with species composition and abundance in estuarine and near shore coastal waters of Godavari basin using Oceansat- 2 Ocean Colour Monitor (OCM).

40|$|The surface {{distribution}} of light attenuation due to particles (c) {{as well as}} chlorophyll-a and gelbstoff fluorescence (Fch and Fcd, respectively) were recorded during an OMEGA (EU funded, MAST III project) cruise in the northwestern Alborán Sea through a high spatial (zonally separated by 10 km and virtually meridionally continuous) and temporal (about 3 days between {{each of the three}} repeated surveys made in the zone) resolution sampling design. The distributions obtained for these variables were tightly linked to the physical forcing at the different scales that the sampling design was able to resolve. Low values dominate the <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> anticyclonic gyre occupying the western Alborán Sea, whereas the frontal zone directly affected by the entrance of the Atlantic jet depicts much higher records for c, Fch and Fcd. High geostrophic Froude numbers in the jet, and the subsequent increase in turbulence diffusion of nutrients towards the surface, cannot alone justify this spatial distribution. Instead, high phytoplankton concentration at the jet could also result from the entrainment and advection of water from the upwelling zone at the Spanish coast. However, T–S characteristics suggest that this is neither the most important process for the biological enrichment of the jet, so that other mechanisms such as vertical ageostrophic velocities {{at the edge of the}} gyre must also be considered. Due to the time needed for phytoplankton growth, the intense horizontal velocities associated to the jet can decouple the sectors where deep nutrient-rich waters reach the surface from sectors where high values of the recorded variables are observed. The decoupling hinders a differentiation of this fertilization mechanism from other possible alternatives as mixing at the sills in the Strait of Gibraltar. In the third survey, the spatial structure of surface warm waters in the gyre and cold waters in the front became less apparent. ADCP data show a southward migration of the jet in a fluctuation probably related to transient states in the Atlantic jet and western Alborán gyre system. The qualitative response of c, Fch and Fcd to these scales of variability was very similar and close to the changes observed in temperature. However, the values of Fcd varied in a much narrower range than c or Fch (a factor of 2 and 10, respectively), which indicates a distinct control for the abundance of Gelbstoff.

40|$|International audienceThe overall {{functioning}} of the Mediterranean Sea, which transforms Atlantic Water (AW) into Mediterranean Waters (MWs), has been comprehended for a while, {{and the process of}} dense water formation, which leads AW to sink offshore in specific northern zones of the western and the eastern basins, has been studied in the world ocean. However, the circulation of the various waters from/to the basins openings to/from the zones of sinking is still debated in the western basin, while a similar debate is only being initiated in the eastern one. The differences between the circulation schemas published up to now can be large and they have already been commented in papers recently published. To provide a coherent introductory chapter, only the authors' analysis is presented hereafter. Overall, and due to the Coriolis effect, all waters (AW and MWs) that circulate at basin scale tend to follow, in the counterclockwise sense, the isobaths at their own level. Hence they tend to describe, in both the western and the eastern basins, <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> gyres a few 10 s km thick and a few 1000 s km long along the continental slope. This simple schema is {{complicated by the fact that}} the southern parts of both gyres described by AW are markedly unstable, the AW inflow being hence identified with the so-called Algerian Current and Libyo-Egyptian Current and generating specific systems over the whole depth. Indeed, these currents (100 - 200 m deep) meander and generate, a few times per year, anticyclonic eddies that can reach diameters of 100 - 200 km (and even more), propagate downstream (i. e. eastward) at speeds up to a few km/day, and sometimes extend down to the bottom (2 - 3000 m). Hence, these eddies follow the deeper isobaths, separate from their parent current where these isobaths diverge from the upper continental slope, and drift for years (up to 3 at least) in the central part of the basins, possibly coming back shoreward where they interact with their parent current, sometimes in a dramatic way. These eddies entrain AW and MWs from the peripheral part of the basins towards their central part, together with eddies induced by the wind in the eastern basin only and having similar characteristics. In both basins, the northern parts of the gyres display specific features linking them to the zones of AW sinking, hence being identified (more easily in the western basin than in the eastern one due to the topography) with the so-called Northern Currents. In addition to these circulation features, and because the various openings are only a few 100 s m deep, the deeper MWs must be uplifted before outflowing. This is achieved permanently and more or less everywhere through continuous mixing with less dense waters and uplifting by newly formed denser waters. This is also achieved when and where intense mixing with other waters (cascading from sills or sinking) and sucking upward straits occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{conclusion of}} this investigation is that the inhibitory effect of plasma or serum on hemolysis by saponin and lysins of the same type is similar in nature to the inhibitory effects of certain sugars and electrolytes, which again {{are similar to the}} acceleratory effects produced by indol, benzene, and other substances already studied. All these effects, both inhibitory and acceleratory, are the result of reactions between the inhibitors or accelerators and those components of the red cell membrane which are broken down by lysins. The inhibitory effect of plasma on saponin hemolysis has a number of properties in common with the inhibition produced by sugars and electrolytes and with accelerations in general. (a) The temperature coefficient is small and negative. (b) The extent of the inhibition depends on the type of red cell used in the hemolytic system. (c) The most satisfactory measure of the extent of the inhibition, the constant R, {{is a function of the}} concentration of lysin in the system, and (d) R is a linear function of the quantity of inhibitor present. It is also shown that the inhibitory effect of plasma, and serum is not entirely dependent on its protein content. The process underlying the phenomenon of lysis and its acceleration or inhibition seems to be one in which the lysin reacts with a component or components of the cell membrane in such a way as to break down its semipermeability to hemoglobin, and in which the accelerator or inhibitor also reacts with the same component in such a way as to increase or decrease the effectiveness of the lysin in producing breakdown. The membrane is considered as being an ultrastructure made up of small areas or spots of varying degrees of resistance to breakdown, the resistances being distributed according to a negatively skew type of frequency curve, and the process of lysis seems to begin with the least resistant spots breaking down first. These spots may be arranged in some regular spatial pattern, and the membrane has also to be regarded as possessing spots of varying rigidity of form. The accelerator or inhibitor changes the resistance of every reactive spot in the ultrastructure by a factor R, which suggests that acceleration and inhibition are results of some over-all effect, such as that of changing the extent to which lysin is concentrated at the surface or partitioned between the material of the membrane and the surrounding fluid. Some kind of combination between the accelerator or inhibitor and the material of the ultrastructure is presumably involved; at first the combination seems to be a loose one and partly reversible, but later some of the loose links are replaced by more <b>permanent</b> <b>combinations</b> involving the same types of bond as are broken down by the lysins themselves...|$|R

This information was considered essential to assist the Government in making policy decisions and in establishing a national control programme, based on priority areas for agricultural development and, in particular, optimum levels of livestock productionOnce the project was initiated, it became apparent that project inputs and national resources would be insufficient to attain the overall objective, and project activities were revised to include data collection only in priority regions and an updating of the 1973 tsetse and trypanosomiasis distribution map. The project was also to look into using remote sensing as a survey aid, carry out practical in-service training and assess the quality of the information gatheredMaps were produced by the project, based on data collected in the Arusha and Dodoma Regions, to indicate the distribution and density of tsetse and human and animal trypanosomiasis, and to facilitate policy decisions on disease control. In terms of planning follow-up activities, it should be kept in mind that, owing to the difficulty in obtaining base maps, it can take considerable time to prepare these documents. Further, the project concluded that, at present, {{it would be impossible to}} mount the ground support needed to correlate remote sensing data with the actual situation. Also, remote sensing maps would be of little use, because the geographical maps needed to conduct tsetse field surveys were lackingOf the information that is currently available, the project found that it varied widely in accuracy. In addition, the reporting system used to convey information from the district to the ministry level resulted in a loss of information between the various reporting levels; as a consequence, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Development and Cooperatives (MALDC) authorities have been basing their policy decisions on incomplete data. The data collected by this project, however, the first effort of its kind in 20 years, would, once complete, enable the MALDC to plan a national tsetse and trypanosomiasis control strategyIn looking to the future, the project would recommend that reporting officers be instructed to preserve the original detail of the reports that they receive. A standardization of the report format would help to ensure that information was not lost or misinterpreted. Disease monitoring information, especially, must be precise. In addition, the preparation of a tsetse and trypanosomiasis distribution map for the entire Tanzanian mainland should be considered a matter of priorityThe project further recommended that the National Tsetse Control Committee (NTCC) direct its scarce resources toward identified priorities, in order to maximize the impact of these limited resources and effect meaningful action with specific activities. The Committee itself should be strengthened, and it should act as the policy-formulating body, as well as direct national activities and receive a mandate to seek external fundingThe Tsetse Control Section at MALDC headquarters, on the other hand, should become the tactical body for tsetse control in the country. The Section's officers should be released from administrative duties, in order to be able to devote more time to organizing and leading field surveys, drafting reports and providing feedback information to the NTCC.

30|$|To summarize, on {{the face}} of it, there have been some {{important}} changes in the field of legislation on employment protection, an institution that was considered highly path-dependent before the crisis. Overall, there is a trend {{in some of the most}} segmented countries towards lower dismissal costs for <b>permanent</b> workers in <b>combination</b> with a moderate (and sometimes ambiguous) re-regulation of temporary contracts. Overall, this tends to narrow the regulatory gap between permanent and temporary contracts at least to some extent. Nonetheless, have these changes contributed to reducing segmentation? Given that many of the reforms have only been implemented in the past three to 5  years—in a situation with limited labor demand in most of the countries—it might still be too early to evaluate their impact on hiring practices with currently available data. However, revisiting Fig.  1 casts some doubt on their effectiveness, showing that the share of temporary contracts has even increased in the countries that deregulated EPL during the crisis. Between 2010 and 2014, the share of workers aged 15 – 29 increased by roughly seven percentage points in Italy and Spain, three in France and Portugal and one in Greece. Of course, we do not have a counterfactual situation, thus making it difficult to assess the exact influence of the reforms.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, many {{developments}} {{in the field of}} the physical human robot interaction (pHRI) have been witnessed and significant attentions have been given to the subject of safety within the interactive environments. Ensuring the safety has led to the design of the robots that are physically unable to hurt humans. However, Such systems commonly suffer from the safety-performance trade-off. Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluids are a special class of fluids that exhibit variable yield stress with respect to an applied magnetic field. Devices developed with such fluids are known to provide the prerequisite requirements of intrinsic safe actuation while maintaining the dynamical performance of the actuator. In this study, a new concept for generating magnetic field in Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches is presented. The main rationale behind this concept is to divide the magnetic field generation into two parts using an electromagnetic coil and a permanent magnet. The main rationale behind this concept is to utilize a hybrid combination of electromagnetic coil and a <b>permanent</b> magnet. The <b>combination</b> of <b>permanent</b> magnets and electromagnetic coils in Hybrid Magneto-Rheological (HMR) clutches allows to distribute the magnetic field inside an MR clutch more uniformly. Moreover, The use of a permanent magnet dramatically reduces the mass of MR clutches for a given value of the nominal torque that results in developing higher torque-to-mass ratio. High torque-to-mass and torque-to-inertia ratios in HMR clutches promotes the use of these devices in human-friendly actuation...|$|R
40|$|Advances in laser cooling {{techniques}} {{have made it}} possible to prepare atomic samples with temperatures of a few micro-Kelvin or less. This stimulated the field of atom optics in which, in analogy to conventional light optics, atom clouds or single atoms are trapped, guided, reflected and diffracted. Magnetic reflectors have been fabricated from a number of materials, including magnetic information storage media. In this thesis we describe experiments manipulating a cold atom cloud by a curved magnetic reflector, fabricated from commercial videotape, in combination with external magnetic fields. The concave spherical shape gives rise to focussing and collimation of the reflected atom cloud. A cloud of typically 10 " 7 " 8 " 5 Rb atoms with a temperature of about 16 #mu#K is prepared in a magneto-optical trap and optical molasses. The cloud is released from a height of 27 mm, reflected off the horizontal magnetic reflector and refocused at its initial position. We utilize the refocused atom cloud to probe corrugations in the reflecting potential introduced by the addition of external magnetic fields. We investigate the atomic motion theoretically and experimentally under application of static, oscillating and rotating external magnetic fields. A static external field leads to splitting of the atom cloud at the position where it usually refocuses. The splitting can be controlled by the magnitude of the external field. For an oscillating external field the shape of the atom cloud is also governed by the oscillation frequency. Rotating external fields give rise to a reflecting potential with moving corrugations. Momentum is transferred to the atom cloud through ''surfing'' on the corrugations. This last experiment is an early demonstration of atom transport using magnetic potentials. The experiments described in this thesis demonstrate that although the magnetic reflector has <b>permanent</b> magnetisation, the <b>combination</b> with an external magnetic field provides an adaptable atom optics element.

40|$|Abstract Background Hemostasis is a {{critical}} and active function of the blood mediated by platelets. Therefore, the prevention of pathological platelet aggregation is of great importance {{as well as of}} pharmaceutical and medical interest. Endogenous platelet inhibition is predominantly based on cyclic nucleotides (cAMP, cGMP) elevation and subsequent cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase (PKA, PKG) activation. In turn, platelet phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and protein phosphatases counterbalance their activity. This main inhibitory pathway in human platelets is crucial for countervailing unwanted platelet activation. Consequently, the regulators of cyclic nucleotide signaling are of particular interest to pharmacology and therapeutics of atherothrombosis. Modeling of pharmacodynamics allows understanding this intricate signaling and supports the precise description of these pivotal targets for pharmacological modulation. Results We modeled dynamically concentration-dependent responses of pathway effectors (inhibitors, activators, drug combinations) to cyclic nucleotide signaling as well as to downstream signaling events and verified resulting model predictions by experimental data. Experiments with various cAMP affecting compounds including anti-platelet drugs and their combinations revealed a high fidelity, fine-tuned cAMP signaling in platelets without cross-talk to the cGMP pathway. The model and the data provide evidence for two independent feedback loops: PKA, which is activated by elevated cAMP levels in the platelet, subsequently inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC) but as well activates PDE 3. By multi-experiment fitting, we established a comprehensive dynamic model with one predictive, optimized and validated set of parameters. Different pharmacological conditions (inhibition, activation, drug <b>combinations,</b> <b>permanent</b> and transient perturbations) are successfully tested and simulated, including statistical validation and sensitivity analysis. Downstream cyclic nucleotide signaling events target different phosphorylation sites for cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKA, PKG) in the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). VASP phosphorylation as well as cAMP levels resulting from different drug strengths and combined stimulants were quantitatively modeled. These predictions were again experimentally validated. High sensitivity of the signaling pathway at low concentrations is involved in a fine-tuned balance as well as stable activation of this inhibitory cyclic nucleotide pathway. Conclusions On the basis of experimental data, literature mining and database screening we established a dynamic in silico model of cyclic nucleotide signaling and probed its signaling sensitivity. Thoroughly validated, it successfully predicts drug combination effects on platelet function, including synergism, antagonism and regulatory loops. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age. As the population ages, {{the burden of}} AF increases. AF is {{associated with an increased}} incidence of mortality, stroke, and coronary events compared to sinus rhythm. AF with a rapid ventricular rate may cause a tachycardia-related cardiomyopathy. Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be administered to reduce immediately a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nondrug therapies should be performed in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a <b>permanent</b> pacemaker in <b>combination</b> with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in patients with AF and symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds which are not drug-induced. Elective DC cardioversion has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of cardiac adverse effects than does medical cardioversion in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Unless transesophageal echocardiography has shown no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective DC or drug cardioversion of AF and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer, especially in elderly patients, ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than maintaining sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio of 2. 0 to 3. 0. Patients with AF at low risk for stroke or with contraindications to warfarin should be treated with aspirin 325 mg daily...|$|R
40|$|MAGNETIC {{bearings}} {{for large}} diameters and low rotational speeds are rarely developed and utilized due to poor competitive ability. They require little maintenance and offer high reliability, but until now mechanical bearings have outperformed them for slow rotating applications, only high speed applications {{have been able}} to justify the cost. With NdFeB magnets the quality of magnets has gone up and the cost down, making a new niche possible; large diameter ring bearings which can reduce the price and weight of the hub and bearing construction /: I (see chapter I). 	A literature study has been conducted to identify promising bearing technologies. One permanent magnet bearing, the PASF bearing, and one heteropolar self regulating electrodynamic bearing, the null flux bearing, were selected for further investigation /:II. PASF bearings are passive permanent magnet (PM) bearings employing change of magnetic reluctance to create force :/III. A. SLC is defined by Khoo et al. as the ratio between the maximum achievable force and the total self-weight of a magnetic bearing [4]. They claim PASF bearings can achieve a SLC up to 450 : 1, ten times higher than conventional repulsive bearings. With this in mind, we have tried to make a simple PASF bearing with better performance than the RPMB described in [19]. The bearings have been modelled in COMSOL and further evaluated in MATLAB /:VI. Results from the PASF computations showed an axial force shape of the PASF bearing very {{different from that of the}} RPMB. The axial force curve is steep in axial direction close to the center position:/ III. C. Axial force increases with radial displacement, as opposed to the RPMB. Stabilizing the PASF bearing might be difficult due to high radial stiffness /:VII. B. Axial PASF bearings work in both axial directions without tradeoffs between force and stiffness or concern of touching. It can be constructed to utilize the magnets in a range of the magnetization curve where they work at the maximum energy product [24] and where the risk of permanent demagnetization is minimal :/ III. C. 	Null flux coils are used in Maglev trains [1][2][3][13], and have also been utilized in flywheel bearings [5]. When they are situated in a desired centre position the sum of magnetic flux through the closed coil loop will be zero, and the coil will neither exert force nor consume power. When displaced from this position there will be a net flux passing through the coil. Moving the coil gives an alternating flux which will induce currents, giving a restoring force /:IV. A. Hence, null flux bearings require speed to function. 	Forces were calculated based on equations for induced currents and forces on currents in magnetic fields, as is also done in [5] and [1]/:IV. B. Two different drag force equations were found using two different methods. Identifying the right equation will later be done by measurements. Axial forces are proportional to axial displacement, while drag forces are proportional to the square of axial displacement. As a result of a trade off between induced current amplitude and coinciding current and magnetic flux density, maximum force occurs when the impedance angle is 45 degrees. The bearing initially suggested, which is to be built, will only produce 5 % of its own weight when displaced 2 mm/:IV. D. Connecting a given inductance in series with the existing ones increases the force to 77 % of the rotor weight. Speed also influences the performance of the bearing. 	The term unloader has been introduced by Lembke [18]. In theory this bearing gives a constant force and no stiffness, hence it does not contribute to bearing stability /:VII. A. It would be very practical in applications exposed to constant forces such as gravity. Calculations performed indicate that theory does not correspond to reality in our case :/V. Further investigation is of interest, but has not been carried out in this project. Earnshaws theorem [16] constitutes the basis for magnetic bearing stability theory. The consequence of the physics described in the theorem is that there is no method of stabilizing a fully levitated bearing with only permanent magnets /:VII. However, there are ways of stabilizing <b>permanent</b> magnet bearings. <b>Combinations</b> of a mechanical bearing, electromagnetic bearing, diamagnetic bearing or electrodynamic bearing and a permanent magnet bearing is not covered by the theorem. Stiffness is the change in force with respect to position. The sum of the bearing stiffnesses in all dimensions must be positive for a bearing to be stable/:VII. A. Earnshaw claims this is not possible for magnetic dipoles, and that the sum will always be zero. Our calculations neither confirmed, nor invalidated this allegation/:VII. B. A null flux bearing can contribute with a positive stiffness, making the sum positive. 	For measurement and verification purposes, two test jigs were planned and nearly completed /:VIII. The test jigs were constructed to allow axial force measurements with radial and axial displacement for both bearing types /:IX. AError! Reference source not found [...] Rotor and stator for both the PASF and null flux bearing were to be made of reinforced epoxy cast from the same moulds. This way the construction would be very strong, and changes in bearing design would be easy to implement in new casts:/ 0. Several aspects of the building process were expected to involve difficulties. Magnet mounting turned out to be easier than suspected. Two of the main challenges when moulding epoxy is air bubbles and releasing the cast from the mould. Air bubbles were practically avoided, but releasing the cast resulted in a broken mould, terminating the building process and postponing the measurements for the time being. 	A lot of work is still to be done. Finishing the moulding and assembling and performing the planned measurements are first in line. Further calculations on PASF bearings may include increasing the number of fingers and including back iron in the middle PASF finger. For the null flux bearing, varying the impedance of the coils by serial connecting inductances could improve the performance significantly. Investigating the dynamics of the null flux bearing is essential for further work on the bearing. Finally, combining a weak repulsive bearing with a null flux bearing to realise complete levitation might be feasible. </p...|$|R
