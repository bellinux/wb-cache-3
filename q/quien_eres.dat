The book is intended {{as a guide to}} giving people their own expanded awareness regarding their creative natures and purpose, with advice on managing and dealing with stressful situations, overcoming any addictions or challenges and how to take conscious control over the experience of one's life. It's laid out in a progressive movement, divided into [...] "what," [...] "why", [...] "how" [...] and [...] "who", in order to establish a foundation of an identity for the reader, concluding with a question and answer process for readers to learn more about themselves and what is possible for them. The book has also been published in Spanish under the title Yo Soy: El Poder de Descubrir <b>Quien</b> <b>Eres.</b> It's now available in 11 countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{intense and}} tragic climax was benefited by the weather, with a {{snowstorm}} {{that was not}} scheduled at all for the shooting, as producer, Pedro Costa, explained at the DVD commentaries. That scene filmed {{in front of the}} famous Burgos Cathedral was articulated around two popular Spanish Christmas carols, Dime, niño, de <b>quién</b> <b>eres</b> and La Marimorena, whose traditional cheerful melody, by contrast, is changed for the score into an elegiac and sad one. The score was composed by Jose Nieto, often working with Aranda (Intruso, Celos, Juana la Loca, Carmen) and the film editor was Aranda’s regular, his wife, Teresa Font. Equally noteworthy is the film’s striking cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine, with whom Aranda had previously worked on no fewer than five films. Alcaine is especially adept at evoking the “sooty” look of Madrid winters, which convey the somber qualities of urban life {{during the early years of}} Franco’s dictatorship.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} fifteen years Alzheimer's disease (AD) has changed the way in which {{developed}} countries have tended to perceive and deal with ageing. It has also become the main health problem needing to be resolved in both financial and social terms. If cancer was considered and labelled as the epidemic of the twentieth century, AD has soon been designated as the epidemic of the twenty-first century. This article analyses how AD is perceived and represented in two films, Amanecer de un sueño, directed in 2008 by Freddy Mas Franqueza, and ¿Y tú <b>quién</b> <b>eres?,</b> directed in 2007 by Antonio Mercero. As for ageing, questions of stigmatization and stereotyping around AD are discussed, and special consideration is given to the manner in which medical, social and political institutions in Spain have created a monolithic view of AD with the purpose of shaping a homogeneous social response to the disease. Current debates between those who perceive the disease as a social burden for the State and the family, and those who defend centring the discussion on the persons diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and their personhoods frame the analysis of these two films. © W.

40|$|The cinema {{has always}} been seduced {{by the loss of}} memory and its 			consequences. However, the amnesia portrayed on the big screen is 			generally more related to head {{injuries}} than to degenerative 			diseases, and the health problems that are of such great importance 			in today’s society, such as Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 			of degenerative origin, have tended to receive far less attention. 			 			 			             			The gradual ageing of the general population as from the middle of 			the last century has meant that this pathology has now become an 			almost “normal” part of our lives, with its all too tragic 			socio-economic and family consequences. Here, an attempt is made to 			reflect on this, taking advantage of the recent work by Antonio 			Mercero “ ¿Y tú <b>quién</b> <b>eres?</b> ” (And Who Are You?), which 			can be seen to fill a lagoon present in the Spanish cinema as 			regards these issues. 			 			             			Outside Spain, two directors have become deeply involved with 			Alzheimer’s disease: Juan José Campanella, with Son of the Bride/ 			El hijo de la Novia, and Richard Eyre, with Iris. Here we 			compare the work of Mercero with these latter two films from 2001 in 			the hope that films addressing with the problems of old age will 			arouse interest in developed countries. </p...|$|E
40|$|As the Latino {{population}} grows, {{mental health}} and social service providers are challenged {{to meet the needs}} of this unique and diverse group. As clinicians we are engaged in an inter-subjective experience to acquire knowledge and understanding of the person before us. Our person-in-context lens and how we apply it is only as expansive and/or limited as our professional knowledge base allows. Although researchers in the psychological and behavioral sciences have briefly explored the impact of gender socialization within the Latino communities, known as machismo and marianismo, as it relates to clinical practice implications, empirical inquiry remains limited. Furthermore, the breadth of inquiry on machismo has focused primarily on how it relates to Latino men. Machismo, as an intricate part of the home and the culture, directly affects Latina women and their development. This qualitative study aimed to acquire an in-depth understanding of the lived experience of Latina women with machismo, and its impact on identity development. USing an intensive interview in-depth approach, the researcher conducted one individual sixty-minute interview with each of the twelve participants. The participants narratives revealed three main constructs: <b>Quien</b> <b>Eres</b> (Who You Are) relating to their ascribed social identity, Quien Soy (Who I Am) relating to their self-concepts, and El Choque (The Clash) that takes place between the two. The participants 2 ̆ 7 narratives also illustrated a responsive process to El Choque highlighting five major themes: 1) questioning machista principles, 2) increased awareness of self and machismo, 3) internal/external intolerance and confrontation of machista principles and behaviors, 4) defiant and rebellious behaviors, and 5) beliefs of equality and independence. Implications for practice and research are discussed. Further research is necessary and encouraged...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation examines the new relationships {{between women and}} crime developed in female-authored Spanish neo-noir cinema. After tracing the origins and transformations of classical and Spanish noir, {{as well as the}} survival of the femme fatale archetype in hegemonic cinema, I proceed to examine the films Beltenebros and Sé <b>quién</b> <b>eres,</b> as they are representative of a filmic body that deconstructs and subverts many of the traditional visual, narrative, and discursive conventions of this subgenre. I argue that the first film questions the mechanisms of female representations that have led to a “masculinization” of the genre, as well as the bearer of a patriarchal culture and ideology. The second film offers a shift in the gender/genre paradigm. The female subject is given narrative agency and professional authority to investigate the crimes and to demand collective and institutional action towards re-building a truly democratic society. Finally, these projects reflect on the ambiguity and validity of discourses that build upon and review Spain’s Francoist violent past, the fraudulent period of the Transition, and the political disillusionment caused by the Pact of Forgetting, leading the country to a collective historical amnesia. The second part of the Dissertation moves forward in the examination of contemporary representations of female figures of power through the inclusion of violent and criminal subjects. This new and debatable identity makes it difficult for a full recognition from the spectator, since her criminal motives are unjustified or they do not receive a satisfactory moral reasoning on behalf of the audience. I analyze the paradigmatic example of Ryu, the female protagonist in the film Map of the Sounds of Tokyo who works as a hit woman. This Dissertation argues that the existence of this criminal figure contributes {{to the development of a}} cultural space of female agency and to the fight against representations of female victimization. Each of the three projects analyzed in this research project offers significant differences from one another. Notwithstanding, they share a common denominator: they break away with the femme fatal stereotype and its counterpart, the “ángel del hogar” figure. All in all, I propose that these works reflect the evolving process that the female subject is undergoing in contemporary Spanish crime fiction. Furthermore, in an effort to redefine the history of Spain and reflect on the new and multiple roles of women in today´s society, these films bring to light an initial process of de-masculinization of the genre, followed by one of feminization, and maturing into what I have termed a gynocriminal tradition, which is part of a broader feminist project within female-authored Spanish crime fiction...|$|E
