40|$|Nonlinear {{processes}} are commonly invoked {{to describe a}} wide range of phenomena in both space plasmas and laboratory plasmas, allowing wave energy in a particular mode to be transferred to different modes. Relevant processes include three-wave interactions and nonlinear wave-particle scattering. The strength of the wave coupling—and hence the nonlinear rates—for these processes is determined by the <b>quadratic</b> <b>response</b> tensor. The general expression for this tensor involves a number of velocity-space integrals of the velocity distribution function and denominators related to the Cerenkov resonance between waves and particles. Due to the difficulty of evaluating these integrals they are typically approximated by making assumptions about the phase speeds of the waves. However, the ranges of validity for these approximations are unclear, and the resulting approximate <b>quadratic</b> <b>response</b> tensors and nonlinear rates may be inaccurate in some regimes. Conversely, an exact expression for the <b>quadratic</b> <b>response</b> tensor of an unmagnetized Maxwellian plasma has been derived previously in terms of generalized plasma dispersion functions. This expression is valid for any phase speeds of the waves, but its length and complexity prevents its use in the calculation of nonlinear rates. What is lacking in the literature are more accurate explicit expressions for the <b>quadratic</b> <b>response</b> tensor that are appropriate for nonlinear rate calculations, from which also the accuracy of the typical approximations can be assessed. This thesis presents new, more accurate analytical expressions for the <b>quadratic</b> <b>response</b> tensor for various second-order processes in unmagnetized plasmas, and analytical and numerical calculations of the corresponding nonlinear rates. Comparisons are then made between these new nonlinear rates and the previous approximate rates, allowing the accuracy of the previous rates to be assessed and sharper bounds placed on their regimes of validity for the first time...|$|E

40|$|Adding {{sugar to}} the diet has been {{reported}} to improve production in dairy cows. In each of 2 trials, 48 lactating Holsteins (8 with ruminal cannulas) were fed covariate diets for 2 wk, blocked by days in milk into 12 groups of 4, and then randomly assigned to diets based on alfalfa silage containing 4 levels of dried molasses (trial 1) or liquid molasses (trial 2). In both studies, production data were collected for 8 wk, ruminal samples were taken in wk 4 and 8, and statistical models were used that included covariate means and block. In trial 1, experimental diets contained 18 % CP and 0, 4, 8, or 12 % dried molasses with 2. 6, 4. 2, 5. 6, or 7. 2 % total sugar. With increasing sugar, there was a linear increase in dry matter intake (DMI), and digestibility of dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM), but no effect on yield of milk or protein. This resulted in linear decreases in fat-corrected milk (FCM) /DMI and milk N/N-intake. There was a linear decrease in urinary N with increasing sugar, and quadratic effects on milk fat content, yield of fat and FCM, and ruminal ammonia. Mean optimum from these <b>quadratic</b> <b>responses</b> was 4. 8 % total sugar in these diets. In trial 2, experimental diets contained 15. 6 % crude protein (CP) and 0, 3, 6, or 9 % liquid molasses with 2. 6, 4. 9, 7. 4, or 10. 0 % total sugar, respectively. Again, there were linear declines in FCM/DMI and milk N/ N-intake with increasing sugar, but <b>quadratic</b> <b>responses</b> for DMI, yield of milk, protein, and SNF, digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber, milk urea, urinary excretion of purine derivatives, and ruminal ammonia.

The gate in a conventional (field-effect) transistor determines the conductance between the source and drain electrode by controlling the density of charge carriers between them, whereas the gate in a single-molecule transistor controls {{the possibility of a}} single electron to jump on and off the molecule by modifying the energy of the molecular orbitals.

Earlier electrophysiological studies have made use of piecewise linear characterization of voltage clamped neurons, which consists of a sequence of linear admittances computed at different voltage levels. In this paper, the linear approach is extended to a piecewise quadratic characterization in two different ways. First, an analytical model is derived with power series following the work pionneered by Fitzhugh.

In addition, a new implicit power iteration algorithm is developed to find the optimal projection space and solve for the unknown model coefficients.
