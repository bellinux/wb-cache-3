5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline <b>quartz</b> were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first <b>quartz</b> crystal oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first <b>quartz</b> clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of <b>quartz</b> clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a <b>quartz</b> clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on <b>quartz</b> clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first <b>quartz</b> wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of <b>quartz</b> clocks and watches.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of <b>quartz</b> have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several <b>quartz</b> xenocrysts and polycrystalline <b>quartz</b> xenoliths in a glassy matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|The {{pendulum}} clock {{remained the}} most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when <b>quartz</b> oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made <b>quartz</b> clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches.|$|E
5|$|The predominate rock type is a white, coarse-grained, foliated {{hornblende}} tonalite. Minerals in the tonalite are <b>quartz,</b> plagioclase, alkali feldspar and hornblende.|$|E
5|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to use <b>quartz</b> crystal filters, {{especially}} for narrowband filtering applications. The signal exists as a mechanical acoustic wave while it is in the crystal and is converted by transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains at the terminals of the crystal.|$|E
5|$|It {{was quickly}} {{realized}} that a glass dispersive prism was not suitable {{for use in the}} ultraviolet spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a <b>quartz</b> prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} 1975 tournament, the common beige {{sand in the}} bunkers was {{replaced}} with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a <b>quartz</b> derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{matter in}} oil shale {{contains}} fine-grained silicate and carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, siderite, <b>quartz,</b> rutile, orthoclase, albite, anorthite, muscovite, amphipole, marcasite, limonite, gypsum, nahcolite, dawsonite and alum. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals such as vanadium, zinc, copper, uranium among others.|$|E
5|$|Phenocrysts include {{plagioclase}} in andesite {{with smaller}} amounts of amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. Apatite and zircon form accessory minerals. Dacites have similar composition but also contain hornblende. Olivine {{is found in}} the andesites and <b>quartz</b> in the dacites.|$|E
5|$|Sampling of soil {{formed on}} the Marcellus bedrock showed the {{dominant}} mineralogy consisted of <b>quartz,</b> illite, montmorillonite, muscovite, and biotite, with phases of todorokite and trona appearing at depths {{closer to the}} bedrock.|$|E
5|$|Sunglasses: The first {{sunglasses}} {{were invented}} in 12th century China when medieval Chinese magistrates wore smoke-colored lenses to conceal {{their eyes and}} feelings during trials while questioning the witnesses and accused. They were a crude slab of smoked <b>quartz</b> that was made {{to block out the}} light from the sun.|$|E
5|$|The Basin area is {{underlain}} by the <b>quartz</b> monzonite of the Boulder Batholith. The batholith is overlain by dacite {{from the}} Paleogene and Neogene periods (roughly 66million to 1.8million years ago) and andesite {{from the late}} Cretaceous. The andesite and monzonite are cut by dikes of dacite and rhyolite.|$|E
5|$|Tufa {{deposits}} {{formed in}} the lake. The continental environment Pleistocene sediments were formed from lacustrine carbonate deposits. These rocks contain amphibole, clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite and smectite, feldspar, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, pyroxene and <b>quartz.</b> The composition of these rocks resembles that of the Altiplano soils.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} rock {{are found in}} the pass and its vicinity. <b>Quartz</b> {{monzonite}} forms many of the cliffs, while the crags are biotite gneiss. The glaciation, which dates to as recently as 12,000 years ago, smoothed much of the rock to the point of it being slippery.|$|E
5|$|When {{the bust}} was first discovered, no piece of <b>quartz</b> to {{represent}} the iris of the left eyeball was present, as in the other eye, and none was found despite an intensive search and a then significant reward of £5 being put up for information regarding its whereabouts. Borchardt assumed that the <b>quartz</b> iris of the left eye had fallen out when the sculptor Thutmose's workshop fell into ruin. The missing eye led to speculation that Nefertiti may have suffered from an ophthalmic infection, and actually lost her left eye, though {{the presence of an}} iris in other statues of her contradicted this possibility.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} Omega Seamaster <b>Quartz</b> Professional watch {{features as}} a major plot device {{several times in the}} film. It is shown to contain a remote detonator and a laser. This was the first time James Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega, and the character has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production.|$|E
5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a <b>quartz</b> glass portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|At Ring Mountain, {{andesite}} comprises 70% brown {{volcanic glass}} and vesicular textures {{as much as}} 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of <b>quartz</b> are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's <b>quartz,</b> Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's <b>quartz</b> is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|Chad's {{currency}} is the CFA franc. In the 1960s, the Mining industry of Chad produced sodium carbonate, or natron. There {{have also been}} reports of gold-bearing <b>quartz</b> in the Biltine Prefecture. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include <b>quartz,</b> cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key piece of evidence is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of <b>quartz</b> diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E
5|$|Germanium {{differs from}} silicon {{in that the}} supply {{is limited by the}} {{availability}} of exploitable sources, while the supply of silicon is limited only by production capacity since silicon comes from ordinary sand and <b>quartz.</b> While silicon could be bought in 1998 for less than $10 per kg, the price of germanium was almost $800 per kg.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to <b>quartz</b> glass, so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and <b>quartz.</b> However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|Hamersley's soil is an {{infertile}} yellow-brown sand {{composed of}} fine to coarse <b>quartz</b> grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, {{it is almost}} certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Han luxury items {{furnished}} {{the homes}} of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such goods were often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic wares with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, <b>quartz,</b> gold, and silver.|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and <b>quartz</b> {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and <b>quartz</b> were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include goethite, ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, <b>quartz,</b> muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
5|$|Now an outlaw, McTeague {{returns to}} Placer County and teams {{up with a}} {{prospector}} named Cribbens. Headed towards Death Valley, they find a large quantity of <b>quartz</b> and plan to become millionaires. Before they can begin mining, McTeague senses danger and flees into Death Valley with a single horse, the remaining money and one water jug. Several marshals pursue him, joined by Schouler. Schouler wants to catch McTeague personally and rides into Death Valley alone.|$|E
5|$|On the Olympic Peninsula the Blue Mountain unit at {{the base}} of the Crescent Formation {{includes}} sediments (including large boulders of <b>quartz</b> diorite) of continental origin, showing that the continent was close by; other sediments were eroded from the pre-Cenozoic rock of Vancouver Island and the northern Cascade Range. At the southern end are sediments derived from the Klamath Mountains, while sand of the overlying Tyee Formation has an isotopic composition corresponding to rock of the Idaho Batholith.|$|E
5|$|Riesling is a {{versatile}} wine for pairing with food, {{because of its}} balance of sugar and acidity. It can be paired with white fish or pork, {{and is one of}} the few wines that can stand up to the stronger flavours and spices of Thai and Chinese cuisine. A Riesling's typical aromas are of flowers, tropical fruits, and mineral stone (such as slate or <b>quartz),</b> although, with time, the wine acquires a petrol note as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{discovery}} in Scotland of a 4000-year-old tomb with burial treasures at Forteviot, near Perth, {{the capital of}} a Pictish Kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries AD, is unrivalled anywhere in Britain. It contains the remains of an early Bronze Age ruler laid out on white <b>quartz</b> pebbles and birch bark. It was also discovered {{for the first time}} that early Bronze Age people placed flowers in their graves.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, although {{it was only in}} the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing <b>quartz</b> clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{result is}} a ceramic that is mainly {{composed}} of silica and alumina, with other ingredients such as <b>quartz</b> sand. The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration. The bricks may vary in color depending {{on the amount of}} iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used, and the amount of oxygen in the kiln.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the ash is evidenced by its distinctive mineralogy–the ash was deposited directly upon the water, so its angular <b>quartz</b> grains differ from the clastic sediments rounded through the erosion process that carries them to the sea. As the volcanic ash settled to the bottom, it was admixed with these terrigenous components, producing a distinctive lithology in the sedimentary rock.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated <b>quartz</b> tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500°C. This green solid has a melting point of 600°C, and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride. Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase.|$|E
