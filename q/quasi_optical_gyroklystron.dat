On 1 June 1894, after the death of Hertz, British physicist Oliver Lodge gave a memorial lecture on Hertz experiments. He set up a demonstration on the <b>quasi</b> <b>optical</b> nature of Hertzian waves (radio waves) and demonstrated their transmission at distances up to 50 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer, a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When received waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the coherer became conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it, with the impulse being picked up by a mirror galvanometer. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer had to be reset by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received.

These mixers were tested at 100 and 530 GHz LO {{for a range}} of temperatures around 77 K. The conversion gain of - 32 dB was measured at an LO power of about 1 mW (530 GHz) and 0. 3 GHz IF. The mixers were integrated with a logarithmic spiral antenna on a silicon lens, providing a broad frequency coverage (well above 1 THz). To measure the incident RF signal power we used the homodyne responsivity (see abstract "Terahertz response of YBCO HEB homodyne detectors") which is referenced to the input of the silicon lens where the bolometers were glued. Corrections were made for losses in the cryostat window and polarization losses between the signal and antenna.

40|$|The NSTX upgrade has {{provided}} the impetus to redesign and improve the High-k Scattering System. Improvements will include increased kθ coverage to target Electron Temperature Gradient (ETG) modes. Improved kθ resolution is realized by increasing the probe frequency from 280 to 693 GHz. Current solid state sources cannot deliver sufficient power at this frequency. Availability of current sources is limited to about 300 GHz and 30 mW; therefore, an optically pumped Far Infrared (FIR), formic acid laser has been chosen which can deliver upwards of 100 mW at 693 GHz. A second high frequency source is needed to provide local oscillator (LO) power for an array of <b>quasi</b> <b>optical</b> mixers.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{is to develop a}} system for the stand-o {{detection}} (typically ten metres) of concealed body-worn explosives. The system must be capable of detecting a layer of explosive material hidden under clothing and distinguishing explosives from everyday objects. Millimetre wave radar is suitable for this application. Millimetre Waves are suitable because they are not signi cantly attenuated by atmospheric con- ditions and clothing textiles are practically transparent to this radiation. Detection of explosive layers from a few mm in thickness to a few cm thickness is required. A <b>quasi</b> <b>optical</b> focussing element is required to provide su cient antenna directivity to form a narrow, highly directional beam of millimetre waves, which can be directed and scanned over the person being observed. A system of antennae and focussing optics has been modelled and built using designs from nite element analysis (FEA) software. Using the developed system, represen- tative data sets have been acquired using a Vector Network Analyser (VNA) to act as transmitter and receiver, with the data saved for processing at a later time. A novel data analysis algorithm using Matlab has been developed to carry out Fourier Transforms of the data and then perform pattern matching techniques using arti cial neural networks (ANN's). New ways of aligning and sorting data have been found using cross-correlation to order the data by similar data slices and then sorting the data by amplitude to take the strongest 50 % of data sets. The signi cant contribution to knowledge of this project will be a system which can be eld tested and which will detect a layer of dielectric at a stando distance, typically of ten metres, and signal processing algorithms which can recognise the di erence 17 between the response of threat and non-threat objects. This has partially been achieved by the development of focussing optics to acquire data sets which have then been aligned by cross-correlation, sorted and then used to train a pattern matching technique using neural networks. This technique has shown good results in di erentiating between a person wearing simulated explosives and a person not carrying simulated explosives. Further work for this project includes acquiring more data sets of everyday objects and training the neural network to distinguish between threat objects and non-threat objects. The operational range also needs increasing using either a larger aperture optical element or a similarly sized Cassegrain antenna. The system needs adapting for real time use with the data processing techniques developed in Matlab.

The interest in studying this kind of systems has recently grown due {{to the development of}} innovative experimental techniques that made possible the confinement of particles in <b>quasi</b> one-dimensional <b>optical</b> lattices weakly interacting with the environment. These properties can be explored using a quantum quench: we prepare the system in the ground state of a given hamiltonian, then we suddenly change a parameter and let it evolve unitarly. There are mainly two types of quantum quenches: local and global We consider a global quantum quench in a confined one dimensional bosonic gas. We show that relaxation occurs in slightly different manner than in the periodic case: the stationary correlation function "feels'' the boundaries also in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore we find a compact expression for the time dependent density profile and for the fermionic correlation function. Both functions describe the non equilibrium behavior of the system. The solutions of the confined problem present difficulties which were absent in the periodic case. These have been overcome by some ingenious approximations which become exact in the thermodynamical limit, thus providing the analytical solution to the problem. In the course of the computation numerical analysis is often used as a support. We found out that the long-time state of the confined system is translationally invariant (we demonstrated that non translationally invariant corrections are finite-size effects), in particular the stationary density profile is the same as in the homogeneous case, as naively expected. But the effects of the confinement are visible both in the stationary two point correlation function and in the non trivial evolution of the density profile...|$|R
40|$|Non-reciprocal devices, with one-way {{transport}} properties, form a {{key component}} for isolating and controlling light in photonic systems. Optomechanical systems have emerged as a potential platform for optical non-reciprocity, due to ability of a pump laser to break time and parity symmetry in the system. Here we consider how the non-reciprocal behavior of light can also impact the transport of sound in optomechanical devices. We focus {{on the case of}} a <b>quasi</b> one dimensional <b>optical</b> ring resonator with many mechanical modes coupled to light via the acousto-optic effect. The addition of disorder leads to finite diffusion for phonon transport in the material, largely due to elastic backscattering between clockwise and counter-clockwise phonons. We show that a laser pump field, along with the assumption of high quality-factor, sideband-resolved optical resonances, suppresses the effects of disorder and leads to the emergence of chiral diffusion, with direction-dependent diffusion emerging in a bandwidth similar to the phase-matching bandwidth for Brillouin scattering. A simple diagrammatic theory connects the observation of reduced mechanical linewidths directly to the associated phonon diffusion properties, and helps explain recent experimental results.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new generation of submillimeter wave receivers aimed at future integrated array receivers and presents astronomical observations taken with a single element of such a new receiver in the submillimeter wavelength band. The technological development presented in this thesis was driven by the need to develop heterodyne receivers based on superconductor- insulator-superconductor (SIS) detectors, which have proven to be the most sensitive detectors in the millimeter and low submillimeter band, and that are suitable for the construction of array receivers. A <b>quasi</b> [...] <b>optical</b> approach was chosen in order to take advantage of the planar photolithography used in SIS diode manufacturing. This allows straightforward integration with planar antennas. The introductory chapter describes an initial receiver design, based on a planar logarithmic spiral antenna, that was an improvement over existing quasi-optical designs using planar antennas. This receiver was the first submillimeter SIS receiver ever to be used for astronomical observations. However, it also showed that two major problems still had to be overcome to develop this technology to the mature state where array receivers can be designed. The beam of an individual element, launched by the planar antenna, has to be of high quality - comparable to that of a waveguide hom antenna - to provide good coupling to a telescope. Second, the impedance of the SIS detector, dominated by its capacitance, has to be matched to the antenna's impedance over the operating range of the receiver. The optics problem was solved by introducing a novel antenna design called the hybrid antenna. The hybrid antenna is defined as a dielectric lens-antenna as a special case of an extended hemispherical dielectric lens that is operated in the diffraction limited regime. It is a modified version of the planar antenna on a lens scheme developed by Rutledge. The dielectric lens- antenna is fed by a planar-structure feed antenna and the combination of the two is termed a hybrid antenna. Beam pattern and aperture efficiency measurements were made at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths as a function of extension of the hemispherical lens and different lens sizes. An optimum extension distance is found experimentally and theoretically for which excellent beam patterns and simultaneously high aperture efficiencies can be achieved. At 115 GHz the aperture efficiency was measured to be (76 ± 5) ...|$|R

Using SALT observations carried out on 5 th and 6 th March, 2014, we detect some interesting reprocessing signatures. We detect a weak <b>optical</b> <b>Quasi</b> Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in the power density spectrum on March 5 th at 48 mHz with a fractional rms of 3. 3 % {{in spite of the}} fact that source shows no corresponding X-ray QPO in the spin-up phase. In the light curve obtained on March 5 th, we detect a coherent pulsation at the spin period of ~ 7. 677 s. A previously known, slightly down-shifted side-band is also detected at 129. 92 mHz. The frequency spacing between main pulse and this side-band is different from earlier observations, though the statistical significance of the difference is limited. The light curve of 6 th March displays short time-scale variability in the form of flares on timescales of a few minutes. Folded pulse profiles resulting from data of this night show an interesting trend of pulse peak drifting. This drift could be due to i) rapid changes in the reprocessing agent, like orbital motion of an accretion disk warp around the neutron star or ii) intrinsic pulse phase changes in X-rays. We also examine some X-ray light curves obtained with RXTE-PCA during 2008 - 2010 for pulse shape changes in short time scales during X-ray flares. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
