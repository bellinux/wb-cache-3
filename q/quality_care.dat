Residents of Texas, which did not accept the Medicaid expansion, did not see a similar improvement during the same period. Kentucky opted for increased managed care, while Arkansas subsidized private insurance. The new Arkansas and Kentucky governors have proposed reducing or modifying their programs. Between 2013 and 2015, the uninsured rate dropped from 42% to 14% in Arkansas and from 40% to 9% in Kentucky, compared with 39% to 32% in Texas.

40|$|Healthcare {{quality in}} the United States of America (USA) {{is the subject of}} intense criticism. Although <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> is vital to patient {{outcomes}} and safety, meaningful quality improvements have been disturbingly slow and incremental. Practicing nurses are rarely involved in developing improvement programs and their definitions of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> have not been known. The lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> for practicing nurses was unknown and not addressed in the literature. A premise of this study was that effective efforts to improve <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> must be meaningful and relevant to nurses. It was proposed that uncovering the lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> would facilitate development of effective improvement approaches. The {{purpose of this study was}} to uncover the lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> for nurses practicing in acute care hospitals. This lived meaning was revealed through analysis of practicing nurse interviews using van Manen's (1990) hermeneutic phenomenology, a research approach designed to explore and uncover the lived meaning of pragmatic experiences. The research question asked: "What is the lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> for practicing nurses in the USA?" Participants were 12 nurses practicing on medical or surgical adult units at general or intermediate levels of care within acute care hospitals who participated in semi-structured interviews. Emerging themes were discovered through empirical and reflective analysis of audiotapes and transcripts. The lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> for practicing nurses was meeting human needs through caring, empathetic, respectful interactions within which responsibility, intentionality, and advocacy form an essential, integral foundation. The lived experience of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> resided within nurse-patient interactions. The lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> for these practicing nurses was within the art of nursing rather than the science of nursing. Practicing nurses, managers, administrators, educators, researchers, and policy makers may use these findings to further define the discipline of nursing and to facilitate practice changes, driving improvements in the <b>quality</b> of nursing <b>care.</b> Future studies based on this understanding of the lived meaning of <b>quality</b> nursing <b>care</b> could begin to address this focus in an effort to improve <b>quality</b> patient <b>care...</b>|$|R
30|$|Given {{the growing}} aged care population, the {{complexity}} of their medication-related needs and increased risk of adverse drug events, there is a necessity to systematically monitor and manage medication-related <b>quality</b> of <b>care.</b> <b>Quality</b> of <b>care</b> is traditionally evaluated using indicators which target the most relevant aspects of healthcare (Arah et al. 2006; Mainz 2003).

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{socioeconomic}} factor of health disparities, race is another key factor. The United States historically had large disparities {{in health and}} access to adequate healthcare between races, and current evidence supports the notion that these racially centered disparities continue to exist and are a significant social health issue. The disparities in access to adequate healthcare include differences {{in the quality of}} care based on race and overall insurance coverage based on race. A 2002 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association identifies race as a significant determinant in the level of quality of care, with blacks receiving lower <b>quality</b> <b>care</b> than their white counterparts. This is in part because members of ethnic minorities such as African Americans are either earning low incomes, or living below the poverty line. In a 2007 Census Bureau, African American families made an average of $33,916, while their white counterparts made an average of $54,920. Due to a lack of affordable health care, the African American death rate reveals that African Americans have a higher rate of dying from treatable or preventable causes. According to a study conducted in 2005 by the Office of Minority Health—a U.S. Department of Health—African American men were 30% more likely than white men to die from heart disease. Also African American women were 34% more likely to die from breast cancer than their white counterparts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{if there}} is a link between <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in the Norwegian nursing home industry and exposure of the industry to competition. Exposing public care to competition implies that the responsibility for providing care services is shared between public authorities and private actors. In Norway, exposure to competition means tender competition. Suppliers bid for a contract issued by the Norwegian authorities for a limited number of years. <b>Quality</b> of <b>care</b> in an institution is the major competitive factor. The provider categories of elderly care are: 1) care provided by institutions run by municipalities, 2) care provided by institutions run by private companies, which have won a tender competition, 3) care provided by institutions run by private companies owned by private families, voluntary religious or idealistic organizations. Nurse-to-patient ratio is used as a proxy for <b>quality</b> of <b>care.</b> The regression analysis indicates a relationship between <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> and exposure to competition. The <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in provider category 2 is significantly lower than in provider category 1, but there are more variations in the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in provider category 1 than in provider category 2. We find the lowest <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in provider category 1. There is also a relationship between the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in an institution and the educational level of the staff, the location, the workforce, and the size of an institution.

The need to properly assess, and thus, improve the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in nursing homes is a growing concern. This research proposes Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) as a modeling tool to perform such assessments. Variables were selected for inclusion in each of 11 BBNs based on prior research pertaining to the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in nursing homes, stepwise variable selection in a least squares regression model, and a Chi-square test of association with the <b>quality</b> of <b>care.</b> After learning the structure and parameters of the BBNs, each model was evaluated based on its ability to accurately assess the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in nursing homes. The structure and parameters of the proposed model support previous research relating structure, process, and outcome measures to the <b>quality</b> of <b>care.</b> The proposed model successfully predicted the <b>quality</b> of <b>care</b> in 58 % of the validation data.

500|$|There {{were three}} broad criticisms {{aimed at the}} idea of {{maternal}} deprivation from feminist critics. The first was that Bowlby overstated his case. The studies on which he based his conclusions involved almost complete lack of maternal care and it was unwarranted to generalise from this view that any separation in {{the first three years of}} life would be damaging. Subsequent research showed good <b>quality</b> <b>care</b> for part of the day to be harmless. The idea of exclusive care or exclusive attachment to a preferred figure, rather than a hierarchy (subsequently thought to be the case within developments of attachment theory) had not been borne out by research and this view placed too high an emotional burden on the mother. Secondly, they criticised Bowlby's historical perspective and saw his views as part of the idealisation of motherhood and family life after World War II. Certainly his hypothesis was used by governments to close down much needed residential nurseries although governments did not seem so keen to pay mothers to care for their children at home as advocated by Bowlby. Thirdly, feminists objected to the idea of anatomy as destiny and concepts of [...] "naturalness" [...] derived from ethnocentric observations. They argued that anthropology showed that it is normal for childcare to be shared by a stable group of adults of which maternal care is an important but not exclusive part.|$|E
