25|$|In example (33), {{the scope}} adverb occurs {{outside of the}} Quantified Noun Phrase every man, which permits this <b>quantifier</b> to have scope over the entire sentence, thus {{allowing}} it to c-command the pronoun ta (or he). This allows he to {{be interpreted as a}} variable bound to the <b>quantifier</b> phrase every man. In contrast, in example (34) the scope adverb occurs within the Quantified Noun Phrase, causing the <b>quantifier</b> to only have scope over that noun phrase. It therefore cannot c-command the pronoun ta, and so the pronoun cannot be interpreted as a variable bound to the <b>quantifier.</b>|$|E
25|$|For first-order tableaux without unification, the {{condition}} of fairness is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal <b>quantifier</b> might require more than one application.

25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the <b>quantifier</b> in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential <b>quantifier,</b> ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal <b>quantifier,</b> ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers in one sentence.|$|E
40|$|Studies from English and German {{have found}} {{differences}} in the processing of affirmative and negative sentences.

A picture-sentence verification task was used to investigate the processing of different types of <b>quantifiers</b> in Croatian: universal <b>quantifiers</b> in affirmative sentences (e. g. all), non-universal <b>quantifiers</b> in compositional negations (e. g. not all), null <b>quantifiers</b> in negative concord (e. g. none) and relative disproportionate <b>quantifiers</b> in both affirmative and negative sentences (e. g. some). The results showed that non-universal and null <b>quantifiers,</b> as well as negations were processed significantly slower compared to affirmative sentences, which is in line with previous findings supporting the two-step model. The results also confirmed that more complex tasks require a longer reaction time. A significant difference in the processing of same-polarity sentences with first-order <b>quantifiers</b> was observed: sentences with null <b>quantifiers</b> were processed faster and more accurately than sentences with disproportional and non-universal <b>quantifiers.</b> A difference in reaction time was also found in affirmatives with different quantifiers: sentences with universal <b>quantifiers</b> were processed significantly faster and more accurately compared to sentences with relative disproportionate <b>quantifiers.</b> These findings indicate that the processing of <b>quantifiers</b> follows after the processing of affirmative information.
