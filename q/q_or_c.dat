We previously found that, within 2 h of immunization, marginal zone (MZ) B cells capture IgG 3 -antigen complexes and transport them into splenic follicles {{and that this}} requires the presence of complement receptors 1 and 2. We have here investigated the localization of IgG 3 anti- 2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl (TNP) /biotin-ovalbumin-TNP immune complexes in the follicles and the involvement of classical versus total complement activation in this process. The majority (50 - 90 %) of antigen inside the follicles of mice immunized with IgG 3 -antigen complexes co-localized with the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network. Capture of antigen by MZ B cells as well as antigen deposition on FDC was severely impaired in mice lacking C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 3, and lack of either C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 3 also impaired the ability of IgG 3 to enhance antibody responses.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} the mechanisms involved in complement-mediated inhibition of immune precipitation using radiolabelled BSA and rabbit anti-BSA. Purified proenzyme C 1 was capable of maintaining the complexes in soluble form {{during the first few}} minutes of reaction whereas immune precipitation was immediate in the presence of purified C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 1 + EDTA (ethylenediamine tetra-acetate). In C 1 q deficient serum, initial immune aggregation was followed by partial solubilization of the formed precipitate similar to that obtained with normal human serum in the presence of Mg EGTA. In C 2 deficient serum precipitation occurred at a slow rate. Repletion of the deficient component (C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 2 respectively) restored fully inhibition of precipitation. These experiments establish a critical role for the classical pathway, in this phenomenon. By contrast the role of the alternative pathway in maintaining complexes in solution was less important; only partial and delayed precipitation occurred in sera depleted of factor D (RD) or factor B (RB). B and D restored normal complement activity to depleted sera. No precipitation was detected in a reagent depleted of properdin (RP). The mechanisms of inhibition of precipitation are therefore distinct from those responsible for solubilization of an immune precipitate, which is largely dependent on the alternative pathway...|$|E

This binding was suppressed by chemical modification of C 1 q and C 1 qCLF using diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). To investigate {{the role of}} lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in this binding, biosynthetically labelled [14 C]LPS were purified from E. coli D 31 m 4 and incorporated into liposomes prepared from phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) [PC/PE/LPS, 2 : 2 : 1, by wt. ]. Binding of C 1 q or its collagen-like fragments to the liposomes was estimated via a flotation test. These liposomes bound C 1 q and C 1 qCLF with Ka values of 8. 0 x 10 (7) and 2. 0 x 10 (7) M- 1; this binding was totally inhibited after chemical modification of C 1 q and C 1 qCLF by DEPC. Liposomes containing LPS purified from the wild-strain E. coli K- 12 S also bound C 1 q and C 1 qCLF, whereas direct binding of C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 1 qCLF to the bacteria was negligible. Diamines at concentrations which dissociate C 1 into C 1 q and (C 1 r, C 1 s) 2, strongly inhibited the interaction of C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 1 qCLF with LPS. Removal of 3 -deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonic acid; KDO) from E. coli D 31 m 4 LPS decreases the binding of C 1 qCLF to the bacteria by 65 %. When this purified and modified LPS was incorporated into liposomes, the C 1 qCLF binding was completely abolished.

METHODS: Immune complex red cell binding (ICRB) was assayed as enzyme activity, C 3 d by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and FB by immunoelectrophoresis. RESULTS: C 2 -deficient sera showed low-grade ICRB, which correlated with levels of FB. This activity could be blocked with antibodies to C 1 q, C 4, or FB, but not by antibodies to C 2. C 3 d levels in the patient's plasma changed during infusion, followed by a gradient increase during remission. Comparison of ICRB, C 3 d, and FB suggested an inverse relationship between FB levels and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: In C 2 deficiency, FB may interact with C 4 to provide a low-grade ICRB.

The uptake of apoptotic cells by mesangial cells, measured as percentage of mesangial cells ingesting apoptotic cells, was ∼ 25 %, 10 % and 10 % for a T cell lymphoma line (RMA), thymocytes and neutrophils, respectively.

Neonatal mice incapable of classical or terminal complement activation because of C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 6 deficiency or pharmacologically inhibited assembly of membrane attack complex were subjected to hypoxia–ischemia. Only C 1 q−/− mice exhibited neuroprotection coupled with attenuated oxidative brain injury. This was associated with reduced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in C 1 q−/− brain mitochondria and preserved activity of the respiratory chain. Compared with C 1 q+/+ neurons, cortical C 1 q−/− neurons exhibited resistance to oxygen–glucose deprivation. However, postischemic exposure to exogenous C 1 q increased both mitochondrial ROS production and mortality of C 1 q−/− neurons. This C 1 q toxicity was abolished by coexposure to antioxidant Trolox (6 -hydroxy- 2, 5, 7, 8 -tetramethylchroman- 2 -carboxylic acid). Thus, the C 1 q component of complement, accelerating mitochondrial ROS emission, exacerbates oxidative injury in the developing HI brain. The terminal complement complex is activated in the HI neonatal brain but appeared to be nonpathogenic.

Deficiency of C 1 q affects only activation of {{the classical}} pathway while deficiency of C 4 and C 2 also prevent activation of the lectin pathway. Bypass mechanisms may result in complement activation also in absence of C 2 but not in absence of C 1 <b>q</b> <b>or</b> <b>C</b> 4. The genes for C 2 and C 4 isotypes are closely located within the MHC class III region on chromosome 6 p and the genes for the 3 C 1 q chains are on chromosome 1 p. Deficiencies of C 1 q and of C 4 show genetic heterogeneity while deficiency of C 2 in the great majority of cases is caused by a specific deletion. The production of C 4 and C 2 is mainly by the hepatocytes in the liver while C 1 q is produced by monocytic bone marrow derived cells. This has implications for the possibility to treat the deficiency and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been tried in C 1 q deficiency...|$|E
40|$|Suppose M is {{a compact}} {{orientable}} irreducible 3 -manifold with Heegaard splitting surfaces P and Q. Then either Q is isotopic to a possibly stabilized copy of P or the Hempel {{distance of the}} splitting P is no greater than twice the genus of Q. More generally, if P and Q are bicompressible but weakly incompressible connected closed separating surfaces in M then either a) P and Q can be well-separated or b) P and <b>Q</b> are isotopic <b>or</b> <b>c)</b> the Hempel distance of P is no greater than twice the genus of Q.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{stability}} of the pentaquarks uuddQ, uudsQ and udssQ (<b>Q</b> = <b>c</b> <b>or</b> b) of positive parity in a constituent quark model based on Goldstone boson exchange interaction between quarks. The pentaquark parity is the antiquark parity times that of a quark excited to a p-shell. We show that the Goldstone boson exchange interaction favors these pentaquarks much more than the negative parity ones of the same flavour content but all quarks in the ground state. We find that the nonstrange pentaquarks are stable against strong decays. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The in-medium {{properties}} of the heavy spin- 3 / 2 Σ_Q^*, Ξ_Q^* and Ω_Q^* baryons with <b>Q</b> being b <b>or</b> <b>c</b> quark are investigated. The shifts in some spectroscopic parameters of these particles due to the saturated cold nuclear matter are calculated. The variations of those parameters {{with respect to the}} changes in the density of the cold nuclear medium are studied, as well. It is observed that the parameters of Σ_Q^* baryons are considerably affected by the nuclear matter compared to the Ξ_Q^* and Ω_Q^* particles that roughly do not see the medium. The results obtained may be used in analyses of the data to be provided by the in-medium experiments like PANDA. Comment: 13 Pages, 10 Figures and 3 Table...|$|R
