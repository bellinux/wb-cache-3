50|$|The {{majority}} {{was ordered}} to buy the 26% minority in a <b>quasi-partnership</b> under the old Companies Act 1980 section 75, now Companies Act 2006 section 996. There was then a dispute as to the basis on which the court should fix the price, and in particular whether there should be any discount to {{reflect the fact that}} the petitioners only had a minority holding.|$|E
50|$|As {{a manager}} and {{business}} owner, Twichell {{gained a reputation}} for kindness and generosity, even toward his business competition. He saw his stage line grow to include many more lines throughout New England. When the Boston and Worcester Railroad (B&W) opened on July 1, 1835, Twichell's stage lines were both competition and complement to the railroad's service. This <b>quasi-partnership</b> lasted until June 1, 1848, when Twichell became the assistant superintendent of the railroad. Twichell rose through the B&W's ranks, becoming president in 1857.|$|E
5000|$|The House of Lords {{stated that}} as a company is a {{separate}} legal person, the court would not normally entertain such an application. However, they believed that as the company was so similar in its operation {{as it was when}} it was a partnership, they created what is now known as a <b>quasi-partnership.</b> Mr Ebrahimi had a legitimate expectation that his management function would continue and that the articles would not be used against him in this way. Based on the personal relationship between the parties it would be inequitable to allow Mr Nazar and his son to use their rights against Mr Ebrahimi so as to force him out of the company and so it was just and equitable to wind it up. The company was wound up and Mr Ebrahimi received his capital interest.|$|E
50|$|Tulip (Ruth Negga) meets a {{woman named}} Dany (Julie Dretzin) in Houston, Texas and {{receives}} {{a slip of paper}} with the address of the enigmatic Carlos, with Tulip intending Jesse to aid her in confronting and killing the man who ruined their lives. Jesse (Dominic Cooper) tests the limits of his newly found abilities of persuasion and finally understands the nature of his abilities when Donnie (Derek Wilson) confronts Custer with a gun, with Jesse later holding control over him. Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) tells Jesse of the possibilities of his abilities, while discovering the true nature of government agents Fiore (Tom Brooke) and DeBlanc (Anatol Yusef); subsequently ending with a <b>quasi-partnership</b> between the mysterious two and the vampire. The episodic title is a reference to a speech given by Cassidy convincing Jesse about imagining the different possibilities of what he can do with his power.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} winding up on the just and {{equitable}} ground, mainly at the instance of members as contributories. The typical cases are (a) where the object for which the company was formed is impossible of further or any attainment;. and (b) where the petitioner has lost confidence in the controllers or, {{in the case of}} a <b>quasi-partnership,</b> in other members. In either case the petitioning contributory seeks to be relieved from his contractual obligation to contribute to the capital of the company or, {{in the case of a}} company limited by guarantee, to contribute in the event of its being wound up and in an article in (1964) 27 Modern Law Review 282, 305 Dr. B. H. McPherson suggested that Winding up on the just and equitable ground might amount to little more than the application to that contractual obligation of the doctrines of discharge by frustration and on account of breach. This thesis originally set out to verify that hypothesis, but in the course of study it became apparent that the contractual analysis was an aid to understanding rather than a complete solution to the problems presented by Section 222 (1) (h). In the first place, a winding up order is a discretionary equitable remedy, so that the common law doctrines of discharge by frustration and on account of breach are modified by the discretionary considerations applicable to equitable remedies generally and in particular equitable remedies in contract. Secondly, it is submitted, the Court does not apply those doctrines directly or even by analogy. Their apparent application stems from the fact that in the majority of cases they do produce a result which is just and equitable. The Court, looking to those ultimate reasons rather than to any application of common law doctrine, usually comes to the same result - but not always. There are cases where a remedy is granted in the absence of circumstances analogous to frustration or breach as well as cases where an order is refused notwithstanding that those circumstances have been shown to obtain. The main illustration is afforded by the Court's recognition of what Sir Owen Dixon once called "general intention and common understanding among the members". A company may have a great many objects stated in its memorandum and its articles may be in standard form, but if there is an express or implied arrangement among the members that its activities are to be directed to one object only or as to the manner in which its affairs are to be conducted the Court will have regard to that arrangement. If the main object becomes impossible or if the understanding among the members breaks down, although the contract expressed in the memorandum and articles has not been frustrated or breached, it may be just and equitable that the company be wound up. Although the contractual analysis has been retained as an invaluable aid, the thesis is now more than just a verification of the original hypothesis. It covers the field generally but concentrates on those areas where an original contribution seemed possible. The main such area is the concept of general intention and common understanding, which not only requires the contractual analysis to be modified but also that attention be given to problems of enforcement against persons not parties to the arrangement and to the consequences in terms of admissible proof.
