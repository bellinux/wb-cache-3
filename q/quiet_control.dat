Measurements were taken of salivary cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, state anxiety and global stress using a Visual Analogue Scale. The subjects were asked to take three salivary cortisol samples on the assessment day as well as on a <b>quiet</b> <b>control</b> day, and to take all other measures 5 min before and 10 min after conducting the bad news consultation. Consultations were videotaped and analyzed using the information-giving subscale of the Amsterdam Attitude and Communication Scale (AACS), the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), and the additional non-verbal measures, smiling, nodding and patient-directed gaze. MANOVA repeated measurements were used to test the difference between the cortisol measurements taken on the assessment and the control day. Linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between physiological and psychological stress measures and the students' communication performance. The analyses were restricted to the sample of 57 students who had complete data records. In anticipation of the communication assessment, cortisol levels remained elevated, indicating a heightened anticipatory stress response. After the assessment, the students' systolic blood pressure, heart rate, globally assessed stress level and state anxiety diminished. Pre-consultation stress {{did not appear to be}} related to the quality of the students' communication performance. Non-verbal communication could be predicted by pre-consultation physiological stress levels in the sense that patient-directed gaze occurred more often the higher the students' systolic blood pressure and heart rate. Post-consultation heart rate remained higher the more often the students had looked at the patient and the more information they had provided. However, the heart rate appeared to diminish the more often the students had reassured the patient. These findings suggest that in evaluating students' communication performance there is a need to take their stress levels into account. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To {{explore the}} {{protective}} effect of trimetazidine on the myocardial tissue of rats by observing the oxidative stress, apoptosis and energy metabolism in myocardial tissue of rats after exhausted exercise. Methods 　Thirty healthy adult male Wistar rats {{were randomly assigned}} to three groups (10 each) : <b>quiet</b> <b>control</b> group (C), exhausted exercise group (E) and exhausted exercise plus trimetazidine group (TE). Exhausted exercise model was established by forcing the rats swim ceaselessly, rats in group TE received hydrochloric acid trimetazidine (10 mg/kg) for intervention. The myocardial tissue of rats was collected after the last exhausted exercise. The myocardial tissue of rats was evaluated by HE staining. The concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in rats' myocardial cell mitochondria were detected by spectrophotometry. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to quantify the mRNA and protein levels of Bax, Bcl- 2 and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) in myocardial tissue of rats. Terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl Transferase Mediated Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay was employed to detect the apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue. Results 　Compared with group C, the SOD and GSH-Px activities in groups E and TE were reduced (P< 0. 01), while the MDA activity was increased (P< 0. 01), and more obvious changes were in group E. The SOD and GSH-Px activities decreased, while the MDA activity increased in group E than in group TE (P< 0. 01). Compared with group C, the apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue increased in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the highest apoptotic rate was in group E (P< 0. 01). Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of Bax were significantly elevated in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the highest expression was in group E (P< 0. 01). The mRNA and protein levels of BCL- 2 were significantly reduced in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01), and the lowest expression was in group E (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile, compared with group C, the mRNA and protein expression of UCP 2 was significantly increased in groups E and TE (P< 0. 01). After treatment with hydrochloric acid trimetazidine, the UCP 2 expression in group TE was relative decreased than in group E (P< 0. 01). Conclusion 　Trimetazidine can reduce the oxidative stress and apoptotic rate of myocardial tissue of rats after exhausted exercise, indicating it plays an important protective role for the myocardial tissue of rats.

We found that five of ten songbird species began singing significantly earlier in the morning in the vicinity of a major European airport than their conspecifics at a <b>quieter</b> <b>control</b> site. As birds at both sites started singing before the onset of air traffic in the morning, this suggests that the birds {{in the vicinity of the}} airport advanced their activity to gain more time for unimpaired singing before the massive plane noise set in. In addition, we found that during the day, chaffinches avoided singing during airplane takeoffs, but only when the noise exceeded a certain threshold, further suggesting that the massive noise caused by the airport can impair acoustic communication in birds. Overall, our study indicates that birds may be adjusting their mating signals and time budgets in response to aircraft noise...|$|R

I invent acts with very different sorts of materials and on a variety of objects. Most of the time I execute these acts quite systematic and often in a machine-like way. Everyday objects, industrial and natural materials and also spaces inspire me for these acts. I decide on an act and then I execute it not always knowing what the outcome will be or what the spatial impact will be. In the work that emerges (be it object, installation, video or photograph) I try to control the result of the acts. Meaning that I try to create formal conditions for these acts to be able to give them a poetic appearance. I try to accomplish that the results of the acts posses sculpturale qualities. Generally I have an interest in the layer and in the material quality of layers. The layer inspires me because I can invent acts to go under, through, inside, or on the layer. I can make cuts or stachings. I can grind in them, I can compose with them (construct, fold, enlarge), I can draw on them. Important is that through the act something new is hapenning.

Objective To compare {{the effect of}} foot massage (intervention) and <b>quiet</b> presence (<b>control)</b> on agitation and mood in people with dementia. Design A randomised controlled trial using a within-subjects, crossover design. Settings Five long-term care facilities in Brisbane, Australia. The primary outcome was the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the secondary outcome was the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS). The screening and data collection research assistants, families, and care staff were blinded to participant allocation. Participants Participants {{of the study were}} 55 long-term care residents aged 74 – 103 years (mean age 86. 5), with moderate to severe dementia and a history of agitated behaviour according to the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale. A computer-program randomised participants to 10 -min foot massage (intervention) or <b>quiet</b> presence (<b>control),</b> every weekday for 3 weeks. Results A carry-over effect was identified in the data, and so the data was treated as a parallel groups RCT. The mean total CMAI increased in both groups (reflecting an increase in agitation) with this increase greater in the quiet presence group than the foot massage group (p= 0. 03). There was a trend towards a difference on OERS General Alertness, with a positive change in alertness for participants in the foot massage group (indicating reduced alertness) and a negative change for participants in the quiet presence group (indicating increased alertness) (F(1, 51) = 3. 88, p= 0. 05, partial ή 2 = 0. 07).

Healthy older and younger adults completed 1 training session and 4 testing sessions consisting of a submaximal isometric handgrip exercise, vigorous or moderate intensity stationary cycling, or <b>quiet</b> rest (<b>control).</b> The following measures were taken before and after exercise/quiet rest: 1) pressure pain thresholds, 2) suprathreshold pressure pain ratings, 3) pain ratings during 30 seconds of prolonged noxious heat stimulation, and 4) temporal summation of heat pain. The results revealed age differences in EIH after isometric and aerobic exercise, with younger adults experiencing greater EIH compared with older adults. The age differences in EIH varied across pain induction techniques and exercise type. These results provide evidence for abnormal pain modulation after acute exercise in older adults...|$|R
