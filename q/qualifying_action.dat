METHODS: This is a descriptive cross-sectional study. Data were obtained through a structured, self-administered questionnaire.

RESULTS: The global percentage of correct answers was not associated with age (p= 0. 173) or degree/specialization (p= 0. 815). Questions were classified into categories. In categories involving knowledge of established breast cancer risk factors and indicators of hereditary breast cancer, the rate of correct answers was 65. 8 % and 66. 4 %, respectively. On the practice of genetic counseling, 40. 7 % of those interviewed were not sure about the definition of genetic counseling and 78. 5 % reported never having identified or referred a patient at genetic risk for specialized risk assessment.

The activities were organized in the following subprojects: (a) online distance learning courses; (b) workshops to train managers, government technicians, representatives of civil society organizations, and social subjects who offered {{to act as a}} link between communities; and (c) local pilot projects. The present study reports this experience. The educational practices implemented in the municipalities of Araçuaí (MG), Juazeiro (BA), and Fortaleza (CE) were analyzed based on systematized information in the project reports and activity records (texts and photographs). The analytical reference was based on the concept of food and nutrition education, guided by the fundamentals of Popular Education and Paulo Freire; on the concept of food and nutrition security; and on the following analytical dimensions: participation, contextualization of educational practices, and intersectoriality. The results evidenced how educational practices contributed to the construction of shared concepts of food and nutrition security from an intersectoral and participatory perspective that values the peculiarities of diet in different socioeconomic and cultural contexts, and highlights daily situations and local traditions. They also expose the limits and potentialities of an experience of this magnitude, conducted from an interdisciplinarity perspective and using participatory methods...|$|R
