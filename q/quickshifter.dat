5000|$|Many modern {{motorcycles}} {{feature a}} device called <b>quickshifter</b> for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes {{pressure on the}} gear shift rod and <b>quickshifter</b> sends {{a signal to the}} ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially [...] "blips" [...] the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.|$|E
50|$|For the 2014 through 2016 model years, {{there were}} {{incremental}} annual updates, including adjustments to road handling, and adding options such as LED headlights, keyless ignition, a <b>quickshifter,</b> an anti-theft system, and another lower seat option. A new ABS mode {{available as a}} software update allows safer braking while cornering.|$|E
50|$|Kawasaki {{releases}} a homologation special the ZX-10RR with modified cylinder head, race kit parts {{can be ordered}} such as high lift cams, DLC coated valve train, a beefed up crank case, Marchesini seven-spoke rims, also a bi-directional <b>quickshifter,</b> and a single seat this model will be a limited run of 500 units.|$|E
50|$|First {{offered in}} early 2011, but {{still part of}} the 2011 model year, Triumph debuted the Daytona 675R. The 675R did not feature any changes to the engine, instead Triumph's focus was on the {{standard}} inclusion of Brembo front brakes, Öhlins suspension, and Triumph's <b>quickshifter.</b> The 675R has carbon fiber front mudguard, rear hugger, exhaust cap, heat shield, and cockpit infill panels.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 {{model of}} the Daytona has had over 50 {{technical}} improvements according to Triumph. While the only cosmetic changes were to the front fairing and turn signals, the new model is lighter, the ECU has been remapped to increase the rev limit and produce a power increase of , a taller first gear, and handling has improved through high and low speed dampers. In addition, the 2009 model's ECU is compatible with Triumph's OEM plug and play <b>quickshifter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At the Intermot 2016, Ducati {{announced}} a new SuperSport, that would be available around March or April 2017. The bike uses the 937 cc Testastretta motor (from the Hypermotard 939), but the power arrives lower in the rev range, and final drive gear ratios are longer. The 2017 SuperSport uses a trellis frame and some similarities in appearance to the Panigale, but configured as a [...] "relaxed sport bike", with a much less radical riding position. The bike is available in two versions, standard and [...] "S". The [...] "S" [...] version features a digital <b>quickshifter</b> and fully adjustable Öhlins suspension at front and rear, but either upgrade may be ordered for the standard bike. Optional packages includes a [...] "Sport Pack" [...] (carbon front fender, carbon tank cover, and bespoke brake reservoir covers) or a [...] "Touring Pack" [...] (semi-rigid panniers, a touring windscreen, and heated grips).|$|E
50|$|The 2016 ZX-10R {{received}} a major update. With a claimed 210 hp with ram-air intake at 13,000 rpm.The electronics now use a Bosch five-axis Internal Measurement Unit (IMU). A sixth degree is calculated by proprietary Kawasaki software. The S-KTRC updated with a added launch control mode a <b>quickshifter</b> and engine brake control. Also optional smarter KIBS cornering ABS. Because of its predictive {{as opposed to}} reactive nature, Kawasaki touts this system of S-KTRC as the most advanced of all current traction control systems. Some of the changes mechanically that are now lighter are the slipper clutch, balancer,crankshaft as well as pistons. A less restrictive air filter and larger air box {{as well as a}} lighter less restrictive exhaust system. A new transmission that is cassette style is vertically stacked. The previous petal rotors that have been in use since 2004 are now replaced with circular rotors. They are now also larger from 310 mm to now 330 mm. The calipers are now Brembo M50 Monoblock and the master cylinder is a radial Brembo. The brake lines are now braided stainless-steel. A first for production sport bikes a 43 mm Showa Balance Free Fork derived from WSBK. Kawasaki also offers Race Kit parts for chassis and engine.|$|E
