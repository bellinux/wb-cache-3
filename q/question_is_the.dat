5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|The Shakespeare authorship <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{argument}} that {{someone other than}} William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E

25|$|The National <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debate {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Quebec {{and the status of}} it as a province of Canada. Political parties are organized along ideologies that favor independence from Canada (sovereigntist or separatist) and various degrees of autonomy within Canada (federalists). Social democrats, liberals, and conservatives are therefore present in most major parties, creating internal tensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{hill in the}} town's name {{is taken}} to mean {{different}} things to different people; many believe that the hill in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> hill on which the railway station currently stands, but there is a Burgess Farm on a hill in the south-east of the town, in Folders Lane. Whether this is the hill referred to in the town's name is not known.|$|E

25|$|In {{the special}} case when the bundle E in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> tangent bundle of a compact, oriented, r-dimensional manifold, the Euler class {{is an element}} of the top cohomology of the manifold, which is {{naturally}} identified with the integers by evaluating cohomology classes on the fundamental homology class. Under this identification, the Euler class of the tangent bundle equals the Euler characteristic of the manifold. In the language of characteristic numbers, the Euler characteristic is the characteristic number corresponding to the Euler class.|$|E
25|$|Using this Carnapian approach, Maher {{identifies}} {{a proposition}} which we intuitively (and correctly) {{know to be}} false, but which we easily confuse with the paradoxical conclusion. The proposition in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proposition that observing non-ravens tells us about the color of ravens. While this is intuitively false and is also false according to Carnap's theory of induction, observing non-ravens (according to that same theory) causes us to reduce our estimate {{of the total number}} of ravens, and thereby reduces the estimated number of possible counterexamples to the rule that all ravens are black.|$|E
25|$|These {{explanations}} {{come from}} the ambiguous {{meaning of the word}} 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years. The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although Rashi's interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Persian king Cyrus.|$|E

25|$|The dating of {{the poems}} {{has been a source}} of lively {{scholarly}} argument for a long time, and firm conclusions are hard to reach. Lines from the Eddic poems sometimes appear in poems by known poets, but such evidence is difficult to evaluate. For example, Eyvindr skáldaspillir composed in the latter half of the 10th century, and he uses a couple of lines in his Hákonarmál which are also found in Hávamál. It is possible that he was quoting a known poem, but it is also possible that Hávamál, or at least the strophe in <b>question,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> younger derivative work.|$|E
25|$|The {{proof of}} the {{independence}} result also shows that a wide class of mathematical statements, including all statements that can be phrased {{in the language of}} Peano arithmetic, are provable in ZF if and only if they are provable in ZFC. Statements in this class include the statement that P = NP, the Riemann hypothesis, and many other unsolved mathematical problems. When one attempts to solve problems in this class, it makes no difference whether ZF or ZFC is employed if the only <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> existence of a proof. It is possible, however, that there is a shorter proof of a theorem from ZFC than from ZF.|$|E
25|$|As of December 2010, one NMP – Professor Walter Woon Cheong Ming, a law {{lecturer}} at the National University of Singapore – {{had succeeded in}} having a public law enacted based on a private member's bill {{he or she had}} initiated. The law in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Maintenance of Parents Act, which entitles parents at least 60 years old and unable to maintain themselves adequately to apply to a tribunal for their children to be ordered to pay maintenance to them. The bill was introduced in Parliament by Woon on 23 May 1994, and eventually passed on 2 November 1995. In that year, the first woman NMP, Dr. Kanwaljit Soin, also introduced a Family Violence Bill but it did not pass.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{existence of}} automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures {{is that one}} of recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B if and only if the set difference B'A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. Soare (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{belonging}} to a western stream of Bantu expansion (sometimes called Kalundu) has been found at sites in northeastern Zimbabwe, dated from the seventh century. (The western stream originated {{in the same area}} as the eastern stream: both belong to the same style system, called by Phillipson the Chifumbadze system, which has general acceptance by archaeologists.) The terms eastern and western streams represent the expansion of the Bantu speaking peoples in terms of their culture. Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> branches of the Bantu languages which they spoke. It seems that the makers of the Ziwa/Gokomere wares were not the ancestral speakers of the Shona languages of today's Zimbabwe, who did not arrive in there until around the tenth century, from south of the Limpopo river, and whose ceramic culture belonged to the western stream. The linguist and historian Ehret believes that in view of the similarity of the Ziwa/Gokomere pottery to the Nkope of the ancestral Nyasa language speakers, the Ziwa/Gokomere people spoke a language closely related to the Nyasa group. Their language, whatever it was, was superseded by the ancestral Shona languages, although Ehret says that a set of Nyasa words occur in central Shona dialects today.|$|E
