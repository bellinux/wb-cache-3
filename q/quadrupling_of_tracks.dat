The original twenty freight paths between Harrogate and Wetherby (in each direction) fell to five by 1960. Local freight consisted largely of house coal, {{the use of}} which was declining.|$|R
50|$|The 7 km long railway line to Auteuil was {{electrified}} in January 1925. The line to Saint-Germain-en-Laye was electrified up to Rueil-Malmaison (14 km) in June 1926, then {{extended to}} Saint-Germain in 1927. The line to Versailles Rive Droite was electrified in July 1928 {{as well as}} between Puteaux and Issy-les-Moulineaux, Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche in May 1931 and the 10 km long line to Argenteuil in 1936 after the <b>quadrupling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tracks</b> two years earlier.|$|R
25|$|The West London Line passes {{beneath the}} Earls Court Exhibition Centre along a complex {{intersection}} <b>of</b> <b>track</b> which crosses over the subsurface junction of three District line branches. The planned redevelopment {{of the site}} by Capital & Counties Properties envisages demolishing the Exhibition Centre {{to make way for}} retail and housing; as part of these plans, the West London Line is to be enclosed by a concrete box.

50|$|With the {{increased}} traffic through Barnetby, the track infrastructure needed more investment. At the time, Barnetby had a fairly simple layout {{based on a}} standard double track. It even had a level crossing near to where the Kings Road bridge is today. To make passage easier, the Great Central Railway invested in the <b>quadrupling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>track</b> between Wrawby Junction and Brocklesby Junction - together with much improved signalling. The level crossing was removed and the Kings Road underbridge was built. To handle the traffic, new signal boxes were built at Wrawby Junction, Barnetby West, Barnetby East, Melton Ross and Brocklesby Junction.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electrification}} of the Metropolitan {{line from}} Rickmansworth to Amersham and Chesham was not completed until 12 September 1960. and the <b>quadrupling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tracks</b> was not completed until 1961, {{but only to}} a point north of Moor Park. The complete resignalling of the line north of [...] was done by 1959. As electrification {{did not take place}} all the way north to Aylesbury, the Metropolitan line service north of Amersham was withdrawn in 1961. The Plan to convert Locomotive-hauled steam stock to Electric working was abandoned, and new EMUs, designed in the 1950s, replaced existing steam and electric locomotives from 1960. They were called the A60 stock.|$|R
50|$|The Great Eastern Railway (GER) {{took over}} in 1862 and renamed the station as Brentwood & Warley for Billericay in 1882, {{shortened}} to Brentwood & Warley in 1889. After the grouping of 1923 the station passed to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), which <b>quadrupled</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> passing through in 1934. In 1969 the station's name was changed back to Brentwood.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first phase}} of the upgrade, south of Manchester, opened on 27 September 2004 with journey times of 1 hour 21 minutes for London to Birmingham and 2 hours 6 minutes for London to Manchester. The final phase, {{introducing}} [...] running along most of the line, was announced as opening on 12 December 2005, bringing the fastest journey between London and Glasgow to 4 hours 25 mins (down from 5 hours 10 minutes). However, considerable work remained, such as the <b>quadrupling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>track</b> in the Trent Valley, upgrading the slow lines, the second phase of remodelling Nuneaton, and the remodelling of Stafford, Rugby, Milton Keynes and Coventry stations, and these were completed in late 2008. The upgrading of the Crewe-Manchester line via Wilmslow was completed in summer 2006.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} most railway routes, {{passenger}} {{traffic on the}} MSJ&AR declined significantly in the 1960s as travel patterns changed and more people had access to private cars. As a result, the Altrincham Electric express services were withdrawn, along some of the rolling stock {{and many of the}} goods trains using the route. The <b>quadruple</b> section <b>of</b> MSJ&AR <b>track</b> was reduced to conventional double track in 1963 and Manchester Central station closed on 5 May 1969, with trains from the ex-CLC Chester and Warrington lines being diverted to terminate at Oxford Road.|$|R
5000|$|The Qingdao-Jinan Railway or Jiaoji Railway ( [...] , {{formerly}} the Shantung Railway) is railway in Shandong Province, China. The railway is 393 km {{in length and}} connects Qingdao, on the Jiaozhou Bay, and Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong. Adolph von Hansemann and other German financiers funded construction of the railway, then known as Schantung Eisenbahn Gesellschaft, which began September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904. Since the <b>quadruple</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>of</b> this corridor {{with the opening of}} the parallel Qingdao-Jinan Passenger Railway the line is mostly used for freight with some conventional passenger services.|$|R
25|$|The {{most notable}} example <b>of</b> <b>quadruple</b> <b>track</b> in the United States, {{and perhaps the}} only four-track section of {{mainline}} therein, was the Pennsylvania Railroad's main corridor {{through the heart of}} Pennsylvania around the famous Horseshoe Curve. This line is now owned by Norfolk Southern. Other examples include the Hudson and New Haven Lines, both of which are shared between Metro-North and Amtrak in New York and Connecticut. The New Haven Line is quadruple track along its entire length, while the Hudson Line is only quadruple tracked along the shared portion from Riverdale to Croton–Harmon and along the shared track from Grand Central Terminal to Yankees–East 153rd Street.|$|R

50|$|Kamonomiya Station was {{established}} as Sakawagawa signal box (Sakawagawa shingōsho) on October 21, 1920, on the Atami Line of the Japan National Railways. It was upgraded {{to a full}} station on June 1, 1923 as a station for both freight and passenger service. With {{the opening of the}} Tanna Tunnel, the Atami Line became the Tōkaidō Main Line from December 1, 1934. Regularly scheduled freight services were discontinued in 1970, and parcel services by 1972. The current station building was completed in 1976. With the completion <b>of</b> <b>Quadruple</b> <b>tracks</b> between Odawara and Ofuna, freight services were resumed as of March 31, 1987. With the dissolution and privatization of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came {{under the control of the}} East Japan Railway Company and the Japan Freight Railway Company. Automated turnstiles using the Suica IC Card system came into operation from November 18, 2001.|$|R
