5|$|The <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang (the quark epoch), the universe was filled with <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma,</b> as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> {{of the early}} Universe as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, in {{a process known as}} Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{phases of}} the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10−37 seconds into the expansion, a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation, during which the universe grew exponentially during which time density fluctuations that occurred because of the uncertainty principle were amplified into the seeds that would later form the large-scale structure of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required {{for the production of}} a <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> as well as all other elementary particles. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds, and particle–antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number, leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30million. This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe.|$|E
40|$|In weakly {{interacting}} <b>quark-gluon</b> <b>plasmas</b> {{diffusion of}} color {{is found to}} be much slower than the diffusion of spin and flavor because color is easily exchanged by the gluons in the very singular forward scattering processes. If the infrared divergence is cut off by a magnetic mass, m_mag∼α_sT, the color diffusion is D_color∼ (α_s(1 / alpha_s) T) ^- 1, a factor α_s smaller than spin and flavor diffusion. A similar effect is expected in electroweak plasmas above M_W due to W^± exchanges. The color conductivity in <b>quark-gluon</b> <b>plasmas</b> and the electrical conductivity in electroweak plasmas are correspondingly small in relativistic heavy ion collisions and the very early universe...|$|R

25|$|The {{physics of}} the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> is governed by a theory called quantum chromodynamics, but this theory is mathematically {{intractable}} in problems involving the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma.</b> In an article appearing in 2005, Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence {{could be used to}} understand some aspects of the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma,</b> the shear viscosity and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> was confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the first}} years, theorists were eager to claim that RHIC has {{discovered}} the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> (e.g. Gyulassy & McLarren), the experimental groups were more careful not to jump to conclusions, citing various variables still in need of further measurement. The present results shows that the matter created is a fluid with a viscosity near the quantum limit, but is unlike a weakly interacting plasma (a widespread yet not quantitatively unfounded belief on how <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> looks).|$|E
25|$|Deconfinement was {{claimed in}} 2000 at CERN SPS in heavy-ion collisions, and it implies {{a new state}} of matter: <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma,</b> less {{interacting}} than in the nucleus, almost as in a liquid. It was found at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven in the years 2004–2010 by four contemporaneous experiments. A <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> state has been confirmed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the three experiments ALICE, ATLAS and CMS in 2010.|$|E
40|$|The quark and gluon viscosities are {{calculated}} in <b>quark-gluon</b> <b>plasmas</b> to leading orders in the coupling constant by including screening. For weakly interaction QCD and QED plasmas dynamical screening of transverse interactions and Debye screening of longitudinal interactions controls the infrared divergences. For strongly interacting plasmas other screening mechanisms taken from lattice calculations are employed. By solving the Boltzmann equation for quarks and gluons including screening the viscosity is calculated to leading orders in the coupling constant. The leading logarithmic order is calculated exactly by a full variational treatment. The next to leading orders {{are found to}} be very important for sizable coupling constants as those relevant for the transport properties relevant for <b>quark-gluon</b> <b>plasmas</b> created in relativistic heavy ion collisions and the early universe.

25|$|According to the Big Bang theory, in {{the early}} {{universe}} at high temperatures when the universe was only a few tens of microseconds old, the phase of matter took the form of a hot phase of quark matter called the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> (QGP).|$|E

25|$|For the {{experimental}} objective of creating and studying the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma,</b> RHIC has the unique {{ability to provide}} baseline measurements for itself. This consists of the both lower energy and also lower mass number projectile combinations that do not result in the density of 200GeV Au+Au collisions, like the p+p and d+Au collisions of the earlier runs, and also Cu+Cu collisions in Run-5.|$|E
25|$|Although in {{the normal}} phase of QCD single gluons may not travel freely, it is {{predicted}} that there exist hadrons that are formed entirely of gluons — called glueballs. There are also conjectures about other exotic hadrons in which real gluons (as opposed to virtual ones found in ordinary hadrons) would be primary constituents. Beyond the normal phase of QCD (at extreme temperatures and pressures), <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> forms. In such a plasma there are no hadrons; quarks and gluons become free particles.|$|E
25|$|The LHC physics {{programme}} {{is mainly}} based on proton–proton collisions. However, shorter running periods, typically one month per year, with heavy-ion collisions {{are included in}} the programme. While lighter ions are considered as well, the baseline scheme deals with lead ions (see A Large Ion Collider Experiment). The lead ions are first accelerated by the linear accelerator LINAC 3, and the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) is used as an ion storage and cooler unit. The ions are then further accelerated by the PS and SPS before being injected into LHC ring, where they reached an energy of 2.3 TeV per nucleon (or 522 TeV per ion), higher than the energies reached by the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The aim of the heavy-ion programme is to investigate <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma,</b> which existed in the early universe.|$|E

25|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{primordial}} nucleons themselves were formed from the <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> during the Big Bang as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes afterward, starting with only protons and neutrons, nuclei up to lithium and beryllium (both with mass number 7) were formed, but the abundances of other elements dropped sharply with growing atomic mass. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the process stopped before significant carbon could be formed, as this element requires a far higher product of helium density and time than {{were present in the}} short nucleosynthesis period of the Big Bang. That fusion process essentially shut down at about 20 minutes, due to drops in temperature and density as the universe continued to expand. This first process, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, was the first type of nucleogenesis to occur in the universe.|$|E
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{occurred within}} the first three minutes {{of the beginning of}} the universe and is responsible for much of the abundance of 1H (protium), 2H (D, deuterium), 3He (helium-3), and 4He (helium-4). Although 4He continues to be produced by stellar fusion and alpha decays and trace amounts of 1H continue to be produced by spallation and certain types of radioactive decay, most of the mass of the isotopes in the universe are thought to have been produced in the Big Bang. The nuclei of these elements, along with some 7Li and 7Be are considered to have been formed between 100 and 300 seconds after the Big Bang when the primordial <b>quark–gluon</b> <b>plasma</b> froze out to form protons and neutrons. Because of the very short period in which nucleosynthesis occurred before it was stopped by expansion and cooling (about 20 minutes), no elements heavier than beryllium (or possibly boron) could be formed. Elements formed during this time were in the plasma state, and did not cool to the state of neutral atoms until much later.|$|E
