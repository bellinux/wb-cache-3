40|$|Exercise {{leads to}} {{increased}} metabolic request and {{this represents a}} challenge for the cardiopulmonary system, which must guarantee O 2 and CO 2 transfer and exchange. Ventilation (VE) and circulation are responsible for gas transfer, whereas gas exchange is due to both pulmonary and cellular diffusion. At rest, muscle work is limited {{to that of the}} heart and the respiratory and bowel muscles. During exercise limb muscles work is added and leads to an increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) request and oxygen consumption (V’O 2) and carbon dioxide production (V’CO 2). As the exercise intensifies, the aerobic metabolism can not supply all the ATP <b>quantity</b> <b>requested.</b> Consequently, the anaerobic metabolism takes over, leading to increased lactic acid output. In healthy sedentary subjects, who perform a maximal exercise, VE values range from 5 - 10 L/min at rest to 80 - 100 L/min at peak of exercise. Cardiac output (CO) increases linearly as external work increases, from 4 - 6 L/min at rest to 20 L/min at peak of exercise. In healthy sedentary subjects the factors which lead to exercise limitation are reaching the maximal CO, and consequently the maximal capacity of gas transfer to tissues, and depletion of glycogen stocks. In heart and respiratory diseases, the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) provides an overall assessment of functional capacity and allows to evaluate disease severity, prognosis and therapeutic interventions. Both in respiratory and cardiac patients exercise intolerance reflects integrated abnormalities of the ventilatory, cardiovascular, peripheral muscle, and neurosecretory systems. The CPET is able to identify which dysfunctional component impacts exercise capacity to the greatest extent...|$|E
40|$|The Hazardous Material Reduction Initiative (HMRI) explores {{using the}} review of {{purchase}} requisitions to reduce both the use of hazardous materials and the generation of regulated and nonregulated wastes. Based on an 11 -month program implemented at the Hanford Site, hazardous material use and waste generation was effectively reduced by using a centralized procurement control program known as HMRI. As expected, several changes to the original proposal were needed during the development/testing phase of the program to accommodate changing and actual conditions found at the Hanford Site. The current method requires a central receiving point within the Procurement Organization to review all purchase requisitions for potentially Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) hazardous products. Those requisitions (approximately 4 % to 6 % of the total) are then forwarded to Pollution Prevention personnel for evaluation under HMRI. The {{first step is to}} determine if the requested item can be filled by existing or surplus material. The requisitions that cannot filled by existing or surplus material are then sorted into two groups based on applicability to the HMRI project. For example, laboratory requests for analytical reagents or standards are excluded and the purchase requisitions are returned to Procurement for normal processing because, although regulated, there is little opportunity for source reduction due to the strict protocols followed. Each item is then checked to determine if it is regulated or not. Regulated items are prioritized based on hazardous contents, <b>quantity</b> <b>requested,</b> and end use. Copies of these requisitions are made and the originals are returned to Procurement within 1 -hr. Since changes to the requisition can be made at later stages during procurement, the HMRI fulfills one of its original premises in that it does not slow the procurement process...|$|E

Supplier selection has been studied for large businesses but not for very small (micro) businesses.

Factors included Brand Name, Consistency, Cost/Lower Price, Loyalty, Quality, and Warranty. Results indicated that none of the factors were unimportant. However, buyer satisfaction was found to be dependent on Quality, Brand Name, and the Length of Time of the Buyer/Supplier Relationship. Additionally, it was concluded that quality, along with complete, on-time delivery are key to buyer satisfaction and may help suppliers achieve preferred status with micro-business buyers. micro business; supplier selection; quality; cost; buyer satisfaction; supply chian management; SCM; consistency; price; loyalty; warranty; quality; brand name; buyer-supplier relationship...|$|R

One may state unequivocally that the printed book created by Gutenberg (1398 - 1468) has finished its role as a carrier of ideas and now it has no future, just as it was with the wonderfully illuminated fables written by monks in the monasteries. The revolution brought by the computer surpasses by far that introduced by the invention of printing. As is known to everybody a book consists of subject matter and its physical basis – printing paper, imposed type and cover. The computer may affect, to some extent, the subject matter of a book, but will never replace the essence of the book and nobody is considering “replacing the book by a computer ”- but it is clear that replacing the existing form of the book by an electronic book is inevitable and will occur very soon. Some of the obvious advantages of the e-book are recapitulated in the following: 1. The ordinary printed book is produced in a large number of copies. This calls for a large initial investment, for providing storage and accounting for the remaining stock, while an E-book is produced in the exact <b>quantities</b> <b>requested</b> by the market. 2.

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates a less-than-truckload {{dynamic pricing}} {{decision-making}} {{problem in the}} context of the Physical Internet (PI). The PI can be seen as the interconnection of logistics networks via open PI-hubs. In terms of transport, PI-hubs can be considered as spot freight markets where LTL requests with different volumes/destinations continuously arrive over time and only remain for short periods. Carriers can bid for these requests using short-term contracts. In a dynamic, stochastic environment like this, a major concern for carriers is how to propose prices for requests to maximise their revenue. The latter is determined by the proposed price and the probability of winning the request at that price. This paper proposes a dynamic pricing model based on an auction mechanism to optimise the carrier’s bid price. An experimental study is conducted in which two pricing strategies are proposed and assessed: a unique bidding price (one unique price for all requests at an auction), and a variable bidding price (price for each request at an auction).

A network composed of a single mobile network operator (MNO) and multiple CPs is considered. The MNO aims to define the price it charges the CPs to maximize its revenue while the CPs compete to determine the number of files they cache at the MNO's small base stations (SBSs) {{to improve the quality of}} service (QoS) of their users. This problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game where a single MNO is considered as the leader and the multiple CPs willing to cache files are the followers. The followers game is modeled as a non-cooperative game and both the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved. The closed-form expression of the NE which corresponds to the amount of storage each CP requests from the MNO is derived. An optimization problem is formulated at the MNO side to determine the optimal price that the MNO should charge the CPs. Simulation results show that at the equilibrium, the MNO and CPs can all achieve a utility that is up to 50 % higher than the cases in which the prices and storage <b>quantities</b> are <b>requested</b> arbitrarily.

The managers and technicians are trying to make the most use of scalability and the flexibility of the resources in cloud computing. The main challenge is with calculating the amount of the required processing resources per moment with regard to the <b>quantity</b> of incoming <b>requests</b> of the service. Through deduction of the accurate amount of these items, one can have an accurate estimation of the requests per moment. This paper aims at introducing a model for automatic scaling of the cloud resources that would reduce the cost of renting the resources for the clients of cloud infrastructure. Thus, first we start with a thorough explanation of the proposal and the major components of the model. Then through calculating the incomings of the model through clustering and introducing the way that each of these components work in different phases, [...] ...|$|R
