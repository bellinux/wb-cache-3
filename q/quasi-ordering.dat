40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the reverse mathematics of wqo and bqo theory. We survey {{the literature on}} the subject, which deals mainly with the more advanced results about wqos and bqos, and prove some new results about the elementary properties of these combinatorial structures. We state several open problems about the axiomatic strength of both elementary and advanced results. A <b>quasi-ordering</b> (i. e. a reflexive and transitive binary relation) is awqo (well <b>quasi-ordering)</b> if it contains no infinite descending chains and no infinite sets of pairwise incomparable elements. This concept is very natural, and has been introduced several times, as documented in [19]. The usual working definition of wqo is obtained from the one given above with an application of Ramsey’s theorem: a <b>quasi-ordering</b> on the setQ is wqo if for every sequence {xn | n ∈ N}of elements ofQ there existm < n such thatxm xn. The notion of bqo (better <b>quasi-ordering)</b> is a strengthening of wqo which was introduced byNash-Williams in the 1960 ’s in a sequence of papers culminating in [30] and [31]. This notion has proved to be very useful in showing that specific quasi-orderings are indeed wqo. Moreover the property of being bqo is preserve...|$|E

One approach to uncovering such dependencies is by exploratory algorithms of Item Tree Analysis (ITA). There are several methods of ITA available. The basic tool to compare such algorithms concerning their quality are large-scale simulation studies that are crucially set up on a large collection of <b>quasi-orders.</b> A serious problem is that all known ITA algorithms {{are sensitive to the}} structure of the underlying <b>quasi-order.</b> Thus, it is crucial to base any simulation study that tries to compare the algorithms upon samples of <b>quasi-orders</b> that are representative, meaning each <b>quasi-order</b> is included in a sample with the same probability. Up to now, no method to create representative <b>quasi-orders</b> on larger item sets is known. Non-optimal algorithms for <b>quasi-order</b> generation were used in previous studies, which caused misinterpretations and erroneous conclusions.

40|$|<b>Quasi-orders,</b> that is, {{reflexive}} and transitive binary relations, have numerous applications. In educational theories, the dependencies {{of mastery}} among {{the problems of}} a test can be modeled by <b>quasi-orders.</b> Methods such as item tree or Boolean analysis that mine for <b>quasi-orders</b> in empirical data {{are sensitive to the}} underlying <b>quasi-order</b> structure. These data mining techniques have to be compared based on extensive simulation studies, with unbiased samples of randomly generated <b>quasi-orders</b> at their basis. In this paper, we develop techniques that can provide the required <b>quasi-order</b> samples. We introduce a discrete doubly inductive procedure for incrementally constructing the set of all <b>quasi-orders</b> on a finite item set. A randomization of this deterministic procedure allows us to generate representative samples of random <b>quasi-orders.</b> With an outer level inductive algorithm, we consider the uniform random extensions of the trace <b>quasi-orders</b> to higher dimension. This is combined with an inner level inductive algorithm to correct the extensions that violate the transitivity property. The inner level correction step entails sampling biases. We propose three algorithms for bias correction and investigate them in simulation. It is evident that, on even up to $ 50 $ items, the new algorithms create close to representative <b>quasi-order</b> samples within acceptable computing time. Hence, the principled approach is a significant improvement to existing methods that are used to draw <b>quasi-orders</b> uniformly at random but cannot cope with reasonably large item sets...|$|R
