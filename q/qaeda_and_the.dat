2500|$|Beginning in 2001, after Al Qaeda's {{attack on}} 9/11, the 332d Air Expeditionary Group participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The Group's F-15Es, F-16s, and later A-10s played a {{critical}} role in the defeat of Al <b>Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Taliban and later provided key air support for the provisional government in Afghanistan. [...] Significantly, the F-15Es and F-16s saved a team of US Army soldiers, US Navy SEALS and US Air Force Combat Controllers and PJ pinned down after the helicopter in which they were flying was disabled by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) in the mountains of Afghanistan at Takur Ghar on what is now known as [...] "Roberts' Ridge". [...] The fighters employed both 20mm cannon and GBU-12 laser guided bombs on Al Qaeda militants as they proceeded up the mountain in an effort to capture or kill the crashed Americans, saving over 2 dozen American lives.|$|E

[...] He also has said that Iraq under Saddam Hussein was a supporter of Al <b>Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> other terrorist organizations [...] "with money, with equipment, with technology, with weapons of mass destruction." [...] He also claimed to have firsthand knowledge of nuclear weapons being smuggled from Russia to Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.|$|R

2500|$|Al-Douri {{played a}} role in the Northern Offensive as {{commander}} of the Naqshbandi Army. Reports soon surfaced that he had links with the jihadist group ISIS, helping them take the city of Tikrit and coordinating attacks against Iraqi security forces. On June 13, a Twitter account, @wikibaghdadi, claimed a [...] "Meeting between ISIS and Naqshbandi Army near al-Qayara area south of Mosul had taken place with representatives from Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi." [...] In July 2014, al-Douri issued an audio recording praising [...] "the heroes and knights of al <b>Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Islamic State" [...] forces in attacking Iraqi government positions within Saladin, Kirkuk, Diyala and Nineveh province. His connections with Islamist elements in Iraq is said to have emerged as far back as during Saddam's regime. According to the Soufan Group, al-Douri had close ties with senior ISIS officials Abu Muslim al-Turkmani and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi. Both men had served in the Ba'athist regime under Saddam Hussein, with al-Turkmani being a Lieutenant colonel and serving in the Istikhbarat and Special Republican Guard. Al-Iraqi had been a Colonel in Iraq's Air Defense Intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Byman, {{security}} studies {{professor at}} Georgetown University, argues that Washington must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent {{in international law}} is set. Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must [...] "remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid." [...] Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes {{that they are very}} effective. [...] "U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al <b>Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Taliban--top figures who are not easily replaced." [...] Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its target audiences, ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices. Byman argues that al Qaeda leaders [...] "cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders." ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{decision}} on sending more troops {{came after the}} administration completed a broader review of Afghanistan policy. On 27 March 2009, Obama announced after an intense 60-day White House policy review, in which military commanders and diplomats, regional governments, partners, Nato allies, NGOs and aid organisations were consulted, a new strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan. [...] "So I want the American {{people to understand that}} we have a clear and focused goal: to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That is the goal that must be achieved. That is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: we will defeat you," [...] Obama said. For this purpose Obama announced that he plans to further bolster American forces in Afghanistan, increase aid to Pakistan, and set strict standards – like levels of violence and casualties in Afghanistan, Pakistani attacks against insurgents and accounting for U.S. aid – for measuring progress in fighting Al <b>Qaeda</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Taliban in both countries. Part of his strategy was the deployment of 4,000 U.S. troops – beyond the additional 17,000 he authorized in February—to work as trainers and advisers to the Afghan army and police. The move was accompanied by a [...] "surge" [...] in US civilians to Afghanistan to help rebuild the country's infrastructure. In addition to the renewed focus on Afghanistan, the Obama administration was to step up pressure on Pakistan to tackle the al-Qaida and Taliban safe havens in the tribal areas along its border with Afghanistan. US military and civilian aid was to be increased. The last element of the policy was to try to engage Afghanistan's regional neighbours, including Russia and Iran, in helping to pacify Afghanistan.|$|E
50|$|Clarke's book Against All Enemies is also {{a crucial}} {{complement}} to the September 11 panel's failure to condemn Mr. Clinton's failure to capture or kill bin Laden {{on any of the}} eight to 10 chances afforded by CIA reporting. Mr. Clarke never mentions that President Bush had no chances to kill bin Laden before September 11 and leaves readers with the false impression that he, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, did their best to end the bin Laden threat. That trio, in my view, abetted al <b>Qaeda,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>the</b> September 11 families were smart they would focus on the dereliction of Dick Clarke, Bill Clinton and Sandy Berger <b>and</b> not <b>the</b> antics of convicted September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui.|$|R

40|$|Afghanistan {{has proved}} to be one of <b>the</b> most {{dangerous}} <b>and</b> unstable political environments in South Asia, if not the world.

40|$|The social {{production}} of misinformation in the United States – {{a case study}} In the lead-up to the Iraq War, the Bush administration rallied the American public for war via claims that they held unassailable evidence that Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction}} <b>and</b> through <b>the</b> insinuation that links existed between Iraq <b>and</b> al <b>Qaeda,</b> <b>and</b> Iraq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 11 September 2001 attacks. Despite the introduction of compelling evidence that these claims were false, more than 18 months after the official end of the war half of the American popu-lation continued to believe that either weapons of mass destruction had been found or that Iraq possessed a developed program for creating them. The preva-lence of these misperceptions suggests important questions: How and why could such a significant percentage of the population remain so misinformed? What was the social process leading to the widespread adoption of misinformation? <b>And</b> what were <b>the</b> political effects of these misperceptions? This article proposes an analytical model that outlines both the {{production of}} these misperceptions and their political ramifications. It argues that the misperceptions about the Iraq war were socially produced via a complex interaction between a variety of factors including: the general climate of fear in America in the post- 9 / 11 era, Bush administration agenda-setting strategies, <b>and</b> brokering between <b>the</b> political <b>and</b> communication establishments...|$|R

40|$|Network {{analysis}} has attracted significant attention when researching {{the phenomenon of}} transnational terrorism, particularly Al Qaeda. While many scholars have made valuable contributions to mapping Al Qaeda, several problems remain {{due to a lack}} of data <b>and</b> <b>the</b> omission of data provided by international organizations such as the UN. Thus, this article applies a social network analysis and subsequent mappings of the data gleaned from the Security Council's consolidated sanctions list, and asks what they can demonstrate about <b>the</b> structure <b>and</b> organizational characteristics of Al Qaeda. The study maps the Al Qaeda network on a large scale using a newly compiled data set. The analysis reveals that the Al Qaeda network consists of several hundred individual and group nodes connecting almost all over the globe. Several major nodes are crucial for the network structure, while simultaneously many other nodes only weakly and foremost regionally connect to the network. The article concludes that the findings tie in well to the latest research pointing to local and simultaneously global elements of Al <b>Qaeda,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>the</b> new data is a valuable source for further analyses, potentially in combination with other data...|$|R
