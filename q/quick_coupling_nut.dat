50|$|A <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also known}} as {{extension}} nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts,</b> for joining two different size threads; sight hole <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts,</b> which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts</b> with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> for a certain distance. <b>Coupling</b> <b>nut</b> dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. <b>Coupling</b> <b>nuts</b> threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Standard {{penetrator}} sampling {{systems were}} designed {{in order to}} allow for sampling via penetrators to produce a full set of sample acquisitions including volatile liquids, fine powders, and solid fragments. A gravity harpoon sampler has been designed with a removable tip and a <b>quick</b> <b>coupling.</b> The separation allows for sample handling and eliminates sample cross-contamination. Also, this design allows for multiple use of the penetrator body, which is the largest and heaviest part of the penetrator, while allowing for multiple changes of the light-mass, penetrator tip to avoid sample cross-contamination. The penetrator tip design has been improved by adding a spring trap to retain the sample, as well as a means for connecting to a <b>quick</b> <b>coupling.</b> <b>Quick</b> connect tips have been demonstrated in a sample handling carousel. The penetrator was released and rewound and the tips were released into a circular platter for rotation into instrument stations. The pyro-harpoon sampler was fabricated and tested with a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI) pyrotechnic charge. Initial tests collected cryogenic ice, but removal of the small pyro-harpoon from the ice was difficult. A brass metal sheath was then fitted over the harpoon tip, and removal from the ice was greatly alleviated by leaving the sheath in the ice. Quartz windows in the tips allow direct optical and spectral imaging and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS) pyrolysis, and were found to survive impact. All systems were successfully tested by dropping into sand and into cryogenic ice...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style <b>quick</b> release <b>couple,</b> fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R
