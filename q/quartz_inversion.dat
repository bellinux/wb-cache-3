5000|$|<b>Quartz</b> <b>inversion,</b> 573C silica {{phase change}} leading to {{cracking}} in ceramics ...|$|E
50|$|Quartz {{exists in}} several phases. At 573 °C at 1 {{atmosphere}} (and at higher temperatures and higher pressures) the α-quartz undergoes <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion,</b> transforms reversibly to β-quartz. The reverse process however is not entirely homogeneous and crystal twinning occurs. Care must be taken during manufacturing and processing to avoid phase transformation. Other phases, e.g. the higher-temperature phases tridymite and cristobalite, are not significant for oscillators. All quartz oscillator crystals are the α-quartz type.|$|E
50|$|The room-temperature form of quartz, α-quartz, {{undergoes}} a reversible change in crystal structure at 573 °C to form β-quartz. This phenomenon is called an inversion, {{and for the}} α to β <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion</b> {{is accompanied by a}} linear expansion of 0.45%. This inversion can lead to cracking of ceramic ware if cooling occurs too quickly through the inversion temperature. This is called dunting, and the resultant faults as dunts. To avoid such thermal shock faults, cooling rates not exceeding 50 °C/hour have been recommended.|$|E
40|$| {{homogenisation}} temperatures {{representative of}} both vein types, with an independent vitrinite reflectance geothermometer {{that defines the}} maximum temperature of 250 degrees&# 176;C {{at the time of}} vein formation. The results demonstrate that the bedding-normal extension veins are trapped from a low salinity (3. 5 - 8 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at near-lithostatic fluid pressures prior to inversion. After the tectonic inversion, bedding-parallel veins formed from a low salinity (4 - 7 eq. wt. % NaCl) H 2 O-NaCl fluid at lithostatic to supra-lithostatic fluid pressures during {{the early stages of the}} compressional stress regime. Subsequently, during progressive Variscan contraction both vein types were passively folded within characteristic, NW-verging, upright to overturned folds of the North Eifel. In contrast to both extensive veining events that characterise the tectonic <b>inversion,</b> <b>quartz</b> veining occurred rather occasionally during the main compression stage of orogeny. This kinematic history eventually shows a clear relationship between fluid-pressure evolution and the stress-state changes in the basin and exemplifies that (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic overpressures are easier to maintain during compressional tectonic inversion at the onset of orogeny, than during the main phase of compression. This intimate relationship during the stress-state evolution from extension to compression is illustrated by plotting the changing differential stress (sigma 1 -sigma 3) against the vertical effective stress and the fluid-pressure evolution in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The results show that the two vein types, which are induced at elevated to (supra&# 8209;) lithostatic fluid pressures, can only form at low differential stress closely related in time to the tectonic switch. The tectonic setting and the localised stress state in the basin are thus both crucial to determine whether the lithostatic fluid overpressure can be sustained by a rock prior to failure at depth. These 2 D brittle failure mode plots are moreover very useful to visualisethe influence of rock parameters such as the tensile strength of rock on the maximum overpressures that can be built up during the transition between two stress regimes. This regional aspect of fluid redistribution within overpressured fluid reservoirs contrasts with the more localised fluid flow along fault systems caused by fault-valving. The 3 D aspect of stress transitions during tectonic inversion of a crust is, however, much more complex than represented in a 2 D brittle failure mode plot. The tectonic switch, illustrated in these brittle failure mode plots, occurs at a specific isotropic stress state in which the three principal stresses are equal and sigma 1 - sigma 3 = 0. The chance that a stress state in the Earths crust equals an isotropic pressure state is, however, highly improbable. The 2 D stress-state evolution visualised in the brittle failure mode plots is therefore an oversimplification of the actual 3 D stress-state evolution in the Earths crust. To discuss the 3 D aspects of stress transitions and to illustrate the complexity of triaxial stress transitions during inversion of Andersonian stress regimes, possible 3 D stress-state evolutions are reconstructed based on the bedding-normal and bedding-parallel veins reflecting the early Variscan tectonic inversion. From these 3 D stress-state reconstructions is concluded that, no matter what orientation of basin geometry or shortening, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should always occur between extension and compression. This transitional stage should contribute to the permeability enhancement during tectonic inversion, although structures that are related to this transitional stage have not yet been reported in a shortened basin affected by tectonic inversion at low differential stress. Ideally, a transitional wrench tectonic regime should be implemented in brittle mode plots at the tectonic inversion. It has been concluded from this research that the naturally fractured Ardenne-Eifel basin can serve a possible analogue to the present upper crust by its regional extent of overpressuring, but more importantly by demonstrating that a tectonic inversion from extension to compression at the onset of orogeny is the crucial timing during which maximum (lithostatic) overpressures can be sustained.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the microstructure, the thermal and the mechanical properties of a clay-based ceramic used in building applications. The X-ray tomography analysis showed a layered microstructure of clay with 200 mu m sheets of porosity after the extrusion process. The gas release from the dehydration, dehydroxylation and decarbonation induced a 7 vol% formation of porosity during the heat treatment of the clay-based ceramic up to 850 degrees C. The porosity increase and the development of metakaolin led to a 38 % decrease in the thermal conductivity. On the other hand, the Young's modulus of the clay-based ceramic was conserved due to the formation of smaller pores than the 200 mu m sheets of porosity. The densification and the crystallization of amorphous phases also led to a 110 % increase of the Young's modulus from 850 degrees C to 1050 degrees C. The Young's modulus of the clay-based ceramic was only decreased by the 13 Kt <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion</b> of the cooling due to sand addition. Hence, this study provided a useful insight into how the microstructure of fired clay bricks can be specifically transformed by the porosity during the heat treatment to control the thermal and mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Siliceous {{rocks that}} were not heated to high {{temperatures}} during their geological formation display improved knapping qualities when they are subjected to controlled heating. Experimental heat treatment of South African silcrete, using open fires of the kind used during the Middle Stone Age, shows that the process needed careful management, notwithstanding recent arguments to the contrary. Silcrete blocks fractured when heated {{on the surface of}} open fires or on coal beds, but were heated without mishap when buried in sand below a fire. Three silcrete samples, a control, a block heated underground with maximum temperature between 400 and 500 °C and a block heated in an open fire with maximum temperature between 700 and 800 °C, were analysed with X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), optical microscopy, and both Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. The results show that the volume expansion during the thermally induced α- to β-quartz phase transformation and the volume contraction during cooling {{play a major role in}} the heat treatment of silcrete. Rapid heating or cooling through the phase transformation at 573 °C will cause fracture of the silcrete. Successful heat treatment requires controlling surface fire temperatures in order to obtain the appropriate underground temperatures to stay below the <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion</b> temperature. Heat treatment of rocks is a transformative technology that requires skilled use of fire. This process involves analogical reasoning, which is an attribute of complex cognition...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants are a {{promising}} option for future solar electricity generation. Their main advantage {{is the possibility}} to utilize integrated thermal storage capacities, allowing electricity generation on demand. In {{state of the art}} solar thermal power plants, two-tank molten-salt thermal energy storages are used. Significant cost reductions are expected by using thermocline thermal energy storage by storing the liquid storage material inside a single tank when compared to a two tank storage system. By embedding a low cost solid filler material inside the storage tank further cost reductions can be achieved. In an earlier study [1, 2] several potential filler materials have been investigated. In this study quartzite {{turned out to be a}} promising candidate due to its satisfying thermal stability and availability. At a temperature of approx. 573 °C the crystal structure of quartzite changes from trigonal α-quartz phase to the hexagonal β-quartz phase [3]. This quartz conversion results in a volume change [4] that may cause cracking of the quartzite crystals due to weight loads in a fill. Since these thermal tests of the study mentioned were limited to 500 °C this dunting was not considered. One trend in today’s development of solar thermal power plants is to use molten salt as storage material and heat transfer fluid at operating temperatures of 560 °C and above. Accordingly, the <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion</b> might limit the applicability of quartzite as a filler material at elevated operating temperatures. Due to this concern, an investigation has been started to investigate the utilizability of natural rocks as low cost filler materials. In the first phase of this investigation a comprehensive literature survey was conducted. Based on this study, magmatic and sedimentary rocks turned out to the most promising rock classes for this application. For the further investigation, basalt was chosen as a suited representative for magmatic and quartzite for sedimentary rocks. In lab-scale tests, these candidate materials were investigated with respect to their: • Calcite content • Thermal stability up to 900 °C in air • Thermal stability up to 560 °C in molten salt • Cyclic stability between 290 °C and 560 °C in molten salt • Specific heat capacity up to 600 °C In this paper the results of these investigations are presented and future activities are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Ocean Drilling Program Leg 129 {{recovered}} chert, porcellanite, and radiolarite from Middle Jurassic {{to lower}} Miocene strata {{from the western}} Pacific that formed by different processes and within distinct host rocks. These cherts and porcellanites formed by (1) replacement of chalk or limestone, (2) silicification and in-situ silica phase-transformation of bedded clay-bearing biosiliceous deposits, (3) high-temperature silicification adjacent to volcanic flows or sills, and (4) silica phase-transformation of mixed biosiliceous-volcaniclastic sediments. Petrologic and O-isotopic studies highlight the key importance of permeability and time in controlling the formation of dense cherts and porcellanites. The formation of dense, vitreous cherts apparently requires the local addition and concentration of silica. The influence of permeability is shown by two examples, in which: (1) fragments of originally identical radiolarite that were differentially isolated from pore-water circulation by cement-filled fractures were silicified to different degrees, and (2) {{by the development of}} secondary porosity during the opal-CT to <b>quartz</b> <b>inversion</b> within conditions of negligible permeability. The importance of time is shown by the presence of quartz chert below, but not above, a Paleogene hiatus at Site 802, indicating that between 30 and 52 m. y. was required for the formation of quartz chert within calcareous-siliceous sediments. The oxygen-isotopic composition for all Leg 129 carbonate- and Fe/Mn-oxide-free whole-rock samples of chert and porcellanite range widely from d 18 O = 27. 8 per mil to 39. 8 per mil vs. V-SMOW. Opal-CT samples are consistently richer in 18 O (34. 1 per mil to 39. 3 per mil) than quartz subsamples (27. 8 per mil to 35. 7 per mil). Using the O-isotopic fractionation expression for quartz-water of Knauth and Epstein (1976) and assuming d 18 Opore water = - 1. 0 per mil, model temperatures of formation are 7 °- 26 °C for carbonate-replacement quartz cherts, 22 °- 25 °C for bedded quartz cherts, and 32 °- 34 °C for thermal quartz cherts. Large variations in O-isotopic composition exist at the same burial depth between co-existing silica phases in the same sample and within the same phase in adjacent lithologies. For example, quartz has a wide range of isotopic compositions within a single breccia sample; d 18 O = 33. 4 per mil and 28. 0 per mil for early and late stages of fracture-filling cementation, and 31. 6 per mil and 30. 2 per mil for microcrystalline quartz precipitation within enclosed chert and radiolarite fragments. Similarly, opal-CT d 101 spacing varies across lithologic or diagenetic boundaries within single samples. Co-occurring opal-CT and chalcedonic quartz in shallowly buried chert and porcellanite from Sites 800 and 801 have an 8. 7 per mil difference in d 18 O, suggesting that pore waters in the Pigafetta Basin underwent a Tertiary shift to strongly 18 O-depleted values due to alteration of underlying Aptian to Albian-Cenomanian volcaniclastic deposits after opal-CT precipitation, but prior to precipitation of microfossil-filling chalcedony...|$|E
