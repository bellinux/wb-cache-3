25|$|In summary, {{the article}} 'A <b>Quick</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Lesbians by Dilys Rowe' (Winter 1962â€“1963) {{was based on}} an {{interview}} with three self-confessed 'homosexual women' and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in families where they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond with their fathers during their formative years.|$|E
25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} {{prompted}} by the article [...] "A <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> lesbians" [...] by the journalist Dilys Rowe in late 1962. [...] Although it would appear condemning in the present day, it discussed serious issues with interviews and quotations, and it prompted an interest in research into lesbian (and bisexual) lives. This research concept continued throughout {{the existence of the}} Minorities Research Group, which also provided a central point for formerly disparate individuals and information. Ultimately, the MRG provided education, support and opportunities to socialise for lesbians nationwide.|$|E

5000|$|When to Rob a Bank: ...And 131 More Warped Suggestions and Well-Intended Rants is an edited {{collection}} of blog posts by American authors Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, {{authors of the}} Freakonomics series. It was published by HarperCollins on May 5, 2015.

60|$|BRODIE (with a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> LESLIE). A dilettante interest, doubtless! See {{what it is}} to be idle.|$|E
60|$|Cranley half {{turned and}} threw a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, as rapid and timid as the glance of a hare in its form.|$|E
60|$|Dick gave a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Staffer before beginning; but Staffer at {{that instant}} was {{lighting}} a cigar, so his face was masked.|$|E
60|$|The other assented at the moment, but {{presently}} stooped down in <b>quick</b> alarm, and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the prisoner.|$|R
6000|$|Everybody exclaimed and {{questioned}} and seemed delighted. I saw Mother give one <b>quick,</b> involuntary <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Jen, and then gaze steadfastly at Mr. Grant {{to atone for}} it. Jen is twenty-six, and Stillwater is next door to our place! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know enough}} about it," [...] she answered, with a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> of {{question}} <b>at</b> her mother, and checking herself in a possibly indiscreet smile.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was evident}} that I insisted too much. [...] "His tone?" [...] she repeated, with a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, and a {{slightly}} heightened color.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Berton {{glanced at}} it, then cast a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the sweet, anxious face before her, and smiled so brightly that Belle smiled also, and asked, wonderingly: ...|$|E
60|$|JILL. [With a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her mother, {{snatching}} the salts] I will. [She {{goes over}} to CHLOE with the salts] Have a sniff; you look awfully white.|$|E
60|$|Here Meg came in. She gave a bright, <b>quick,</b> bird like <b>look</b> <b>at</b> George, and flushed a {{brighter}} red.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} it and I will it, {{what more can}} you have to say?" [...] he asked in a <b>quick</b> whisper, and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her with frightened eyes.|$|R
50|$|The {{disaster}} of the Comet, the dead-end {{development of the}} Bristol Brabazon begin the film. The development of the Jet Set is reviewed, including a <b>quick</b> humorous <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Ronald Reagan as related by Alistair Cooke in his glory days as a Hollywood star. We {{then go on to}} the 747, and the view expressed by experienced captains.|$|R
6000|$|The oldest girl saw it, {{guessed the}} truth, and a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the woman in}} the apron {{confirmed}} her suspicion. Touching her mother, she whispered: 'Ma, it's Mrs Bhaer herself. I know it is.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mac {{flashed a}} <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her {{and shut the}} book, saying quietly, {{although}} his eyes shone, and a conscious smile lurked about his mouth: [...] "We shall see, and no one need meddle, for, as my Thoreau says, ...|$|E
6000|$|His Eminence threw a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the young}} man, a look half of pity, half of contempt. For {{a moment it}} seemed as if an angry retort hovered upon his lips. But he merely shrugged his {{shoulders}} and said blandly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{were the}} use? He {{would remain in}} the village--in his brother's cottage mayhap ... with more time on his hands for his spying work.... He would dog the wench's steps more jealously than eve.... No! no!" [...] he added, whilst he cast a <b>quick,</b> furtive <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her--a <b>look</b> which somehow caused her to shiver with {{apprehension}} more deadly than heretofore.|$|R
6000|$|... --Let him! {{she said}} with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as <b>quick</b> as I'd <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{found an}} {{unexpected}} interest here. She felt {{its application to}} herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; {{and at the same}} moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a <b>look,</b> one <b>quick,</b> conscious <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.|$|R
60|$|The Earl of Mackworth darted a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Myles, {{who came}} forward the moment {{his father had}} ended, and kneeled beside him. The King offered no {{interruption}} to his speech, but he bent a look heavy with anger upon the young man.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no mistaking}} {{the tone of his}} voice, {{whatever}} his language. Concha darted a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him like the momentary resentment of an animal, but almost as quickly her eyes became suffused, and with a hurried movement she put on the slipper.|$|E
6000|$|Meg spoke {{seriously and}} {{expected}} to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, he said, in his impetuous way, [...] "I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after dawn}} he went. M. le Vicomte was then visibly easier. Laporte had all along paid no heed to me, but I noticed that {{once or twice}} during his long vigil by the {{sick-bed}} his dark eyes beneath their overhanging brows shot a <b>quick</b> suspicious <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the door behind which cowered Mme. la Marquise. I had absolutely {{no doubt in my}} mind then that he knew quite well who his patient was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} you the names of a number of gentlemen you'll never deal with any more, and that's the whole of Longhurst's gang," [...] said Jim. [...] "I'll put your pipe out in that quarter, my friend. Here, rout out your traps as <b>quick</b> as <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, and take your vermin along with you. I'll have a captain in, this very night, that's a sailor, and some sailors to work for him." ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{speaking}} I turned <b>quick</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the hogs, and there, sure enough, {{one of them}} had rooted open a portfolio and had hold of the corners of a colored picture, which, from where I sat, I could see was perfectly beautiful. The sky and the trees and the water was just like what we ourselves had seen a little while ago, and in about half a minute that hog would chew it up and swallow it.|$|R
6000|$|Charlie shot a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his mother, who exclaimed, as if {{in spite}} of herself, [...] "Now, Alec, {{are you going to}} let that girl squander a fine fortune on all sorts of {{charitable}} nonsense and wild schemes for the prevention of pauperism and crime?" ...|$|E
60|$|Chauvelin, who {{was trying}} to conceal his impatience beneath his usual urbane manner, took a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his watch. Desgas should not be long: another two or three minutes, and this impudent Englishman would be secure in the keeping of half a dozen of Captain Jutley's most trusted men.|$|E
6000|$|Amos Wentworth shot a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "She's a crank," [...] was the reply. [...] "So {{are we all}} cranks, {{for that}} matter. But Heaven save me from the crank that won't wash the dishes that he eats off of, and that's what this crowd of cranks are like." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gameshow Marathon was a British game show, {{broadcast}} on ITV from 17 September 2005 to 26 May 2007. After a <b>quick</b> retrospective <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the history of}} the particular show, the show itself is recreated. This involved recreating the original set and using original opening programme titles, including the appropriate producer ident (excluding Blankety Blank). All participants are celebrities, and any prizes won go into a [...] "Viewer Prize Mountain" [...] which is awarded to a viewer via a phone-in competition.|$|R
6000|$|He did {{twist the}} front wheels dangerously near to {{the outer edge of}} the shelf road. Mr. Boltwood gazed at the hand on the wheel. With a <b>quick</b> breath Claire <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the side of the road. If the car ran off, it would shoot down forty feet ... turning over and over.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mason gave a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> up <b>at</b> him. The {{action was}} purely involuntary, and, in fact, had been half a startle of {{surprise}}. The next instant {{her eyes had}} dropped again, and she sat waiting {{to go on with}} the dictation. But in that moment of her glance Daylight had noted that her eyes were gray. He was later to learn that at times there were golden lights in those same gray eyes; but he had seen enough, as it was, to surprise him, for he became suddenly aware that he had always taken her for a brunette with brown eyes, as a matter of course.|$|R
