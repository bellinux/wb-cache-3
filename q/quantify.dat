40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{traditional}} formalization of a Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DisCSP) to a <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP. A <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP includes several universally <b>quantified</b> variables, {{while all of}} the variables in a traditional DisCSP are existen-tially <b>quantified.</b> A universally <b>quantified</b> variable represents a choice of the nature or an adversary. A <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP formalizes a situation where a team of agents {{is trying to make}} a robust plan against the na-ture or an adversary. In this paper, we present the formalization of such a <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP and develop an algorithm for solving it. This algo-rithm generalizes the asynchronous backtracking algorithm used for solv-ing a DisCSP. In this algorithm, agents communicate a value assignment called a good in addition to the nogood used in asynchronous backtrack-ing. Interestingly, the procedures executed by an adversarial/cooperative agent for good/nogood are totally symmetrical. ...|$|R

This is done by representing both the fixed-point equation for Reflective Logic and the fixed-point equation for Default both as necessary equivalences in the Modal Quantificational Logic Z. and then inserting universal quantifiers before the defaults. The two resulting systems, called <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic and <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic, are then compared by deriving metatheorems of Z that express their relationships. The main result {{is to show that}} every solution to the equivalence for <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic is a strongly grounded solution to the equivalence for <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic. It is further shown that <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic and <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic have exactly the same solutions when no default has an entailment condition...|$|R
