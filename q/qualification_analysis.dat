30|$|Radiomics is an {{emerging}} translational {{field of research}} aiming to extract mineable high-dimensional data from clinical images. The radiomic process {{can be divided into}} distinct steps with definable inputs and outputs, such as image acquisition and reconstruction, image segmentation, features extraction and <b>qualification,</b> <b>analysis,</b> and model building. Each step needs careful evaluation for the construction of robust and reliable models to be transferred into clinical practice for the purposes of prognosis, non-invasive disease tracking, and evaluation of disease response to treatment. After the definition of texture parameters (shape features; first-, second-, and higher-order features), we briefly discuss the origin of the term radiomics and the methods for selecting the parameters useful for a radiomic approach, including cluster analysis, principal component analysis, random forest, neural network, linear/logistic regression, and other. Reproducibility and clinical value of parameters should be firstly tested with internal cross-validation and then validated on independent external cohorts. This article summarises the major issues regarding this multi-step process, focussing in particular on challenges of the extraction of radiomic features from data sets provided by computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E

40|$|<b>Qualification</b> <b>analysis</b> and {{reliability}} testing of electronic components represent a major {{activity in the}} process of development of electronic equipment. Electronics manufacturers have to adopt often costly test programmes to ensure qualification standards {{and reliability}} requirements are met. This paper details a novel similarity-based qualification approach for assessing expected reliability of electronic components, and in general electronic prod- ucts, as an alternative to conventional physical testing. The originality of this work is in the proposed approach which introduces a new way of qualifying electronic components based on similarity with previously assessed and qualified components. This novel approach has the potential to transform in a major way the current oper- ational practices in the industry, demanding at present substantial physical testing, by offering a complementary, “virtual qualification” route for addressing the cost and time challenges associated with qualification tests. A major achievement is the comprehensive and detailed demonstration of the proposed reliability qualification approach. Case studies on qualifying electronic components to the thermal loads induced by a particular post- manufacturing process widely adopted by high-reliability electronics sectors – the robotic hot solder dip (refinishing) process, and associated risks of thermo-mechanical damage are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Highlights - Combustion instabilities in a {{pre-mixed}} lean-burn {{natural gas}} engine were studied. - Effect of gas injection timing on the complexity of combustion system was analysed. - Analysis is based on return map, recurrence plot, recurrence quantification analysis. - Source of combustion instabilities is identified based on 3 -D CFD simulation. Abstract The cyclic combustion instabilities in a pre-mixed lean-burn {{natural gas engine}} have been studied. Using non-linear embedding theory, recurrence plots (RPs) and recurrence <b>qualification</b> <b>analysis</b> (RQA), the hidden rhythms and dynamic complexity of a combustion system in high dimensional phase space for each gas injection timing (GIT) have been examined, and the possible source of combustion instabilities has been identified based on 3 -D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The results reveal that for lower engine load, with the decrease of mixture concentration, the combustion instability and complexity of combustion system become {{more sensitive to the}} variation of GITs. Richer mixture and earlier (GIT 90 °CA ATDC) gas injection will lead to more stable combustion, regular oscillatory and low complexity of combustion system, while leaner mixture together with the medium GITs (from 30 to 90 °CA ATDC) easily leads to increase of combustion fluctuations, time irreversibility and dynamic complexity of combustion system. When GITs are changed, the combustion instabilities of pre-mixed lean-burn natural gas engines are from in-cylinder unreasonable stratification of mixture concentration and turbulent motion...|$|E

The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the possible causes of poor Grade 12 results in physical science in South Africa and to apply a total quality management (TQM) approach to suggest a solution. The literature study indicates that resources, preparation or subject knowledge, commitment and support affect the quality of performance. The research was done in one school district (cluster). Following the literature study a questionnaire was distributed to 150 science teachers from 31 schools and the response rate was 73 % (113 responses). The questionnaire tested the respondents' perception on the availability of resources and the support received by them, the support given to learners and their level of preparation and subject knowledge. From this, as well as from the biographical information from the questionnaire, certain conclusions were made about the reasons for poor performance of learners in science examinations. It could be concluded from the analysis of the results that limited support to teachers and support to learners are important factors contributing to a poor Grade 12 pass rate. The pass rate also correlates positively with experience levels of teachers. Although 39 % of teachers are unqualified or under-qualified, no significant correlation could be found between pass rate and level of <b>qualification.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the effect of commitment on pass rate was inconclusive.

Given that migration is often viewed {{as a way for}} individuals to locate prospective returns fitting for their <b>qualifications,</b> <b>analysis</b> of migration behavior offers an opportunity to examine the impact of status inconsistency. Key findings indicate that under-rewarded individuals, specifically relatively highly educated individuals in low status and low paying occupations, are more likely to migrate than are status consistent individuals. Over-rewarded individuals are less likely to migrate. These findings vary across metropolitan and nonmetropolitan places: individuals in nonmetropolitan areas who are under-rewarded or have mixed statuses have higher odds of migration than status consistent respondents. Individuals in metropolitan areas with inconsistent statuses are not more likely to migrate than status consistent respondents once other determinants of migration are entered in the analysis. Exploratory analysis shows migration increases the likelihood of achieving status consistency.

Design: Mixture modeling approach. Setting: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Patients or Other Participants: Cognitively normal persons, patients with AD, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. Main Outcome Measures: Cerebrospinal fluid derived p-amyloid protein 1 - 42, total tau protein, and phosphorylated tau(181 p) protein concentrations were used as biomarkers on a clinically well-characterized data set. The outcome of the <b>qualification</b> <b>analysis</b> was validated on 2 additional data sets, 1 of which was autopsy confirmed. Results: Using the US Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, a cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid protein 1 - 42 /phosphorylated tau(181 P) biomarker mixture model identified 1 feature linked to AD, while the other matched the "healthy" status. The AD signature was found in 90 %, 72 %, and 36 % of patients in the AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal groups, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since the 1960 ’s {{the need}} {{to put in place}} a {{language}} of instruction policy that favours the use of national language (Kiswahili) as a medium of instruction throughout education system in Tanzania has been considered significant. Several government guidelines, circulars and policy statements have been repeatedly produced in this regard, but with little hope! This study presents views and opinions from educational stakeholders in Tanzania as to why there has been such ambivalence in the language of instruction policy, especially at post-primary levels of education. Different views and opinions were elicited from twenty research participants, who were in four major categories: government policy-makers (GPM), university academics and researchers (UAR), international donors to Tanzania (IDT) and the general public (GP). Females and males, one each made 50 % of all research participants. Face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, documentation analysis and library survey were the main methods used in data collection. Phenomenological strategy within the qualitative approach was employed to guide the process of data analysis and interpretation on the one hand, and argumentation and discussion of research findings on the other. The study also used <b>Qualification</b> <b>Analysis</b> (QA), Linguistic Human Rights (LHRs) and Education for Self-Reliance (ESR) as the major theories which basically served as a guide. To achieve the major purpose of the study, the following main research question was used: ‘Why has Tanzanian government been so ambivalent to the use of Kiswahili as the language of instruction in post-primary education despite the fact that Kiswahili is spoken by almost 99 % of Tanzanians compared with English, which is a foreign language spoken by hardly 5 % of the population?’ According to the data analysis and interpretation (section 5. 3) and the whole corpus of discussion of major themes and research findings (section 5. 4), the study shows {{that there are a number}} of reasons and facts which, over the last forty years, have attributed to the ambivalence of the language-in-education policy in Tanzania, particularly in secondary schools and higher learning institutions...|$|E

DESIGN [...] Analysis of records entered on to audit computer (Dunnfile) and relating to inpatient episodes for one consultant general surgeon over one year. Data obtained were compared with ward records and the patient administration system to check their accuracy. SETTING [...] The three hospitals and 12 wards in Brighton health district where the surgeon admitted patients. SUBJECTS [...] 859 Records relating to inpatient episodes from 1 January to 31 December 1988. These covered 655 main procedures and 79 secondary procedures performed at the same time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Procedures were analysed by complexity of operation (BUPA code) and grade of surgeon; complications were counted and rates constructed by surgeon and by BUPA code: returns to theatre were analysed. RESULTS [...] Simple counts revealed some data, such {{as the fact that}} one registrar performed more major operations (32) than the senior registrars (22 and 14), and an analysis of complications showed that he had a lower complication rate (11. 4 % v 20. 0 % and 19. 4 %). But the simple complication rate disclosed nothing about whether the complication was avoidable. Likewise, the number of returns to theatre needed further <b>qualification.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of data collection for February to April 1988 showed a 30 % deficit of information on the audit system compared with ward records and prompted a re-examination of everyone's role in collecting data.

40|$|In South Africa, the medium-of-instruction (MOI) {{debate has}} {{continued}} to demand the attention of educators and academics, particularly after the promulgation of the 1997 multilingual language-in-education (LIE) policy {{and the introduction of}} the OBE-NCS curriculum in the schools. Using a survey questionnaire, classroom observations and focused interviews, this study aims at establishing how teachers in selected urban and rural high schools in the Mthatha District understand, interpret and implement MOI policies within their practice. It also seeks to establish reasons for implementing the MOI policies in the ways they do. The study utilizes Phillipson’s English Linguistic Imperialism Theory, Brock-Utne’s <b>Qualification</b> <b>Analysis,</b> and Vygotsky’s Social Constructivism to explain the findings. The main findings of the study are that MOI policies are not implemented uniformly in urban and rural contexts or within each context. Learner linguistic profiles, mismatch between a teacher’s home language (HL) and that of his/her learners, the subject being offered, the need to promote understanding of content, teachers’ understandings, misconceptions and beliefs about the role of language in education: all these were found to be factors which may influence a teacher’s language choice during lesson delivery. Generally, teachers endorse the use of English as a language of learning and teaching (LOLT) at high school, together with the learners’ HL. Although some teachers believe that they use English mainly for teaching, indigenous languages are also used extensively, especially in rural and township schools; code-switching, code-mixing, translation, repetition, and township lingo all make the curriculum more accessible to learners. The anomaly is that assessments are conducted only in English, even in contexts in which teaching has been mainly in code-switching mode. An English-only policy was employed in the following situations: in a desegregated urban school; in a rural high school where there was a mismatch between the teacher’s HL and that of his learners; and also in a rural high school where English was offered as a subject. The most cited reasons for using English only as an LOLT were: school language policy, teachers seeing themselves as language role models, the use of English as a LOLT at tertiary level, and past teacher training experiences. The study concludes that the major factors influencing school language policies in a multilingual country such as South Africa are the school context and the teacher and learner profiles. In addition, teaching and assessing learners in languages with which they are familiar, as well as using interactive teaching strategies, would develop learner proficiency, adaptability and creative qualifications, resulting in an improved quality of education.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a collection of}} practical techniques for analysing various market properties in order to design advanced self-evolving trading systems based on neural networks combined with a genetic algorithm optimisation approach. Nonlinear multivariate statistical models have gained increasing importance in financial time series analysis, as {{it is very hard}} to fmd statistically significant market inefficiencies using standard linear modes. Nonlinear models capture more of the underlying dynamics of these high dimensional noisy systems than traditional models, whilst at the same time making fewer restrictive assumptions about them. These adaptive trading systems can extract information about associated time varying processes that may not be readily captured by traditional models. In order to characterise the fmancial time series in terms of its dynamic nature, this research employs various methods such as fractal analysis, chaos theory and dynamical recurrence analysis. These techniques are used for evaluating whether markets are stochastic and deterministic or nonlinear and chaotic, and to discover regularities that are completely hidden in these time series and not detectable using conventional analysis. Particular emphasis is placed on examining the feasibility of prediction in fmancial time series and the analysis of extreme market events.

This research performs several tests on a large number of US and European stocks using methodologies inspired by both fundamental analysis and technical trading rules.

In addition future aeroelastic tests will not only focus on the classical interactions of aerodynamic-,elastic-,and inertial forces of the flying system, but also on their interaction with all modern active systems like flight- and manoeuvre control and load alleviation systems, etc. The paper addresses advanced aeroelastic test philosophies ranging from sophisticated ground tests on prototypes to complex wind tunnel tests with scaled models. Design and optimisation of high quality aeroelastic tests with respect to time and costs as well as computer aided test preparation are important issues for efficient testing. As future challenges of aeroelastic testing will be discussed: -Aeroelastic testing and <b>qualification</b> by <b>analysis</b> and –High fidelity numerical simulations and experimental response surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Sophisticate {{computational}} tools {{exist in}} nuclear thermal-hydraulics; however, approximations and hypotheses {{are needed to}} derive solutions or results applicable for the design and safety analysis of Nuclear Power Plants (NPP). A vast amount of experimental data has been gathered from so-called basic experiments, separate effect and integral effect test facilities. The measured data has been extensively used to prove the validity of computational tools. A number of issues arises when comparing experimental data with the code results (validation process) as well as when attempting to apply the codes to the actual configuration of nuclear reactors. Examples are: a) precision targets are not established; b) in one assigned scenario some measured parameters maybe very well predicted and other {{at the same time}} may be mispredicted c) full demonstration of scaling capability cannot be achieved; d) some phenomena, whose importance is recognized within accident analysis in NPP, like two phase critical flow are predicted with large errors also {{due to the lack of}} modeling of parameters as density of the nucleation sites (either in the fluid and on the solid wall) and possible void formation following sharp edge cavitation upstream the break location. We propose the design of a virtual (so far) test facility aiming at prioritization of the research in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics with respect to the importance on safety and design of NPP. The test facility is entitled as μλ-I 4 TF (μ=Modular, λ=Large, Advanced, Multi-Basics & discipline apparatus, I 4 TF=Ideal (four times) Test facility) and has the following key features: • The scaling of the reference configuration is based upon the findings and recommendation of a recently issued NEA/CSNI State-of-Art-Report on Scaling. • The size is the maximum reasonable (even though it remains four times ideal). • Occurring phenomena are expected to cover an entire spectrum of accidents in Light Water Reactors (LWR), including primary system and containment. • Calculated trends are (to be demonstrated) fully consistent with the experimental data base available today. The global strategy behind this idea can be summarized as following: 1) To fix the minimum list of accident scenarios which covers all the phenomena mentioned above with the reasonable ranges of variation of dominating parameters, including their combination; 2) To perform calculation and analysis of each selected scenario (one example is provided in the present paper); 3) To show consistency between the calculated phenomena and parameter ranges with the experimental data; 4) To change features of the μλ-I 4 TF (e. g. by introducing CFD portions, by changing scaling laws, etc.) and performing new calculation; 5) The comparison between the calculation results at previous step with the reference calculation at step 2) may involve large differences in Safety Margins or in important design features: those differences (following a specific <b>qualification</b> <b>analysis)</b> will support the prioritization of new research in nuclear thermal-hydraulics. The purposes of the present paper are: - to describe the overall pattern of prioritization-driven research using μλ-I 4 TF facility, - to present the main features of μλ-I 4 TF, - to perform one reference calculation of the selected accident scenario...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{economic}} and social cohesion in the European Union. There are different factors to explain the convergence process and besides, empirical findings are not conclusive. To the European Union, GDP per head interregional differences have decreased for certain periods but it has remained unchanged or even increased for others periods. The second report on the economic and social cohesion indicates that some decades are necessary to eliminate regional differences. These differences in regional GDP are mainly explained by differences in their productive structures, degree of innovate activity, communications structures, which depend on the relative level of transport infrastructures, and manpower <b>qualifications.</b> This <b>analysis</b> allows us to obtain some conclusions to the economic policies and the social cohesion.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{gender gap}} in {{advanced}} math coursework in high school that many believe exists because girls are discouraged from taking math courses. In this paper, we exploit an institutional change that reduced the costs of acquiring advanced high school math to determine if access is, in fact, the mechanism - in particular for girls {{at the top of}} the math ability distribution. By estimating marginal treatment effects of acquiring advanced math qualifications, we document substantial beneficial wage effects from encouraging even more females to opt for these <b>qualifications.</b> Our <b>analysis</b> suggests that the beneficial effect comes from accelerating graduation and attracting females to high-paid or traditionally male-dominated career tracks and to CEO positions. Our results may be reconciled with experimental and empirical evidence suggesting there is a pool of unexploited math talent among high ability girls that may be retrieved by changing the institutional set-up of math teaching...|$|R
40|$|The {{creation}} of a quasi-market in England and Wales schooling has changed pupil, parent and school behaviour {{in a way which}} has reinforced the dominance of traditional, academic schooling. We summarise the results of research into this quasi-market behaviour, with particular emphasis upon the upper secondary age group. Whilst schools now face greater incentives to respond to consumer choice, we argue that only certain groups of consumers have been effectively empowered by these reforms. Schools thus respond only to the wishes of a sub-sample of consumers. In effect, they receive a signal which is biased against the provision of quality vocational schooling. We link this analysis to changes in structure of contemporary labour markets and the attempt to gain credibility for a national system of vocational <b>qualifications.</b> Our <b>analysis</b> concludes with proposals which seek {{to improve the quality of}} the information flows between parents, schools and the labour market. ...|$|R

30|$|Securing {{employment}} is, of course, not {{the sole}} measure of successful integration into the labor market. Immigrants who find work but become stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs remain at risk of marginalization and exclusion. It is therefore also important to ask whether immigrants {{are able to make}} their way into more secure, higher skilled jobs after several years in the labor market. To explore this, this section first analyzes the proportion of migrants in vulnerable positions, such as those out-of-employment (including both unemployment and out of the labor force) or those in the lowest skilled jobs. Second, it studies how the proportion of immigrants working in jobs requiring different types of skills (low, medium and high) or not working varies with years since arrival. Finally, we consider the impact of immigrants’ individual characteristics on their occupational trajectories and evaluate {{the extent to which the}} pathways into middle-skilled work for immigrants hold up for those who lack high-level educational <b>qualifications.</b> The <b>analysis</b> is done by cohort of arrival.|$|R
