50|$|Clinically, <b>quinupramine</b> is {{reported}} to be stimulating similarly to imipramine, desipramine, and demexiptiline. It can be inferred that its in vivo metabolites may have stronger effects on the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin than <b>quinupramine</b> itself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinupramine</b> (brand names Kevopril, Kinupril, Adeprim, Quinuprine) is a {{tricyclic}} antidepressant (TCA) used in Europe {{for the treatment}} of depression.|$|E
50|$|Many {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) including clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, imipraminoxide, lofepramine, metapramine, opipramol, <b>quinupramine,</b> and trimipramine contain saturated dibenzazepine moieties {{in their}} chemical structures.|$|E
50|$|Pharmacologically, <b>quinupramine</b> acts {{in vitro}} {{as a strong}} muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor antagonist (anticholinergic) and H1 receptor antagonist (antihistamine), moderate 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It has negligible affinity for the α1-adrenergic, α2-adrenergic, β-adrenergic, or D2 receptor.|$|E
40|$|To the Editor: A 16 -year-old {{boy in a}} coma (Glasgow scale 3) {{with general}} {{seizures}} {{was admitted to the}} intensive care unit. No palpable pulse necessitated cardiac massage. A blood specimen submitted to this laboratory tested positive for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) by EMIT (Behring, Cupertino, CA) and negative by FPIA (Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). A number of antidepressants were screened for in blood by a high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method (1) : amineptine, amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, dosulepine, doxepin, fluoxetine, imipramine, maprotiline, metapramine, mianserine, nomifensine, nortriptyline, opipramol, propizepine, protriptyline, <b>quinupramine,</b> tianeptine, trimipramine, and vilox,~ine. None of these compounds were found in this sample. Drug screening for phenothiazines (2), which are known to be a frequent cause of false-positive results with immunoassays (3), was negative. A comprehensive drug test, performed by HPLC with diode-array detection (4), identified buflomedil, a peripheral vasodi ator, at a concentration f 28 mg/L in this specimen. Studies were then performed with drug-free plasma samples spiked with buflomedil in a concentration range of 1 to 100 mg/L. A positive result for TCA was obtained for 13 mg/L with EMIT and 85 mg/L with FPIA. These results demonstrate that buflomedil cross-reacts with TCA in both systems at concentrations that can be found in ac te toxications. Indeed, whereas therapeutic plasma values of buflomedil are 1 to 4 rag/L, cardiotoxicity may occur as soon as plasma concentrations are greater than 10 mg/L (5). A review of the literature revealed nodata on this cross-reactivity. The pointing out of such an interference may beof grea...|$|E
