5|$|The <b>Question</b> <b>Time</b> British National Party {{controversy}} {{occurred in}} the autumn of 2009, due to an invitation by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to Nick Griffin, leader of the far-right British National Party (BNP), to be a panelist on <b>Question</b> <b>Time,</b> one of its flagship television programmes on current affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} record audience for <b>Question</b> <b>Time</b> was set during its 14 May 2009 edition {{in the wake}} of the MPs' expenses scandal, when 3.8million watched. and The Guardian had estimated the broadcast might attract '3million or so' viewers. The programme was watched by over 8million people, the highest in the 30-year history of <b>Question</b> <b>Time,</b> and nearly triple the programme's normal audience of two to three million.|$|E
5|$|<b>Question</b> <b>Time</b> is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put questions to politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. <b>Question</b> <b>Time</b> is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on <b>Question</b> <b>Time.</b> It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E

5|$|A late {{appeal was}} made to the BBC Trust, the BBC's {{governing}} body, by the Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain, to have the appearance blocked, which ultimately failed. Griffin appeared on the edition which aired on 22 October 2009. As the programme was due to go on air, public protests took place at BBC Television Centre in London. The pre-recorded programme featured Griffin alongside the Secretary of State for Justice Jack Straw, the Conservative peer and Shadow Minister for Community Cohesion Sayeeda Warsi, Baroness Warsi, the Liberal Democrats' Home Affairs spokesperson Chris Huhne, and the writer/playwright Bonnie Greer. The edition was watched by over 8million people – over half the total audience share – and {{more than double the}} previous record high for <b>Question</b> <b>Time.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Question</b> <b>Time</b> {{was held}} in BBC Television Centre in London, {{for the first time}} in four years, to enable the police to keep order for Griffin's appearance.

The recording of the edition of 22 October was brought forward two hours from the usual 8.30pm start time to allow for any disruption, before being broadcast later the same night.|$|E

Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final <b>question</b> <b>time</b> limit.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October 2009, Griffin {{took part}} in the BBC's topical debate programme, <b>Question</b> <b>Time,</b> as a {{representative}} of the BNP. He appeared alongside Bonnie Greer, Jack Straw, Baroness Warsi and Chris Huhne. He was challenged by members of the studio audience, and questioned by host David Dimbleby on comments he had previously made on the Holocaust. He was also critical of Islam. His invitation followed the election of two BNP MEPs to the European Parliament, and led to significant debate over the merits of the BBC's decision. The appearance sparked a protest outside the BBC Television Centre prior to the recording of the programme, in which an estimated 500 people picketed the front entrance of the complex, many chanting anti-Nazi slogans and others trying to break into the building to stop the programme being filmed. Some got past the police and security, but were expelled. Six protesters were arrested, and three police officers were injured, one needing hospital treatment.|$|E
