40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{simulation}} is {{to identify}} the best filter design for the test data set. Therefore, the test data set described in section 6. 3 has been processed using {{each of the three}} different filter models described in section 6. 4. It should be mentioned that regularization (cf. section C. 1) and variance component estimation (cf. section C. 2) of the PCGMA algorithm were used within all three computations. Within this section the results of these three computations are compared to each other. The comparison is performed with respect to: • the gravity field solution in terms of <b>quasi</b> <b>geoid</b> heights, • the spherical harmonic coefficients, i. e. the parameters of the least squares solution, and • the residuals of the least squares adjustment. <b>Quasi</b> <b>geoid</b> heights are obtained in the following manner. First, the potential U of a rotational ellipsoid is subtracted from the potential V in order to obtain the so-called disturbing potential T. T = V − U (6. 39) Then, the disturbing potential T is divided by the normal gravity γ of the reference ellipsoid (cf. Heiskanen and Moritz 1967), which yields the <b>quasi</b> <b>geoid</b> height...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} outline of the modern {{physical}} height systems which are based on levelling and gravity surveys. Also, the Slovenian vertical networks are presented (vertical datum and height system) with all their drawbacks. The adoption of the new modern height system and determination of the new (<b>quasi)</b> <b>geoid</b> would enable a widespread use of GNNS levelling. The possible use of the new national vertical datum or European vertical datum is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the context}} of a GOCE {{regional}} vali-dation and combination experiment in Germany, a work package {{within the framework of the}} GOCE-GRAND II project, gravity observations, vertical deflections and GPS/levelling data are collected as independent data sets. The observation of absolute gravity values is carried out by the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie (BKG), while the vertical deflections are observed by the Institut für Erdmessung (IfE) using the Hannover digital transportable zenith camera system TZK 2 -D. The vertical deflections have an accuracy of approx. 0. 1 arc seconds and are arranged along a north-south and east-west profile. The two profiles have a length of about 500 km each with a spacing of 2. 5 – 5 km between adjacent stations. Furthermore, a national GPS and levelling data set of about 900 stations with an accuracy of approx. 1 cm is available for Germany. The analysis of the vertical deflections is carried out by the astronomical levelling method, resulting in two (<b>quasi)</b> <b>geoid</b> profiles. The accuracy of the profiles is expected to be at the cm level. A cross-validation of both the vertical deflection and GPS/-levelling data is realised by traversing the profiles through all nearby GPS/levelling stations (approx. 40 in total). In addition, comparisons are performe...|$|E
