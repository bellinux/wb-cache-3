5|$|Benzema began {{earning more}} playing {{time in the}} 2006–07 season and made his {{competitive}} season debut in the 2006 Trophée des Champions against Paris Saint-Germain. In the French Supercup, Benzema converted a penalty which drew the match at 1–1. Lyon later won the league curtain-raiser 5–4 on penalties. Benzema opened the league campaign on a <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> scoring in the team's first match of the season against Nantes. Three weeks later, on 26 August 2006, Benzema appeared as a substitute and scored two goals in a 4–1 away win over Nice. He also converted two goals in the Champions League group stage against Romanian outfit Steaua București and Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv. After appearing regularly during the autumn campaign, on 10 November, Benzema suffered a severe thigh injury. The injury resulted in the striker missing three months of action before returning in February 2007. Benzema failed to score a goal until the final league match of the season against Nantes as Lyon recorded its sixth consecutive league title.|$|E
5|$|Nasri {{began the}} 2006–07 season playing under Albert Emon, his fourth {{different}} manager in three years. Despite this, Marseille's now heightened popularity saw increased speculation from writers and supporters that the club would finally win its first league title since the 1991–92 season. Nasri began the season on a <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> scoring the second {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 win over Paris Saint-Germain in September 2006. On 29 April 2007, Nasri scored a goal in Marseille's 4–2 hammering of Sochaux. Marseille were due to face the same club in the 2007 Coupe de France Final just days later and were, subsequently, heavy favorites {{as a result of}} the team's two-goal victory in the previous match. However, Sochaux recorded an upset victory defeating Marseille 5–4 on penalties after the match ended 2–2 following extra time. On the final match day of the season, Nasri converted the only goal in a 1–0 win over Sedan. The victory secured 2nd place for Marseille and was the club's best finish since finishing runner-up to Bordeaux in the 1998–99 season. Nasri finished the season with a career-high 50 appearances, 37 of them in the league. For his efforts, he was awarded the UNFP Young Player of the Year award and named to the Team of the Year. Nasri was also voted the Club Player of the Year by supporters, receiving 62% of the votes ahead of the likes of Ribéry and Niang.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1540s, {{after his}} initial assumed {{employment}} with Gardane and Scotto, Gero published two books of madrigals in the then-popular note nere (black note) style. [...] In music of this style, black notes referred to <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> values (i.e. filled-in note heads, as in modern quarter-notes rather than half-notes); quick passages alternated with slower ones, and syncopation was common.|$|E
2500|$|Many of his {{published}} madrigals, {{for four}} to six voices, give no hint in the score of the extravagance of their original premières. [...] They are full of textural contrast, as befits their dramatic origin. [...] His earlier work shows {{the influence of the}} frottola, and often his style mimics Arcadelt's. [...] The madrigals he wrote for the Medici weddings are often in a note nere, i.e. [...] "black note" [...] style: [...] choppy rhythms, <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> values, sudden textural contrasts; in addition, they were usually designed for instrumental accompaniment, and consequently the soprano and bass lines often stand out. [...] In this they foreshadow the development of monody by the Florentine Camerata later in the century.|$|E
2500|$|All of Ciera's known {{music is}} vocal. His {{complete}} surviving output {{amounts to a}} single setting of the mass, four motets, and two published collections of madrigals. Dates of the works range from 1554 to 1561, with the two books of madrigals – the first for four voices, and the second for five – published in 1554 and 1561, respectively. Ciera's style in his sacred music (the motets and mass) was akin {{to that of the}} Netherlanders, with dense pervading imitation. His madrigals, on the other hand, use chordal harmonies, and occasionally what was referred to as the [...] "note nere" [...] technique ("black note" [...] for [...] "filled in notes" [...] – i.e. <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> values, running passages, alternating with other textures). [...] Some of the madrigals are antiphonal in places, reminiscent of the polychoral style of the Venetian School.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a relief}} to the party when they emerged from the forests into the little clearings where villages had once stood, for the gloom and quiet of the great forest weighed upon the spirits. The {{monotonous}} too too of the doves--not a slow dreamy cooing like that of the English variety, but a sharp <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> repeated in endless succession--alone broke the hush. The silence, the apparently never ending forest, the monotony of rank vegetation, the absence of a breath of wind to rustle a leaf, were most oppressive, and the feeling was not lessened by the dampness and heaviness of the air, and the malarious exhalation and smell of decaying vegetation arising from the swamps.|$|E

His acute faculty of perception took <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> {{of a change in}} Blair's mother. Lane turned his gaze away. The agony of joy and sorrow--the light of her face--was more than Lane could stand. He looked at the sister Margaret--a tall, fair girl. She had paint on her cheeks. She did not see Lane. Her strained gaze held a beautiful and piercing intentness. Then her eyes opened wide, her hand went to cover her mouth, and she cried out: [...] "Oh Blair!--poor boy! Brother!" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{was glad}} enough to sit down, but I {{answered}} her at random. She re-entered the cottage and continued some household duties. I sat quite still, {{with my eyes}} steadily fixed upon a dark object {{a little to the}} left of those white palings. Above my head a starling in a wicker cage was making an insane cackling, on the green patch in front a couple of tame rabbits sat and watched me, pink-eyed, imperturbable. Inside I could hear the slow ticking of an eight-day clock. The woman was humming to herself as she worked. All these things, which my senses took <b>quick</b> <b>note</b> of and retained, seemed to me to belong to another world. I myself was under some sort of spell. My brain was numb with terror, the fire of life had left my veins, so that I sat there in the warm sunshine and shivered until my teeth chattered. Inside, the woman was singing over her work.|$|E
6000|$|Berenice {{was looking}} radiantly beautiful. The {{exquisite}} simplicity {{of her white}} muslin gown and large hat of black feathers, the slight flush with which she received him, as though she carried about with her a secret which she expected every one to read, the extinction of that air of listlessness which had robbed her for some time of a certain share of her good looks--of all these things Borrowdean made <b>quick</b> <b>note.</b> His face grew graver as he accepted her not very enthusiastic invitation and occupied {{the back seat of}} the carriage. For the first time he admitted to himself the possibility of failure in his carefully laid plans. He recognized the fact, that there were forces at work against which he had no weapon ready. He had believed that Berenice was attracted by Mannering's personality and genius. He had never seriously considered the question of her feelings becoming more deeply involved. So many men had paid vain court to her. She had a wonderful reputation for inaccessibility. And yet he remembered her manner when he had paid his first unexpected visit to Blakely. It should have been a lesson to him. How far had the mischief gone, he wondered! ...|$|E
