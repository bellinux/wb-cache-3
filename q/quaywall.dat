Each structure has been selected as it has a typical structural type. Predominant frequencies of these structures are estimated by means of spectral analysis.

40|$|The {{construction}} of cofferdams to protect building pits nearby rivers against high water dis-charges {{is part of}} the history in development of geotechnical engineering. Today cofferdams with a total height up to 25 m and a width up to 30 m and more are to be built as a part of <b>quaywalls</b> in modern marine terminals for bulk-goods and containers. The calculation methods for this high specialised constructions are world wide very different. The goal of all calculations is to minimize the dimensions and in consequence of this the costs of the quay wall. German geotechnical engineers normally use the method of JELINEK which is proposed in the recommendation R 100 of the EAU 1990. Applying this recommendation for the planning of a sea-lock for ocean-going vessels up to 150, 000 dwt it was found out that there are some differences in calculation between cofferdams used as protection elements against flood levels and cofferdams used as quay walls with a very complexe load of different dynamic influences of several live loads and water-pressure at one side and bulkhead weight, passive earth pressure and the support body as statically load on the other side. The comparison of the results for some cofferdam cross-sections of the improved JELINEK-method by using the diagrams with the results, won by using other calculation methods are sufficient. So the found out method for cofferdam calculation can be generally recommended to geotechnical engineers. At last a comparison is given about needed steel for sheet-piles and surface to be driven into the subsoil under the future dredging level for cellular cofferdams and double-wall cofferdams.

40|$|In this {{multidisciplinary}} {{project a}} proposal for a framework for tsunami risk management in Chile, has been developed. This was done using Iquique in the north of Chile as a case study. Solutions for improvement of current practice have been searched within specific activity areas of hazard management: prediction, mitigation and response. Prediction concerns the available intelligence on the chance of occurrence and the related force of the tsunami event. For this, earthquake (and resulting tsunami) scenarios have been defined and modeled with NeoWave in order to establish probable boundary conditions {{for the rest of the}} research. A scenario based on the conditions described by [Chlieh et al., 2011 b], with a Mw. 8. 8, turned out to have the worst results (runup of 12 m max, inundation of almost 10 m max, and arrival time less than 12 min). Based on these results estimations have been made of the number of people at risk and economic damage. The number of people at risk was derived from zonal data from [SINTIA, 2010] and resulted in at least 12, 500 people living in inundated areas. Direct economic damage was derived using fragility curves [Mas et al., 2012 b] and building value estimations [Blong, 2001], and resulted in 14 : 90 M damage in an Iquique downtown area and 142 M damage in the Zofri shopping mall area. For mitigation of tsunami effects, prevention of the tsunami event (e. g. by means of breakwaters) has not been taken into account. Focus has been on city evacuation, possible slope failures of infrastructure, and possibilities of vertical evacuation. For city evacuation remarkable differences between inundation maps from SHOA, ONEMI, the Municipality of Iquique, and our model results were indicated, from which the cause is not clear. An optimistic calculation on evacuation possibilities of the Zofri shopping mall has shown that only 6, 000 people (from 10, 000 people present during peak hour) could escape. A slope failure analysis of the main exit from the Zofri area and the highway A 16 has indicated that both slopes are instable. Additional geo analyses pointed out that safety zones in higher grounds are stable, that there's a lack of knowledge on liquefaction of <b>quaywalls</b> (which could be troublesome for port evacuation routes), and that scouring of sidewalks is likely (however it will not occur during evacuation). An initial analysis on high buildings in Iquique resulted in 56 buildings that have been examined for vertical evacuation and two areas that lack any possibilities for vertical evacuation (Zofri and the port). An hydraulic load analysis has been done, based on both NeoWave model results and analytical approach. After a comparative stability analysis with available criteria for seismic loads, 21 buildings in Iquique were marked as suitable for vertical evacuation.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formulation of a simple and practical method for esti-mating the earthquake resistant powr of <b>quaywall</b> structures. In the first part, the factoranalysis was made with reference to some reports on damaged quaywalls during the NigataEarthquake in 1964 and the Tokachi-oki Earthquake in 1968. The result shows that thedensity or shear strength of subsoil {{is one of the most}} important factor for the earthquakedamages of structures. In the second part of this paper, the microtremor of <b>quaywall</b> structures were measuredat the site of Osaka harbour. In an attempt to compare these in-situ measurements withcalculations, the FE-analysis of quaywall-subsoil system was also made.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The authors initial {{thought on}} the {{backwards}} problem in geotechnical earthquake engineering is presented through {{an example of}} damage to caisson <b>quaywall</b> during earthquakes. Both a simplified and de-tailed dynamic analyses are presented. It is essential to confirm, at the outset, that the backwards problem. is well defined. There should be sufficient geotechnical data and earthquake data to match the analysis procedure used for solving the backwards problem. Ill-defined backwards problem, either {{due to lack of}} required ge-otechnical or earthquake motion data, should be corrected before the trial solution of the backwards problem. 1 INTRODUCTON Backwards problem in geotechnical earthquake engineering is to identify the process to the residu-al states (often in terms of excessive deformation rather than complete collapse) of geotechnical structures as the most likely scenario that is ex-plained through geotechnical and earthquake data. Backwards problem usually consists of three steps. The first step is to define the problem in terms o...|$|E
40|$|Thirty three {{papers have}} been {{submitted}} for this session, covering a range of topics {{within the field of}} dynamic response of foundations and retaining structures. The topics can be broadly classified into the following five categories: (a) Seismic behavior of quaywalls, including the analysis and design of countermeasures to resist strong seismic motions and liquefaction 'flow' failure. Essentially all papers in this category refer to, or have been motivated by, the extensive <b>quaywall</b> failures (and successes) in Kobe, during the 17 - 1 - 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake. [Papers Numbered : 32, 43, 59, 66, 92, 61, 101]. (b) Analysis of piles and pile-supported structures subjected to lateral-spreading type of ground deformation. Again, the papers in this session seem to have been motivated by the numerous incidences of liquefaction-induced large ground deformations and their effect on nearby piles in the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. [Papers Numbered : 55, 86, 90, 132, 137]. (c) Dynamic response of pile foundations, under inertial and kinematic vibratory loading. The papers in this group include studies on the effect of pile response on soil-structure interaction. [Papers Numbered: 10 A 28, 53, 57, 83, 98, 108]. (d) Analysis of the dynamic responses of shallow and embedded foundations, in a variety of situations. [Papers Numbered: 41, 43, 52, 127, 63, 134, 140, 141]. (e) Dynamic response and design of retaining walls, which retain and are supported by 'stable' soil. [Papers Numbered: 31, 122 A, 23]. One interesting remark is that the methods used in the papers for analysis, design, or just interpretation of the observed phenomena include: Â· theoretical analyses (numerical. analytical, and hybrid) Â· large scale shaking table tests Â· centrifuge model tests. In several of the papers the results of such theoretical and/or experimental analyses are contrasted against field observations, to reach reliable conclusions regarding the seismic behavior of complex soil-structure systems. Overall, the papers in this session reflect the considerable progress during the last 4 years {{in the state of the}} art of analyzing the behavior of retaining structures and pile foundations under very strong seismic shaking and large ground imposed deformations...|$|E
