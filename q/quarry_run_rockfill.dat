Two months later, Tahoma raided St. Marks, Florida, burned a barracks and destroyed a battery of cannon before heading out to sea, unscathed.|$|R
5000|$|During the war many {{works of}} art from {{galleries}} in London were stored in slate caverns at Manod. The access road to the <b>quarry</b> <b>ran</b> from Llan Ffestiniog rather than the village of Manod, so the treasures were brought by the GWR to [...] station where they were put onto lorries for {{the last leg of}} their journey. Some of the paintings were so large that the roadway under the bridge north of Festiniog station had to be lowered.|$|R
50|$|From 1865 to 1923, {{the island}} was home to a farm run by Richard McCloud and Elisha Brigham. It was also {{the site of a}} <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> by the Bass Island Brownstone Company which {{operated}} from 1868 into the 1890s. The brownstone from this and other Apostle Islands quarries was in great demand, and brownstone from Basswood Island was used {{in the construction of the}} first Milwaukee County Courthouse in the 1860s.

50|$|Despite {{starting}} in May, Quarry had 14 matches in 1965 {{at the start}} of his pro career. Many of his early career fights took place at the Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles, where he was a popular crowd draw. Quarry supplemented meager boxing pay then by working as a tire changer at a Greyhound bus terminal.Quarry's first loss came in his 21st bout, in July, 1966, a poor showing against veteran and former contender Eddie Machen in 1966. By then he had three draws on his record.Motivated by the loss to Machen, <b>Quarry</b> <b>ran</b> off a streak of wins over good, second-tier heavyweights and rose in the rankings.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1809 Fawn formed part of the {{squadron}} off Guadeloupe under Captain Volant Vashon Ballard of Blonde. On 25 September [...] Blonde, Fawn, and [...] sent their boats after an enemy vessel making for Basse-Terre. To escape her pursuers, their <b>quarry</b> <b>ran</b> herself ashore in a bay between two batteries. The boat parties reached the French vessel despite cross-fire from the batteries and {{in the face of}} small arms fire from men on the beach. However, the British were unable to get the French vessel off. Instead, as she was bilged, they simply left. British casualties amounted to two men wounded from Blonde, one of whom lost an arm and the other of whom later died.|$|R

50|$|On {{the north}} shore of Smith Sound, across from Britannia, lies Nut Cove, the site of a slate <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> by three brothers, William Carberry, George Carberry and Jubal Carberry, during 1850-1900. Approximately 100 years later, it became better known as the inclement-weather crash site of an American Convair B-36 bomber known as The Peacemaker, killing all on board on March 18, 1953, {{including}} Brigadier General Richard E. Ellsworth. The flight originated in the Azores and was bound for the plane's home in Rapid City Air Force Base, South Dakota, renamed Ellsworth Air Force Base. The calamity claimed more lives that night when all on board a second plane, a Boeing SB-29 Superfortress from Harmon Air Force Base in Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador spotted the downed Convair, then disappeared, the plane and crew never seen again.|$|R

2500|$|On 9 October 1803 Atalante pursued two ketches and a brig at Saint Gildas Point. The <b>quarry</b> <b>ran</b> ashore {{near the}} mouth of the Pennerf river. Mansfield then sent in his boats on a cutting out expedition. One boat {{captured}} one of the ketches but couldn't bring her off; while they were so engaged they endured fire from soldiers on board the other ketch and troops with two field guns on the beach. The boarding party then abandoned their vessel and went to the assistance of the party that had boarded the brig. That party had killed six of the 10 or 12 soldiers on the brig, thrown two over board, and driven the rest and the crew below decks. The boarding party was unable to get the brig off the shore so they abandoned her without setting her on fire in consideration of the men below decks. Atalante lost one man killed and two wounded in the operation. Next day Masefield was pleased to see that the brig was on a ridge of rocks and [...] "apparently bilged".|$|R
50|$|Freight {{traffic from}} a nearby <b>quarry</b> {{continued}} to <b>run</b> until 1978 when the contract for the traffic expired. From then onwards, goods traffic was solely for railway civil engineering use, with the final train running in 1986.|$|R
25|$|Puddingstone plays a {{historic}} {{role in the}} area. The large puddingstone <b>quarry</b> that <b>ran</b> between Tremont Street and Allegany Street produced the stone foundations {{of most of the}} late-19th-century houses in the neighborhood. This locally sourced material made quick construction of working-class housing possible. Some structures around the Tremont Street/Parker Street intersection are made entirely of the material, including 682-688 Parker Street, 2-5 Sewall Street and 1472-74 Tremont Street (1856, David Connery, mason).|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{research}} {{is done on}} the Carbon Footprint of different coastal protection systems. In the process of gathering data for the analyses I contacted many different companies and organizations for information on either the project of Scheveningen or on emission coefficients. The individuals I want to thank in particular are J. Wyrdeman and R. van der Kooi for their specific information concerning the reinforcement work at the coast of Scheveningen. J. Rietdijk from Delfland for his expert knowledge on the dredging activities on site. M. Boor and R. van de Ketterij looked into information on dredging emissions. M. Onderwater from Alkyon for his additional calculations on the wave spectrum at Scheveningen. I want to thank J.

50|$|Later {{renamed the}} 'Penrhos Branch' by the GWR, post-nationalisation it {{came under the}} control of British Railways. On 31 March 1963, a fire {{destroyed}} Tynycaeau Junction signal box and BR decided not to rebuild it, and hence the Penrhos Branch section from the Walnut Tree tunnel southwards to Tynycaeau junction was maintained as its original double track but given 'long siding' status and as Steetley Doloma workings had always necessitated a run-round by the steam locomotive, which could not be performed at the Walnut Tree West rail connection due to the permanent way layout, the loco' had to travel 'light engine' for a round trip of 7Â¼ miles by running to Tynycaeau and crossing over from down to up line near the former junction with the Cadoxton-Wenvoe-Pontypridd line. With the signal box out of action at Tynycaeau, the crossover was modified to sprung points from down to up line. Eventually even that section was curtailed and sleeper stops placed on both lines at the Walnut Tree tunnel north portal. The double track was not lifted until the decommissioning of the whole line in 1969. The remaining branch was later worked as a single-track long siding from Penrhos to the Steetley Doloma limestone quarry, just south of the viaduct, the permanent way layout having been modified. The last train to the <b>quarry</b> <b>ran</b> over the viaduct in 1967. By the late 1990s the tunnel was gated and by the year 2000 the quarry had breached the tunnel lining, leaving a 50 yd air gap in its structure.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} {{to connect the}} newly built luxury GNSoR Cruden Bay Hotel in Cruden Bay to the wider rail network. From there, the line ran on to Boddam to serve local <b>quarries.</b> The line <b>ran</b> through a very rural area, from a junction with the Formartine and Buchan Railway at Ellon railway station, however the line was constructed to a high standard, with bridges throughout.|$|R
50|$|The {{final phase}} was from 1891 to 1897, when the <b>quarry</b> was <b>run</b> by J Solomon Jones, and traded as the Moelwyn Slate Company. There are few {{details of the}} amount of slate {{produced}} by the quarry, and the Department of Mines only has one set of annual returns for the entire life of the quarry. Large scale Ordnance Survey maps of the area were published in 1889 and 1901, but both correspond to periods when the quarry was not in production, and so although the formation of the main tramway and inclines can be seen, and the location of the mill and its water wheel is evident, few other details can be gleaned from this source.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Broadcroft Quarry {{had been}} worked {{for many years}} since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century in the form of a number of smaller individual family <b>run</b> <b>quarries</b> which eventually merged to form a large quarry.

50|$|The line {{first opened}} in 1840 to carry stone from the {{recently}} opened Tootle Heights quarry on the northeastern {{side of the}} village of Longridge, as it then was. Wagons carrying <b>quarried</b> stone <b>ran</b> downhill to Preston and were hauled {{in the other direction}} by horses. There were rudimentary passenger facilities at a level crossing in Burey Lane (later called Berry Lane) which at the time was a rural lane with only a couple of houses; the village of Longridge was at the southeast end of the lane. A hotel was built next to the station, and was known as the Longridge Railway Tavern and the Station Hotel before being renamed in 1853 the Towneley Arms, as it is still known today.|$|R

50|$|This quarry in the Orange Mountain (First Watchung) basalt began {{operating}} in the early 1900s under the ownership of Louis Keller. Originally named The Commonwealth Quarry, it was later obtained by the North Jersey Quarry Company. In the 1950s, the Houdaille Construction Materials Company purchased the <b>quarry</b> and <b>ran</b> it until 1977. In the early 1970s, the Interstate-78 road cut was excavated immediately adjacent to the pit, and across the access road between the quarry and the plant. The access road was in a cut. A bridge was constructed over this cut to accommodate I-78 while keeping the quarry functioning. However, the quarry closed only 2 or 3 years later {{in the aftermath of}} the 1973 oil embargo and the resulting increase in fuel and asphalt prices.|$|R
