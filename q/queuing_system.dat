25|$|A similar, {{but more}} inconspicuous, {{incident}} also {{occurred on the}} Sunday evening before the Championships. A swarm of bees descended upon the area surrounding the All England Club; this caused the clearing out of the players' lawn (where competitors gather after play) and a temporary cessation of some interviews. Further disruption was caused because organizers had to alter the overnight <b>queuing</b> <b>system,</b> {{in order to protect}} people. This {{was the first time that}} bees had caused disruptions at the All England Club. Some media outlets reported that the bees deserted the grounds after around 90 minutes, whilst others claimed that a similar resolution to the pigeon problem was sought, with the bees being professionally exterminated.|$|E
500|$|The ride's {{construction}} took seven months, and 120 {{construction workers}} and project managers participated. Testing took two months. The park conducted a [...] "pull-through" [...] by pulling a train along {{the course to}} ensure proper clearance. The ride was inspected and tested with water-dummies on the trains. The first media event was held on May 11, 2000, and the ride {{opened to the public}} on May 13. When it opened, it broke six world records. It was the first Giga Coaster and was the world's fastest complete-circuit roller coaster, but was later overtaken by other rides. About a month after Millennium's debut, Cedar Point introduced a new <b>queuing</b> <b>system</b> called [...] "Ticket to Ride" [...] to reduce the waiting times, which allowed visitors to buy a ticket then return later and wait in a shorter line. In August, Cedar Point engaged John Hancock and Associates and Stalker Radar of Indianapolis to measure the height and speed of Millennium Force. The height was measured at , and the speed was measured at , slightly faster than what the park had been advertising (92mph).|$|E

The initial contract between Q-Bot developers Lo-Q was for 1 year from 8 April 2008. This contract was extended for 2009 before a new 3-year contract was signed on 26 March 2010. Three tiers of the device are available at different prices which reduce the queue time by different proportions. Most rides can be selected with Q Bot, {{with the exception of}} those which boast large or thin alleyways.|$|E

40|$|Abstract.

40|$|In appointment-driven systems, {{service is}} {{administered}} only during predefined service sessions (e. g. {{during the opening}} hours of a doctors office). When making an appointment, a patient is assigned an appointment date (at some future service session) and joins a waiting list. At the appointment date, the patient leaves the waiting list and enters the service facility (e. g. a doctors office). At the service facility the patient once more joins a queue (e. g. the waiting room at the doctors office), receives service and leaves the system. Appointment-driven systems {{may be found in}} healthcare, legal services, administration and many other service systems. It is clear that an appointment-driven system is in fact a combination of two distinct <b>queueing</b> <b>systems.</b> In a first <b>queueing</b> <b>system,</b> patients arrive at the queue (i. e. the waiting list) when making an appointment. At the appointment date the patient is removed from the waiting list and enters a second <b>queueing</b> <b>system.</b> In this second <b>queueing</b> <b>system,</b> the patient joins the queue at the service facility, receives the actual service and leaves the appointment-driven system. We refer to both <b>queueing</b> <b>systems</b> as the patient assignment system and the service facility <b>queueing</b> <b>system</b> respectively. Both <b>queueing</b> <b>systems</b> require a rather distinct modeling approach. The patient assignment system can be considered as a vacation model while the service facility <b>queueing</b> <b>system</b> is modeled as a so-called appointment system. Building on the findings in both the literature on vacation models and the literature on AS, we combine the patient assignment system and service facility <b>queueing</b> <b>system</b> to create a single model which allows the study of appointment-driven systems. We refer to this combined model as the appointment-driven <b>queueing</b> <b>system.</b> Using the appointmentdriven <b>queueing</b> <b>system,</b> we assess: (1) the time a patient spends in the waiting list; (2) the time a patient spends waiting at the treatment facility (this does not include the processing time itself); (3) The probability of a server to work overtime; (4) The amount of overtime a server performs. These performance measures can easily be implemented in an optimization procedure to support strategic decisions concerning server capacity (e. g. how often, when and for how long should a server be online). status: publishe...|$|R
