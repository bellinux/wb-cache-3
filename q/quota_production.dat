40|$|No poster available. Prior to the {{introduction}} of the modern management regime, the concept of capacity constituted no other reference than the technical capacity of a given fishing vessel. However, after closing the commons and {{the introduction}} of a an heavily institutionalized management regime, the fisheries sector have been transfomed to complex web of rules for regulating fisheries in a detailed manner. The core element of this processes referes to the nationalisation of the fish resources, a scientific based <b>quota</b> <b>production</b> (TAC), the introduction of a complex regime for allocating limited fish resources and the quota regime at fleet level. In the Norwegian management system, the "capacity concept" constitute a special status, which corresponds to the individual vessel quota regime (IVQ). In this model, both quota size {{and the size of the}} individual vessel are integrated into one system. Hence, the IVQ model becomes a meeting place for technological adaptations as input regulations and the limited quota as output regulations. However, despite the strict and regulated regime as the Norwegian management model, adapting capacity have proven hard to manage.

We compare these quota-setting games with two different tariff-setting games: (1) A non-cooperative game in which the government sets the tariff at a level that maximizes tariff revenue; and (2) A cooperative game in which producers, through rent-seeking activities, induce the government to set the tariff at a level that maximizes joint government and producer rents. ...|$|R

40|$|Border measures—tariffs and tariff-rate quotas (TRQs) —provide {{high levels}} of support to Japan’s {{producers}} of milk for manufacturing purposes and keep consumer prices for dairy products in Japan high by world standards. Since drinking milk is not easily traded, Japan’s drinking milk market is largely autonomous from the world market. High farm costs of milk produc-tion and relatively high costs for processing and distributing drinking milk keep consumer prices of drinking milk high. Production quotas, designed to limit supplies and keep market prices stable, guide the volume of milk produced. A direct, fixed payment per kilogram of milk is provided from the Government budget to farmers for their <b>quota</b> <b>production</b> of manufacturing milk. A fund sharing farm and Government contributions pays farmers {{a portion of the}} difference between the current annual price and a historical average price when manufacturing milk prices fall.

40|$|The European {{agricultural}} {{market has been}} criticized for its heavy regulations and subsidization. The sugar market {{is one of the most}} regulated ones; however, this will change radically in 2017 when the current system of production quotas will end. The aim of this paper is to present the basic characteristics of the EU quota sugar market. The analysis identifies the main drivers of EU sugar market and their position within the EU sugar market. The paper identifies especially those drivers/companies/alliances which take control over the EU sugar production realized under the <b>quota</b> <b>production</b> system. The paper also highlights the level of EU sugar market concentration and also identifies those countries and companies which are the main leaders in the sugar production area realized under the quota system. Based on the results deriving from the paper, it is possible to characterize the EU sugar market as a heavily concentrated one – nearly 75 % (10 mil. tonnes) of the quota is controlled by five multinational companies only; these companies are operating more than 50 % of all the available sugar plants located in the EU. These multinational alliances are also in control of the production capacities of their subsidiaries. In most countries, this causes serious problems as the given quota is controlled by one or two producers only. The EU sugar market is extremely concentrated especially if we take into consideration the location of each alliance’s headquarters. The majority of production capacities are under (the) control of especially German and French companies. These two countries are also the main beneficiaries in relation to the EU sugar production quota system...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. peanut program restricts {{domestic}} sales with poundage quota but allows surplus production to be exported or crushed. Empirical analysis of North Carolina peanut production {{reveals that the}} marginal (and lower) price received by production above quota, that is the world price, {{is far more important}} in determining acreage than is the inframarginal subsidy of the quota support price. Key words: marketing quotas, peanuts, price supports, supply response, yield uncertainty. Many commodity markets are restricted by government-imposed supply controls. Ex-amples include milk, poultry, and eggs in Canada, milk in Australia, and tobacco and pea-nuts in the United States. Where firm-level quotas are used to restrict supply, failing to pro-duce enough to meet one's quota can be costly. The cost will depend upon the price received on <b>quota</b> <b>production</b> and the regulations governing unused quota. To reduce the probability of these losses, producers may on average produce more than their quota. The costs of this precau-tionary over-production depend, in part, on the marketing alternatives for excess production. In many quota schemes, excess production can be sold in a surplus market, where it receives a lower price. Alston and Quilkey examined this phenom-enon in milk production in New South Wales. They argued that farmers produce "insurance milk " in excess of the quota to guard against production uncertainty. Alston and Quilkey noted two opportunity costs of not meeting quota. The first is the loss of revenue and the second is the potential loss of future quota share. Excess production, in their view, is cho-sen to balance the marginal benefit of reducing Robert B.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the milk quota regime reform, actually under discussion, on the European countries with a detailed focus on the Italian milk and dairy sector. The dismantling of the milk quota regime is already on the EU agenda, but how and when to do it is still matter of debate. A possibility is to enlarge gradually the size of the national quotas, up to the full dismantling in 2015 (“soft landing”). Meanwhile, the discussion on Health Check of the CAP is under way. In this work we analyse the possible impacts of the reform of the milk quota regime {{on the basis of a}} Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach, using two models in sequence: the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to evaluate the impacts of different scenarios of milk quota reform on the EU market and to compute the price changes outside Italy; these, in turn, are used as inputs for the MEG-D model, that focuses on the Italian milk and dairy market. The two models were run together with two specific objectives: the first was to avoid, in evaluating the impacts of reform of the milk sector regime in Italy, running the model with rough price estimates taken for secondary sources; the second, to have more specific results on the outcome at the national level. Particularly, the model takes in account the particular relevance of quality products (GDO) in Italian diary sector. In order to evaluate {{the impact of}} the “soft landing” reform scenario, we run a “comparison” scenario where the milk quotas are fully abolished in the 2009.
