5|$|Despite <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> income, no scandal ever touched Sunday. He was {{sincerely}} {{devoted to}} his wife, who also managed his campaigns, but his three sons disappointed him. His audiences grew smaller during the 1920s as Sunday grew older, religious revivals became less popular, and alternative sources of entertainment appeared. Nevertheless, Sunday continued to preach and remained a stalwart defender of conservative Christianity until his death.|$|E
5|$|Born in Alexandria, Virginia, Latos' {{family moved}} to Florida when he was young. He played {{baseball}} at Coconut Creek High School, where {{he became one of}} the best high school players in the state. Highly regarded for his talent before the 2006 MLB draft, he fell to the 11th round due to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> maturity. After pitching at Broward College for a season, the San Diego Padres signed him for a $1.25 million bonus. He debuted for the Padres in 2009, and established himself in their starting rotation. The Reds traded four players, including three prospects, to acquire Latos before the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|Johnson entered {{politics}} in 1804, {{when he was}} elected to represent Scott County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was twenty-three years old. Although the Kentucky Constitution imposed an age requirement of twenty-four for members of the House of Representatives, Johnson was so popular that no one raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> age, and he was allowed to take his seat. He was placed on the Committee on Courts of Justice. During his tenure, he supported legislation to protect settlers from land speculators. On January 26, 1807, he delivered an address condemning the Burr conspiracy.|$|E

Silcott's barrister, Barbara Mills (1940–2011), a future Director of Public Prosecutions, decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> previous convictions.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1999 {{season the}} Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins {{had been the}} first-ever draft choice of the {{expansion}} Carolina Panthers and {{in his second season}} led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character led to his release from the Panthers. Mike Ditka, coach of the New Orleans Saints signed him after his release; however the experiment failed and Collins was released again. Although many people, including Sports Illustrated football beat writer Peter King questioned the wisdom of Accorsi and the Giants giving Collins a US$16.9 million contract, especially when there was little interest for Collins's services league-wide, Accorsi was confident that Collins was a wise investment.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the Red Star Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Žigić gave Red Star the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to answer <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> Red Star future.|$|E

5|$|Perceval {{had led the}} Tory {{government}} since 1809, during a critical phase of the Napoleonic Wars. His determination to prosecute the war using the harshest of measures caused widespread poverty and unrest on the home front; thus the news of his death was a cause of rejoicing in the worst affected parts of the country. Despite initial fears that the assassination might be linked to a general uprising, it transpired that Bellingham had acted alone, protesting against the government's failure to compensate him for his treatment a few years previously, {{when he had been}} imprisoned in Russia for a trading debt. Bellingham's lack of remorse, and apparent certainty that his action was justified, raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> sanity, but at his trial he was judged to be legally responsible for his actions.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 1998. The {{strength}} of the team during the season was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense continued to struggle. Dave Brown had been released before the season and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. However, neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl-caliber play. Before the 1999 season, the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first–ever draft choice of the Carolina Panthers, and in his second season, {{led them to the}} NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol abuse, conflicts with his teammates, and <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> character led to his release from the Panthers.

5|$|The {{match was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} played on 20 May. However, England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson wanted a four-week break {{before the start of}} the 2006 FIFA World Cup, so that if any England players were involved (Liverpool's Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher and Peter Crouch all later made his squad) would get a decent rest before the tournament. The final was scheduled to be held at Wembley Stadium, however the stadium had fallen behind in its rebuild and would not be completed in time for the final. The final would instead be played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, where it had been held since 2001. Mike Dean was originally appointed to referee the final, but <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> impartiality were raised as he resided close to Liverpool. He was replaced by Alan Wiley.|$|E

5|$|Through 11 {{weeks in}} 2012, the Jets {{struggled}} to a 4–7 record. The presence of quarterback Tim Tebow created a controversy {{as the media}} and fans called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow. Ryan was criticized for his decision to keep Tebow activated during the Jets' Thanksgiving Day contest against the New England Patriots despite Tebow playing with two broken ribs, leading to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> job security. With Tebow inactive for the Jets' following contest against the Arizona Cardinals, Ryan {{made the decision to}} bench Sanchez, who threw three interceptions, in favor of Greg McElroy. McElroy threw a touchdown pass to tight end Jeff Cumberland to score the team's only points in a 7–6 victory over Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The Peach Bowl was {{the final}} game as head coach of Virginia Tech for Bill Dooley, who had {{accumulated}} a record of 62381 for the Hokies since assuming the head coaching job in 1978. Tech president William Lavery had long disagreed with Dooley {{about the role of}} football at Virginia Tech, and prior {{to the beginning of the}} season, Lavery told Dooley that his tenure as coach would end on January 1, 1987. This fact was revealed to the football team and the general public after Tech's third game of the season. At the time, Dooley was the winningest head coach in Virginia Tech history, but was under investigation for recruiting violations and had settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the university for $3.5 million. As part of the out-of-court settlement, Dooley was required to quit his position following the Peach Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the game, Dooley dodged <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> future. On December 23, it was announced that Murray State head coach Frank Beamer would replace Dooley after the Peach Bowl.|$|E
