5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were <b>questioned</b> as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were <b>questioned,</b> none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of <b>question</b> search. In <b>question</b> search, given a <b>question</b> as query, we are to return <b>questions</b> semantically equivalent or close to the queried <b>question.</b> In this paper, we propose to conduct <b>question</b> search by identifying <b>question</b> topic and <b>question</b> focus. More specifically, we first summarize <b>questions</b> in a data structure consisting of <b>question</b> topic and <b>question</b> focus. Then we model <b>question</b> topic and <b>question</b> focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying <b>question</b> topic and <b>question</b> focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying <b>question</b> topic and <b>question</b> focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR). ...|$|R

His ally, Richard Fitzpatrick, purchased his coontie and citrus plantation on the Miami River for $2,500. Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for Monroe County to the Territorial Legislative Council. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was <b>questioned</b> by the Key West Inquirer.

Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He <b>questioned</b> whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E

Instead, a candidate’s response to a pretest <b>question</b> is {{used to evaluate the}} question’s statistical performance. A majority of the <b>questions</b> are operational questions; however, pretest <b>questions</b> are mixed into the exam and are not identified as pretest <b>questions.</b> From the candidate’s perspective, pretest <b>questions</b> are indistinguishable from operational <b>questions.</b> Pretest <b>questions</b> that meet certain statistical criteria are used as operational <b>questions</b> on future exams. This strategy for pretesting <b>questions</b> is common practice in high-stakes testing.|$|R
40|$|<b>Question</b> {{classification}} {{plays an}} important role in cross-language <b>question</b> answering (CLQA) systems, while <b>question</b> Informer plays a key role in enhancing <b>question</b> classification for factual <b>question</b> answering. In this paper, we propose an integrated Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Machine Learning (ML) approach for <b>question</b> classification in English-Chinese cross-language <b>question</b> answering. To enhance <b>question</b> informer prediction, we use a hybrid method that integrates GA and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to optimize feature subset selection in a CRF-based <b>question</b> informer prediction model. The proposed approach extends cross-language <b>question</b> classification by using the GA-CRF <b>question</b> informer feature with Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results of evaluations on the NTCIR- 6 CLQA <b>question</b> sets demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in improving the accuracy of <b>question</b> classification in English-Chinese cross-language <b>question</b> answering. 1...|$|R

This paper addresses this challenge by using a synonym-based approach that expands each unanswered <b>question</b> into several related <b>questions.</b> This paper argues that the number of unanswered <b>questions</b> can be reduced by searching the data set for the most similar resolved <b>question(s)</b> (<b>questions</b> that have been satisfactorily answered) to either the unanswered <b>question</b> and / or any of its expanded <b>questions.</b> If this search returns more than one resolved <b>question,</b> we rank the returned <b>questions</b> and choose the highest ranking resolved <b>question</b> as the most similar to the unanswered <b>question...</b>|$|R

The <b>question</b> episodes were classified into six categories: (1) verification <b>questions,</b> (2) search <b>questions,</b> (3) open <b>questions,</b> (4) verification answers, (5) short answers, and (6) elaborated answers. For example, <b>questions</b> by any team member to their peers that were asking to verify a specific information or an action were coded as verification <b>questions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} {{traditions are}} clear influences on The Age of Reason, Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet.
