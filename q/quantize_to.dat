SIFT features extracted from spectrogram images are <b>quantized</b> <b>to</b> 16 SIFT feature points; then these 16 feature points are converted to 128   ×   16 dimension vectors for each sample. For MFCC features, we extract 18 MFCC coefficients from each speech signal, and then all MFCC coefficients are <b>quantized</b> <b>to</b> 16 feature vectors.

50|$|In battle, Patrick's GN-XIV is hit by an ELS and {{is slowly}} assimilated. He prepares to self-destruct before saying goodbyes to Kati, when Setsuna blasts Patrick's GNX, saving him from assimilation. With {{a large number}} of ELS appearing, the Harute is {{eventually}} assimilated and Allelujah and Marie are forced to eject. Setsuna attempts to communicate with the ELS via the Twin Drive’s quantum effect, but it is to no avail as the ELS constantly thwart Setsuna's attempts. Tieria, now a small hologram inside of the 00 QanT, tells Setsuna that Trans-Am is necessary for the dialogues. Graham Aker, now partially assimilated, decides to believe in a better future for humanity and sacrifices himself to create a large hole using Trans-Am, allowing Setsuna to enter the core of the ELS ship. After Setsuna establishes contact, he realizes the attack was a misunderstanding as assimilation was their only means to understand humanity. It also revealed that the ELS's original homeworld had been consumed by a red giant star and they began searching the universe for a new home. Along the way they reformed various planets and eventually found a new home, eventually setting out into the vast reaches of space to explore the universe. Through Setsuna's quantum brainwaves, the true intention of the ELS's arrival to Earth was understood, and the battle was halted. Setsuna becomes humanity's liaison and uses the 00 QanT to <b>quantize</b> <b>to</b> the ELS homeworld. The ELS then uses Setsuna's vision of a flower to alter the superstructure of their mother ship, ending the battle.|$|E
40|$|We {{carry out}} the {{canonical}} quantization of the Levi-Cività family of static and cylindrical solutions. The reduced phase space of this family of metrics is proved to coincide with that corresponding to the Kasner model, including the associated symplectic structures, except for that the respective domains of definition {{of one of the}} phase space variables are not identical. Using this result, we are able to construct a quantum model that describes spacetimes of both the Levi-Cività and the Kasner type, and in which the three-dimensional spatial topology is not uniquely fixed. Finally, we <b>quantize</b> <b>to</b> completion the subfamily of Levi-Cività solutions which represent the exterior gravitational field of a straight cosmic string. These solutions are conical geometries, ie, Minkowski spacetime minus a wedge. The quantum theory obtained provides us with predicitions about the angular size of this wedge. PACS numbers: 04. 60.

40|$|Adiabatic {{quantum state}} {{evolution}} {{can be accelerated}} {{through a variety of}} shortcuts to adiabaticity. In one approach, a counterdiabatic quantum Hamiltonian Ĥ_CD is constructed to suppress nonadiabatic excitations. In the analogous classical problem, a counterdiabatic classical Hamiltonian H_CD ensures that the classical action remains constant even under rapid driving. Both the quantum and classical versions of this problem have been solved for the special case of scale-invariant driving, characterized by linear expansions, contractions or translations of the system. Here we investigate an example of a non-scale-invariant system [...] a tilted piston. We solve exactly for the classical counterdiabatic Hamiltonian H_CD(q,p,t), which we then <b>quantize</b> <b>to</b> obtain a Hermitian operator Ĥ_CD(t). Using numerical simulations, we find that Ĥ_CD effectively suppresses non-adiabatic excitations under rapid driving. These results offer a proof of principle [...] beyond the special case of scale-invariant driving [...] that quantum shortcuts to adiabaticity can successfully be constructed from their classical counterparts.

40|$|Stochastic pooling {{networks}} (SPN) are sensor networks where {{multiple sensors}} make independently noisy and compressed {{measurements of the}} same information source, which are combined via pooling. Examples of SPNs range from nanoelectronics to biological sensory neurons. Here it is shown that optimal information transmission in SPNs with nodes that <b>quantize</b> <b>to</b> {{a finite number of}} states requires the input signal distribution to be discrete. This is illustrated numerically for a simple SPN consisting of N binary-quantizing sensors. The resultant information capacity is shown to be independent of the noise distribution when the signal distribution can be freely chosen, but to imply an optimal noise distribution if the signal distribution is fixed. While larger than the best performance of previously studied continuously valued input signals, the capacity does not scale faster than the previous best result of log_{ 2 }(sqrt[N]) bits per channel use. It is also shown that a plot of the optimal input distribution contains bifurcations as N increases, and that suprathreshold stochastic resonance occurs when the mutual information is determined for a suboptimal noise distribution.

40|$|We <b>quantize</b> <b>to</b> {{completion}} an {{inflationary universe}} with small inhomogeneities {{in the framework}} of loop quantum cosmology. The homogeneous setting consists of a massive scalar field propagating in a closed, homogeneous scenario. We provide a complete quantum description of the system employing loop quantization techniques. After introducing small inhomogeneities as scalar perturbations, we identify the true physical degrees of freedom by means of a partial gauge fixing, removing all the local degrees of freedom except the matter perturbations. We finally combine a Fock description for the inhomogeneities with the polymeric quantization of the homogeneous background, providing the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of the composed system. Its solutions are then completely characterized, owing to the suitable choice of quantum constraint, and the physical Hilbert space is constructed. Finally, we consider the analog description for an alternate gauge and, moreover, in terms of gauge-invariant quantities. In the deparametrized model, all these descriptions are unitarily equivalent at the quantum level. © 2012 American Physical Society. This work was supported by the research grants Nos.

40|$|Custom {{arithmetic}} is a {{novel and}} successful technique to reduce the computation and resource utilization of ASR systems running on mobile devices. It represents all floating-point numbers by integer indices and substitutes a sequence of table lookups for all arithmetic operations. The first and crucial step in custom arithmetic design is <b>to</b> <b>quantize</b> system variables, preferably to low precision. This paper explores several techniques <b>to</b> <b>quantize</b> variables with high entropy, including a reordering of Gaussian computation and a normalization of Viterbi search. Furthermore, a discriminatively inspired distortion measure is investigated for scalar quantization to better maintain recognition accuracy. Experiments on an isolated word recognition show that each system variable can be scalar <b>quantized</b> <b>to</b> less than 8 bits using a standard quantization method, except for the alpha probability in Viterbi search which requires 10 bits. However, using our normalization and discriminative distortion measure, the forward probability can be <b>quantized</b> <b>to</b> 9 bits, thereby halving the corresponding lookup table size. This greatly reduces the memory bandwidth and enables the implementation of custom arithmetic on ASR systems. 1...|$|R
