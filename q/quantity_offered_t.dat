40|$|This paper empirically tests {{whether an}} open limit order book {{contains}} information about future short-run stock price movements. To {{account for the}} discrete nature of price changes, the integer-valued autoregressive model of order one is utilized. A model transformation has an advantage over conventional count data approaches since it handles negative integer-valued price changes. The empirical results reveal that measures capturing <b>offered</b> <b>quantities</b> of a share at the best bid- and ask-price reveal more information about future short-run price movements than measures capturing the <b>quantities</b> <b>offered</b> at prices below and above. Imbalance and changes in <b>offered</b> <b>quantities</b> at prices below and above the best bid- and ask-price do, however, have a small and significant effect on future price changes.
