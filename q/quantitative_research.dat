5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In <b>quantitative</b> <b>research,</b> statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with <b>quantitative</b> <b>research,</b> and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E

25|$|Music {{therapy is}} a non verbal {{approach}} to the person using instruments and music in general, the use of interventions to accomplish individual goals within a therapeutic relationship by a professional who has completed an approved music therapy program. Music therapy {{is one of the}} expressive therapies, consisting of a process in which a music therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients improve their physical and mental health. Music therapists primarily help clients improve their health in several domains, such as cognitive functioning, motor skills, emotional development, social skills, and quality of life by using both active and passive music experiences such as free improvisation, song, dance, listening, and discussion of music to achieve treatment goals. There is a wide qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>research</b> literature base which incorporates clinical therapy, psychotherapy, biomusicology, musical acoustics, music theory, psychoacoustics, embodied music cognition, aesthetics of music, sensory integration, and comparative musicology. Referrals to music therapy services may be made by other health care professionals. Clients can also choose to pursue music therapy services without a referral (i.e., self-referral).|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} broadly review the {{currently}} available twin and adoption data on antisocial behaviour (AB). It {{is argued that}} <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> can make {{a significant contribution to}} further the understanding of how AB develops. Genetically informative study designs are particularly useful for investigating several important questions such as whether: the heritability estimates vary as a function of assessment method or gender; the relative importance of genetic and environmental influences varies for different types of AB; the environmental risk factors are truly environmental; and genetic vulnerability influences susceptibility to environmental risk. While the current data are not yet directly translatable for prevention and treatment programmes, <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> has concrete translational potential. <b>Quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> can supplement neuroscience research in informing about different subtypes of AB, such as AB coupled with callous–unemotional traits. <b>Quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> is also important in advancing the understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental risk operates...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{recent years}} <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> has {{addressed}} {{all the major}} psychiatric disorders. In order {{to interpret the results}} of this type of research one needs to be aware of its potential and its limitations. AIM: To discuss the basic concepts and the main results of <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> and to consider how this can help us to better understand the aetiology of psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Using Medline (1990 -February 2006) we reviewed the literature on the subject of quantitative genetic and psychiatric disorders. In addition we studied the standard books on the subject. RESULTS: A fairly large number of psychiatric disorders, namely about 30 to 85 %, can be inherited. In addition, the non-shared environment has a considerable influence on the phenotype. The influence of the shared environment seems to have only a limited influence or it is totally absent. The results of <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> are specific to a particular time or environment and therefore may not be applicable to other populations. There may be a correlation or interaction between genetic factors and the environment while the phenotype is being formed. However, because of the analytical methods used, this is only partly visible in the results. CONCLUSION: <b>Quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> has made an impressive contribution to our knowledge about the heritability of psychiatric disorders. By definition <b>quantitative</b> genetic <b>research</b> always provides information about environmental influences...|$|R

25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{qualitative research}} {{is used to}} address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. Qualitative logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on qualitative literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. It does appear, however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using qualitative design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. Qualitative formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that concisely show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between <b>quantitative</b> <b>research</b> method and qualitative research method is about the data, how the data collected and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how the data collected and analyzed by researchers in qualitative research.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries. The main {{reason for this is}} the social and legal repercussions associated with leaving Islam in many Muslim majority countries, up to and including the death penalty for apostasy. However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as they assume that all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>research</b> is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E
