50|$|<b>Quercitannic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is one of}} the {{two forms}} of tannic acid found in oak bark and leaves. The other form is called gallotannic acid and is found in oak galls.|$|E
50|$|The <b>quercitannic</b> <b>acid</b> {{molecule}} is {{also present}} in quercitron, a yellow dye obtained from the bark of the Eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), a forest tree indigenous in North America. It {{is described as a}} yellowish brown amorphous substance.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, oak is {{a common}} source of tanbark. <b>Quercitannic</b> <b>acid</b> is the chief {{constituent}} found in oak barks. The bark is taken from young branches and twigs in oak coppices and can be up to 4 mm thick; it is grayish-brown {{on the outside and}} brownish-red on the inner surface.|$|E
50|$|Many cinchona barks {{contain a}} {{particular}} tannin, cinchotannic acid, which by oxidation rapidly yields a dark-coloured phlobaphene called red cinchonic, cinchono-fulvic acid or cinchona red. They {{are common in}} redwoods barks like Sequoia sempervirens or in oak barks where the chief constituent, <b>quercitannic</b> <b>acid,</b> a molecule also present in quercitron, is an unstable substance, having a tendency to give off water to form anhydrides (phlobaphenes), {{one of which is}} called oak-red (C28H22O11).|$|E
50|$|Quercitron is {{a yellow}} natural dye {{obtained}} from the bark of the Eastern Black Oak (Quercus velutina), a forest tree indigenous in North America.The name is a shortened form of quercicitron, from Latin quercus, oak, and citron, lemon, and was invented by Edward Bancroft (1744-1821), who by act of parliament in 1785 was granted special privileges {{in regard to the}} importation and use of the substance. The dyestuff is prepared by grinding the bark in mills after it has been freed from its black epidermal layer, and sifting the product to separate the fibrous matter, the fine yellow powder which remains forming the quercitron of commerce.The ruddy-orange decoction of quercitron contains <b>quercitannic</b> <b>acid,</b> whence its use in tanning, and an active dyeing principle, quercitrin, C21H20O11. The latter substance is a glycoside, and in aqueous solution under the influence of mineral acids it yields quercetin, C15H10O7, which is precipitated, and the methyl-pentose rhamnose.|$|E
