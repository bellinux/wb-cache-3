2500|$|... 1525—Diogo da Rocha and his pilot Gomes de Sequeira reached Celebes {{and were}} blown off course and driven three hundred leagues in a {{direction}} constantly towards the east and to Ilhas de Gomes de Sequeira - most probably the Palau Island or Yap, (Caroline Islands) according to the geographical notes, distance traveled and physical description of the natives in Décadas da Ásia of João de Barros, or, according to the alleged existence of gold mentioned by the natives, other descriptions {{of the people and}} if they were to south and east in one or two voyages made by Gomes de Sequeira (According to the different interpretations of the Chronicles of Barros, Castanheda and Galvão), raises also the hypothesis of Cape York Peninsula in Australia, maybe one of the Prince of Wales Islands. In Gastald`s map a group of islands named Insul de gomes des <b>queria</b> lie in about 8 degrees of south latitude and in the longitude of the Northern Territory of Australia. In the same map the Apem insul seems to correspond with either Adi Island or the Aru Islands. The Ins des hobres blancos (Islands of the White Men) correspond, as far as locality is concerned, to the Arru (Aru) Islands. It would appear then that Gomes de Sequeira's Islands, which are the south-easternmost of those represented, must correspond with the Timor Laut group. In the same year, according to the voyages to the Banda Islands mencioned on Decadas and according to contemporaneous cartographers, Martim Afonso de Melo (Jusarte) and Garcia Henriques explored the Tanimbar Islands (the archipelago labelled [...] "aqui invernou Martim Afonso de Melo" [...] and [...] "Aqui in bernon Martin Afonso de melo" [...] ) and probably the Aru Islands (the two archipelagos and the navigator mentioned in the maps of Lázaro Luís, 1563, Bartolomeu Velho, c. 1560, Sebastião Lopes, c. 1565 and also in the 1594 map of the East Indies entitled Insulce Molucoe by the Dutch cartographer Petrus Plancius and in the map of Nova Guinea of 1600).|$|E

5000|$|When {{translating}} from {{a language}} that has these aspects, they will sometimes be given separate verbs in English. For example, in Spanish, the imperfective sabía can be translated [...] "I knew" [...] vs. the perfective supe [...] "I found out", podía [...] "I was able to" [...] vs. pude [...] "I succeeded", <b>quería</b> [...] "I wanted to" [...] vs. quise [...] "I tried to", no <b>quería</b> [...] "I did not want to" [...] vs. no quise [...] "I refused".

5000|$|A case {{on which}} the Academy is silent is the {{tendency}} described in point b1. It is perfectly common in educated speech {{in many parts of}} the world to distinguish between no <b>quería</b> molestarlo [...] "I did not mean to bother him" [...] and no <b>quería</b> molestarle [...] "I did not mean to bother you". Those Spaniards who would not just say le anyway for the reasons explained in the last paragraph are likely to use le in this case. Butt & Benjamin (1994) says that their Argentine informants made this distinction, whereas their loísta Colombian informants preferred molestarlo always.|$|E

5000|$|For some verbs in some languages, the {{difference}} between perfective and imperfective conveys an additional meaning difference; in such cases, the two aspects are typically translated using separate verbs in English. In Greek, for example, the imperfective sometimes adds the notion of [...] "try to do something" [...] (the so-called conative imperfect); hence, the same verb, in the imperfective (present or imperfect) and aorist, respectively, is used to convey look and see, search and find, listen and hear. (For example, ηκουομεν (ēkouomen, [...] "we listened") vs. ηκουσαμεν (ēkousamen, [...] "we heard").) Spanish has similar pairs for certain verbs, such as (imperfect and preterite, respectively) sabía ("I knew") vs. supe ("I found out"), podía ("I was able to") vs. pude ("I succeeded (in doing something)"), <b>quería</b> ("I wanted to") vs. quise ("I tried to"), and no <b>quería</b> ("I did not want to") vs. no quise ("I refused (to do something)"). Such differences are often highly language-specific.|$|E
