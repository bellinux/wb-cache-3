5|$|The Xbox 360 E was {{revealed}} and released at E3 2013 on June 10, 2013. It featured a new slimmer design, that was <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> previous models.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very quiet in normal operation, <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E

5|$|There {{are certain}} jobs that horses do very well, and no {{technology}} has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for {{certain types of}} patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses {{can also be used}} in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.|$|E

25|$|The January {{transfer}} {{window was}} <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> the summer, with Ashley Young's £9.65m move to Aston Villa and Matthew Upson's £6m move to West Ham United the window's most expensive.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{compilation}} albums of hits {{by multiple}} different artists became popular, and if artists and producers found their song was <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> {{others on the}} compilation, they would insist that their song be remastered to be competitive.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Diomede {{took part}} in the Second Cod War during the fishing dispute with Iceland, though Diomede's {{involvement}} was more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> her involvement in the subsequent Cod War.

25|$|An {{electronic}} ballast uses solid state electronic circuitry {{to provide the}} proper starting and operating electrical conditions to power discharge lamps. An {{electronic ballast}} can be smaller and lighter than a comparably-rated magnetic one. An electronic ballast is usually <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> a magnetic one, which produces a line-frequency hum by vibration of the transformer laminations.|$|E
25|$|Brisbanes {{tour was}} {{considered}} <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> those experienced previously by Australian ships. This, {{combined with the}} damage to the forward gun turret and other defects, meant that the destroyer only fired 7,891 shells during the six-month deployment. Two officers from the ship were Mentioned in Despatches, while other personnel awards included a British Empire Medal and 25 Naval Board commendations.|$|E
25|$|Scooter engine sizes range {{smaller than}} motorcycles, , and have all-enclosing {{bodywork}} {{that makes them}} cleaner and <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> motorcycles, as well as having more built-in storage space. Automatic clutches and continuously variable transmissions (CVT) make them easier to learn on and to ride. Scooters usually have smaller wheels than motorcycles. Scooters usually have the engine {{as part of the}} swingarm, so that their engines travel up and down with the suspension.|$|E

50|$|The concerto {{departs from}} the usual solo piano concerto with the {{dialogue}} between the two pianos as they exchange musical ideas. Mozart divides up the more striking passages quite evenly between the two pianos. Also, the orchestra is rather more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> in Mozart's other piano concertos, leaving much of the music to the soloists.|$|R
30|$|The SW {{conditions}} from November 2014 to March 2015 {{were less}} <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> {{that in a}} previous study (Yoshikawa et al. 2016). The dynamic SW pressure increased suddenly on day-of-year (DOY) − 10, 11, 47, 66, and 74 in 2015. Discontinuous increase of the dynamic SW pressure, which is typical for forward shocks, might influence the IPT environment.|$|R
25|$|Germany {{has brought}} the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new Type 212. The 212 {{features}} an air-independent propulsion system using hydrogen fuel cells. This system is safer than previous closed-cycle diesel engines and steam turbines, cheaper than a nuclear reactor and <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> either. While the Type 212 is also being purchased by Italy, the Type 214 has been designed as the follow-on export model and has been sold to Greece, South Korea and Turkey.|$|E

He was also the voices of King Friday XIII and Queen Sara Saturday (named after his wife), rulers of the neighborhood, as well as X the Owl, Henrietta Pussycat, Daniel Striped Tiger, Lady Elaine Fairchilde, and Larry Horse. The show won a Sylvania Award for best children's show and was briefly {{broadcast}} nationally on NBC.|$|E
25|$|But racial {{tensions}} worsened {{on the night}} of July 22–23. Initially, the night was <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> previous nights. The police and National Guard largely deployed {{toward the edge of the}} expanded patrol zone. Cleveland police made 72 arrests for public intoxication, which they said was about usual for a Friday night. There were far fewer fires set the night of July 22–23 (only 14), and only a few false alarms. Cleveland fire investigators determined that none of the fires had been caused by a firebomb, and no firefighters were harassed as they put out blazes.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} route itineraries and variations available on the Lares trek. The trek is also far more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> the Inca Trail as it is not as well known. The Lares trek is also slightly easier than the Inca Trail, although there are still 3 high passes will trek over, the highest being 4,400 meters.|$|R
60|$|Beth {{has grown}} slender, pale, and more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> ever. The beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an {{expression}} that saddens one, {{although it is not}} sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.|$|R
50|$|Starting from Playing Field Road, it runs north, {{crossing}} Boundary Street into New Kowloon and terminates slight beyond Poplar Street. This {{street is}} largely residential and more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> the other {{street in the}} south. A much shorter, separated section of this street is to the north, between Sai Yeung Choi Lane and St. Francis' Church, separated by a hill slope.|$|R
25|$|Peaslake {{is set in}} rolling {{meadows and}} forests in terms of topography, soil type and land use. Its {{architecture}} and amenities have been the backdrop to filming. Access to the village by car can only be gained by using roads which are at some point single track, which gives visitors the {{feel that it is}} more remote than it is, and which makes it <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> the villages closer to the A25. The position, {{in one of the most}} uniformly forested parts of the Greensand Ridge, provides a variety of trees on varying terrain.|$|E
25|$|Demand {{breathing}} systems {{reduce the}} amount of gas required to adequately ventilate the diver, as it needs only to be supplied when the diver inhales, but the slightly increased work of breathing caused by this system is a disadvantage at extreme levels of exertion, where free-flow systems may be better. The demand system is also <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> free-flow, particularly during the non-inhalation phase of breathing. This can make voice communication more effective. The breathing of the diver is also audible to the surface team over the communications system, and this helps to monitor the condition of the diver and is a valuable safety feature.|$|E
25|$|The prototype, {{named the}} Stipa-Caproni, first flew on October 7, 1932. Remarkably ungainly in appearance, the plane {{nonetheless}} proved Stipa's concept in that its intubed propeller increased its engine's efficiency, and the airfoil {{shape of the}} tube gave it an improved rate of climb compared to conventional aircraft of similar engine power and wing loading. The Stipa-Caproni also had a very low landing speed and was much <b>quieter</b> <b>than</b> conventional aircraft. Its rudder and elevators were mounted in the propeller's slipstream in the opening at {{the trailing edge of}} the tube in order to improve handling, and this configuration gave the aircraft handling characteristics that it made it very stable in flight.|$|E

Evidently the hunter was waiting for something. The dog slept on. It was the noonday hour, when the stillness of the forest almost matched that of midnight. The birds were more <b>quiet</b> <b>than</b> at any other time during daylight.|$|R
