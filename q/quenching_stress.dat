40|$|In this paper, the {{residual}} stress state of thermally sprayed ceramic coatings was examined by combining different experimental and analytical techniques, {{in order to}} provide a thorough characterisation of through-thickness stress profiles and a cross-verification of results. HVOF-sprayed ceramics, manufactured using commercial and nanostructured Al 2 O 3 powders and commercial Cr 2 O 3 powders, and atmospheric plasma-sprayed (APS) ceramics, manufactured using commercial Al 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 powders, were investigated. The near-surface stress was measured by X-ray diffraction. The through-thickness profile and the intrinsic <b>quenching</b> <b>stress</b> were analytically computed by the Tsui-Clyne iterative model, using the X-ray measurement result as input, and results were validated by the substrate chemical removal method. Further verification was achieved by applying the in-situ curvature technique to the deposition of HVOF-sprayed Al 2 O 3 coating. HVOF-sprayed Al 2 O 3 coatings deposited using both conventional and nanostructured powders feature a similar, almost equibiaxial tensile stress on the top surface (116. 5  MPa and 136. 5  MPa, respectively) and a moderate through-thickness gradient (about 12  MPa and 20  MPa, respectively). Their intrinsic quenching stresses were analytically estimated to be 184  MPa and 205  MPa, respectively. APS Al 2 O 3 possesses higher top surface stress (220  MPa) and <b>quenching</b> <b>stress</b> (311  MPa). However, it shows a less pronounced stress gradient (≈ 3  MPa) than HVOF-sprayed Al 2 O 3 -based coatings, because cracks, pores and weak lamella boundaries in the APS coating can accommodate the deformations induced by the bending moments arising both during coating deposition and during cooling. The model-derived <b>quenching</b> <b>stress</b> of the conventional HVOF Al 2 O 3 coating was validated by the in-situ curvature measurement technique. Cr 2 O 3 -based coatings are significantly different. They display a lower residual stress in the near-surface region: 20  MPa in the APS coating, 27. 5  MPa in the HVOF one. The HVOF coating also exhibits a very large stress gradient of ≈ 77  MPa. Machining and sliding processes (like polishing and dry sliding tribological testing) change their surface residual stresses to compressive ones. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

Internal stresses originating from the solidification process and from subsequent heat treatments reach levels that exceed the material`s yield strength, promoting plastic strain.

40|$|Thermally sprayed coating {{characteristics}} and mechanical properties are {{in part a}} result of the residual stress developed during the fabrication process. The total stress state in a coating/substrate is comprised of the quench stress and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch stress. The quench stress is developed when molten particles impact the substrate and rapidly cool and solidify. The CTE mismatch stress results from a large difference in the thermal expansion coefficients of the coating and substrate material. It comes into effect when the substrate/coating combination cools from the equilibrated deposit temperature to room temperature. This paper describes a laser-based technique for measuring the curvature of a coated substrate and the analysis required to determine residual stress from curvature measurements. Quench stresses were determined by heating the specimen back to the deposit temperature thus removing the CTE mismatch stress. By subtracting the quench stress from the total residual stress at room temperature, the CTE mismatch stress was estimated. Residual stress measurements for thick (> 1 mm) spinel coatings with a Ni-Al bond coat on 304 stainless steel substrates were made.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{influence}} of macroscopic <b>quenching</b> <b>stresses</b> on long fatigue crack growth in an aluminium alloy-SiC composite has been made. Direct comparison between quenched plate, where high residual stresses are present, and quenched and stretched plate, where they have been eliminated, has highlighted their rôle in crack closure. Despite similar strength levels and identical crack growth mechanisms, the stretched composite displays faster crack growth rates over the complete range of ΔK, measured at R = 0. 1, with threshold being displaced to a lower nominal ΔK value. Closure levels are dependent upon crack length, but are greater in the unstretched composite, due to the effect of surface compressive stresses acting to close the crack tip. These result in lower values of ΔKeff in the unstretched material, explaining the slower crack growth rates. Effective ΔKth values are measured at 1. 7 MPa√m, confirmed by constant Kmax testing.

40|$|Conventional {{enamelling}} requires {{both the}} feedstock powder and the substrate component {{to be heated}} one or more times in a furnace at 800 – 900 °C. The process can degrade the substrate and limit {{the size of the}} component to the furnace dimensions, which are serious restrictions on the technology. This study concerns the use of combustion- flame spraying as an alternative technique for enamelling. In this process, the heat source (the flame) is separated from the substrate, which enables much lower substrate temperatures and avoids thermal damage. It also removes the need for furnace treatment and opens up the possibility of on-site enamelling and repair. However, experimental trials showed that thick flame-spray coatings delaminated during cooling and had high microporosities due to <b>quenching</b> <b>stresses</b> at the glass-steel interface and inadequate splat flow of small feedstock particles. The research shows that these adverse mechanisms could be overcome by pre-heating the substrate surface to the dilatometric softening temperature and removing fines from the feedstock powder. The control of these two parameters was found to double the adhesion strength, provide coatings of very similar hardness and fracture toughness to conventional enamel aswell as deposit coatings of over 1 mmin thickness for heavy-duty corrosion protection. Thermal spraying is well established for ceramic and metal coatings but the fundamentally different structure of glasses requires a different approach. An advantage of combustion flame spraying shown up by this research is that the high energy of the flame accelerates the particles to a high velocity and the resulting impact forces promote the flow of the glass. As a result, lower substrate temperatures may be used with reduced risk of degradation or higher viscosity glasses may be deposited with enhanced properties.

The experimental work involved subjecting raw SMA wires to different heat-treatment temperatures using a muffle furnace immediately followed by water <b>quenching.</b> Recovery <b>stress</b> tests were then conducted on the pre-strained heat-treated SMA wires using a 50 kN tensile machine to determine the maximum and minimum recovery stresses generated by the SMA wires. The experimental work also included conducting tensile tests on the SMA wires using a 100 kN tensile machine to determine their mechanical properties. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the maximum recovery stresses produced by heat-treated SMA wires increase with increasing heat treatment temperature, while the minimum recovery stresses (residual stresses) produced by heat-treated SMA wires increase with increasing heat treatment temperature up to 350 oC, then decrease at 400 oC. The recovery stresses generated by NiTi SMA wires can be used to provide pre-stressing or confinement in concrete and steel structures...|$|R
