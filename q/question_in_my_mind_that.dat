500|$|Intra-conference {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2007, when Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "'s only got onemore year, though. He'll be there onemore year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. [...] At the Pac-10 Conference media day (July 26, 2007), Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football"; the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.|$|E
500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{influence}} {{on foreign policy}} has been cited as foundational to the George W. Bush administration's foreign policy, and the Iraq War. Jackson biographer Robert Kaufman says [...] "There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the people who supported Iraq are supporting Henry Jackson's instincts." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an {{approach}} based on artificial neural networks. TD-Gammon, developed by Gerald Tesauro of IBM, {{was the first}} of these programs to play near the expert level. Its neural network was trained using temporal difference learning applied to data generated from self-play. According to assessments by Bill Robertie and Kit Woolsey, TD-Gammon's play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world. Woolsey said of the program that [...] "There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> its positional judgment is far better than mine." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5, finding it fell {{just short of}} being a classic; [...] "the biggest and most obvious problem with the game has to be its story. There was not a single, solitary moment during the game where I was even the {{slightest}} bit interested in or entertained by its copious, well-voiced, cinematic sequences." [...] He concluded [...] "There's no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Dark Cloud 2 {{is one of the}} most solid RPG adventures for the PS2; but what I am sure of is that it doesn't quite live up to its potential. If Level-5 had worked out all of the kinks, it'd be one of my favorite games for the PS2. Sadly, it's not. While it has my grudging respect, there are many games that I prefer, thanks to DC2's idiosyncrasies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Engaging {{in civil}} disobedience {{that would result}} in many people being arrested was a primary objective, as it would focus {{attention}} on the target. On March 24, 1987, 17 people out of 250 participating were arrested for blocking rush-hour traffic in front of the FDA's Wall Street offices. Kramer was arrested dozens of times working with ACT UP, and the organization grew to hundreds of chapters in the US and Europe. Immunologist Anthony Fauci states [...] "ACT UP put medical treatment {{in the hands of the}} patients. And that is the way it ought to be... There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Larry helped change medicine in this country. And he helped change it for the better. In American medicine there are two eras. Before Larry and after Larry. Playwright Tony Kushner offered his opinion of why Kramer fought so relentlessly: [...] "In a way, like a lot of Jewish men of Larry's generation, the Holocaust is a defining historical moment, and what happened in the early 1980s with AIDS felt, and was in fact, holocaustal to Larry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harbaugh stirred some intra-conference {{controversy}} in March 2007, {{when he was}} quoted as saying rival USC head coach [...] "Pete Carroll's only got one more year, though. He'll be there one more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. The comment caused a rebuke from Carroll. (In fact, Carroll would be at USC for three more years.) At the Pacific-10 Conference media day on July 26, 2007, Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is no <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football." [...] The declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention. Later in the season, Stanford defeated #1 USC 24–23 with a touchdown in the final minute. With USC being the favorite by 41 points, it was statistically the greatest upset in college football history. Although Stanford lost to USC in 2008, Harbaugh and the Stanford Cardinal upset USC at home again with a score of 55–21 on November 14, 2009. Stanford's 55 points was the most ever scored on USC in the Trojans' history until Oregon scored 62 in a 62–51 win over USC on November 3, 2012. It was Pete Carroll's first November loss as USC head coach. Harbaugh never lost in USC's home stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no doubt}} but that the lad had come very near the truth in his guessing; but I did not {{speculate}} upon it very long, for the <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> was whether we could be of any service {{to the old man}} who had served us so truly and faithfully.|$|R

"Now, the <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> Roberts, {{is which}} would be easier--to cut a slit in the curtain, or to bore {{a hole in the}} shutter, or to take a brick out {{carefully}} from the side wall and then to deepen the hole until we got to the wall-paper, and then make a slight hole there?" ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{as little}} <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> he {{believed}} the carriage we had engaged to take us next morning to the Cartuja de Miraflores would be ready at a quarter before nine, and {{that he may have}} been disappointed when it was not ready until a quarter after. But it was worth waiting for if to have a team composed of a brown mule on the right hand and a gray horse on the left was to be desired. These animals which nature had so differenced were equalized by art through the lavish provision of sleigh-bells, without some strands of which no team in Spain is properly equipped. Besides, as to his size the mule was quite as large as the horse, and as to his tail he was much more decorative. About two inches after this member left his body it was closely shaved for some six inches or more, and for that space it presented the effect of a rather large size of garden-hose; below, it swept his thighs in a lordly switch. If anything could have added distinction to our turnout {{it would have been the}} stiff side-whiskers of our driver: the only pair I saw in real life after seeing them so long in pictures on boxes of raisins and cigars. There they were associated with the look and dress of a torrero, and our coachman, though an old Castilian of the austerest and most taciturn pattern, may have been in his gay youth an Andalusian bull-fighter.|$|E

40|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the recent}} announcement by University Microfilms of its Japanese Technical Abstracts, the recent offering by UNV Science Press of Chinese Science Abstracts, and continuing advertisements by ISI for their Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings and Index to Scientific Book Contents raise a bothersome <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> Namely, are format-dependent or "national" abstracts/indexes useful tools in a science/engineering library's reference collection...|$|R
