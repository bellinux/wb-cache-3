40|$|Plant {{processes}} affect fluxes of energy, {{moisture and}} CO 2 between {{the land and}} the atmosphere. Land surface models need to correctly represent the vegetation functioning and its response to environmental conditions. Due to anthropogenic carbon emissions rising, and global warming, plant processes are being affected and in turn modulate the terrestrial carbon sink. However, models still disagree on the response of plants to changing conditions. This work analyses how vegetation is treated in two land surface models: the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) and Carbon Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (CTESSEL). The aim is to analyse how environmental variables control the vegetation processes at daily and seasonal timescales at present day climate and the changes that arise in a scenario of double atmospheric CO 2 and higher temperature. The analyses are carried out at the leaf level and at the canopy level. To investigate the responses at the leaf level, the photosynthesis scheme used in each model was extracted, thereby providing a submodel that can be run in stand alone mode. The photosynthesis submodel provides a means to analyse the leaf level response of each photosynthesis model to environment variables as well as the internal model parameters that characterise each plant type. In JULES the environmental controls on photosynthesis are explicitly introduced by three limiting regimes: light, rubisco (carbon) or <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime. In CTESSEL the carbon and light limitations are implicitly represented but there is no export limitation. Due to the lack of <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime, CTESSEL presents higher sensitivity to CO 2 concentration resulting in a stronger CO 2 fertilization effect. The carbon and energy fluxes produced by the full land surface models were tested and compared at 10 European FLUXNET sites. The main differences between modellled carbon fluxes were found to be the treatment of soil moisture stress and the lack of <b>export</b> <b>limiting</b> regime in CTESSEL. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in models is the result of model parameters’ dependence on temperature and the combination of limiting regimes. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis was found to be a determining element in the strength and sign of the vegetation modelled feedback to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Argentinean export {{growth was}} {{impressive}} {{during the recent}} economic boom (2003 - 2007). However, decomposing export growth reveals that the extensive margin (increases in exports of existing products to existing markets) dominates, while the intensive margin (increases in exports of new products or new markets) contributes little to export growth. Argentina's trade product concentration has increased in the past 10 years, and the main export products remain overwhelmingly natural-resource intensive. The little diversification of non-primary <b>exports</b> <b>limits</b> the country’s ability to weather a decline in export commodity prices. The country has had some success finding new export markets, especially in Latin America, but should seek to develop deeper trade relationships with high GDP export destinations such as the European Union and the United States.

40|$|Countries {{sometimes}} use {{export controls}} on raw materials to encourage domestic processing. The motivation is usually to assure raw materials at low prices for domestic industries, although exports are sometimes controlled {{in an attempt}} to increase export earnings (by promoting exports of higher value-added processed goods rather than raw materials). The problem is, export controls hurt raw material producers and cause economic distortions that result in net losses to the country. The impact of raw material export controls on total export earnings is ambiguous: the decline in raw material export when production is discouraged by lower prices may outweigh the effect of increased exports of processed goods. The author develops a simple partial equilibrium model of export controls on raw material to investigate the impact of export restrictions and to estimate the potential magnitude of the transfers between groups and the net costs of the export-control regimes. The author's estimates of the magnitude of transfers and costs of export controls on raw cashmere (in Mongolia) and wood production (in Romania) indicate that the transfers and costs may be substantial. The author finds that (under reasonable assumptions about elasticities of supply) export controls can transfer significant profits from the raw materials producers to the processing industries, causing significant net losses to the economy and a substantial net decrease in <b>export</b> earnings. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>export</b> controls will be even more distortive if processing industries have any monopsony (single-buyers) power. This is quite likely in developing countries with small industrial bases - or in economies in transition, where central planning has left a legacy of very large firms in highly concentrated industries. With monopsony power in the processing industry, both output and exports of final products can be reduced by <b>quantitative</b> <b>export</b> controls on raw material inputs. The quantitative control bestows effective monopsony power on the processing firm and encourages it to exploit this monopsony power by reducing output. If the raw materials could be freely exported, processors {{would not be able to}} effectively exercise monopsony power.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} air-sea {{heat flux}} feedback (α, in W m[superscript − 2] K[superscript − 1]) {{is a major}} contributor to setting the damping timescale of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. In this study we compare the spatial distribution and magnitude of αα in the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean, as estimated from the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. The comparison is rationalized in terms of an upper bound on the heat flux feedback, associated with “fast” atmospheric export of temperature and moisture anomalies away from the marine boundary layer, and a lower bound associated with “slow” export. It is found that regions of cold surface waters (≤ 10 ∘C) are best described as approaching the slow <b>export</b> <b>limit.</b> This conclusion is not only valid at the synoptic scale resolved by the reanalysis data, but also on basin scales. In particular, it applies to the heat flux feedback acting as circumpolar SST anomaly scales are approached in the Southern Ocean, with feedbacks of ≤ 10 W m[superscript − 2] K[superscript − 1]. In contrast, the magnitude of the heat flux feedback is close to that expected from the fast <b>export</b> <b>limit</b> over the Gulf Stream and its recirculation with values on the order of ≈ 40 W m[superscript − 2] K[superscript − 1]. Further analysis suggests that this high value reflects a compensation between a moderate thermodynamic adjustment of the boundary layer, which tends to weaken the heat flux feedback, and an enhancement of the surface winds over warm SST anomalies, which tend to enhance the feedback.
