Starr's attorney Bruce Grakal told journalist Peter Palmiere that the partnership between Hudson and Starr was over and they would never work together again. This happened after Hudson dropped out of Starr's 2006 tour as musical director to do the TV show The One: Making a Music Star. According to Palmiere, Hudson claimed that the split was over Starr's insistence on using synthesized sounds, for which Stewart is known, whereas Hudson wanted real guitars, pianos, strings etc. However, concerning the parting of ways with Hudson, Starr commented, [...] "The separation between Mark Hudson and myself was a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> and friendship and {{had nothing to do}} with synthesizers." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Open learner models (OLM) {{enable users}} to access their learner model to view {{information}} about their understanding. Opening the learner model to the learner may increase their perceptions of how a system evaluates their knowledge and updates the model. This raises <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> relating to whether the learner believes the evaluations are correct, and whether they trust {{the system as a}} whole. We investigate learner trust in various OLM features: the complexity of the model presentation; the level of learner control over the model contents; and the facility to release one's own model for peer viewing. ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{therefore}} {{not surprising that the}} following referendums suggest that in France, the process is marked by a plebiscite. The impression that voters are motivated a contrario even if, unlike de Gaulle, none of his successors has openly raised the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> This is the main reason for the use of referendums in recent years, where politically random referendums give an opportunity for the protest vote to speak, at the risk of failure (as was nearly the case in 1992, {{as was the case in}} 2005). In addition, out of an almost cultural dimension, the referendum may trigger a minor increase in interest and low participation which, because of the requirement for a quorum, reduces the scope of its result (as in 1972 and especially in 1988).|$|E
50|$|Each of {{the parties}} {{involved}} in describing, discussing or seeking to understand a system, actual or planned, will view it in the conceptual framework {{with which they are}} familiar. Each party will usually have a different view of the values of the system; their knowledge of the policies embodied in it will vary according to their responsibilities; they may know of only a subset of the events handled by the system; and they are unlikely to know of all content required, as content will not always be formal and recognized. Finally, there is the important <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> that the parties have for one another, and trust that the system will meet its expected outcomes. A lack of trust between the parties can affect the success of the system in cases where information is not revealed, commitment to using the system is not whole-hearted or maintaining 'shadow systems'.|$|E

40|$|This MBA {{project is}} a company hosted {{management}} project. This work has been commissioned by the <b>Question</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trust</b> Campaign. This recently-launched campaign aims to improve the levels of trust within the UK financial services industry. The campaign approach involves concern over ‘soft controls’ within the industry, related to ethics and values. The position of the campaign is that too much emphasis has been placed upon ‘hard controls’ such as regulation; ‘compliance’ {{is not necessarily the}} same as ‘doing the right thing’. The remit of this project is to investigate and assess codes of conduct, and to discuss the potential role that codes of conduct may play in increasing levels of trust within the UK financial services industry. Recent banking scandals affecting the industry have highlighted the salience and importance of this topic. A picture has emerged whereby lack of trust has led to a lack of engagement of consumers with the industry. This in turn creates a societal problem given that many consumers do not adequately invest in pension plans or other forms of financial life-stage planning. The <b>Question</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trust</b> campaign board commissioned this report in order to investigate whether academic theory could assist the campaign in achieving its objective to rebuild trust in the industry. A significant element of this project has involved creating an in-depth academic literature review on the subject of codes of conduct. Findings from this literature review were summarised though creation of a campaign ‘policy report’ on the subject of whether codes of conduct can help rebuild trust in the UK financial services industry. Furthermore, specific recommendations have been provided for the <b>Question</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trust</b> campaign based on research findings. In terms of methodology, this project {{can be seen as a}} form of ‘action research’. Whilst the project aims to deliver a practical client solution, client reaction and feedback is also recorded as results of the project activity. In this way, reaction of a small number of business leaders is recorded as a means of evaluating practitioner views on academic theory. This project document argues that codes of conduct can help rebuild trust in the UK financial services industry. Academic theory on the topic does however illustrate inherent difficulties and challenges. Codes of conduct are seen as the most important element within a wider programme of business ethics management. The project policy report offers practical recommendations as a means of summarising and applying academic theory on the topic. This project document recommends the <b>Question</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trust</b> campaign create infrastructure to assist companies in developing their own codes of conduct, and further recommends that the campaign play a role in developing ethical training programmes to further support the UK financial services industry...|$|E

40|$|While {{education}} cannot function without trust, its loss {{in institutions}} sometimes goes unspoken, officially unreported, only shared in ways invisible to measurement or control. This article considers issues <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> power and displaced dissent, providing some snapshots of participant views about <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> and leadership recorded {{in a series}} of 28 interviews and 242 electronic survey responses from the post-compulsory education or ‘lifelong learning’ sector in 2004 ‑ 09.

These snapshots are random examples of dissent emerging from those whose power to speak out in their own institutions was limited, for fear of reprisals.

In a meta-analysis across seventeen UK public dialogue processes we identify five spheres of public concern about the governance of science and technology relating to: the purposes of science; trust; inclusion; speed and direction of innovation; and equity. Forty in-depth interviews with senior UK sciencepolicy actors reveal highly partial institutional responses to these concerns and help explain the underlying processes that close down, and at times open up, reflection and response on public values. Finally, we consider the implications of this analysis for the future of science governance, prospects for more anticipatory, reflexive, and inclusive forms of governing, and the roles for critical social science inquiry...|$|R
40|$|The {{trust that}} {{patients}} invest in healthcare professionals and their advice {{has been shown}} to facilitate positive clinical outcomes, although there is evidence that patient trust in expertise, including healthcare professionals, has been declining over the years. Questions about whether or not to trust healthcare professionals have been raised recently in international media by Australian pop icon Kylie Minogue, who spoke of her alleged initial misdiagnosis with breast cancer and went on to tell women that they should ‘follow their intuition’ rather than placing unquestioning trust in doctors or medical advice. Given the power of the media in shaping public opinion, there is a potential for such stories to further impact on the already potentially friable doctor-patient relationships, with <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> taking centre-stage. Therefore, an understanding of the nature <b>of</b> <b>trust,</b> in addition to the reasons for the decline in patient trust, is exceedingly important for health professionals.
