5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to him out of an airlock some time previously. A chance {{to get back to}} Earth through a dimension warp presents itself; although it is not <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> it appears to be, it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, Will {{served as}} an {{assistant}} to a chairman at a foot massage company. He soon found that the job was not <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> he had expected, and, about one year later, applied to join Alibaba as a sales person for its business-to-business e-commerce service in 2005.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} however, {{there was a}} serious {{breakdown}} in command and control, {{and a number of}} fundamental errors were made. The shuttle of helicopters to and from Whiskey-Three, the HAA, as well as the order in which paratroopers were embarked, was improvised and initially uncoordinated and disorganised. It wasn't made initially clear to the commander of the helicopter extraction force <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> the problem - and the sudden urgency - was. Furthermore, two engineers, whose role was to destroy enemy equipment, departed in the first wave with all the demolition fuses before all the equipment had been disabled.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea behind}} Mad Dogs {{came from the}} {{friendship}} between the four main actors, who wanted to work together for a television project, as well as Cris Cole and executive producer Suzanne Mackie. The four initially {{wanted to make a}} story about a rock band, but decided that making programmes about bands have been [...] "done to death". To write the series, Cole was influenced by the works of David Lynch and the Coen brothers as inspiration to the kind of storytelling that is [...] "never <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> you {{think it is going to}} be".|$|E
500|$|After {{two weeks}} of {{manoeuvre}} and engagements (including The Battle of the Clouds, The Paoli Massacre, and an engagement at Valley Forge where Alexander Hamilton was nearly lost), Howe triumphantly entered the city on 26 September. The reception the British received was not <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> they had expected, however. [...] They had {{been led to believe}} that [...] "Friends thicker than Woods" [...] would greet them upon their arrival; they instead were greeted by women, children, and many deserted houses. Despite Howe's best attempts to minimise the plundering by his army (he authorised the execution of violators of his orders against it), this activity by the army had a significant negative effect on popular support.|$|E
500|$|Although the duo had deleted {{their back}} {{catalogue}} in the UK with immediate effect, international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings {{for a number}} of years. The KLF, like any other artist, were also entitled to Performing Right Society royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television. Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain, the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation. [...] "Having created an artistic machine that created money", said GQ Magazine, [...] "they [...] invented a machine for destroying it." [...] <b>Quite</b> <b>what</b> the Foundation, this money-destroying machine, would do with the million pounds plus was still undecided.|$|E

500|$|Lord's {{invocation}} {{of an era}} of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme {{at the height of}} the Cold War. The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia [...] "thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to wonder whether the world and their being are <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> they always took them to be." [...] The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of Titanics passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.|$|E
500|$|On October 22, 2015, {{producer}} Malek Akkad {{expressed his}} wishes to postpone production {{for the new}} Halloween film and insists that the next iteration and the extra time {{will result in a}} better film. Malek said of Halloween Returns: [...] "Although, I have to say, and this is somewhat new news, but unfortunately things happen in Hollywood where you have issues with studios and different variables. We've had {{to take a step back}} and now we’re trying to re-figure this beast that is the new Halloween. So there is a bit of a delay, but this new Halloween isn't going to be <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> has been announced and what people are expecting, so we're making some changes there as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Clair de Lune {{was soon}} {{removed from the}} Fantasia program, but Disney and his writers {{encountered}} problems of setting a concrete story to Cydalise. Its opening march, [...] "The Entry of the Little Fauns", attracted Disney to the piece which at first provided suitable depictions of fauns he wanted. On January 5, 1939, following {{a search for a}} stronger piece to fit the mythological theme, the piece was replaced with sections of Beethoven's sixth symphony. Stokowski disagreed with the switch, believing that Disney's [...] "idea of mythology... is not <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> this symphony is about". He was also concerned about the reception from classical music enthusiasts who would criticize Disney for venturing too far from the composer's intent. Taylor on the other hand welcomed the change, describing it as [...] "a stunning one", and saw [...] "no possible objection to it".|$|E

500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> to do with someone like me, but that's OK. I think there are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan is setting up the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|In the {{introduction}} to the story as it appears in the DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore trade paperback, Brian Bolland disputes the widely held belief that the story started as a Batman annual story and ended up as a prestige-format book. Bolland recalls that the idea for a one-off Batman story focusing on the Joker—with Batman more of an incidental character—was his. Bolland says that in 1984, DC editor Dick Giordano told him he could do any project for DC he wanted, and Bolland requested to do a Batman/Joker prestige book with Moore as writer. Bolland has also expressed dissatisfaction with the final book, and regrets that its impending schedule for release meant he could not color the book himself (John Higgins was the colorist). Bolland says that [...] "the end result wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> I'd hoped. I don't think it rates with some of the highlights of Alan's career." [...] March 2008 saw the release of the artwork as Bolland intended it: the twentieth anniversary hardcover edition of The Killing Joke is completely recolored by Bolland himself. The book made The New York Times Best Seller list in May 2009.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
2500|$|They {{performed}} [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] live {{during their}} appearances from late 1964 until their last tour in 1966. McCartney said they introduced the song by saying, [...] "'And now for something different.' ... We {{used to put}} that in there, and think, 'Well, they won't know <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> to make of this, but it's cool.'" [...] In 1996, a live version of [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] was released as a B-side to [...] "Real Love", the second single from their Anthology project.|$|E
2500|$|Influenced by 1960s {{rhythm and}} blues, soul, bluegrass, and rock bands {{such as the}} Byrds and Buffalo Springfield, the Eagles' overall sound has been {{described}} as [...] "California rock." [...] In the words of Sal Manna, author of the CD liner notes of the band's 1994 album Hell Freezes Over, [...] "no one knew <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> 'California rock' meant – except perhaps that, because in California anything was possible, music that came from that promising land was more free-spirited and free-ranging." [...] Rolling Stone described the Eagles' sound as [...] "country-tinged vocal harmonies with hard rock guitars and lyrics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellen Barkin, {{who played}} the romantic {{interest}} [...] "Penny Priddy", describes the film as [...] "if Terry Southern had written Star Wars. None of the characters are <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> they should be—just my kind of thing." [...] Richter's only choice to play John Bigbooté was Christopher Lloyd. Richter first met Jeff Goldblum on Invasion of the Body Snatchers and wanted him to play New Jersey. The actor admired his writing and was eager {{to work with the}} cast the director had assembled. Lewis Smith was asked to dye his hair blond. It took eight hours, and he saw it go from red to orange to fluorescent yellow to white.|$|E
2500|$|The dark {{theme of}} the album was {{balanced}} by [...] "Every Little Thing", which Unterberger describes as a [...] "celebration of what a wonderful girl the guy has". McCartney said of the song: [...] "'Every Little Thing', {{like most of the}} stuff I did, was my attempt at the next single... but it became an album filler rather than the great almighty single. It didn't have <b>quite</b> <b>what</b> was required." [...] Musicologist Walter Everett says the chorus' incorporation of [...] "leaden" [...] parallel fifth harmonies, supported by Starr's timpani, was the inspiration for a proto-heavy metal version of the song recorded by the English progressive rock band Yes in 1969.|$|E

The trio quickly get caught in a {{downward}} spiral of sex, closeted movie stars, hustlers, blackmail, secret videotape, a homophobic district attorney, a cute bartender, false fire alarms, car theft, impersonating a police officer, a sleazy public-access television host and a [...] "night with Oscar" [...] {{that has nothing to}} do with the Academy Awards.|$|E
