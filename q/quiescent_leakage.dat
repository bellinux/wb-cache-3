This leads to leakage current becoming a much more significant component of power {{than it has been in}} the past. We have previously shown that substantial leakage reduction can be achieved in single Vt circuits by turning off stitcks of transistors. A theoretical model was also derived which predicts the <b>quiescent</b> <b>leakage</b> current and the idle time required to reach quiescent levels. In this report, we will review the leakage estimation model, outline a method for evaluating the leakage assocated with an input vector, and use the model to identify inputs which minimize leakage in a variety of test cases...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{manufactured in}} current technology consist {{of millions of}} transistors with dimensions shrinking into the nanometer range. These small transistors have <b>quiescent</b> (<b>leakage)</b> currents that are increasingly sensitive to process variations, which have increased the variation in good-chip quiescent current and consequently reduced the effectiveness of IDDQ testing. This research proposes {{the use of a}} multivariate statistical technique known as principal component analysis for the purpose of variance reduction. Outlier analysis is applied to the reduced leakage current values as well as the good chip leakage current estimate, to identify defective chips. The proposed idea is evaluated using IDDQ values from multiple wafers of an industrial chip fabricated in 130 nm technology. It is shown that the proposed method achieves significant variance reduction and identifies many outliers that escape identification by other established techniques. For example, it identifies many of the absolute outliers in bad neighborhoods, which are not detected by Nearest Neighbor Residual and Nearest Current Ratio. It also identifies many of the spatial outliers that pass when using Current Ratio. The proposed method also identifies both active and passive defects...|$|E
40|$|Prevailing CMOS design {{practice}} {{has been very}} conservative with regard to choice of transistor threshold voltage, {{so as to avoid}} the difficult problems of threshold variations and high leakage currclnts. It is becoming necessary to scale threshold voltages more aggress vely in order to obtain further power reduction, performance improven ent, and integration density. Substantial leakage reduction can be achi ved in single Vt designs by stacking low 27 t transistors. We have derived a simplified theoretical model which predicts the <b>quiescent</b> <b>leakage</b> current and the worst case time required to settle to quiescent levels in a single stack of transistors. This model {{can be used in a}} design environment to make quick estimation of leakage with respect to design changes. Model results are compared to circuit sirnulation. Leakage current predictions were found to rnatch simulation results very closely for a wide random selection of design parameter values and temperatures. Transistor stacks with mt ltiple transistors turned off were found to have anywhere from 2 to 30 times lower leakage current than stack with only one transistor turned off. The time requirecl for a transistor stack to settle to quiescent current levels varied from a few microseconds up to tens of milliseconds...|$|E

40|$|<b>Quiescent</b> current <b>leakage</b> {{test of the}} VDD supply (IDDQ Test) {{has been}} proven an {{effective}} way to screen out defective chips in manufacturing of Integrated Circuits (IC). As technology advances, the traditional IDDQ test is facing more and more challenges. In this research, a practical built-in current sensor (BICS) is proposed and the design is verified by three generations of test chips. The BICS detects the signal by sensing the voltage drop on supply lines of the circuit under test (CUT). Then the sensor performs analog-to-digital conversion of the input signal using a stochastic process with scan chain readout. Self-calibration and digital chopping are used to minimize offset and low frequency noise and drift. This non-invasive procedure avoids any performance degradation of the CUT. The measurement results of test chips are presented. The sensor achieves a high IDDQ resolution with small chip area overhead. This will enable IDDQ of future technology generations...|$|R

First, a digital voltage multistandard WLAN receivers. Instead of approaching a interface would require at least 20 more pins for communication complicated SoC, a 3 D-stack SiP appears as a promising between the two chips, as the receive chain generates in-phase (1) alternative to meet those requirements {{in conjunction with the}} and quadrature (Q) signals.

Techniques such as clock gating, low power processes, low power IP and lower supply voltage used with each new generation of process technology have helped designers of mobile applications to stem the tide of ever increasing power. Configurable processors such as the Xtensa [1] core used here can also optimize the instruction set to minimize power and energy. As technology moved down to 180 nm, leakage power was not a major issue. The old techniques produced acceptable results. However, the 130 nm and 90 nm technologies are reaching the point where leakage power is nearly the same as dynamic power. And both dynamic and static powers are increasing at such a rate that the ol...|$|R
