5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic <b>quinone,</b> beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The <b>quinone</b> is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase <b>quinone</b> type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a <b>quinone</b> irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E

5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, the other holding hydrogen peroxide and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and <b>quinone.</b> The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E

25|$|Complex I {{contains}} a ubiquinone binding pocket at the interface of the 49-kDa and PSST subunits. Close to iron-sulfur cluster N2, the proposed immediate electron donor for ubiquinone, a highly conserved tyrosine constitutes a critical {{element of the}} <b>quinone</b> reduction site. A possible <b>quinone</b> exchange path leads from cluster N2 to the N-terminal beta-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit. All 45 subunits of the bovine NDHI have been sequenced. Each complex contains noncovalently bound FMN, coenzyme Q and several iron-sulfur centers. The bacterial NDHs have 8-9 iron-sulfur centers.|$|E
25|$|FAD {{can exist}} in four {{different}} redox states, {{which are the}} flavin-N(5)-oxide, <b>quinone,</b> semiquinone, and hydroquinone. FAD is converted between these states by accepting or donating electrons. FAD, in its fully oxidized form, or <b>quinone</b> form, accepts two electrons and two protons to become FADH2 (hydroquinone form). The semiquinone (FADH·) can be formed by either reduction of FAD or oxidation of FADH2 by accepting or donating one electron and one proton, respectively. Some proteins, however, generate and maintain a superoxidized form of the flavin cofactor, the flavin-N(5)-oxide. See the mechanism section below for details.|$|E
25|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{dynamics of}} Complex I are primarily {{driven by the}} <b>quinone</b> redox cycle. In conditions of high proton motive force (and accordingly, a ubiquinol-concentrated pool), the enzyme runs in the reverse direction.

25|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, animals {{exposed to}} certain PAHs have shown increased development of plaques (atherogenesis) within arteries. Potential mechanisms for the pathogenesis {{and development of}} atherosclerotic plaques may {{be similar to the}} mechanisms involved in the carcinogenic and mutagenic properties of PAHs. A leading hypothesis is that PAHs may activate the cytochrome enzyme CYP1B1 in vascular smooth muscle cells. This enzyme then metabolically processes the PAHs to <b>quinone</b> metabolites that bind to DNA in reactive adducts that remove purine bases. The resulting mutations may contribute to unregulated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells or to their migration {{to the inside of the}} artery, which are steps in plaque formation. These <b>quinone</b> metabolites also generate reactive oxygen species that may alter the activity of genes that affect plaque formation.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} results on chromosomal aberrations and spindle disturbances in mammalian liver cells for eight regioisomers of pyrene, benzo(a) pyrene and phenanthrene <b>quinones</b> {{were compared with}} the AM 1 calculated stereoelectronic descriptors. The electronic structure of the parent compounds {{as well as the}} corresponding radical anions, were evaluated. Two groups of reactivity descriptors were specified evaluating the mechanisms of genotoxicity of <b>quinones</b> that were recently proposed by us. The first group of parameters (e. g., electronic gap) describes potency of chemicals as cross-linkers of cellular macromolecules, whereas the second group (e. g., electronegativity, frontier orbital energies, their displacement and energy equivalence when going from <b>quinones</b> to the respective intermediate anion-radicals) assesses the one electron reduction efficiency. The ordering of <b>quinones,</b> according to their theoretically estimated reactivities, was found to be consistent with the experimental genotoxicity data. It was concluded that genotoxic activity of studied <b>quinones</b> is an integrated effect of two mechanisms. The prevailing one of these mechanisms affects the qualitative difference in the genotoxic effect of <b>quinones.</b> The benzo(a) pyrene and pyrene <b>quinones</b> were predicted to be more active cross-link inducers and more effective oxidants than phenanthrene <b>quinones...</b>|$|R

25|$|There {{are three}} redox states of CoQ10: fully {{oxidized}} (ubiquinone), semiquinone (ubisemiquinone), and fully reduced (ubiquinol). The capacity of this molecule {{to act as}} a two-electron carrier (moving between the <b>quinone</b> and quinol form) and a one-electron carrier (moving between the semiquinone and one of these other forms) is central to its role in the electron transport chain due to the iron–sulfur clusters that can only accept one electron at a time, and as a free radical-scavenging antioxidant.|$|E
25|$|The most {{confirmed}} {{function of}} plastid terminal oxidase in developed chloroplasts is {{its role in}} chlororespiration. In this process, NADPH dehydrogenase (NDH) reduces the <b>quinone</b> pool and the terminal oxidase oxidizes it, serving the same function as cytochrome c oxidase from mitochondrial electron transport. In Chlamydomonas, there are two copies of the gene for the oxidase. PTOX2 significantly contributes to the flux of electrons through chlororespiration in the dark. There is also evidence from experiments with tobacco that it functions in plant chlororespiration as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} by Roessler et al. (2010) used {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and double electron-electron resonance (DEER) to determine the path of electron transfer through the iron-sulfur complexes, which {{are located in the}} hydrophilic domain. Seven of these clusters form a chain from the flavin to the <b>quinone</b> binding sites; the eighth cluster is located {{on the other side of}} the flavin, and its function is unknown. The EPR and DEER results suggest an alternating or “roller-coaster” potential energy profile for the electron transfer between the active sites and along the iron-sulfur clusters, which can optimize the rate of electron travel and allow efficient energy conversion in complex I.|$|E

25|$|The {{coupling}} of proton translocation and electron transport in Complex I {{is currently}} proposed as being indirect (long range conformational changes) {{as opposed to}} direct (redox intermediates in the hydrogen pumps as in heme groups of Complexes III and IV). The architecture of the hydrophobic region of complex I shows multiple proton transporters that are mechanically interlinked. The three central components believed to contribute to this long-range conformational change event are the pH-coupled N2 iron-sulfur cluster, the <b>quinone</b> reduction, and the transmembrane helix subunits of the membrane arm. Transduction of conformational changes to drive the transmembrane transporters linked by a 'connecting rod' during the reduction of ubiquinone can account {{for two or three}} of the four protons pumped per NADH oxidized. The remaining proton must be pumped by direct coupling at the ubiquinone-binding site. It is proposed that direct and indirect coupling mechanisms account for the pumping of the four protons.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{number of}} species have {{developed}} special glands that produce chemicals for deterring predators (see Defense and predation). The Ground beetle's (of Carabidae) defensive glands, located at the posterior, produce a variety of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. While African carabid beetles (e.g., Anthia some of which used to comprise the genus Thermophilum) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. While Bombardier beetles have well developed, like other carabid beetles, pygidial glands that empty from the lateral edges of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers. The first holds hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, with the second holding just hydrogen peroxide plus catalases. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, forming temperatures of around 100 C, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to H2 + O2 + <b>quinone,</b> with the O2 propelling the excretion.|$|E
25|$|The full {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} beetle's unique defense mechanism is unknown, but biologists {{have shown that the}} system could have theoretically evolved from defenses found in other beetles in incremental steps by natural selection. Specifically, <b>quinone</b> chemicals are a precursor to sclerotin, a brownish substance produced by beetles and other insects to harden their exoskeleton. Some beetles additionally store excess foul-smelling quinones, including hydroquinone, in small sacs below their skin as a natural deterrent against predators—all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement. Some beetles additionally mix hydrogen peroxide, a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, in with the hydroquinone; some of the catalases that exist in most cells make the process more efficient. The chemical reaction produces heat and pressure, and some beetles exploit the latter to push out the chemicals onto the skin; this is the case in the beetle Metrius contractus, which produces a foamy discharge when attacked. In the bombardier beetle, the muscles that prevent leakage from the reservoir additionally developed a valve permitting more controlled discharge of the poison and an elongated abdomen to permit better control over the direction of discharge.|$|E
