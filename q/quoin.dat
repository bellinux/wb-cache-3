5|$|Almost {{nothing of}} the {{original}} church—built {{on the site of}} a wooden Saxon church—remains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a plait interweave and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a <b>quoin,</b> which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re-consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch {{on the inside of the}} southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{two kinds}} of course in this family of bonds is called a {{stretching}} course, and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from <b>quoin</b> to <b>quoin.</b> The other kind of course is the heading course, and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the <b>quoin</b> header at either end—to generate the bond.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a course}} {{begins with a}} <b>quoin</b> stretcher, the course will ordinarily {{terminate}} with a <b>quoin</b> stretcher at the other end. The next course up will begin with a <b>quoin</b> header. For the course's second brick, a queen closer is laid, generating the lap of the bond. The third brick along is a stretcher, and is—on account of the lap—centred above the header below. This second course then resumes its paired run of stretcher and header, until the final pair is reached, whereupon a second and final queen closer is inserted as the penultimate brick, mirroring the arrangement {{at the beginning of}} the course, and duly closing the bond.|$|E
50|$|Stone <b>quoins</b> {{are used}} on stone or brick {{buildings}}. Brick <b>quoins</b> may appear on brick buildings that extrude from the facing brickwork {{in such a}} way as to give the appearance of uniformly cut blocks of stone larger than the bricks. Where <b>quoins</b> are used for decoration and not for load-bearing, they may be made from a wider variety of materials beyond brick, stone or concrete, extending to timber, cement render or other stucco.|$|R
25|$|The main facade {{is divided}} into five bays in an A-B-A rhythm {{established}} by a single-bay central section and flanking two-bay sections. Rustic <b>quoins</b> turn {{the east and west}} corners of the facade. An italianate cornice spans the roof-line between the rusticated <b>quoins.</b>|$|R
25|$|This bond {{is exactly}} like English cross bond {{except in the}} {{generating}} of the lap at the <b>quoins.</b> In Dutch bond, all <b>quoins</b> are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen closers.|$|R
25|$|All bricks in this bond are headers, {{but for the}} lap-generating <b>quoin</b> three-quarter bat which offsets each {{successive}} course by half a header.|$|E
25|$|The {{great variety}} of monk bond {{patterns}} allow for many possible layouts at the quoins, and many possible arrangements for generating a lap. A <b>quoin</b> brick may be a stretcher, a three-quarter bat, or a header. Queen closers may be used next to the quoins, but the practice is not mandatory.|$|E
25|$|The two stone two-story {{dependencies}} have hipped {{roofs and}} central chimneys and their corners {{are given the}} same <b>quoin</b> treatment as the main house. The connecting passageways, also of stone, are quadrants covered with shed roofs that are concealed from the north or front. At the junction with the central block, the roofs of the connections are stepped up to allow entrances to the main floor of the house.|$|E
50|$|The {{long and}} short <b>quoining</b> method instead places long stone blocks with their lengths {{oriented}} vertically, between smaller ones that are laid flat. This load bearing <b>quoining</b> is common in Anglo-Saxon buildings {{such as that of}} St Bene't's Church in Cambridge, England.|$|R

25|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in limestone rubble, with some ironstone banding, and ashlar dressings. Its plan {{consists of a}} nave with a clerestory and north and south aisles, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower dates from the 12thcentury and is in three stages. Its parapet is embattled, and has pinnacles and gargoyles at the corners. Pieces of stone decorated with chevrons have been incorporated {{in the fabric of}} the tower. In the top stage are paired bell openings on the north, west and south sides. In the middle stage is a round-headed window on the south side, and a lancet window on the west. A large vertical stone, possibly a former cross shaft, {{has been used as a}} <b>quoin</b> in the northwest corner of the nave. In the west wall of the north aisle is a small 12th-century round-headed window. Its north wall contains a blocked doorway and two 13th-century lancet windows; there is another lancet window in the east wall. In the north wall of the chancel is a blocked doorway which formerly led to a north chapel. The east wall contains a 19th-century two-light window, and outside the east wall are the foundations of a former apse. In the south wall of the chancel is a 14th-century two-light window with a cinquefoil above it. The south aisle has two-light windows with ogee heads in its east and south walls. The south doorway has a pointed arch. In both the north and south sides of the clerestory are two windows with paired lights.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, Wanderone {{and friend}} Jimmy Castras [...] arrived in {{southern}} Illinois— a major hustling center {{on a fast}} track to televised tournament play— and settled in Du <b>Quoin,</b> Illinois, where he continued hustling. Eventually, he met Evelyn Inez Graff; they married two months to the day later, on May 7, 1941. Following their wedding, the Wanderones settled in Dowell, Illinois. In 1942, the couple moved to Norfolk, Virginia. [...] Norfolk had become a key mustering point for American soldiers, {{as well as a}} shipbuilding center. The growing population led to an enormous interest in gambling; Wanderone, in partnership with fellow hustler Lassiter, quickly recognized the financial possibilities. Following World War II, however, the action [...] "dried up" [...] soon, and the Wanderones returned to Little Egypt. For a period throughout the 1950s, Wanderone entered semi-retirement, making only occasional hustling trips to New York City.|$|E
500|$|Ludlow Castle {{sits on a}} rocky promontory, {{overlooking}} the modern town of Ludlow on lower ground to the east, while the ground slopes steeply from the castle to the rivers Corve and Teme {{to the south and}} west, about [...] below. The castle is broadly rectangular in shape, and approximately [...] in size, covering almost [...] in total. The interior is divided into two main parts: an inner bailey which occupies the north-west corner and a much larger outer bailey. A third enclosure, known as the innermost bailey, was created in the early 13thcentury when walls were built to enclose the south-west corner of the inner ward. The castle's walls are linked to Ludlow's medieval town wall circuit on the south and east sides. The castle is built from a range of different types of stone; the Norman stone work is constructed from greenish-grey siltstone rubble, with the ashlar and <b>quoin</b> features carved from red sandstone, with the later work primarily using local red sandstone.|$|E

On the other hand, the <b>quoins</b> are not laid in the strict long-and-short alternation diagnostic of Saxon work.|$|R

500|$|John Kinder Archer, son of Carrick's first Inn's builder, began {{building}} a large mansion on Bishopbourne Road in 1847. It was {{built as a}} substantial, brick <b>quoin</b> and rubble walled, two-story structure with a triple-gabled roof. It was designed to have large rooms ( [...] by [...] ) and a domed driveway through the house's centre. When only four rooms were completed, the ship [...] "The City of Launceston" [...] sank off Adelaide {{with much of the}} supplies to complete the building. After this setback, exacerbated by the lack of insurance, Archer abandoned the building. Thomas Monds bought it in 1867 and used it for storing grain. Archer's building work created only a shell that became known as Archer's Folly. The folly was recorded by The Mercury in 1883 as both unfinished and ugly. By 1946 the Folly remained uncompleted and was used as a barn. In the late 20th century it was owned by Mirek Marik, local copper-work artist, who partly restored it. A fire broke out on 5 April 1978 and the conflagration left just a roofless shell. Marik Metal Art later built a replacement studio and workshop adjacent to the now grand ruin.|$|E

2500|$|Buck paid {{particular}} attention to the design of bridges of extreme obliquity, addressing two potential problems he had identified. Firstly, he noted that the acutely angled quoins at the obtuse corners of the plan view were very susceptible to damage during construction, settlement or by accidental blows in subsequent use so he devised a method of chamfering the edge, removing the single acute angle and replacing it with two obtuse angles and, in his own words, [...] "the quantity thus cut off from the acute <b>quoin,</b> is gradually diminished to the opposite or obtuse <b>quoin,</b> where the cutting vanishes; by this contrivance no angle less than a right angle is any where presented on the exterior of the work [...] the effect produced is elegant and pleasing to the eye." ...|$|E

He was indefatigable in attending to his duties; which consisted in taking care of one division of the guns, embracing ten of the aforesaid twenty-four-pounders. Ranged up against the ship's side at regular intervals, they resembled not a little a stud of sable chargers in their stall. Among this iron stud little <b>Quoin</b> was continually running in and out, currying them down, now and then, with an old rag, or keeping the flies off with a brush. To <b>Quoin,</b> the honour and dignity of the United States of America seemed indissolubly linked with the keeping his guns unspotted and glossy. He himself was black as a chimney-sweep with continually tending them, and rubbing them down with black paint. He would sometimes get outside of the port-holes and peer into their muzzles, as a monkey into a bottle. Or, like a dentist, he seemed intent upon examining their teeth. Quite as often, he would be brushing out their touch-holes with a little wisp of oakum, like a Chinese barber in Canton, cleaning a patient's ear.|$|E
