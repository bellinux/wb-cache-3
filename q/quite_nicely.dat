500|$|Madvillainy {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from music critics {{and became one}} of the most critically acclaimed projects of both artists. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 93, based on 20 reviews; it was the year's best-reviewed rap album and third highest reviewed album overall, according to the website. Sam Samuelson of AllMusic wrote that album's strength [...] "lies in its mix between seemingly obtuse beats, samples, MCing, and some straight-up hip-hop bumping" [...] and that [...] "MF DOOM's unpredictable lyrical style fits <b>quite</b> <b>nicely</b> within Madlib's unconventional beat orchestrations". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "indie rap blowing session by two guys near the top of their game". Alternative Press praised Madvillainy as [...] "all invention and no indulgence", while HipHopDX dubbed it an [...] "experimental, eclectic, raw, spontaneous" [...] classic. Mojo praised the album, calling it [...] "a symphony of such densely constructed chaos" [...] and noting that [...] "Madvillainys very opacity is part of its brilliance".|$|E
500|$|Selman {{wanted to}} include {{things in the}} episode that [...] "only really hard-core foodies would {{have any idea what}} we were talking about. This was like a love letter to foodie culture." [...] Food {{references}} featured in the episode include jokes about sriracha sauce and sous-vide cooking, referrals to chefs Wylie Dufresne, Frank Bruni, and Ruth Reichl, a mention of the soup phở from Vietnam and how to pronounce it correctly, and the inclusion of the El Chemistri owner who is based on the Spanish chef José Andrés (known for using molecular gastronomy). Selman has commented that food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy [...] "lends itself to comedy <b>quite</b> <b>nicely.</b> There’s a dish , for instance, called Regret. The waiter cries into your soup when he serves it. The human tear is the final ingredient." [...] The fictional character Swedish Chef is also seen in the episode, and the scene where the meth dealer is reminded of his childhood after eating the apple pie is a reference to the Pixar film Ratatouille, which was written and directed by former Simpsons consultant Brad Bird.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an A- {{describing}} {{the film as}} [...] "a friskier, sweeter-natured variation" [...] when compared to Raimi's work. She explained that the most [...] "amazing" [...] element was not the [...] "blockbuster wow!" [...] but instead the [...] "intimate awww." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today explained that [...] "as {{a new chapter in}} the superpowered arachnid saga, it stands on its own <b>quite</b> <b>nicely,</b> focusing more on human emotions than on a panoply of special effects." [...] She said [...] "where Tobey Maguire in the original Spider-Man trilogy was earnest, Garfield's Spider-Man is whip-smart and likably cheeky, with an undercurrent of teenage angst." [...] She also called the film [...] "as much a coming-of-age story as a crime-fighting action saga." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press described Garfield's Spider-Man as an arrogant and misunderstood outsider, giving the film a [...] "restless, reckless energy and a welcome sense of danger." [...] She also concluded that Webb was a different sort of director, saying that while Webb's big set pieces lacked Raimi's imagination, they conveyed [...] "emotional truth" [...] and [...] "a pervasive sense of humanity". However, Ty Burr of The Boston Globe felt that the film lacked the original's pop grace and the pulpy joy, saying the film was [...] "dumbed down, tarted up" [...] and [...] "almost shockingly uninspired". Burr evaluated it as [...] "the worst superhero film since Green Lantern". Colin Covert of the Star Tribune also felt that The Amazing Spider-Man is weaker than its predecessor and described it as [...] "The Notebook in spandex". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the reboot provided better reasons for why Peter Parker adopts his superhero role, even if the origin story didn't need to be told once again. He also remarked that it was [...] "probably the second best" [...] of the four Spider-Man films after Spider-Man 2, explaining that Lizard was lackluster compared to that film's villain, Doctor Octopus, and had the dramatic range of Godzilla.|$|E

At the end of half an hour, the meal over, Miss Rebecca Sharp (for such, astonishing to state, {{is the name of}} her who has been described ingeniously as [...] "the person" [...] hitherto), went upstairs again to her patient's rooms, from which, with the most engaging politeness, she eliminated poor Firkin. [...] "Thank you, Mrs. Firkin, that will <b>quite</b> do; how <b>nicely</b> you make it! I will ring when anything is wanted." [...] "Thank you"; and Firkin came downstairs in a tempest of jealousy, only the more dangerous because she was forced to confine it in her own bosom.|$|R
2500|$|Buick touted the California as [...] "The Distinctive Personal Car for Americana on the GO", {{using the}} Skylark platform. The {{merchandising}} {{creation of the}} West Coast's Mickey Garrett, the California GS became one of Buick's entries into what is now often known as a junior musclecar. The intent of these autos were to provide the visual impact of the era's supercars with the low maintenance and price of a more economical car, while maintaining reasonable performance levels. When reviewed with these thoughts in mind the California GS delivered <b>quite</b> <b>nicely.</b> They were fitted with the small block GS drivetrain and the exterior received the full treatment including vinyl top, chrome moulding package, GS emblems, and special California scripts. This marketing approach was also used in Colorado, using the [...] "Colorado" [...] name instead of [...] "California".|$|E
2500|$|Chambers {{had some}} chart {{success with the}} disco single [...] "Benihana" [...] in 1976, {{produced}} by Michael Zager on the Roulette Records label. Billboard magazine said [...] "She...sings <b>quite</b> <b>nicely</b> in a sexy little voice in this catchy disco tribute to an oriental loverman." [...] The song is played {{in the background of}} one scene in the film Rabid. In Insatiable she sang the theme song, [...] "Shame On You," [...] which plays over the opening credits. She did the same for the song [...] "Still Insatiable", which was used in her comeback in the 1999 adult film of the same name. She also sang vocals in the 1983 X-rated film Up 'n' Coming, in which she plays a rising country music star. In the early 1980s, she was the lead singer of a country and western band called Haywire.|$|E

However, when she insists upon heading more directly and quickly for his home, he loses the disguise and announces his identity to her, explaining that he was named Benten Kozō after his home, the island of Benten-jima. His possession of Kotarō's flute, Chidori, being what originally convinced her that he was her betrothed, he concocts an explanation of how he came to obtain it. He explains that Kotarō came to him as a poor and ill traveler who asked him to safeguard the flute and to exchange it for the incense burner, just before he died. In truth, Benten Kozō took care of Kotarō before killing him for his money and taking the flute.|$|E
60|$|Two black dragons {{were walking}} {{backwards}} {{in front of}} him. Two black dragons were looking at him with evil eyes. The dragons were walking backwards it was true, but they kept their eyes fixed on him none the less. The eyes which he saw were, in truth, only the two buttons {{at the back of}} a frock-coat: perhaps some traditional memory of their meaningless character gave this half-witted prominence to their gaze. The slit between the tails was the nose-line of the monster: whenever the tails flapped in the winter wind the dragons licked their lips. It was only a momentary fancy, but the small clerk found it imbedded in his soul ever afterwards. He never could again think of men in frock-coats except as dragons walking backwards. He explained afterwards, <b>quite</b> tactfully and <b>nicely,</b> to his two official friends, that (while feeling an inexpressible regard for each of them) he could not seriously regard the face of either of them as anything but a kind of tail. It was, he admitted, a handsome tail--a tail elevated in the air. But if, he said, any true friend of theirs wished to see their faces, to look into the eyes of their soul, that friend must be allowed to walk reverently round behind them, so as to see them from the rear. There he would see the two black dragons with the blind eyes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental results}} from the synchrotron cooler and storage ring CRYRING on charge transfer processes in fast electron transfer collisions using high-resolution cold target recoil-ion momentum spectroscopy. The main focus of these studies was to investigate a key concept of quantum mechanics: the wave-particle duality. One series of experiments has been dedicated {{to the study of}} heavy particle de Broglie wave interference due to scattering on a molecular ’double slit’. This is a fundamental manifestation of the wave properties of matter. Quantum interference oscillations were observed in the target orientation dependent cross section of single- and double-electron capture from H 2 to 1. 3 MeV protons and to 1. 2 and 2. 0 MeV He 2 + ions. Another study, included in this work, is a series of angular differential cross section measurements for single-electron capture to 1. 3 - 12. 5 MeV kinetic energy protons from He that enabled us to systematically investigate the classically allowed non-radiative electron capture process in fast collisions predicted by L. H. Thomas in 1927. The cross section for this process is expected to have a nonrelativistic, asymptotic dependence on the projectile velocity, vp, of vp− 11. This prediction (from 1927) was verified experimentally for the first time through the present measurements. Using the above mentioned experimental data in addition to measurements of double electron capture by 6. 0 MeV He 2 + from He, we have also studied the dominating, central part of the angular differential cross section, dσ/dΩ, where the peak shapes and widths surprisingly are very similar regardless of projectile energy and the number of captured electrons. We explain this with a diffraction model for the electron capture and calculate the corresponding diffracting electron capture ‘apertures’ from the shapes and widths of the measured cross sections and the projectile de Broglie wavelengths. We have on one hand established very strong experimental support for the picture suggested by Thomas in 1927 in which electrons and protons are described as classical particles. On the other hand, the diffraction picture describes the shapes of the central peaks in dσ/dΩ <b>quite</b> well, and <b>nicely</b> explains appearances of second and a third maxima in the angular differential cross section. It {{is hard to see how}} these seemingly contradicting results can be explained through complementary classical and quantum descriptions of the same underlying physical processes. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following paper was unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 3 : Manuscript...|$|R

If {{we could afford}} to give him really good lessons, he would soon be quite a little artist." [...] At the age of thirteen, he received some watercolor lessons from Carl Welsch, a German landscape painter. Although his education was far from complete, Sargent {{grew up to be}} a highly literate and cosmopolitan young man, accomplished in art, music, and literature. He was fluent in French, Italian, and German. At seventeen, Sargent was described as [...] "willful, curious, determined and strong" [...] (after his mother) yet shy, generous, and modest (after his father).

2500|$|Because of {{the harsh}} {{extremes}} in temperature on the Indian Subcontinent, the sari fills a practical role {{as well as}} a decorative one. It is not only warming in winter and cooling in summer, but its loose-fitting tailoring is preferred by women who must be free to move as their duties require. For this reason, it is the clothing of choice of air hostesses on Air India. This led to a professional style of draping a sari which is referred to [...] "Air-Hostess style sari". An air hostess style sari is tied in just the same way as a normal sari except that the pleats are held together <b>quite</b> <b>nicely</b> with the help of pins. A bordered sari will be just perfect for an Air-Hostess style drape where the pallu is heavily pleated and pinned on the shoulder. Even the vertical pleats that are tucked at the navel are severely pleated and pressed. Same goes for the pallu pleats that are pinned at the shoulder. To get the perfect [...] "Air-hostess" [...] a complimentary U-shaped blouse that covers the upper body completely is worn which gives a very elegant and formal look. Mastering the [...] "Air-hostess" [...] style drape helps to create the desired impact in a formal setting like an interview or a conference.|$|E
2500|$|Some, like Ali, {{argue that}} the overall {{condition}} of women {{who lived in the}} jahiliyya improved with the advent of Islam. These scholars cite a general establishment of order and protection provided by the Qur'anic verses, espousing the view that [...] "the position of women was ameliorated to a greater degree by the mission of Muhammad." [...] Nefarious practices of infanticide-particularly that of female newborns-capricious divorces, and unlimited license of polygyny all were social phenomena eradicated by the revelation of Qur'anic verses relating to the question of polygyny. Moulavi Chiragh Ali summarizes this view <b>quite</b> <b>nicely</b> when he states, [...] "The Qur’an gradually improved and elevated the degraded condition of women [...] by curtailing, in the first place, the unlimited number of wives to four...and, in the second place, declaring it impossible to deal equitably with more than one wife even if men ‘would fain to do so,’ and thus virtually abolishing polygamy." [...] Conversely, those of Ahmed's perspective would argue that with the arrival of Qur’anic law came the loss of sexual autonomy for women. In this view, jahiliyya marriage practices, including that of pre-Islamic polygyny, correlated with women's being [...] "active participants, even leaders, {{in a wide range of}} community activities...their autonomy and participation were curtailed with the establishment of Islam, its institution of patrilineal, patriarchal marriage as solely legitimiate, and the social transformation that ensued." [...] An extended discussion of the intersection of feminism and polygyny can be found in later sections of this article; see Muslim Feminism and Polygyny.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 1943, the Japanese {{declared}} Burma {{an independent}} nation. Aung San was appointed War Minister, {{and the army}} was again renamed, {{this time as the}} Burma National Army (BNA). Aung San soon became doubtful about Japanese promises of true independence and of Japan's ability to win the war. As William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim put it: It was not long before Aung San found that what he meant by independence had little relation to what the Japanese were prepared to give—that he had exchanged an old master for an infinitely more tyrannical new one. As one of his leading followers once said to me, [...] "If the British sucked our blood, the Japanese ground our bones!" [...] He became more and more disillusioned with the Japanese, and early in 1943 we got news from Seagrim, a most gallant officer who had remained in the Karen Hills at the ultimate cost of his life, that Aung San's feelings were changing. On 1 August 1944 he was bold enough to speak publicly with contempt of the Japanese brand of independence, and it was clear that, if they did not soon liquidate him, he might prove useful to us. ... At our first interview, Aung San began to take rather a high hand. ... I pointed out that he was in no position to take the line he had. I did not need his forces; I was destroying the Japanese <b>quite</b> <b>nicely</b> without their help, and could continue to do so. I would accept his help and that of his army only on the clear understanding that it implied no recognition of any provisional government. ... The British Government had announced its intention to grant self-government to Burma within the British Commonwealth, and we had better limit our discussion to the best method of throwing the Japanese out of the country as the next step toward self-government.Aung San made plans to organize an uprising in Burma and made contact with the British authorities in India, in cooperation with the Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe. On 27 March 1945, he led the BNA in a revolt against the Japanese occupiers and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese. 27 March came to be commemorated as Resistance Day, until the military regime renamed it [...] "Tatmadaw (Armed Forces) Day".|$|E
