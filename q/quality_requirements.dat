25|$|Psyonix's {{team were}} aware of past {{difficulties}} that they had with Battle-Cars and other racing games with online play and client-side prediction, and the issues that would arise from that with Rocket Leagues fast-paced play style. To solve this, the physics in the game are based on using the Bullet physics engine within the Unreal Engine 3's PhysX engine, which tracks the movement of all the cars and actors, allowing them to periodically re-synchronize the game state across players based on the stored physics states, which enabled players to have quick reactions from their client. At the time of Battle-Cars, Psyonix could not afford a dedicated server network and were forced to rely on individual hosts, {{which could lead to}} poor performance with slow Internet connections. With Rocket League, Psyonix was able to put a dedicated server network in place, writing their own service protocols to interface with Sony's and Valve's online services so as to enable cross-platform play, as well as improving matchmaking capabilities. Psyonix's previous experience in contract work for AAA titles had exposed them to the larger developers' approach to release and quality control, {{and they were able to}} apply those principles and aim for the same level of <b>quality</b> <b>requirements</b> in the final release of Rocket League.|$|E

25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as phthalates that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water <b>quality</b> <b>requirements</b> are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E
500|$|Among {{contemporaneous}} critics, John C. Esposito—an environmentalist and {{affiliate of}} Ralph Nader—wrote the 1970 book Vanishing Air to accuse Muskie of watering down {{the bill and}} adding needless complications to satisfy industry. A 2011 encyclopedia of environmental law judged that the act [...] "was a failure {{but it was the}} first step in federal air pollution control." [...] Calls for greater air pollution regulation in this era culminated with the passage under President Richard Nixon of the 1970 Clean Air Act, which supplanted the Air Quality Act and has been described as the most significant environmental legislation in American history. The 1970 Clean Air Act significantly increased the role of the federal government and, for the first time, imposed air <b>quality</b> <b>requirements</b> on states.|$|E

Occasionally, area closures and restrictions on use, such as prohibition of campfires, are implemented to aid in wildfire prevention. Following severe fires, area closures may be put in place to protect the public from risks such as falling trees and landslides. Proactive fire management strategies include prescribed burns and mechanical reduction of fuel levels.

The basic premise of the research is that the handling <b>qualities</b> <b>requirements</b> and prescribed maneuvers from ADS‐ 33 E‐PRF document can be modified to suit an autogiro. Inverse simulation is proposed as a preliminary tool in designing autogiro maneuvers. A high fidelity, individual blade/blade element coupled rotor‐fuselage mathematical model of an autogiro is developed and successfully coupled with a generic inverse simulation algorithm to form an inverse simulation package. Two test maneuvers, slalom and acceleration‐deceleration, were performed during flight test trials of a fully instrumented Montgomerie‐Parsons research autogiro. This paper documents the results on autogiro handling qualities assessment based on subjective pilot comments. In conclusion, levels of handling qualities are defined for roll attitude quickness and pilot attack criteria for the autogiro slalom maneuver...|$|R
