It can be achieved when both the service consumer and service provider understand the exchanged <b>data</b> <b>message</b> in the same way. Therefore, the specification of the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> needs to be explicitly defined in the service specification. Six requirements for specifying the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> are formulated based on the data modeling approach. DEMO is selected to be the methodology for representing the semantics of <b>data</b> <b>message.</b> Since one of the requirements is not completely fulfilled by DEMO; DEMO is extended by using ORM.

40|$|Abstract—For {{multimedia}} <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions in wire-less multihop networks {{composed of}} wireless links with lower throughput, transmission capacity is reserved in wireless links included {{in one of}} wireless multihop transmission routes from a source node Ns to a destination node Nd. For reservation of transmission capacity required for applications, a method for achieving the maximum <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow from N s to Nd is required. For wired multihop networks, the labeling method has been proposed. However, in wireless multihop networks, since message transmission between neighbor nodes is realized by broadcast transmission of wireless signal, capacity of a wireless link is effected by <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions by neighbor nodes due to the hidden-terminal and exposed-terminal problems. Thus, this paper proposes an extended labeling method based on a novel wireless network model for the maximum <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow in wireless multihop networks and according to novel conditions for a wireless multihop transmission route {{to increase the amount}} of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> flow from Ns to Nd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In {{wireless}} sensor networks, sensor <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> {{are required}} to be transmitted along a wireless multihop transmission route with shorter delay. For avoidance of corruption of sensor <b>data</b> <b>messages,</b> the RTS/CTS control is introduced in wireless LAN protocols which solves the hidden terminal problem among 2 -hop neighbor wireless nodes. However, it causes additional transmission delay and various methods have been proposed to apply the RTS/CTS control conditionally. This paper proposes introduction of directional intermediate sensor nodes distributed sparsely in the sensor networks. Directional sensor nodes with directional antennas for space-division multiplexing reduces interferences among sensor nodes. It results in conditional omissions of the RTS/CTS control without collisions of <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions among 1 - and 2 -hop neighbor nodes. Thus, it is expected for sensor <b>data</b> <b>message</b> transmissions to reduce transmission delay without additional losses of them. ...|$|R

Weather stations transmitting to NEWA via RainwiseNet {{have access to}} Rainwise features including graphing weather parameters and frost alarms. Sensatronics modem-connected stations were phased out saving $ 1500 in operating costs, but leaving poor coverage in the Keuka Lake vineyard region. NEWA is funded largely through fees from expansion networks in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Vermont. Pennsylvania joined in 2013. NEWA now has 249 station locations. In 2013, Rainwise AgroMET weather stations were improved to allow for plug-in of additional sensors and cellular modem communications. In NY, 11 presentations on NEWA were given, reaching over 1, 000 people. The apple thinning and irrigation models were implemented in NEWA and this has greatly increased interest from apple growers to get weather instruments connected to NEWA. <b>Data</b> <b>quality</b> control <b>messaging</b> was implemented to alert people about station outages longer than 24 -hours...|$|R

In that protocol, although the fixed reservation overhead is avoidable, a data terminal that transmits a <b>data</b> <b>message</b> with multiple packets has to reserve a slot for eachpacket transmission. In this paper, to improve the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay without degrading the voice packet loss probability, we propose the DRMA with multiple slots reservation as the proposed- 1 DRMA. We also propose the DRMA with multiple slots reservation and retransmission algorithm using exponential backoff scheme as the proposed- 2 DRMA to further improve the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay. By the performance evaluation using computer simulations, weshow that the proposed schemes reduce the <b>data</b> <b>message</b> delay without degrading the voice packet loss probability comparing to the conventional DRMA. 1.

If the modified protocol is used to route a sequence of <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> from a source to a destination, then these messages will be uniformly distributed over all k-monotonic paths from the source to the destination, i. e., over all paths whose distance to the destination never increases at each hop, and may remain constant in at most k hops.

30|$|All {{protocols}} {{considered in}} this evaluation require {{that a certain}} overhead is added into beacons or <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> in order to guarantee their proper functioning.

In particular, AMD also includes a small variable list in <b>data</b> <b>messages</b> to guarantee that the order of rebroadcast in the neighborhood is achieved. Therefore, in this last section, we measure the message overhead required by these two protocols when increasing network densities are considered.|$|R
