5|$|Napoleon {{was hoping}} that the Allied forces would attack, and to {{encourage}} them, he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> the forthcoming battle. He shrugged off their suggestion of retreat.|$|E
5|$|Musically speaking, Hate {{is notable}} for its stripped-down, {{straightforward}} approach {{and the use}} of a drum machine, the latter sparking some controversy. Lamounier claimed to have no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> using this device, on the basis that most death metal drummers use trigger pads for recording purposes, which in the end produces the same homogenized sound as that of a drum machine.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> perpetuating an injustice to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E

6000|$|Arrived a primrose-brocade beau, with ruffles, and his hat {{under his}} arm: about twelve years old. Walking statelily, without a qualm {{up the steep}} twist of the street. Or perhaps so perfect in his self-consciousness that it became an elegant [...] "aplomb" [...] in him. He was a genuine {{eighteenth-century}} exquisite, rather stiffer than the French, maybe, but completely in the spirit. Curious, curious children! They had a certain stand-offish superbness, {{and not a single}} trace of misgiving. For them, their [...] "noblesse" [...] was indisputable. For {{the first time in my}} life I recognized the true cold superbness of the old [...] "noblesse". They had not a single <b>qualm</b> <b>about</b> their own perfect representing of the higher order of being.|$|R
5|$|The riots {{revealed}} that the Anglican gentry of Birmingham were not averse to using violence against Dissenters whom they viewed as potential revolutionaries. They had no <b>qualms,</b> either, <b>about</b> raising a potentially uncontrollable mob. Many of those attacked left Birmingham; as a result, the town became noticeably more conservative after the riots. The remaining supporters of the French Revolution decided not to hold a dinner celebrating the storming of the Bastille the next year.|$|R
25|$|Critical {{reception}} for Spirit Detective has been mostly unfavorable. While separate reviewers {{had their own}} <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> the game, nearly all complained of monotonous gameplay and boring visuals.|$|E

25|$|While Zuse {{never became}} a member of the Nazi Party, he is not known to have {{expressed}} any doubts or <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a Faustian bargain, or not pursuing their line of work at all.|$|E

At first our hero had some <b>qualms</b> of conscience <b>about</b> it, but on reflecting {{that on the}} part of the tribe to which he belonged it was a war of self-defence, his conscience was pacified.|$|R
5000|$|Glaum's {{performance}} as the [...] "vampish" [...] Renault drew extensive coverage. One reviewer called it [...] "one of the most perfect vampire characterizations" [...] ever given in a motion picture.

25|$|The RSS {{established}} {{a number of}} affiliate organisations after Indian Independence to carry its ideology to {{various parts of the}} society. Prominent among them is the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP, World Hindu Council), set up in 1964 with the objective of protecting and promoting the Hindu religion. Being an explicitly religious organisation, the VHP had no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> using a Hindutva ideology, which came to mean in its hands political Hinduism and Hindu militancy.|$|E
25|$|In Bunker's work, {{there is}} often an element of envy and disdain towards the normal people who live outside of this circle and hypocritically ensure that those caught in it have no way out. Most of Bunker's {{characters}} have no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> stealing or brutalizing others and, as a rule, they prefer {{a life of crime}} over an honest job, in great part because the only honest career options are badly paying and low-class jobs in retail or manual labor.|$|E
25|$|Loss of steamboats by collision, fire, or river {{obstacles}} (snags) {{was well}} understood, but boiler explosions seemed arbitrary and mysterious. Immediately {{after the loss}} of the Lucy Walker, many newspapers began to speculate on the cause or causes of the explosion. One paper opined that a faulty force pump and low water level in the boiler was the cause. Another newspaper reported <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> reckless behavior of the boat's officers or shoddy construction of the boilers. Later there was speculation that steamboat racing might have contributed to the disaster.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, he did {{not survive}} the {{transition}} from awkward adolescent to adult, ending his career unbilled as a troubled teen in Blackboard Jungle. Luckily, Teddy played it smart, and found a vocation, graduating from chiropractic school in 1958. Long married to wife Rita, {{with whom he had}} two sons, he has had no <b>qualms</b> or regrets <b>about</b> leaving show business. Until his death in Thousand Oaks on May 12, 2007, he attended nostalgia conventions.|$|R
25|$|This led to {{frequent}} power-struggles within the organization, {{and ultimately the}} Baroness and Major Bludd enacted a plot to assassinate the Commander, and seize control of Cobra. In a twist of fate, the conspirators recruited Billy {{to carry out the}} assassination, but he was intercepted by Destro. Cobra Commander had no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> torturing his own son to unearth the conspiracy, yet Billy refused to surrender who had sponsored the hit. Storm Shadow later freed Billy, and they both escaped to New York, where Storm Shadow trained him in ninjitsu. Billy was later caught in the crossfire between the Soft Master and Cobra agent Scrap-Iron, resulting in an explosion which seemingly killed Billy and several others.|$|E
25|$|Ben appears {{far less}} {{competent}} when he agrees to {{a green card}} marriage with his British co-worker Sara. He had just given up on his search for the perfect girl, {{who happens to be}} independently wealthy, enjoys mixed martial arts, and reads Sue Grafton novels. Once married, Ben immediately meets Cassidy while chasing a soul, and she fits every criteria for his perfect girl. Sara, far crueler and more shrewd than she initially lets on, forbids Ben to see Cassidy, though she has no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> her own extramarital affairs that she keeps secret from Ben. Ben is eventually able to negotiate a compromise with Sara after discovering she is pregnant with her married boyfriend Esteban's child.|$|E
25|$|Merrick surmises that a cloning defect was {{responsible}} for Lincoln's memories and behavior, resulting in him and every future clone generation to question their environment and even tap into their sponsor's memories. To prevent this, he decides to eliminate the four newest generations of clones. Lincoln and Jordan, however, plan to liberate their fellow clones. Posing as Tom, Lincoln returns to the compound (allegedly {{to have a new}} clone created) to destroy the holographic projectors that conceal the outside world. Jordan allows herself to be caught to assist Lincoln's plan. Laurent, who has moral <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> the clones' treatment after witnessing their fight for survival and learning that Sarah Jordan may not survive even with the organ transplants, helps Jordan. Lincoln kills Merrick and the clones are freed, seeing the outside world for the first time. Lincoln and Jordan sail away in a boat together.|$|E
60|$|In {{those days}} I {{had never even}} heard of Treviranus' 'Biologie.' However, I had studied Lamarck attentively and I had read the 'Vestiges' with due care; but neither of them afforded me any good ground for {{changing}} my negative and critical attitude. As for the 'Vestiges,' I confess that the book simply irritated me by the prodigious ignorance and thoroughly unscientific habit of mind manifested by the writer. If it had any influence on me at all, it set me against Evolution; and the only review I ever have <b>qualms</b> of conscience <b>about,</b> on the ground of needless savagery, is one I wrote on the 'Vestiges' while under that influence.|$|R

We are the fiddlers, and play our tunes only; you are the showman." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Collun later {{claimed that}} he had <b>qualms</b> of {{conscience}} <b>about</b> the plot, which led him to ask Fr. Holt whether the assassination was morally justified; according to his account Holt {{told him that it}} was a meritorious act, and gave him absolution for the sin of murder. This may well be true: Holt sincerely believed that Elizabeth deserved to die, as apparently did [...] "Captain Jacques", who is known to have said that [...] "no action could be more glorious" [...] (although Jacques himself had once worked as a spy for Elizabeth). Other would-be assassins, like Edmund York, said that Holt had given them absolution for the same act. Holt's plotting attracted so much notoriety that he was eventually ordered by his superiors to show more discretion.|$|R
25|$|The Saint {{starring}} Val Kilmer {{was made}} in 1997 but diverged far from the Charteris books, although it did revive Templar's use of aliases. Kilmer's Saint is unable to defeat a Russian gangster in hand-to-hand combat and is forced to flee; {{this would have been}} unthinkable in a Charteris tale. Whereas the original Saint resorted to aliases that had the initials S.T., Kilmer's character used Christian saints, regardless of initials. This Saint refrained from killing, and even the main villains live to stand trial, whereas Charteris's version had no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> taking another life. Kilmer's Saint is presented as a master of disguise, but Charteris's version hardly used the sophisticated ones shown in this film. The film mirrored aspects of Charteris's own life, notably his origins in the Far East, though not in an orphanage as the film portrayed. Sir Roger Moore features throughout in cameo as the BBC Newsreader heard in Simon Templar's Volvo.|$|E
500|$|As {{teenagers}} {{were among}} the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) [...] "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s". The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of [...] "kids us them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down." [...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while {{it was fun to}} drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E
500|$|Dow worked fervently {{on behalf}} of Whig {{candidates}} and came to detest Democrats as {{the tools of the}} alcohol industry. Maine's Whig governor, Edward Kent, granted Dow a colonel's commission in the state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself [...] "a party man in the politician's understanding of the term," [...] and had no <b>qualms</b> <b>about</b> encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.|$|E
40|$|Parental {{satisfaction}} {{is critical to}} the politics of school reform. Many charter school advocates have no <b>qualms</b> in talking <b>about</b> a charter school move-ment, linking charter schools to a larger political effort to reform the system of education in the United States. If this movement is to have traction, par-ents who are satisfied with their children’s schools represent a potential pool of supporters for further expansion of charter schools and choice in general. In contrast, if charter school parents are not satisfied with their schools, then a foundation for the movement is missing. In this article, using data from a four-wave panel study of parents in Washington, DC, with children in the traditional public schools and in the growing charter school sector, we ex-plore the effect of charter school enrollment on satisfaction...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was born}} an Englishman {{as well as}} any of you. Though labouring under civil disabilities, as a Dissenter, I have long contributed my share to the support of government, and {{supposed}} I had the protection of its constitution and laws for my inheritance.

For then, as you have seen in my case, without any form of trial whatever, without any intimation of your crime, or of your danger, your houses and all your property may be destroyed, and you may not have the good fortune to escape with life, as I have done....What are the old French Lettres de Cachet, or the horrors of the late demolished Bastile, compared to this?

50|$|Days {{before any}} actual fighting, Napoleon had given an {{impression}} to the Allies that his army {{was in a}} weak state and that he desired a negotiated peace. In reality, he was hoping that they would attack, and to encourage them on this mission he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November, Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters and they informed him of their <b>qualms</b> and fears <b>about</b> the upcoming battle, even suggesting a retreat, but he shrugged off their complaints and went to work. Napoleon's plan envisioned that the Allies would throw so many troops to envelop his right flank that their centre would be severely weakened. He then counted on a massive French thrust, to be conducted by 16,000 troops of Soult's IV Corps, through the centre to cripple the Allied army. Meanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout's III Corps to force march {{all the way from}} Vienna and join General Legrand's men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heavy part of the Allied attack. Davout's soldiers had 48 hours to March 110 km. Their arrival would be extremely crucial in determining {{the success or failure of}} the French plan. The Imperial Guard and Bernadotte's I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under Lannes guarded the northern sector of the battle.|$|R
