5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data <b>Questionnaire,</b> which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE <b>questionnaire.</b> It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening <b>questionnaire</b> developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE <b>questionnaire,</b> it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT <b>questionnaire</b> but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E
5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point <b>questionnaire</b> that he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's <b>questionnaire</b> remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{in order}} to aid in future studies, {{confidence}} <b>questionnaires</b> and face and content validity <b>questionnaires</b> were collected. The confidence <b>questionnaires</b> were collected following preparation, training, and testing. These <b>questionnaires</b> measured the participant's confidence in diagnosing emergency pathologies using bedside ultrasound. The <b>questionnaires</b> used a 5 -point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]extremely unconfident, 3 [*]=[*]neutral, 5 [*]=[*]extremely confident). <b>Questionnaires</b> regarding the simulators' face and content validity were collected from participants following testing. Face and content validity <b>questionnaires</b> used questions similar to those described by Weidenbach et al. [10] to gauge the participants' views on the realism of the PoCUS simulator and how effective it was in teaching proper PoCUS diagnostic technique. These <b>questionnaires</b> also employed a 5 -point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]not at all, 3 [*]=[*]neutral, 5 [*]=[*]very much).|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{importance}} {{of quality of}} life (QOL) as an endpoint {{and the use of}} validated QOL <b>questionnaires</b> has increased over time. OBJECTIVE OF OVERVIEW: To evaluate health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measurement instruments used in patients in otorhinolaryngology (ORL). We aim to establish the use of QOL <b>questionnaires</b> in ORL over a period of time, establish the use of QOL <b>questionnaires</b> within different domains and determine the use of validated QOL <b>questionnaires.</b> SEARCH STRATEGY AND EVALUATION METHOD: We performed a comprehensive search in PubMed up to January 1 (st), 2014. Articles were included that measured HR-QOL <b>questionnaires</b> in clinical practice in children, adolescents or adults in 42 journals of ORL. Multiple unique QOL <b>questionnaires,</b> organized according to domain, time, and survey of validation were extracted from reported articles. RESULTS: Out of 2442 articles, we utilized 1196 publications with a total of 2103 QOL <b>questionnaires</b> regarding ORL. We evaluated a variety of 363 unique QOL <b>questionnaires</b> in which 60 % (n= 220) QOL <b>questionnaires</b> had been validated. We found a continuing increase in the amount of articles which used QOL <b>questionnaires</b> {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century while the percentage of validated QOL <b>questionnaires</b> remained the same (76 %). Most QOL <b>questionnaires</b> were used in the domains oncology (35 %), otology (21 %) and rhinology (20 %). The domain otology had the largest amount of unique QOL <b>questionnaires</b> (n= 122). CONCLUSIONS: We identified and evaluated all unique HR-QOL <b>questionnaires</b> utilized inpatients in ORL. Recently, the use of validated and non-validated HR-QOL <b>questionnaires</b> has increased within all domains of ORL. The assessment of QOL has become an important outcome measure in clinical practice, in medical research and for health care organizations. This article is protected by copyright.

This paper describes a selection of FHS <b>questionnaires</b> in more detail; issues concerning the inclusion of Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) items, choices in target populations and the distinction between oropharyngeal versus esophageal dysphagia will be discussed. Recommendations are made about the evaluation and use of FHS <b>questionnaires</b> in daily clinical practice. In particular the psychometric properties of FHS <b>questionnaires</b> should be evaluated to determine if they meet quality criteria for measurement properties of health status <b>questionnaires</b> in order to guarantee valid and reliable outcome measurements...|$|R

Attributional style has been assessed by the Attributional Style <b>Questionnaire,</b> the Expanded Attributional Style <b>Questionnaire,</b> the Attributions <b>Questionnaire,</b> the Real Events Attributional Style <b>Questionnaire</b> and the Attributional Style Assessment Test.|$|E

25|$|The CAGE <b>questionnaire,</b> {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The <b>questionnaire</b> takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE <b>questionnaire</b> does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE <b>questionnaire</b> is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE <b>questionnaire</b> have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E
