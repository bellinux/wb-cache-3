500|$|The first ballot on Tuesday morning, June 8, saw {{two major}} {{breaks in the}} voting. Massachusetts {{switched}} their twenty-one votes from Senator George Edmunds to John Sherman, spiking his total to 116, the highest thus far. William Chandler also convinced three Minnesota delegates to switch their support from their [...] "favorite son" [...] candidate, William Windom, to James G. Blaine. By the thirty-second ballot, Blaine had dropped six votes from the night before, and Grant had increased his total to 309. Despite the relatively small changes in votes totals Roscoe Conkling confidently claimed that the [...] "embers of the N.Y. Delegation assert that Grant will be nominated before one o'clock." [...] On the thirty-third ballot, nine Wisconsin delegates shifted their support from Grant to Elihu Washburne. On the next ballot, sixteen of twenty Wisconsin delegates changed their vote to James Garfield. Garfield immediately called to chairman Hoar to raise a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> Garfield [...] "challenge the correctness of the announcement", claiming that without his consent, {{he should not be}} receiving votes. Hoar dismissed Garfield's question, claiming later that he denied Garfield because {{he did not want to}} see a presidency be undone by a simple point of order, meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy. After the ballot, the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant, 275 for Blaine, 107 for Sherman, and 17 for Garfield. In the thirty-fifth ballot, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana announced that his state would shift all twenty-seven of its votes (mostly coming from the Blaine column) to Garfield. Four Maryland delegates and one delegate each from Mississippi and North Carolina also switched their vote to Garfield, bringing his total to 50.|$|E

5000|$|The {{starting}} point for Bohm's articulation of what he means by a [...] "new order in physics" [...] is his notion of wholeness. Thus crucial for understanding the holomovement is his notion of how interconnected phenomena are woven together in an underlying unified fabric of physical law. In the following section, called [...] "Law in the Holomovement", he takes up the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> {{and the laws of}} organization which relate the parts {{to each other and to}} the whole. This is what he calls the [...] "law of the whole", or holonomy. Rather than starting with the parts and explaining the whole in terms of the parts, Bohm's point of view is just the opposite: he starts with a notion of undivided wholeness and derives the parts as abstractions from the whole. The essential point is that the implicate order and the holomovement imply a way of looking at reality not merely in terms of external interactions between things, but in terms of the internal (enfolded) relationships among things: [...] "The relationships constituting the fundamental law are between the enfolded structures that interweave and inter-penetrate each other, through the whole of space, rather than between the abstracted and separated forms that are manifest to the senses (and to our instruments)" [...] (185).|$|E

40|$|Despite its {{frequent}} {{appearances in}} sociological textbooks, dictionaries and theoretical opuses, ethnomethodology {{is still one}} of the most misunderstood and undervalued domains of sociological inquiry. This is particularly evident in the case of the central sociological question: social order. Harold Garfinkel, the founder of ethnomethodology, provided a unique answer to the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> His answer emphasized a contingent, situated character of constitutive practices of local order production. Initially a response to Talcott Parsons ’ question about the conditions of the stability of social order, Gar-finkel’s conception of constitutive order was later radicalized and used as the foundation of the programme of empirical ethnomethodological studies. To properly understand the radical character of the conception and programme, it is necessary to reveal the core elements of it and to separate them from the historically changed components...|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of contemporary films are now using narrative models that allow several adaptations on digital and interactive operating systems. This trend is seen in films such as Memento by Christopher Nolan (2000), Irréversible by Gaspar Noé (2002) and Smoking / No Smoking by Alain Resnais (1993), concerning the chronological organization of their narrative parts – here it is a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> Or in films such as Elephant by Gus Van Sant (2003), Groundhog Day by Harold Ramis, 1993 and Rashômon by Akira Kurosawa (1950), for the diegetic repetition – a question of frequency. Or even, in films such as Magnolia by Paul Thomas Anderson (1999) and Short Cuts by Robert Altman, 1993 which use the idea of expansion or compression of the narrative – a question of simultaneity.

40|$|The {{thesis of}} the present work is that {{throughout}} the modern era the dominant corpus of scientific ideas, as articulated around key machine technologies, has been reflected in the contemporary theories and practices of warfare in the Western world. Over the period covered by this thesis - from the ascendancy of the scientific worldview in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth}} centuries to present day - an ever more intimate symbiosis between science and warfare has established itself with the increasing reliance on the development and integration of technology within complex social assemblages of war. This extensive deployment of scientific ideas and methodologies in the military realm allows us to speak of the constitution and perpetuation of a scientific way of warfare. There are however within the scientific way of warfare significant variations in the theories and practices of warfare according to the prevalence of certain scientific ideas and technological apparatuses in given periods of the modern era. The four distinctive regimes I thereupon distinguish are those of mechanistic, thermodynamic, cybernetic, and chaoplexic warfare. Each of these regimes is characterised by a differing approach to the central <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> and chaos in war, on which hinge the related issues of centralisation and decentralisation, predictability and control...|$|E
40|$|The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> is problematical {{from two}} main points of view: the former {{concerning}} its origin {{and the latter}} dealing with the relation between order and its dialectic opposite, the disorder. Bernhard Waldenfels offers us valuable theoretical means to recast the conceptual galaxy of order and its epistemology: relating to the phenomenological lesson about the paradox of foundation and going into the investigation of “threshold” phenomenons, he suggests to overcome all the metaphysical dualisms in a responsive perspective. This means not only {{that it does not}} exist a cosmos set against the chaos (like the Greek cosmology conveys), but neither just relative orders, contractually established and inseparable from as many relative disorders (like Modern philosophy conceived). These conceptions forget the diachronic phase shift of ordering, reducing it to its description; in this way order becomes a totality, and from totality to totalitarianism or universalism is an even too short step. Rather, the responsive perspective means that ordering is a spurious foundation (Stiftung) and disorder is not another, outside, world. Both what exists having a certain consistence and what at the same time threatens that consistence belong inviolably to the same order, which is inviolable exactly because it is an unique order...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this work was to discuss the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> from the {{standpoint}} of Eric Voegelin. (Political) order is not understood as an artificial man-made construct, but as an intelligible structure of the whole, which is to be attuned to. Disastrous experiences of the last century led Voegelin to the attempt at rediscovery of the science of order: politiké epistemé. To this end he pursued a detailed study concerning history, i. e. the subject in which he hoped to find structures of order and, in particular, the experience of order in soul of man. Therefore it is possible -in his view- to reflect on political order adequately only after we have attended to philosophical anthropology which should facilitate the detection of constants of human nature. These appear against a background of unexceeded tension between poles of God and man. In the first chapter of the main part, I discuss the relationship between the human and transcendent pole and I try to clarify Voegelin's conception of metaxy (also participation of the human on the transcendent pole). In the following chapter, I pursue the theoretical and pragmatic consequences arising for the political order, whose goal is the preservation of man, society, and good life. The result is the admission of both pragmatic and spiritual order. The third part [...] ...|$|E
