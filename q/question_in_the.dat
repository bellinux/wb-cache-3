5|$|Another <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{case was}} whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had {{jurisdiction}} to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction. The opinion affirmed the state court of appeals' assertion that an elective office was not property. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion.|$|E

30|$|Contact Questions: Participants {{submitted}} {{a total of}} 4 answers to challenge <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contact theme. <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contact theme {{are likely to be}} known to friends and colleagues.

5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the cityâ€”a <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original version of Trivial Pursuit {{noted that the}} city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

30|$|Favourite Questions: Participants {{submitted}} {{a total of}} 2 answers to challenge <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favourite theme. <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favourite theme are widely used for credential recovery by email providers and banks. Although, an earlier empirical study [20] indicates that favourite questions are vulnerable to guessing, however, our findings indicate that <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> favourite theme were resistant to an informed guessing attack.|$|R

5|$|The <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 referendum, in {{an attempt}} to build a broad coalition, had sought only the {{authority}} to negotiate sovereignty with the Canadian government, and promised a second referendum to ratify the results of any negotiation. Parizeau believed a second referendum was unnecessary and would only encourage the remainder of Canada to use delaying tactics. The draft initial Act featured a question only asking for the authority to declare Quebec sovereign.|$|E
5|$|The <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{case was}} whether Al-Kateb's {{continued}} detention was lawful. That question involved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of}} the Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
50|$|This sort of {{a process}} where elected representatives ask {{questions}} that are replied by the Prime Minister or other government ministers is part of parliamentary tradition in many other countries. <b>The</b> <b>Question</b> Hour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indian Parliament is similar to <b>the</b> Prime Minister's <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, <b>the</b> First Minister's <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, <b>the</b> <b>Question</b> Period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> federal Parliament and provincial legislatures of Canada and <b>the</b> <b>Question</b> Time <b>in</b> Australia and New Zealand.|$|R
30|$|Using the {{equality}} algorithm, <b>the</b> challenge <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contact theme were reported with poor effectiveness and received 9 (83 %) unmatched answers, which indicates a sharp decrease <b>in</b> effectiveness. <b>Questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contact theme were also reported with poor efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preceding Section.|$|R
30|$|To {{conclude}} this section, informed guessing {{by friends}} and colleagues was not highly successful and participants could not authenticate. However, <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public, friends and colleague domain were vulnerable to guessing. The abuse case scenario is discussed below to examine challenge <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> individual themes.|$|R
