5|$|As a landlord, Coke was a {{firm believer}} in the right and moral {{obligation}} of a landowner to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> those living on his estates. The roles of landlord and tenant were clearly set out by the late 18th century; the landlord was to provide fields, roads and buildings, while the tenant would provide the seed, implements and manual labour. Coke's estate included 54 farms when he inherited it, with excellent farm output. There were, however, significant debts {{as a result of his}} uncle's work on Holkham Hall, with the interest alone being £4,000 a year. He had some difficulties dealing with the people employed before he inherited the estates, and when the steward Ralph Cauldwell, appointed by Coke's uncle, retired in 1782, Coke failed to replace him until 1816. This replacement was Francis Blaikie, a Scottish man who had previously been employed as estate steward for Lord Chesterfield. Blaikie paid close attention to where farms were doing badly or could do better, but often struggled to deal with Coke. Coke lacked financial sense in matters other than the agricultural, on one occasion selling all his land near Manchester. It wasn't until 20 years later that Blaikie became aware of this, after receiving a query from the new owners about the mineral rights. Blaikie travelled to Manchester to meet the solicitor who had handled the sale, finding not only poorly drafted conveyances but that all the sold land had been rich in coal.|$|E

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> ordinary citizens {{and resulted in}} increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized {{by the government in}} order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E

40|$|Mona Eklund Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden Background: Findings from <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{studies are}} often {{inconclusive}} for reasons such as: i) estimates may address different aspects <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and thus produce different outcomes; ii) <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is largely determined by self-factors; and iii) {{people with a}} long-term condition rate their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> better than those who have had their condition for a short duration. This makes <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> a complex phenomenon to measure. Aims: The above explanations served as hypotheses for this methodologically oriented paper, based on a longitudinal study on women with stress-related disorders receiving work rehabilitation. Methods: Eighty-four women participating in a lifestyle intervention or care as usual were compared. Self-ratings <b>of</b> “general <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life” and a summarized “satisfaction with different life domains” index (according to Manchester Short Assessment <b>of</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life)</b> and two self-factors (self-esteem and self-mastery) were administered at admission and a 6 -month follow-up. Participant age and amount of months on sick leave prior to rehabilitation were used as two proxies of duration of the condition. Results: General <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> distinguished between the groups, whereas satisfaction with life domains did not. Self-esteem and self-mastery were related to both <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> aspects. Age was related to both estimates <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> whereas duration <b>of</b> sick leave was unrelated to both.
