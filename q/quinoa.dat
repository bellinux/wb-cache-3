25|$|Some species, such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea) or {{forms of}} beet (Beta vulgaris) (beetroot, chard), {{are used as}} vegetables. Forms of Beta vulgaris include fodder beet (Mangelwurzel) and sugar beet. The seeds of Amaranthus, lamb's {{quarters}} (Chenopodium berlandieri), <b>quinoa</b> (Chenopodium <b>quinoa)</b> and kañiwa (Chenopodium pallidicaule) are edible and are used as pseudocereals.|$|E

25|$|Potato was domesticated near lake Titicaca between 8000 and 5000 BC, <b>quinoa</b> some 3000–4000 {{years ago}} and {{production}} of copper began in 2000 BC. Llama, alpaca and vicuña were domesticated and used for transport, food and clothing.|$|E
25|$|This {{region is}} {{regarded}} as perhaps the one most influenced by Native Americans, and its foods are {{closely linked to the}} Andean-Incan tradition. When preparing regional dishes, potatoes and corn or wheat are almost always used, including <b>quinoa</b> (a cereal typically used in Incan cuisine), peppers, squashes and tomatoes. The most celebrated dishes are humita and tamal, in which the corn husk is stuffed with the corn filling itself, seasonings or meat.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the species}} {{cultivated}} by Indians for food are today considered undesirable weeds. Another name for marshelder is sumpweed; chenopods are derisively called pigweed, although one South American species with a more attractive name, <b>quinoa,</b> is a health food store favorite. Many plants considered weeds are the colonizers of disturbed soil, the first fast-growing weeds to spring up when a natural or man-made event, such as a fire, leaves a bare patch of soil.|$|E
25|$|Early {{inhabitants}} of the Americas developed agriculture, developing and breeding maize (corn) from ears 2–5cm in length to the current size are familiar today. Potatoes, tomatoes, tomatillos (a husked green tomato), pumpkins, chili peppers, squash, beans, pineapple, sweet potatoes, the grains <b>quinoa</b> and amaranth, cocoa beans, vanilla, onion, peanuts, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, papaya, and avocados were among other plants grown by natives. Over two-thirds {{of all types of}} food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas.|$|E
25|$|In the Sierra, people {{cultivated}} locally developed crops, including potatoes, <b>quinoa,</b> and tarwi. They also farmed {{crops that}} {{originated in the}} coastal regions and in the North, including ají, peanuts, beans, and maize. Animal husbandry kept pace with agricultural development, with the domestication of the local animals llama, alpaca, and the guinea pig, {{as well as the}} coastal Muscovy duck. The domestication of camelids during this period laid the basis for the pastoral tradition that continues to this day.|$|E
25|$|Soy {{beans and}} <b>quinoa</b> {{are known as}} {{complete}} proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements. Mangels et al. write that consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8g/kg body weight) {{in the form of}} soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. In 2012 the United States Department of Agriculture ruled that soy protein (tofu) may replace meat protein in the National School Lunch Program.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, FLO {{launched}} for {{the first}} time an International Fairtrade Certification Mark. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade, and simplify procedures for both producers and importers. At present, the certification mark is used in over 50 countries and on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, tea, rice, bananas, mangoes, cocoa, cotton, sugar, honey, fruit juices, nuts, fresh fruit, <b>quinoa,</b> herbs and spices, wine, footballs, etc.|$|E
25|$|Proteins are {{composed}} of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as <b>quinoa</b> (pronounced keenwa), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure a}} {{subsistence}} economy, the Muisca irrigated their lands and varied their cultivation over different climatic zones. The {{geography of the}} area allowed for micro-ecological regions providing farmlands on the fertile plains and in higher altitude terrains such as mountain slopes. <b>Quinoa</b> and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) were cultivated on the highest altitudes, maize and coca in the temperate regions and yuca, arracacha, pineapples, tobacco and cotton in the low-lying valleys with a warmer climate. Additionally, Cucurbita maxima, Oxalis tuberosa (oca), peppers and Ullucus tuberosus were cultivated by the Muisca. The surplus of the agricultural production was available for trading on the many markets throughout the Muisca territories.|$|E
25|$|The Fairtrade {{certification}} system covers a growing range of products, including bananas, honey, coffee, oranges, Cocoa bean, cocoa, cotton, dried and {{fresh fruits and}} vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, <b>quinoa,</b> rice, spices, sugar, tea, and wine. Companies offering products that meet the Fairtrade standards may apply for licences {{to use one of}} the Fairtrade Certification Marks for those products. The International Fairtrade Certification Mark was launched in 2002 by FLO, and replaced twelve Marks used by various Fairtrade labelling initiatives. The new Certification Mark is currently used worldwide (with the exception of the United States). The Fair Trade Certified Mark is still used to identify Fairtrade goods in the United States.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{features}} of this trade was the exchange of a great array of domesticated plants and animals between the Old World and the New and vice versa. Some that were introduced to America included wine, wheat, barley, apples, cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, donkeys, and many others. The Old World received from America such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, <b>quinoa,</b> amaranth, chia, agave and so on. The result of these exchanges, known generally as the Columbian Exchange, was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in America, but also that of Europe and Asia.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture was {{the main}} source of income for the Muisca who were {{generally}} self-sustaining due to the fertility of the soils of the Altiplano, especially on the Bogotá savanna. The fertility originates from the lake deposits, the result of the Pleistocene Lake Humboldt that existed until around 30,000 years BP and which remnants are still visible today; the various lakes and wetlands (humedales) of the Altiplano. Other prehistorical and historical lakes were present in the other valleys of the high plateau; the Ubaté-Chiquinquirá Valley, Iraka Valley and the Tenza Valley. When the lakes dried up, they left leveled fertile soils which were used by the Muisca to cultivate a large variety of crops, mainly maize, tubers, beans. <b>quinoa</b> and potatoes. The fertility of the Bogotá savanna was enhanced by the deposition of Neogene volcanic ashes. Fruits were cultivated in Somondoco and Subachoque. The highest population density was related to the richest agricultural lands, mainly on the Bogotá savanna.|$|E

Ingredients include {{proprietary}} formulations of proteins (slow-cooked soy, wheat and pea), organic flours (kamut, amaranth, millet, <b>quinoa),</b> potato starch, modified vegetable gum, organic beet fibers, and carrot fibers.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{recorded}} history, {{the rich}} {{have been able}} to afford a varied diet including meat, vegetables and fruit, but for poor people, meat was a luxury and the food they ate was very dull, typically comprising mainly some staple product made from rice, rye, barley, wheat, millet or maize. The addition of vegetable matter provided some variety to the diet. The staple diet of the Aztecs in Central America was maize and they cultivated tomatoes, avocados, beans, peppers, pumpkins, squashes, peanuts, and amaranth seeds to supplement their tortillas and porridge. [...] In Peru, the Incas subsisted on maize in the lowlands and potatoes at higher altitudes. They also used seeds from <b>quinoa,</b> supplementing their diet with peppers, tomatoes, and avocados.|$|E
500|$|Another {{specialty}} concession area is The Band Box, a [...] outdoor {{restaurant and}} bar {{located on the}} right-center field concourse. The restaurant serves variations on traditional ballpark foods including cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, jalapeño corn fritters, smoked chicken nachos, <b>quinoa</b> chopped salads, and local draft craft beer. Its 150-person bar {{is located on the}} right field concourse. The bar has an adjoining lounge area with couches, televisions, ping pong, cornhole, foosball, and shuffleboard, which is open to all game ticket-holders. Patrons in the adjacent 4-top seating section can order food and drinks from The Band Box and have items delivered to their seats. On June 28, 2016, a 9-hole miniature golf course, called The Country Club at The Band Box, opened behind the restaurant between the bar and Fifth Avenue North. Each of the nine holes exhibits art from different local or regional artists. It is open to game attendees for an additional $5 playing fee.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{argued that}} the development of Chavín social complexities coincided with the cultivation of maize and development of agricultural surpluses. [...] Through an analysis of carbon isotope in the human bones found at Chavín sites, researchers have proved that the diet consisted mainly of C3 foods such as potatoes and <b>quinoa,</b> while maize, a C4 food, was {{not a part of the}} main diet. [...] Potato and <b>quinoa</b> were crops better adapted to the Chavín environment. [...] They are more resistant to the frost and irregular rain fall associated with high-altitude environments. [...] Maize would not have been able to thrive in such conditions.|$|E
2500|$|The suni zone {{rises from}} [...] and is {{suitable}} {{for the production of}} native tubers and grains such as <b>quinoa,</b> kaniwa, and kiwicha. Given the innumerable valleys and micro-climates of the Andes, over the millennia Andean farmers developed over 1,000 varieties of potatoes, as well as other tuber species, such as mashua, ulluco, oca, and achira.|$|E
2500|$|The people domesticated {{camelids}} such as llamas. Camelids {{were used}} for pack animals, for fiber, and for meat. They produced ch'arki, or llama jerky. This product was commonly traded by camelid-herders and was the main economic resource for the Chavín people. [...] Chavín people also successfully cultivated several crops, including potatoes, <b>quinoa,</b> and maize. They developed an irrigation system to assist the growth of these crops.|$|E
2500|$|Triticeae {{gluten-free}} oats (free of wheat, rye or barley) may be {{a useful}} source of cereal fiber. Some wheat allergies allow the use of rye bread as a substitute. Rice flour is a commonly used alternative for those allergic to wheat. [...] Wheat-free millet flour, buckwheat, flax seed meal, corn meal, <b>quinoa</b> flour, chia seed flour, tapioca starch or flour, and others {{can be used as}} substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Tiwanaku's {{location}} {{between the}} lake and dry highlands provided key resources of fish, wild birds, plants, and herding grounds for camelids, particularly llamas. Tiwanaku's economy was based on exploiting {{the resources of the}} lake Titicaca, herding of llamas and alpacas and organized farming in raised field systems. Llama meat was consumed and potatoes, <b>quinoa,</b> beans and maize grown. Storage of food was important in the uncertain high altitude climate, so technologies for freeze-dried potatoes and sun-dried meat were developed.|$|E
2500|$|As maize was {{introduced}} to new cultures, new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations. Maize was the staple food, or a major staple [...] along with squash, Andean region potato, <b>quinoa,</b> beans, and amaranth [...] of most pre-Columbian North American, Mesoamerican, South American, and Caribbean cultures. The Mesoamerican civilization, in particular, was deeply interrelated with maize. Its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation [...] from the planting to the food preparation. Maize formed the Mesoamerican people's identity.|$|E
2500|$|In the Sierra, {{the most}} {{important}} groups were the Pasto, the Caras, the Panzaleo, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Palta. They lived on hillsides, terrace farming maize, <b>quinoa,</b> beans, potatoes and squash, and developed systems of irrigation. Their political organization was a dual system: one of chieftains, the other, a land-holding system called curacazgo, that regulated the planting and harvesting of multiple cycles of crops. While some historians have referred to this system as the [...] "Kingdom of Quito", it did not approach the level of political organization of the state.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the earliest civilizations on the Peruvian coast initially relied more upon maritime resources than agriculture during the formative period of their societies. However, as in all ancient civilizations, agriculture was the principal occupation of {{the great majority of}} the people. [...] The greatest contribution of Andean civilization to the modern world has been the plants they domesticated. [...] Crops grown by the Andeans were often unique to the region. Maize, which found its way to the Andes from Mexico, was often the most important crop at lower and intermediate elevations. [...] The Andeans cultivated an estimated 70 different plants, almost as many as were cultivated in all of Europe and Asia. Many of these plants are no longer cultivated, or are minor crops, but important plants which were domesticated in or near the Andes include [...] potatoes, <b>quinoa,</b> tomatoes, chile peppers, cotton, coca, tobacco, pineapples, peanuts, and several varieties of beans.|$|E
2500|$|... {{confirmed}} vegetarian diets {{provide sufficient}} protein intake {{as long as}} a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. [...] Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and <b>quinoa.</b> However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1600 BCE, Maya civilizations were using cacao beans to produce beer, {{long before it}} was used to make the non-alcoholic cocoa common now. Though actual {{production}} methods are unknown, Friar Landa described the process of preparing beverages as involving grinding maize and cacao to a paste before adding liquids and spices. Agriculture was within man's realm in the Mayan world, but food preparation belonged to women and on an ancient ceramic vase, chocolate preparation shows a woman pouring the substance between two vessels to create the highly desired foam favored by the Maya. Pre-Columbian Andean women chewed maize (occasionally using cassava or <b>quinoa)</b> to break down the starch and then spit it out to began fermentation. The resulting drink chicha, is still widely available in Latin America. In the Wari Empire, archaeological evidence has indicated that elite women ran the breweries and that tradition carried forward into Incan society. Throughout the Andean region and Mesoamerica, women were the chief producers of alcoholic beverages. During the 15th century in Peru, women's lives among the Xauxa people of the Upper Mantaro Valley were changed by process of producing chicha. After the Xauxa were conquered by the Inca, women were forced to work harder to produce more alcohol. In Mexico, a female deity, [...] "Mayahuel" [...] was revered among the Aztec for having discovered how to extract agave sap for the manufacture of pulque. After the Spanish invasion, women in Brazil and Mexico, as well as throughout Andean territories became not only producers of alcoholic beverages, but also its main market vendors.|$|E
