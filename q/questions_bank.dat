40|$|Abstract — Mathematics at an {{undergraduate}} level is frequently {{presented to the}} students in quite a traditional way. When implementing the Bologna education reform in Portuguese universities, the number of contact hours of the courses decreased (considerably in some cases), therefore increasing the need of a more self-responsible learning by the student. This means that the student has to work by himself (i. e., outside lectures and examples classes) on a regular basis. In practice this implies that the lecturer is supposed to plan the students work, in principle weekly basis. In this paper we intend to describe an experience made at the Department of Mathematics for Science and Technology of the University of Minho in Portugal. Using an e-learning platform specially designed for teaching Mathematics called Maple T. A., we designed, programmed and made available for the students various sets of exercises organized in Question Banks on the course of Calculus. We also make a comparison of alternative ways to program the questions of a <b>questions</b> <b>bank.</b> The advantage of this platform is that if properly designed, the questions can be always different and with different methods of solving (because {{of the use of}} random variables), the student can do it whenever and wherever he is (he does it via internet) and it feedback is made available to the students as soon as he submits the exercise. At the end of the academic year and with the aim of being able to evaluate how did the students feel about this experience, the students were given a survey implemented on the e-learning platform. The results obtained from this survey strongly suggest, among other things, that using Maple T. A. helped the students {{in the study of the}} course of Calculus, and that it helped to achieve better results on the course...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{number of}} {{institutions}} affiliated {{to a university}} increasing enormously these days, thus demands the preparation of highly distributed, fast, reliable, secured and confidential question papers. Traditional way of question paper generation is time consuming, less efficient and less transparent. This paper aims at an automated question paper preparation in large scale distributed <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> environment. For maintaining security and confidentiality instead of a single faculty preparing the whole question paper, this system allows many faculties to prepare the question papers based on a predefined syllabus copy. From the distributed <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> the <b>questions</b> must be intelligently or randomly selected such that it contains no repetitive questions. Similarly from the <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> we need to prepare question paper based on {{the changes in the}} syllabus. In these applicationsquestion classification plays a major role and a new method is proposed in this paper. This method is based on XML based approach and is to augment the questions with syntactic and semantic analysis knowledge from the predefined syllabus.

40|$|With {{the advent}} in {{computers}} and the Internet, item banking emerged as an effective approach to testing. One of the many responsibilities currently burdening educators is regularly building tests. A <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> can help reduce the workload of constantly developing tests. A carefully constructed <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> renders test building efficient and the evaluation of learning more structured and criteria based. The significance of item banking stems from the increased inclination towards standardization in educational institutions. <b>Question</b> <b>banking</b> is a step towards developing standards for testing, getting reliable data and statistics to evaluate the educational process, and making the necessary educational decisions. For this purpose, {{it is essential that}} educators be conscious of the various options available before launching an item bank so that their choice be sound and based on the advantages, the disadvantages, and the implementation of each option. This study presents three main possibilities to launch an item bank: locally developing a software program and constructing items accordingly, leasing or buying item bank software and locally constructing items to supply it with, or buying a readily made item bank and the accompanying software. Clear guidelines and illustrations are provided to help educators construct well-built <b>question</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R

As far as teaching-learning-evaluation process is concerned, the major task associated with the objective-type examination system is the administration of question paper setting. The lack of expertise and time are the major constraints that are encountered in the task of setting objective type question papers. During retrieval of records from a objective type <b>question</b> <b>bank,</b> redundancy may occur. To solve this problem, an approach needed to retrieve records from a database without redundancy. Approach: The task associated in generating the required collection of questions from a <b>question</b> <b>bank,</b> with minimal redundancy as far as possible in the retrieval of records from the <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> using mid-square and mid-product techniques for random number generation were discussed in this study.

40|$|Computer-assisted testing {{systems are}} {{promising}} in generating tests efficiently and effectively for evaluating a person's skill. This paper develops a novel intelligent testing system for {{both teachers and}} students. Based on the Browser/Server structure, the proposed testing system comprises a <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> and five modules, offering the features of self-adaptation, reliability, and flexibility for generating parallel tests with identical test ability. The core of the developed system is the ant-colony-optimization-based test composition (ACO-TC) method, which aims at generating high-quality tests for examinations and satisfying multiple requirements. As an advanced computational intelligence algorithm, the proposed ACO-TC method uses a colony of ants to select appropriate questions from a <b>question</b> <b>bank</b> to construct solutions. Pheromone and heuristic information is designed for facilitating the ants' selection. The system is analyzed by composing tests in different situations. The generated tests not only match the expected total completion time, the concept proportions, the average difficulty, and the score proportions of different question types, but also have high average discrimination degrees of questions. The experimental results also show that the system can always generate high-quality tests from <b>question</b> <b>banks</b> with various sizes. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R
