5|$|A {{feature-length film}} that {{indirectly}} parodies Star Trek is Galaxy <b>Quest.</b> This film {{is based on}} the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based TV series called Galaxy <b>Quest,</b> modeled heavily on Star Trek, believe that what they are seeing is real. Many Star Trek actors have been quoted saying that Galaxy <b>Quest</b> was a brilliant parody.|$|E
5|$|After its U.S. debut, Final Fantasy Mystic <b>Quest</b> was {{released}} in Japan under the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic <b>Quest.</b> The European release of the game {{was released}} in English, German and French, and had the title changed to Mystic <b>Quest</b> Legend to avoid confusion with Final Fantasy Adventure, which had been released in Europe as Mystic <b>Quest.</b> Final Fantasy Mystic <b>Quest</b> was first unveiled in June at the 1992 Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, where it was a popular venue, and the game was later presented in more detail in the Fall 1992 issue of the Ogopogo Examiner.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Lance Mackey {{became the}} first Yukon <b>Quest</b> rookie to win the race, a feat that was {{repeated}} by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey {{became the first}} to win both the Yukon <b>Quest</b> and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20days, 8hours, and 29minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle {{became the first woman}} to win the race, in 10days, 22hours, and 57minutes. Yukon <b>Quest</b> International, which runs the Yukon <b>Quest</b> sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior <b>Quest</b> and the Yukon <b>Quest</b> 300 (previously the Yukon <b>Quest</b> 250).|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} type of <b>quests</b> in Aion: {{ordinary}} <b>quests,</b> campaign <b>quests</b> and Work Orders. Ordinary <b>quests</b> require the player {{to complete a}} task to receive a reward. Campaign <b>quests</b> are focused on story, and are crucial for player progression. Work Orders are used to increase skill in a chosen profession. Some <b>quests</b> are repeatable. Some <b>quests,</b> especially campaign <b>quests,</b> cannot be shared or abandoned.|$|R
50|$|Game <b>quests</b> were <b>quests</b> {{which had}} nothing to do with {{tutoring}} characters. There were two types of game quests: Events and Normal <b>Quests.</b> Event <b>quests</b> were special <b>quests</b> catered to low level characters which had to do with a particular holiday event.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>quests</b> that players can complete throughout the game. Different types of <b>quests</b> exist, some are party <b>quests,</b> others involve monster hunting, item collecting or other tasks, for instance, skill-based <b>quests</b> like cooking or tailoring.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the Yukon <b>Quest</b> organization operates two shorter races: the Junior Yukon <b>Quest</b> and the Yukon <b>Quest</b> 300. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the <b>Quest</b> 300 was only 250miles and thus known as the <b>Quest</b> 250.|$|E
5|$|Other {{compilations}} of Dragon <b>Quest</b> music {{have been}} released, including Dragon <b>Quest</b> Game Music Super Collection Vol.1. The London Philharmonic performed {{many of the}} soundtracks, including a compilation entitled Symphonic Suite Dragon <b>Quest</b> Complete CD-Box. Some of the soundtracks include a second disc with the original game music, as with the Dragon QuestVI soundtrack. In 2003 SME Visual Works released Symphonic Suite Dragon <b>Quest</b> Complete CD-Box, featuring music from the first seven Dragon <b>Quest</b> games.|$|E
5|$|Rather than a single, {{overarching}} plot, {{the story}} of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main <b>quest</b> arcs, numerous other quests, and a final <b>quest</b> arc. Each main <b>quest</b> arc contains optional side-quests {{in addition to the}} main quests. Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the <b>quest</b> arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even if the other arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main <b>quest</b> arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} story <b>quests,</b> there are {{multiple}} side-quests, offered by re-occurring NPCs. Often, they are simple fetch <b>quests.</b> The rewards of these <b>quests</b> are usually enchanted weapon techniques.|$|R

40|$|Role-playing games (RPG) often contain side <b>quests</b> - shorter <b>quests</b> {{not related}} to the main story, to give the player the feeling of freedom and to let him choose his own path. For this effect to be good, there must be a large number of side <b>quests</b> in the game. Replacing hand-made <b>quests</b> with {{generated}} ones is one of the possibilities to make this task easier, however contemporary attempts at generating <b>quests</b> result in the <b>quests</b> being simple and repetitive. This thesis aims to explore a different approach to the problem, a system generating side <b>quests</b> from a set of hand-crafted building blocks. An abstract design and an implementation are described, along with the methods used for evaluating the implementation. The system was evaluated on a group of players, which rated the generated <b>quests</b> similarly to the hand-picked ones...|$|R
5|$|Similar {{to other}} early main {{games in the}} series, Dragon <b>Quest</b> II was novelized and adapted to game books. The Dragon <b>Quest</b> II Novel was written by Hideo Takayashiki and {{published}} in 1989; it was reprinted in 1991 and 2000. The Dragon <b>Quest</b> II Game Book series was also published in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Junior Yukon <b>Quest,</b> or Junior <b>Quest,</b> is a 135-mile (217km) {{race for}} mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the Yukon <b>Quest,</b> the Junior <b>Quest</b> {{does not change}} {{locations}} and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed {{as an opportunity for}} young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the Yukon <b>Quest</b> and Yukon <b>Quest</b> 300.|$|E
5|$|The Real Adventures of Jonny <b>Quest</b> (also {{known as}} Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures) is an American {{animated}} action-adventure television series produced by Hanna-Barbera and broadcast on Cartoon Network from August 26, 1996 to April 16, 1997. A {{continuation of the}} Jonny <b>Quest</b> (1964) and The New Adventures of Jonny <b>Quest</b> (1986) series, it features teenage adventurers Jonny <b>Quest,</b> Hadji Singh, and Jessie Bannon as they accompany Dr. Benton <b>Quest</b> and bodyguard Race Bannon to investigate strange phenomena, legends, and mysteries in exotic locales. Action also {{takes place in the}} virtual realm of QuestWorld, a three-dimensional cyberspace domain rendered with computer animation. Conceived in the early 1990s, Real Adventures suffered a long and troubled development.|$|E
2500|$|The player {{typically}} must {{complete a}} linear sequence of certain <b>quests</b> {{in order to}} reach the end of the game's story, although <b>quests</b> in some games such as [...] or Geneforge can limit or enable certain choices later in the game. Many RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side-quests and character interactions. <b>Quests</b> of this sort can be found by talking to a non-player character, and there may be no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these <b>quests</b> other than a missed opportunity or reward. <b>Quests</b> may involve defeating one or many enemies, rescuing a non-player character, item fetch <b>quests,</b> or locational puzzles such as mysteriously locked doors.|$|R
5000|$|Monster Hunter {{is played}} through <b>quests</b> {{given to the}} hunter by the Village Elder or the Town Guild. Village <b>Quests</b> can be {{classified}} into four categories: hunting, gathering, capture and event. They are also categorized into different levels, ranging from 1 to 8. Higher level <b>quests</b> become available after <b>quests</b> in the previous level are completed. There are three types of quests: ...|$|R

5|$|The series' monsters, characters, and box art were {{designed}} by Toriyama. The music for the Dragon <b>Quest</b> series was composed by Koichi Sugiyama. In the past, Dragon <b>Quest</b> games have been developed by Chunsoft, Heartbeat, ArtePiazza and, starting with Dragon <b>Quest</b> VIII, Level-5. Horii's company, Armor Project, {{is in charge of}} the Dragon <b>Quest</b> games that were published by Enix and Square Enix.|$|E
5|$|A prequel, Dragon Warrior Monsters (Dragon <b>Quest</b> Monsters: Terry's Wonderland in Japan), was {{released}} in 1998. This game featured Terry and Milly years before the events of Dragon <b>Quest</b> VI. It {{was released}} in North America the next year, even though Dragon <b>Quest</b> VI was never released in North America. Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, reappear, however, their previous roles have been eliminated, making them appear as just normal enemies. Mortamor and Murdaw (DeathMore and Mudou, respectively, in the localization) do appear as very challenging, very late in-game bosses, though.|$|E
5|$|A sequel series, , {{published}} by Square Enix started in 2005 {{and is still}} ongoing; as of December 2012, fifteen volumes have been released. The first four volumes were written by Jun Eishima {{and all the rest}} volumes written by Takashi Umemura. All of them have been supervised by Yuji Horii with artwork done by Kamui Fujiwara. Dragon <b>Quest</b> Retsuden: Roto no Monshō is meant to take place between Dragon <b>Quest</b> III and Dragon <b>Quest.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additional themed <b>quests</b> {{that are}} only {{available}} for {{a limited amount of}} time, such as a week or two, regularly appear. Completion of these <b>quests</b> unlock exclusive buildings not available at any other time. With new <b>quests,</b> new buildings and new collectibles are introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Spellborn {{consisted}} {{largely of}} conventional MMORPG gameplay, {{in which the}} player plays a character (avatar), and explores the gameworld {{in order to gain}} experience points and advance in level. In exploring the gameworld, the player encounters <b>quests,</b> {{the most important part of}} Spellborns gameplay. The game had about a thousand of these <b>quests.</b> Completing <b>quests</b> was the primary means of earning experience points. Repeatedly killing dolphins ("Grinding" [...] in gaming jargon) to gain levels was not a practical option in Spellborn. Separate from other story-driven <b>quests</b> were the Ancestral <b>Quests,</b> which allowed the player to take the role of a major character in Spellborns history to accomplish a specific requirement. Players needed to complete certain Ancestral <b>Quests</b> in order to advance their characters story arc.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between climate and Ixodes ricinus L. tick behavior by following every day the proportion of ticks <b>questing</b> in a tick population placed in polyamide mesh-delimited arenas in the field. Simultaneously, the phenology of the <b>questing</b> density of nymphs and adults was studied by sampling ticks in a close location. At {{any time during the}} year, the proportion of <b>questing</b> adults was significantly higher (mean 24 %) than the proportion of <b>questing</b> nymphs (mean 12 %). The proportion of <b>questing</b> nymphs and adults decreased stepwise with time. The proportion of <b>questing</b> adults partially recovered after each decrease. In contrast, the proportion of <b>questing</b> nymphs was strongly reduced during a single short period in June and did not recover even partially. Decrease in the proportion of <b>questing</b> ticks was strongly related either to a peak in saturation deficit or to a drop in maximal relative humidity. No increase in the proportion of <b>questing</b> nymphs was observed in the arenas during autumn, although an autumn peak of nymphs was observed at the sampling location close to the arenas. This suggests that the autumn peak of nymphs observed in nature was due to newly emerged spring-fed larvae and not to reactivated spring active nymph...|$|R

5|$|As {{with nearly}} every Dragon <b>Quest</b> game, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} the musical score. As {{was done for}} Dragon <b>Quest</b> VI, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called Dragon <b>Quest</b> VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST. The entire first disc and the opening track of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, {{while the rest of}} the second disc is the original sound version. The Symphonic Suite was released alone on Super Audio CD later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled Dragon <b>Quest</b> VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The Symphonic Suite was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of the music from the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the remake.|$|E
5|$|Both the Famicom and Super Famicom {{versions}} of this game, along with Dragon <b>Quest</b> and Dragon <b>Quest</b> III, were re-released under the Dragon <b>Quest</b> 25th Anniversary Collection compilation for the Wii in Japan on September 15, 2011. The Wii compilation featured interruptive save functions for each games. The compilation also included original copies of the strategy guides for the games, along with original artwork and material on the games' development.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with many}} side <b>quests,</b> there are storyline <b>quests</b> that reveal things about each realms {{past and the}} war between them. <b>Quests</b> reward players with experience, gold, and some items {{that they could not}} obtain otherwise. There are also player versus player <b>quests</b> which require the player to {{accomplish}} a certain task such as killing a certain amount number of players from another realm or holding a specific location for a certain amount of time.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{contains}} almost 200 <b>quests</b> and missions {{spread over}} the island. Each region has 1-4 <b>quests,</b> which can be either normal or time-limited.

On 6 January 1827 either James Head <b>Quested</b> - or his father, James <b>Quested</b> - {{was sentenced}} to life {{imprisonment}} for the charge of aiding and abetting smugglers. He was transported from London to Tasmania on the ship Governor Ready. The same person received a conditional pardon on 9 March 1839. James Head <b>Quested</b> became a master mariner. James Head <b>Quested</b> married Anne Mack (Ann Macnamara) on 17 October 1842 in Hobart. The couple lived on Smooth Island. In 1851 James Head <b>Quested</b> joined the Bendigo gold rush with John Rowlands (of Brushy Plains) and a man named 'Bannan' - the group was [...] "fairly successful" [...] there. <b>Quested</b> owned and traded the ship [...] "Boomerang" [...] between Tasmania, New Zealand and mainland Australia. He testified that a man boarded his ship in a drunk and quarrelsome manner. When the [...] "Boomerang" [...] was shipwrecked, <b>Quested</b> was accused of exaggerating the severity of the damage to obtain undue charity from the public. <b>Quested</b> subsequently moved to Garden Island (Either rented it from Mr E Vimpany or purchased it himself, and started a butchering business. On 13 April 1871, James Quested's sheep dog died. He suspected it had been poisoned and offered a £10 reward for information leading to a conviction. Anne Mack was a drunk, had a very long, elaborate criminal record and was known to have a [...] "very infirm temper". The Daly and <b>Quested</b> families had a long, bitter history of petty conflict which frequently aired in public, beginning at least during 1872.In 1872 Anne reportedly had a public quarrel with John Daly, where she broke windows, used foul language and threw meat bones at him. [...] On 15-16 May 1877, James Quested's wife Anne Mack {{was sentenced to}} 2 months of manual labor for maliciously wounding her daughter, Sarah <b>Quested,</b> with a knife. On 28 May 1878, James <b>Quested</b> submitted a notice in a newspaper calling for all his financial accounts (debts and credits) to be settled, stating that his solicitor would seek to recover any debt not repaid by 10 June 1878. In spite of his financial difficulties, on 19 August 1878 James <b>Quested</b> took the unusual decision to purchase Smooth Island from Henry Vimpany for £400. On 27 September 1878, <b>Quested</b> obtained a short term mortgage for £200 from Thomas Green, a gentleman in Hobart, for redemption 17 August 1880, with interest of 7% per annum, payable half-yearly. On 30 January 1879, <b>Quested</b> obtained a mortgage for £300 from the Tasmanian Permanent Building Society. Repayment terms were £3 14s per month for 10 years. On 2 September 1879, <b>Quested</b> obtained a short term mortgage for £72 from a banker, John Townsend Sale, for redemption on 2 February 1880. On 6 May 1880, a court case (Adkins v. <b>Quested),</b> a claim for wages, the verdict was given for the complainant. On 17 June 1880, <b>Quested</b> obtained another a short-term mortgage for £300 from Thomas Green, for redemption on 17 June 1881, with interest of 7% per annum, paid half-yearly[...] [...] [...] On 18 November 1880, <b>Quested</b> continued to occupy the house and 145 acres of land, paying £25 rent annually to E Vimpany. [...] On 19 March 1881, James <b>Quested</b> was summonsed to appear in court, accused of underpaying the wages of his employee, Mr Kemp. However, <b>Quested</b> disobeyed the summons and was subsequently arrested and brought to court. He was found guilty and ordered to pay Kemp £9 17s. 5d. and 13s. 6d. in costs. <b>Quested</b> continued to occupy the homestead on Smooth Island throughout part or all of George Herbert Bailey's period of ownership (11 Feb 1881 to 16 Jan 1884). Whilst George Herbert Bailey left the colony on 17 March 1882, <b>Quested</b> was reportedly still living on the island until at least 6 June 1883 There is currently no record suggesting <b>Quested</b> occupied the island during any of Capt Thomas de Houghton's period of ownership (16 Jan 1884 to 4 Oct 1897). In 1886 Jamed <b>Quested</b> was charged with deserting his illegitimate child in Prahran, Victoria. <b>Quested</b> died 30 March 1892 (At Walker street, Redfern, Sydney).

5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 Yukon <b>Quest,</b> for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by Yukon <b>Quest</b> International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the <b>Quest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Concepts for an MMORPG {{within the}} Dragon <b>Quest</b> series began among a small team during the later {{development}} of Dragon <b>Quest</b> VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon <b>Quest</b> IX. The {{aim was to}} make it accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, who had previously worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In typical Might and Magic fashion, {{the game}} is fairly non-linear, so <b>quests</b> can be {{completed}} at the player's own leisure, though the completion of storyline <b>quests</b> is essential for progression. Dialog, lore and exploration are important to progression in the game, with some dungeons involving relevant puzzles. In addition, side <b>quests</b> and dungeons can warrant rewards if completed, but are not vital to the main storyline. Also, promotion <b>quests</b> can increase the capabilities of particular classes of character.|$|R
50|$|In-game {{conversations with}} non-player {{characters}} {{are also a}} large part of the game. DeathSpank features advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series which play a large part in unfolding the game's story. These conversations may lead to <b>quests</b> for DeathSpank. In all, the game features 79 side <b>quests</b> in addition to the 33 <b>quests</b> required to advance the main plot. Once the game is completed the player can return and complete any unfinished side <b>quests.</b>|$|R
50|$|Progress {{is defined}} by {{completing}} <b>quests</b> and leveling up. After creating a character, players are required {{to go through a}} tutorial, and then receive <b>quests</b> from non-player characters. After accumulating enough experience points through <b>quests,</b> the character gains a level, which grants access to feats, spells, and skills. The game initially limited characters to a maximum level of 10, but has since increased the limit to 30. Each module has added <b>quests</b> and areas. Unlike most other RPGs, experience points are not gained by killing monsters, but rather by completing <b>quests.</b> Another difference is that characters do not automatically heal from damage, but instead must visit special locations to do so.|$|R
