40|$|This thesis investigates {{whether or}} not changes in a country’s {{government}} debt could affect its domestic stock market performance. The relationship is investigated by examining three different European countries, Germany, Portugal and Sweden, {{on the basis of}} two variables; (1) <b>quarterly</b> <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> changes as a percentage of gross domestic product and (2) the quarterly stock market changes over the time period 2000 :Q 2 – 2011 :Q 2. The evidence is presented with help of Ordinary Least Square Method and Granger Causality test for each respective country. According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, stock market prices should fully reflect all relevant information, e. g. government debt changes, as soon as they occur, without any delay, if the market is efficient. Past information should be insignificant and therefore not affect the stock market prices in an efficient market. In the cases of Sweden and Germany, the results proved to be ambiguous and thus do not allow for either rejection or acceptance of the Efficient Market Hypothesis with respect to government debt changes. However, some support was found in the case of Germany since the government debt changes and the stock market performance were instantaneously correlated. The empirical results presented in this thesis further allowed for the assumption that Portugal was not able to efficiently capture changes in the debt levels without any delay. This indicates that the Efficient Market Hypothesis can be rejected in regards for Portugal with respect to government debt changes. Furthermore, since the Portuguese stock market performance was not able to capture efficiently changes in the government debt level, it hence could possibly mislead the direction of the economy when looking into the stock prices to determine economic conditions. Moreover, the results imply that each country faces different relationships between the variables and that the relationships possibly could depend on the economic health of a country...|$|E

The analytical part {{is focused on the}} development of central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> of the Czech Republic and its structure in the years 2000 - 2014. The central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> {{from the point of view}} of the holders is divided into domestic and foreign debt. Its development and the development of individual components of these debts are described. In the thesis are also mentioned factors, which influenced the decline in central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> in 2014. The next section compares the evolution of central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> in CR and selected EU countries, namely Estonia, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and Greece. The structure of central <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> of selected countries for the period 2000 - 2010 is also analyzed, especially the marketable state debt that dominates.

30|$|The core {{issue of}} local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk is the {{long-term}} and sustainable negative effect of fiscal deficit which manifests as local <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> This therefore cannot form effective and sufficient fiscal {{income in the}} future, leading to the inability to maintain properly the performance of government function, ultimately making the fiscal operation unsustainable. The above shows that {{the rapid growth of}} local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and debt burden ratio beyond the warning line in some areas both indicate the presence of local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risks. It is necessary to be aware that if the local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk explodes, it will not affect just one city or fiscal province, but under the special system relationship in China, it will also trigger a systemic fiscal, financial, and economic crisis throughout the country. From the perspective of lending, the expansion of local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> comes from the soft constraint relationship in credit between local government and financial institutions (Liu 2013; Xie and Bai 2013); the local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk will inevitably spread to the financial system. In addition, the single state structure of China also determines that the central government will become the “final paymaster” of local fiscal burden (Huang and Xu 2011; Miao and Fu 2015); the debt risk of local government will eventually evolve into the central fiscal risks. The study of Fu et al. (2013) also elaborated that local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk in China will possibly trigger an economic crisis. Therefore, strengthening the prevention of local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk is not only the key to running local fiscal sustainability, but also the important premise to ensure the systemic safety of the economy. However, the most important key is finding the origin of local <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> risk.|$|R

40|$|Recently, several countries, {{which include}} not only developing, but also {{developed}} ones, face the severe sovereign crisis. In this circumstance, we introduce the new method for testing the sustainability of <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> Previous studies which investigate the sustainability of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> satisfies or not to test the Transversality condition of <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> But, these studies are criticized by Bohn (1998, 2008) as "ad-hoc" sustainability, because the situation which satisfies transversality condition (in other words, the intertemporal government budget constraint is bind) is merely chance. Bohn (1998, 2008) suggest the sufficiency condition which satisfies the sustainability of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> if the debt stabilization rule of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and primary surplus is satisfied. But, {{we do not know}} whether the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is really sustainable, at least in view of "Locally Ricardian" which Woodford suggests. Therefore we connect these discussions to apply the covariate augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test to the <b>government</b> <b>debt,</b> and check whether the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is unit root or not using U. S data. Moreover, we apply the estimation method Hamilton and Flavin (1986) with covariates to check whether "Globally Ricardian" is really satisfied. In our results, U.

On the other hand, "Globally Ricardian" is satisfied, and then the result is consistent with Woodford (1995, 1998). ...|$|R

One of these impacts is {{a huge amount of}} <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> Particularly, the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> whether from domestic or foreign is one of the instruments to finance government expenditure which can not be fulfilled entirely by revenues from taxes. However, using the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to fund the government expenditure has consequences for the government to pay-back not only for the interest rate but also for the principal of debt which have maturity-date in the future. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze how far the development of the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> dynamic from both domestic and foreign is correlated to fiscal sustainability. This study uses a case of lndonesia in period 1980 - 2005 which is divided into three periods: before crisis (1980 - 1997), crisis (1998 - 2000), and after crisis (2001 - 2005). In this study, we use Branson (1992) to analyze the <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> dynamic. In addition, we also use different approaches to have several comparisons in our analysis by Hamilton and Flavin (1986), Wilcox(1989), and Trehan and Walsh (1991).

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis started. in 2008 {{with the collapse}} of Iceland's banking system. Subsequently, several European countries faced the implosion of financial institutions, high <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and rapidly rising bond yield spreads in government securities. In this context, Greece {{is an example of a}} country whose <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is a matter of grave concern since it has received the second bailout but still threatens to default. This is ironic since a developed economy like Greece is considered to aide developing economies. The main aim of this dissertation is to conduct an econometric analysis of the determinants of the Greek {{sovereign debt}} crisis while the secondary aim is an extensive literature review of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Regarding the former aim, the variables selected include the government deficit, current account balance, inflation, gross savings and general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> of Greece. This annual data (from 1976 to 2010) was collected from the World Development Indicators, European Commission data base and the International Monetary Fund. The Vector Error Correction Model framework was used to estimate our model. Also, the Granger causality analysis helped to identify the direction of causation. Furthermore, the Variance Decomposition and the Generalized Impulse Response Function were employed to analyze the shocks of all our variables on each other. Finally, for the latter aim, we critically review the evolution, causes, consequences and cures of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis and then formulate some suggestions on how to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The results of the econometric analysis show that there is a significant negative relationship between general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> with <b>government</b> deficit and inflation. However, a significant positive relationship between general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and current account balance was found. There is an insignificant negative relationship between gross savings and general <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> The past value of the general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> and <b>government</b> deficit has the ability to determine the present value of inflation; and in turn, pass value of inflation, can predict the present value of current account balance and gross savings. Variation in most of our variables is highly explained by our variables itself, with the exception of current account balance where variation is explained mostly by general <b>government</b> <b>debt.</b> The response of general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to itself is positive. Gross <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to <b>government</b> deficit and general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to current account balance is negative. General <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> to inflation is positive. A shock of gross <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> has an increasing negative effect on gross savings over the study period. Among the causes of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis is the rapid growth of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> levels, trade imbalances, monetary policy inflexibility, and loss of confidence. Consequences of this crisis involve disrupted bond markets and the banking sector, depreciation of the Euro, reduced economic growth, loss of confidence, reduced remittances and tight fiscal measures. Some measures were taken and many are proposed as a cure for this crisis. This dissertation recommends that policies aimed at decreasing the level of general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> should increase expenditure hence deficit in an income generating investment, increase inflation while decreasing current account balance.

In terms of size, the paper focuses on different definitions that are in use, in particular the concept of gross general <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> used in the surveillance of the euro area countries, the total liabilities from the government balance sheet approach, and the net debt concept which subtracts government fi nancial assets from the liability side. In addition, it discusses “hidden debt” {{in the form of}} implicit and contingent liabilities. In terms of composition, the paper provides information about euro area <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> broken down by maturity, holder or the currency of issue.

40|$|<b>Government</b> <b>debt</b> (also {{known as}} public debt and {{national}} debt) is the debt owed by a central government. (In the U. S. {{and other federal}} states, "government debt" may also refer to the debt of a state or provincial government, municipal or local government). By contrast, the annual "government deficit" refers {{to the difference between}} government receipts and spending in a single year, that is, the increase of debt over a particular year. <b>Government</b> <b>debt</b> is one method of financing government operations, {{but it is not the}} only method. Governments can also create money to monetize their debts, thereby removing the need to pay interest. But this practice simply reduces government interest costs rather than truly canceling <b>government</b> <b>debt,</b> and can result in hyperinflation if used unsparingly. Governments usually borrow by issuing securities, government bonds and bills. Less creditworthy countries sometimes borrow directly from a supranational organization (e. g. the World Bank) or international financial institutions). As the government draws its income from much of the population, <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is an indirect debt of the taxpayers. <b>Government</b> <b>debt</b> can be categorized as internal debt (owed to lenders within the country) and external debt (owed to foreign lenders). Sovereign debt usually refers to <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> that has been issued in a foreign currency. Another common division of <b>government</b> <b>debt</b> is by duration until repayment is due.
