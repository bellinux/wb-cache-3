60|$|There were {{no signs}} of such a feat having been performed, when, the panic being past, my father went up to London with Griffith, who was to begin eating his terms at the Temple. He was to share Clarence's lodgings, for the Robsons had plenty of room, and Gooch was delighted to extend her cares to her special favourite, as she already reigned over Clarence's {{wardrobe}} and table as entirely as in nursery days; and, to my great exultation, my father {{said it would be}} good for Griffith to be with his brother; and, moreover, we should hear of the latter. Nothing could be a greater contrast than his rare notifications or requests, scrawled on a single side of the <b>quarto</b> <b>sheet,</b> with Clarence's regular weekly lines of clerkly manuscript, telling all that could interest any of us, and covering every available flap up to the blank circle left for the trim red seal.|$|E

For they were a curious mixture, those girlish letters, of village interests, discussion of books, and thoughts beyond their age; Tommy Toogood and Prometheus; or Du Guesclin in the closest juxtaposition with reports of progress in Abercrombie on the Intellectual Powers. It was the desire of Ellen to prove herself not unsettled but improved by love, and to become worthy of her ideal Griffith, never guessing that he would have been equally content with her if she had been as frivolous as the idlest girl who lingered amid the waning glories of Bath.|$|E

Now I have some thoughts of making a proposal to Robinson, the great London bookseller, of translating all the works of Schiller, which would make a portly quarto, on condition that he should pay my journey and my wife's to and from Jena, a cheap German University where Schiller resides, and allow me two guineas each <b>quarto</b> <b>sheet,</b> which would maintain me. If I could realize this scheme, I should there study chemistry and anatomy, and bring over with me all the works of Semler and Michaelis, the German theologians, and of Kant, the great German metaphysician. On my return I would commence a school for either young men at £105 each, proposing to perfect them in the following studies in this order:--1. Man as an Animal;--including the complete knowledge of anatomy, chemistry, mechanics, and optics:--2. Man as an intellectual Being;--including the ancient metaphysics, the system of Locke and Hartley--of the Scotch philosophers--and the new Kantean system:--3. Man as a Religious Being;--including an historic summary of all religions, and of the arguments for and against natural and revealed religion. Then proceeding from the individual to the aggregate of individuals, and disregarding all chronology, except that of mind, I should perfect them: 1--in the history of savage tribes; 2--of semi-barbarous nations; 3--of nations emerging from semi-barbarism; 4--of civilized states; 5--of luxurious states; 6--of revolutionary states; 7--of colonies.

The MSS. of these additions, which number ninety lines, are written on <b>quarto</b> <b>sheets,</b> and have been bound up with the folios. (Lines 1-16 are missing.) The poem, which with these and other additions had run up to 560 lines, was printed in book form (probably by Ridge of Newark), under the title of 'British Bards, A Satire'. [...] "This Poem," [...] writes Byron ['MSS. M.'], [...] "was begun in October, 1807, in London, and at different intervals composed from that period till September, 1808, when it was completed at Newstead Abbey.--B., 1808." [...] A date, 1808, is affixed to the last line. Only one copy is extant, that which was purchased, in 1867, from the executors of R.C. Dallas, by the Trustees of the British Museum. Even this copy has been mutilated. Pages 17, 18, which must have contained the first version of the attack on Jeffrey (see 'English Bards', p. 332, line 439, 'note' 2), have been torn out, and quarto proof-sheets in smaller type of lines 438-527, [...] "Hail to immortal Jeffrey," [...] etc., together with a quarto proof-sheet, in the same type as 'British Bards', containing lines 540-559, [...] "Illustrious Holland," [...] etc., have been inserted. Hobhouse's lines (first edition, lines 247-262), which are not in the original draft, are included in 'British Bards'. The insertion of the proofs increased the printed matter to 584 lines. After the completion of this revised version of 'British Bards', additions continued to be made. Marginal corrections and MS. fragments, bound up with 'British Bards', together with forty-four lines (lines 723-726, 819-858) which do not occur in MS. M., make up with the printed matter the 696 lines which were published in March, 1809, under the title of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'. The folio and <b>quarto</b> <b>sheets</b> in Mr. Murray's possession ('MS. M.') may be regarded as the MS. of 'British Bards; British Bards' (there are a few alterations, e.g. the substitution of lines 319-326, [...] "Moravians, arise," [...] etc., for the eight lines on Pratt, which {{are to be found in}} the folio MS., and are printed in 'British Bards'), with its accompanying MS. fragments, as the foundation of the text of the first edition of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the mail}} went by coach the sending {{of letters and}} parcels could not but be expensive. Heavy goods {{travelled}} by waggon, barge, or ship, parcels went by carriers or by coaches, and nothing could be posted but what was quite light. So postage was very expensive, and it is strange {{to look back on}} the regulations connected with it. Our readers under forty years old will hardly believe the rates that were paid for postage, varying according to distance. There was a company in London that carried letters from one part of that town to another for twopence apiece, and this was the cheapest post in England. A letter from London to Otterbourne cost eightpence, and one from Winchester either threepence or fourpence, one from Devonshire elevenpence, and this was paid not by the sender, but by the receiver. It was reckoned impolite to prepay a letter. Moreover, the letter had to be on a single sheet. The sheet might be of any size that could be had, but it must be only one. A small sheet enclosed within another, or the lightest thing, such as a lock of hair or a feather, made it a double letter, for which double postage had to be given. The usual custom was to write on <b>quarto</b> <b>sheets</b> twice the size of what is used now, and, after filling three sides, to fold the fourth, leaving a space for the direction and the seal, and then to write on the flaps and in the space over [...] "My dear ---," [...] sometimes crossing the writing till the whole letter was chequer work. For if the letter was to cost the receiver so much, it seemed fair to let him get as much as possible. Letters were almost always sealed, and it took neat and practised hands to fold and seal them nicely, without awkward corners sticking out.|$|R

6000|$|The article upon 'Hours of Idleness' [...] "which Lord Brougham ... after {{denying it}} for thirty years, {{confessed that he}} had written" [...] ('Notes from a Diary', by Sir M. E. Grant Duff, 1897, ii. 189), was {{published}} in the 'Edinburgh Review' of January, 1808. 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers' did not appear till March, 1809. The article gave the opportunity for the publication of the satire, but only in part provoked its composition. Years later, Byron had not forgotten its effect on his mind. On April 26, 1821, he wrote to Shelley: [...] "I recollect the effect on me of the Edinburgh on my first poem: it was rage and resistance and redress: but not despondency nor despair." [...] And on the same date to Murray: [...] "I know by experience that a savage review is hemlock to a sucking author; and the one on me (which produced the 'English Bards', etc.) knocked me down, but I got up again," [...] etc. It must, however, be remembered that Byron had his weapons ready for an attack before he used them in defence. In a letter to Miss Pigot, dated October 26, 1807, he says that [...] "he has written one poem of 380 lines to be published in a few weeks with notes. The poem ... is a Satire." [...] It was entitled 'British Bards', and finally numbered 520 lines. With a view to publication, or for his own convenience, it was put up in type and printed in <b>quarto</b> <b>sheets.</b> A single copy, which he kept for corrections and additions, was preserved by Dallas, and is now in the British Museum. After the review appeared, he enlarged and recast the 'British Bards', and in March, 1809, the Satire was published anonymously. Byron was at no pains to conceal the authorship of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers', and, before starting on his Pilgrimage, he had prepared a second and enlarged edition, which came out in October, 1809, with his name prefixed. Two more editions were called for in his absence, and on his return he revised and printed a fifth, when he suddenly resolved to suppress the work. On his homeward voyage he expressed, in a letter to Dallas, June 28, 1811, his regret at having written the Satire. A year later he became intimate, among others, with Lord and Lady Holland, whom he had assailed on the supposition that they were the instigators of the article in the 'Edinburgh Review', and on being told by Rogers that they wished the Satire to be withdrawn, he gave orders to his publisher, Cawthorn, to burn the whole impression. A few copies escaped the flames. One of two copies retained by Dallas, which afterwards belonged to Murray, and is now in his grandson's possession, was the foundation of the text of 1831, and of all subsequent issues. Another copy which belonged to Dallas is retained in the British Museum.|$|R
6000|$|I try {{at least}} to recover here, however, some closer {{notation}} of W. J.'s aspects--yet only with the odd effect of my either quite losing him or but apprehending him again at seated play with his pencil under the lamp. When I see him he is intently, though summarily, rapidly drawing, his head critically balanced and his eyebrows working, and when I don't see him it is because I have resignedly relinquished him. I can't have been often for him a deprecated, still less an actively rebuffed suitor, because, as I say again, such aggressions were so little in order for me; but I remember that on my once offering him my company in conditions, those of some planned excursion, in which it wasn't desired, his putting the question of our difference at rest, with the minimum of explanation, by the responsible remark: [...] "I play with boys who curse and swear!" [...] I had sadly to recognise that I didn't, that I couldn't pretend to have come to that yet--and truly, as I look back, either the unadvisedness and inexpertness of my young contemporaries on all that ground must have been complete (an interesting note on our general manners after all,) or my personal failure to grasp must have been. Besides which I wonder scarce less now than I wondered then in just what company my brother's privilege was exercised; though if he had but richly wished to be discouraging he quite succeeded. It wasn't that I mightn't have been drawn to the boys in question, but that I simply wasn't qualified. All boys, I rather found, were difficult to play with--unless it was that they rather found me; but {{who would have been}} so difficult as these? They account but little, moreover, I make out, for W. J.'s eclipses; so that I take refuge easily enough in the memory of my own pursuits, absorbing enough at times to have excluded other views. I also plied the pencil, or to be more exact the pen--even if neither implement critically, rapidly or summarily. I was so often engaged at that period, it strikes me, in literary--or, to be more precise in dramatic, accompanied by pictorial composition--that I must again and again have delightfully lost myself. I had not on any occasion personally succeeded, amid our theatric strife, in reaching the footlights; but how could I have doubted, nevertheless, with our large theatrical experience, of the nature, and of my understanding, of the dramatic form? I sacrificed to it with devotion--by the aid of certain <b>quarto</b> <b>sheets</b> of ruled paper bought in Sixth Avenue for the purpose (my father's store, though I held him a great fancier of the article in general, supplied but the unruled;) grateful in particular for the happy provision by which each fourth page of the folded sheet was left blank. When the drama itself had covered three pages the last one, over which I most laboured, served for the illustration of what I had verbally presented. Every scene had thus its explanatory picture, and as each act--though I am not positively certain I arrived at acts--would have had its vivid climax. Addicted in that degree to fictive evocation, I yet recall, on my part, no practice whatever of narrative prose or any sort of verse. I cherished the [...] "scene"--as I had so vibrated to the idea of it that evening at Linwood; I thought, I lisped, at any rate I composed, in scenes; though how much, or how far, the scenes [...] "came" [...] is another affair. Entrances, exits, the indication of [...] "business," [...] the animation of dialogue, the multiplication of designated characters, were things delightful in themselves--while I panted toward the canvas on which I should fling my figures; which it took me longer to fill than it had taken me to write what went with it, but which had on the other hand something of the interest of the dramatist's casting of his personæ, and must have helped me to believe in the validity of my subject.|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{formed the}} basis for Linnaeus's lectures on dietetics, between 1742 and 1772, when Linnaeus lectured at least 8 times on dietetics. Linnaeus made numerous additions to his notes during this period. According to Wikman (1970), {{in the middle of the}} 1760 s, Linnaeus seems to have prepared the notes for publication. The Prolegomena was probably composed at that time, as well as the title page. On the title page, the last line are in Linnaeus's elderly hand. The manuscript regroups many notes written at different times in Linnaeus's career. It is likely that Axel Otto Lindfors or Johan Markus Hulth (or both successively) regrouped these notes thematically. Contents: Folder I.

On f. 15, little drawing of the succession of professors of Uppsala. The drawing is entitled 'Professores upsalienses 1741. ? secundum numeros unus cincter(?) singulo anno'. Around a circle are names of past and present professors of the University of Uppsala, much like a seating plan. Each professor is attributed a symbol, contemporaneous professors sharing the same symbol. Professors listed are (clockwise from bottom) : P. Julan, Ihre, Matheasius, A. Celsius, Boberus, Gronwal, Beronius, Asp, Winbom, E. Melander, O. Celsius, D. Solander, A. Berch, N. Rosen, C. Linnaeus, E. Frondin, Klingenstrem, P. Ullen, Eckerman, A. Arhenius. In the table is written: 'unus post alterum tandem succedimus omnes': one after the other we eventually follow everyone. Next to two of them are dates: next to P. Ullen is the date 22 V 1747; next to A. Arhenius 1743. f. 16 - 17 : Spectra f. 18 : Sympatia f. 19 - 21 : Superstitio f. 22 - 28 : Theologia f. 29 : Virtus IV.

50|$|Barnard was {{the author}} of a {{pamphlet}} in three <b>sheets</b> <b>quarto,</b> entitled Censura Cleri, against scandalous ministers not fit to be restored to the church's livings in prudence, piety, and fame. This was published in the latter end of 1659 or beginning of 1660, ‘to prevent such from being restored to their livings as had been ejected by the godly party in 1654-55.’ His name is not set to this pamphlet, and Anthony a Wood says he did not care afterwards, when he saw how the event proved, to be known as its author. He is best known as the author of Theologo-Historicus, a true life of the most reverend divine and excellent historian, Peter Heylyn, D.D., sub-dean of Windsor (London, 1683, 8vo). This was published, according to the author, to correct the errors, supply the defects, and confute the calumnies of George Vernon, M.A., rector of Burton in Gloucester, who had brought out a life of Dr. Heylyn in 1682. Printed with Theologo-Historicus was an answer to Mr. Baxter's false accusation of Dr. Heylyn. Barnard also wrote a catechism for the use of his parish, and left behind him a manuscript tract against Socinianism, which was never printed. He died on 17 August 1683 at Newark-on-Trent, while on a journey to the Spa, and was buried in his own church of Waddington.|$|R

6000|$|His acts {{continued}} to confirm his guilt. A little while after the quarto was published there appeared the 5th and 6th {{volume of the}} octavo edition of Pope's works, which the title-page says [...] "consists of Letters, wherein {{to those of the}} author's own edition are added all that are genuine from the former impressions, with some never before printed."[113] This edition bears internal evidence of having been printed concurrently with the <b>quarto</b> itself. A <b>sheet</b> signed *Dd, the pages of which are numbered from 215 to 222, is interpolated in the quarto between the two last leaves of Dd, and the numbers are of necessity repeated on the succeeding eight pages. The interpolated letters of the quarto are equally an interpolation in the octavo, where they follow p. 116 of Vol. VI., on a duplicate half-sheet signed *I, and the paging is repeated on the half-sheet which follows. Consequently the octavo must have been struck off before the letters were interpolated in the quarto, or they would not have been printed in the octavo on an interpolated half-sheet. A second insertion tells the same tale. A few letters are added {{at the end of the}} quarto with the announcement that they had been published [...] "since the foregoing sheets were printed off." [...] These letters appear in like manner at the end of the octavo after finis. At the very moment, therefore, that Pope was compelling his reluctant friends to subscribe to his expurgated quarto, he was clandestinely printing an octavo edition in which he put back the whole of the omitted letters he allowed to be genuine, and his imperfect quarto was simply a fraud upon the purchasers for the purpose of accrediting his feigned reprobation of the P. T. volume.|$|R
