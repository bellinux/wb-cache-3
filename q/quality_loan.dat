40|$|This paper models bank asset {{choice when}} {{shareholders}} {{know more about}} <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> than do outsiders. Because of this informational asymmetry, the price of loans in the secondary market is the price for poor <b>quality</b> <b>loans.</b> Banks desire to hold marketable securities {{in order to avoid}} liquidating good <b>quality</b> <b>loans</b> at the "lemons" price, but also have a countervailing desire to hold risky loans in order to maximize the value of deposit insurance. In this context, portfolio composition and bank safety is examined {{as a function of the}} market distribution of <b>loan</b> <b>quality,</b> and the distribution of deposits. The model suggests that off-balance sheet commitments have little effect on bankruptcy risk, and induce banks to hold more securities.

In the short run, banks are unambiguously riskier on-balance-sheet, although the effect on bank safety is ambiguous. ...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{increase}} of bank failure raises {{many questions about}} <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> {{and the ability of}} the managers. Loans comprise a significant proportion of bank assets, and therefore it is important to manage <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> so as to ensure a bank’s financial health. Higher loan loss provision in a pre-crisis period could signify that bank managers are more prompt in recognising loan losses. Many managers, however, have been unable to anticipate and understand the conditions of the recent 2007 - 09 financial crisis. Further, it remains unclear whether higher <b>quality</b> <b>loans</b> are attributed to higher ability managers. Hence, this thesis has two objectives. First, it aims to examine the influence of managerial ability on bank <b>loan</b> <b>quality.</b> Second, it aims to estimate the effect of three crises on the nexus between <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> and managerial ability of banks. The crises studied are the global financial crisis (GFC), the dot-com bubble, and 9 / 11 terrorist attacks crisis (DB- 9 / 11). This study uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Tobit regression to estimate the managerial ability proxy. This research also employs the fixed effect panel regression and the panel ordered probit regression to address both the objectives. The results show that managerial ability significantly influences a bank’s <b>loan</b> <b>quality.</b> Hence, banks with more talented (higher ability) managers have less probability of loan default. Further, the association between <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> and managerial ability is significantly affected by the GFC and DB- 9 / 11 crises. The nexus of <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> and managerial ability is shown to be strengthened during the GFC; however, the nexus was weakened during the DB- 9 / 11 crisis. The research contributes as follows. First, it contributes to both the bad management hypothesis and the task complexity theory by providing empirical evidence of the relationship between bank <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> and managerial ability. Second, it also provides empirical evidence on the impact of both financial and non-financial crises on <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> through the channel of managerial ability. Third, it provides an extension of the managerial ability proxy to the banking industry which makes available a measure of managerial ability of US banks to parties both within and outside the industry. Fourth, the managerial ability and <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> relationship are shown to be useful tools for forecasting and stress testing purposes for policy makers, regulators and bankers. Fifth, it contributes to the understanding of how managerial ability impacts on <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> during critical crisis periods. The study has limitations in that it employs a limited sample of US commercial banks over the limited time period of 1991 to 2013. Nonetheless, these limitations do not undermine the significance of the research findings. Instead, it provides directions for future research opportunities...|$|R

A substantial theoretical literature motivates the use of collateral as a means to alleviate ex-ante and ex-post information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders and the incidence of credit rationing.

There is little empirical evidence, however, on the precise workings of collateral, its interaction with other contract terms, and its impact on banks’ monitoring incentives.

40|$|The lending banks’ {{function}} of loan monitoring {{plays an important}} role in sustaining <b>quality</b> <b>loan</b> portfolios and protects risk assets against deterioration thereby keeping non-performing loans (NPLs) within acceptable standards. The aim of this paper is to propose a conceptual model/framework of investigating the moderating role of loan monitoring on the relationship between macroeconomic variables and NPLs among Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community (AEC) countries. The global problem of NPLs has been persistent and on the rise. Many attempts have been made to investigate the determinant of NPLs yet the problem has remained unexplained. Most of the previous studies have focused on macroeconomic and other environmental variables, industry specific and bank-specific determinants of NPLs but gave less attention to the moderating role of loan monitoring functions of the lending banks. This paper proposes a framework by adding a moderator of loan monitoring to the existing models of the macroeconomic determinants of NPLs with special attention to the AEC countries that mostly were once heavily confronted with severe banking and financial crises in the late 90 s. It is expected that the outcome will assist policymakers in protecting and/or improving the current state of NPLs among AEC member countries...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{failures}} of depository institutions in the 1980 s, many analysts concluded that {{the rapid growth of}} lending activity and the deterioration of loan quality were related. Robert T. Clair tests this relationship after separating loan growth by its source: increased lending to new or existing customers, bank mergers, and acquisitions of failed banks. The preliminary evidence suggests that additional lending to new or existing customers beyond what might be normal at a given stage of the business cycle lowers loan quality after a three-year lag. This relationship, based on evidence from Texas banks, was especially strong at banks with below-average capitalization.; Not all loan growth, however, will lead to lower loan <b>quality.</b> <b>Loan</b> growth during an economic expansion is to be expected as loan demand increases. Furthermore, well-capitalized banks were able to grow very rapidly and maintain loan quality.; One method of increasing lending while maintaining loan quality was through the purchase of failed banks {{with the assistance of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Of course, these purchases increased lending only for the acquiring banks and did not reflect an increase in total lending for the banking industry. Furthermore, it is possible that FDIC resolution procedures have discouraged the acquisition of weak but still solvent banks by stronger banks and are thereby slowing the rate of needed consolidation in the banking industry.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the topics related to securitization and with pricing of finan- cial assets in general. The topics are analyzed from a macroeconomic perspective using various theoretical and empirical methods. The first chapter studies the efficiency of financial intermediation through securitiza- tion with asymmetric information about the <b>quality</b> of securitized <b>loans.</b> In this theoret- ical model I show that, in general, by providing reputation-based implicit recourse, the issuer of a loan can credibly signal its quality. However, in boom stages of the business cycle, information on <b>loan</b> <b>quality</b> remains private, and lower <b>quality</b> <b>loans</b> accumulate on balance sheets. This deepens a subsequent downturn. The longer the duration of a boom, the deeper the fall of output in a subsequent recession will be. I present empir- ical evidence from securitization deal level data consistent with this result. Finally, the model suggests that excessive regulation which requires higher explicit risk-retention by the originators of loans can adversely affect both {{quantity and quality of}} investment in the economy. The second chapter presents a Markov-switching DSGE model which focuses on the adverse selection on re-sale markets for securitized products.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{consequences}} of existing regulations on the <b>quality</b> of mortgage <b>loans</b> originations in the originate-to-distribute (OTD) market. The information asymmetries in the OTD market can lead to moral hazard problems {{on the part of}} lenders. We find, using a plausibly exogenous source of variation in the ease of securitization, that the <b>quality</b> of <b>loan</b> origination varies inversely with the amount of regulation: more regulated lenders originate <b>loans</b> of worse <b>quality.</b> We interpret this result as a possible evidence that the fragility of lightly regulated originators' capital structure can mitigate moral hazard. In addition, we find that incentives which require mortgage brokers to have [`]skin in the game' and stronger risk management departments inside the bank partially alleviate the moral hazard problem in this setting. Finally, having more lenders inside a mortgage pool is associated with higher <b>quality</b> <b>loans,</b> suggesting that sharper relative performance evaluation made possible by more competition among contributing lenders can also mitigate the moral hazard problem to some extent. Overall, our evidence suggests that market forces rather than regulation may have been more effective in mitigating moral hazard in the OTD market. The findings caution against policies that impose stricter lender regulations which fail to align lenders' incentives with the investors of mortgage-backed securities.

It is generally accepted that maintaining the financial strength which is importance in corporate governance mechanism of institutions, has {{a close relationship with}} the efficiency of {{financial institutions}}, although they are small. However, there is a doubt of efficiency of SFIs in developing countries due to not maintaining appropriate financial practices. In Sri Lanka, recent collapses of many financial institutions also signal that they do not maintain sound financial practices. Cooperative rural banks in Sri Lanka (CRBs) one of the formal SFIs in Sri Lanka which serve a large number of customers, deal with a large amount of funds and have substantial contributions to the rural financial sector during the last four decades. This paper seeks to test financial strength of cooperative rural banks in Sri Lanka (CRBs) and whether these strengths {{have a significant impact on}} efficiency of these institutions. The financial strength of CRBs was assessed using ratios of capital adequacy, liquidity, asset <b>quality,</b> <b>loan</b> to deposit, profitability, loan portfolio yield, operational efficiency, and operational self-sufficiency. The efficiency of CRBs in Sri Lanka was examined by using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a non-parametric analytic technique. Based on the data extracted from CRBs’ financial statements, correlation coefficients showed that several financial practices have significant associations with the efficiency of CRBs in Sri Lanka. This confirms that efficient SFIs maintain sound financial practices which contribute to higher levels of efficiency. ...|$|E

Using a forward looking simulation of many risk factors applied to detailed balance sheets for a 10 bank stylized United States banking system, we analyze correlated market and credit risk and estimate {{the probability that}} multiple banks will fail or experience liquidity runs simultaneously. Significant systemic risk factors are shown to include financial and economic environment regime shifts to stressful conditions, poor initial loan credit <b>quality,</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio sector and regional concentrations, bank creditors ’ sensitivity to and uncertainties regarding solvency risk, and inadequate capital. Systemic banking system solvency risk {{is driven by the}} correlated defaults of many borrowers, other market risks, and inter-bank defaults. Liquidity runs are modeled as a response to elevated solvency risk and uncertainties and are shown to increase correlated bank failures. Potential bank funding outflows and contractions in lending with significant real economic impacts are estimated. Increases in equity capital levels needed to reduce bank solvency and liquidity risk levels to a target confidence level are also estimated to range from 3 percent to 20 percent of assets. For a future environment that replicates the 1987 – 2006 volatilities and correlations, we find only a small risk of U. S. bank failures focused on thinly capitalized and regionally concentrated smaller banks. For the 2007 – 2010 financial environment calibration we find substantially elevated solvency and liquidity risks for all banks and the banking system. JEL Classification Numbers...|$|E

This uncertainty adversely affects economic growth as investment in agriculture and small enterprises by poor rural households relies on the provision of microfinance services. Hence, the Sri Lankan Government and Central Bank of Sri Lanka have implemented legislation to strengthen SFIs. Further, attention to the efficiency of SFIs in Sri Lanka is of concern to the general public given the recent malpractice-related collapses of several formal and informal financial institutions. The cooperative rural banks (CRBs) in Sri Lanka provide a comprehensive network throughout the country and make a substantial contribution to rural credit activities. As formal SFIs, these CRBs have gained an increasing share of financial assets, which has been particularly helpful for satisfying the growing demand for loans and advances from people living in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the overall efficiency of CRBs in Sri Lanka. The study provides evidence on the accounting practices and financial practices of CRBs and some elements in the corporate governance mechanisms of financial institutions. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure efficiency. A comparative analysis of the efficiency of CRBs operating in Sri Lanka is undertaken. Two main approaches are used to evaluate efficiency. Input and output variables are selected for the intermediation and asset approaches. The results from both approaches show that relatively few CRBs operate efficiently. Further, the efficiency of CRBs in Sri Lanka has declined during the study period. Variables for CRBs specific characteristics are also tested for relationships with CRBs size. The evaluation of accounting and financial practices reveals that most sample CRBs deviate from the normative benchmarks. Many CRBs provide accounting information only to fulfil legal requirements rather than with the objective of providing information useful for decision-making purposes. With regards to financial practices, performance relative to best practice is below the benchmarks for most sample CRBs. In this context, the level of risk exposure of these CRBs is very high. As a consequence, the possibility of failure to meet the going concern criteria is raised, especially at a time when global financial crises are impacting all financial institutions. Analysis of the associations of efficiency with accounting and financial practices shows that efficiency in intermediation is correlated with accounting practices and indicators of sound financial practice (assets <b>quality,</b> <b>loan</b> portfolio yield, operating efficiency and operating self-sufficiency). Further, efficiency in asset transformation is associated with capital adequacy, loan portfolio yield and operational self-sufficiency. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the underlying problems for efficiency in particular CRBs in Sri Lanka. Further, they can assist regulators with the development of policies affecting the small financial institutions generally and CRBs in particular...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance is the {{practice}} of providing small, collateral free loans to the poor. While the microfinance industry was initially comprised of predominantly non-profit institutions, a shift towards for-profits has emerged. This paper examines the effects of changes in for-profit concentration on the microfinance industry. First, an economic model for the activity of non-profit firms is established. Empirical data from microfinance institutions (MFIs) is then analyzed {{in the context of}} this model. Findings indicate that for-profit MFIs serve more borrowers, serve wealthier borrowers, and do not provide lower <b>quality</b> <b>loans</b> than non-profit MFIs. There is also evidence that economic models developed to understand non-profit decision-making might not apply to the microfinance industry. Honors Thesi...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} banking model with {{imperfect}} competition in which borrowers’ {{access to credit}} is improved when banks are able to transfer credit risks. However, the market for credit risk transfer (CRT) works smoothly only if the <b>quality</b> of <b>loans</b> is public information. If the <b>quality</b> of <b>loans</b> is private information, banks {{have an incentive to}} grant unprofitable loans in order to transfer them to other parties, leading to an increase in aggregate risk. Nevertheless, the introduction of CRT generally increases welfare in our setup. However, under private information, higher competition induces an expansion of loans to unprofitable firms, which in the limit offsets the welfare gains from CRT completely. access to credit, bank competition, credit derivatives, Credit risk transfer, public and private information...|$|R
