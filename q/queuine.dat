We show that the uptake of <b>queuine</b> is stimulated by activators of protein kinase C (PKC) and inhibitors of protein phosphatase; while inhibitors of PKC, and down-regulation of PKC by chronic exposure to phorbol esters inhibit the uptake of <b>queuine</b> into cultured human fibroblasts. Activators of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases exert no effect on the uptake of <b>queuine</b> into fibroblast cell cultures. These studies suggest that PKC directly supports the activity of the <b>queuine</b> uptake mechanism, and that protein phosphatase activity in the cell acts to reverse this. Regardless of the modulation of uptake rate, the level of intracellular <b>queuine</b> base saturates in 6 h. However, there is still an effect on the incorporation rate of <b>queuine</b> into tRNA of fibroblast cultures even after 24 h. We now show that the incorporation of <b>queuine</b> into tRNA in cultured human fibroblasts by tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase (TGRase) is also stimulated by activators of PKC and inhibitors of protein phosphatase: while inhibitors of PKC decrease the activity of this enzyme. These studies suggest that PKC supports both the cellular transport of <b>queuine</b> and the activity of TGRase in cultured human fibroblasts, and that protein phosphatase activity in fibroblasts acts to reverse this phenomenon. A kinase-phosphatase control system, that is common to controlling both intracellular signal transduction and many enzyme systems, appears to be controlling the availability of the <b>queuine</b> substrate and the mechanism for its incorporation into tRNA.

The bioassay employs L-M cells which respond to the presence of <b>queuine</b> by an increase in their Q(+) tRNAAsp that is accompanied by a decrease in the Q(-) tRNAAsp isoacceptors. The increase in Q(+) tRNATyr in Drosophila that occurs on a yeast diet is accompanied by an increase in <b>queuine.</b> Similarly the increase of Q(+) tRNAs with age also is accompanied by an increase in free <b>queuine.</b> In two mutants, brown and sepia, these correlations were either diminished or failed to occur. Indeed, the extract of both mutants inhibited the response of the L-M cells to authentic <b>queuine.</b> When the pteridines that occur at abnormally high levels in sepia were used at 1 x 10 (- 6) M, the inhibition of the L-M cell assay occurred in the order biopterin greater than pterin greater than sepiapterin.

40|$|<b>Queuine</b> is a {{modified}} nucleotide known {{to occur in}} the anticodon of four tRNAs. The <b>queuine</b> modification occurs across all eukaryotes and eubacteria with few exceptions, but its function remains unclear. Prior in vitro work demonstrated that the modification can be incorporated into RNA species other than presently known tRNAs. <b>Queuine</b> is unusual in that, unlike the majority of modified nucleotides that result from changes to genetically encoded bases, it is incorporated into RNA by transglycosylation. Base modification by transglycosylation is unusual and represents an interesting point of entry for study. Due to this method of incorporation the modification can be studied with small molecule probes. Tritium-labeled <b>queuine</b> and preQ 1 were prepared to study the differences between the eukaryotic and eubacterial version of the enzyme responsible for the incorporation of <b>queuine,</b> tRNA guanine transglycosylase. A concise, convergent synthesis of <b>queuine</b> was developed that is the shortest route to date. PreQ 1, the precursor to <b>queuine</b> incorporated by eubacteria, was used to investigate the prevalence of base modification in E. coli. Three cell lines were utilized to conduct the in vivo experiments of this study: a ΔqueC knockout of E. coli that is unable to synthesize preQ 1 so that labeled compound would be incorporated exclusively, a Δtgt knockout strain of E. coli that is unable to incorporate preQ 1 and a wild-type E. coli strain. As the modified nucleotide occurs through incorporation of a specially synthesized nucleotide, a study of the sites of modification by prepared probes is possible. The syntheses of two novel azide congeners were undertaken for this purpose. The evaluation of their interaction with tRNA guanine transglycosylase was undertaken to determine if they are substrates of the enzyme. 	The tritium labeled preQ 1 allowed for a general evaluation of the prevalence. That determined the four known tRNAs are the main site of incorporation in vivo, while many other RNAs are substrates in vitro. The azide probes were generated and interact with E. coli TGT, but were not substrates.

40|$|Enzymes of the Dnmt 2 {{family of}} methyltransferases have yielded {{a number of}} {{unexpected}} discoveries. The first surprise came {{more than ten years}} ago when it was realized that, rather than being DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt 2 enzymes actually are transfer RNA (tRNA) methyltransferases for cytosine- 5 methylation, foremost C 38 (m 5 C 38) of tRNAAsp. The second unanticipated finding was our recent discovery of a nutritional regulation of Dnmt 2 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Significantly, the presence of the nucleotide queuosine in tRNAAsp strongly stimulates Dnmt 2 activity both in vivo and in vitro in S. pombe. <b>Queuine,</b> the respective base, is a hypermodified guanine analog that is synthesized from guanosine- 5 ’-triphosphate (GTP) by bacteria. Interestingly, most eukaryotes have queuosine in their tRNA. However, they cannot synthesize it themselves, but rather salvage it from food or from gut microbes. The <b>queuine</b> obtained from these sources comes from the breakdown of tRNAs, where the <b>queuine</b> ultimately was synthesized by bacteria. <b>Queuine</b> thus has been termed a micronutrient. This review summarizes the current knowledge of Dnmt 2 methylation and queuosine modification with respect to translation as well as the organismal consequences of the absence of these modifications.

40|$|Of the {{approximately}} 100 tRNA modifications {{that have been}} identified thus far, <b>queuine</b> (Q, 7 -((4, 5 -cis-dihydroxy- 2 -cyclopenten- 1 -yl) amino) methyl- 7 -deazaguanine) {{is one of the}} most complicated. Although its physiological role is largely obscure, the Q modification of tRNA in eukarya has been suggested to be involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and response to oxidative stress. Additionally, the malfunction of Q modification has been correlated with several biological disorders. These observations have elicited an interest in acquiring a greater understanding of the physiological role(s) of the queuosine modification. To explore the biological significance of queuosine modification in eukarya, this dissertation work studied the key human enzyme, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), which catalyzes the exchange of <b>queuine</b> for guanine in its substrate tRNAs. The eukaryal TGT was previously proposed to be a heterodimeric protein composed of <b>queuine</b> tRNA-ribosyltransferase 1 (QTRT 1) and ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP 14). However, physical and kinetic evidence that we have obtained make it clear that the human TGT consists of QTRT 1 and its homologue, <b>queuine</b> tRNA-ribosyltransferase domain-containing 1 (QTRTD 1). Additional mutagenesis studies reveal that QTRT 1 is responsible for the transglycosylase activity. Our results along with previous observations by others also led us to propose that QTRTD 1 not only assists in recognizing substrate tRNAs, but has also evolved into a <b>queuine</b> salvage enzyme that generates the heterocyclic substrate (<b>queuine)</b> for the transglycosylation. Future work is pending to validate the latter part of this hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, we have also provided the first report of the kinetics of the eukaryal TGT via direct incorporation assays. In vitro kinetic studies reported in this dissertation demonstrate preferential heterocyclic substrate recognition for the human TGT. Follow-up work of wild-type and mutant, human and Escherichia coli TGTs confirmed that active site residues of both enzymes evolved to selectively recognize their cognate heterocyclic substrates. This work has provided a greater understanding of the eukaryal TGT via rigorous enzymatic characterization of the recombinant human and E. coli TGTs. Our results are consistent with the concept that the present forms of TGT have arisen via divergent evolution...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{key enzyme}} {{involved}} in the incorporation of the modified base <b>queuine</b> into tRNA (position 34) is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT). Studies of the recognition of truncated tRNAs by the Escherichia coli TGT have established a minimal recognition motif involving a minihelix with a 7 base loop containing a U-G-U sequence (where G is replaced with <b>queuine)</b> [Curnow, A. W. and Garcia, G. A. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 17264 – 17267; Nakanishi, S. et al. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32221 – 32225]. Still, {{a clearer understanding of}} the recognition of full-length `queuine-cognate' tRNAs by TGT remains lacking. In this paper, we report the in vitro transcription and enzymological characterization (Km and kcat) of all four `queuine-cognate' tRNAs from E. coli and from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the TGT from E. coli. No primary or secondary structures emerge as important recognition elements from this study. The modest differences in substrate specificity (relative kcat/Km values vary from 0. 5 to 8. 4) seen among these `queuine-cognate' tRNAs most likely result from the accumulated effects of many subtle factors. Interestingly, the yeast tRNAs are essentially equivalent to the E. coli tRNAs as substrates for TGT, indicating that there is nothing intrinsic to the yeast tRNAs that accounts for the absence of <b>queuine</b> in yeast...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (Tgt) catalyses the {{exchange}} of the genetically encoded guanine at the wobble position of tRNAs(His,Tyr,Asp,Asn) by the premodified base preQ 1, which is further converted to <b>queuine</b> at the tRNA level. As eucaryotes {{are not able to}} synthesise <b>queuine</b> de novo but acquire it through their diet, eucaryotic Tgt directly inserts the hypermodified base into the wobble position of the tRNAs mentioned above. Bacterial Tgt is required for the efficient pathogenicity of Shigella sp, the causative agent of bacillary dysentery and, hence, it constitutes a putative target for the rational design of anti-Shigellosis compounds. Since mammalian Tgt is known to be indirectly essential to the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, it is necessary to create substances which only inhibit bacterial but not eucaryotic Tgt. Therefore, it seems of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features within both types of proteins. Homology models of Caenorhabditis elegans Tgt and human Tgt suggest that the replacement of Cys 158 and Val 233 in bacterial Tgt (Zymomonas mobilis Tgt numbering) by valine and accordingly glycine in eucaryotic Tgt largely accounts for the different substrate specificities. In the present study we have created mutated variants of Z. mobilis Tgt in order to investigate the impact of a Cys 158 Val and a Val 233 Gly exchange on catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we gained evidence that the Cys 158 Val mutation reduces the affinity to preQ 1 while leaving the affinity to guanine unaffected. The Val 233 Gly exchange leads to an enlarged substrate binding pocket, that is necessary to accommodate <b>queuine</b> in a conformation compatible with the intermediately covalently bound tRNA molecule.

40|$|Queuosine is a {{modified}} pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside {{found in the}} anticodon loop of transfer RNA acceptors for the amino acids tyrosine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and histidine. Because it is exclusively synthesized by bacteria, higher eukaryotes must salvage queuosine or its nucleobase <b>queuine</b> from food and the gut microflora. Previously, animals made deficient in <b>queuine</b> died within 18 days of withdrawing tyrosine, a nonessential amino acid, from the diet (Marks, T., and Farkas, W. R. (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 230, 233 – 237). Here, we show that human HepG 2 cells deficient in <b>queuine</b> and mice made deficient in queuosine-modified transfer RNA, by disruption of the tRNA guanine transglycosylase enzyme, are compromised {{in their ability to}} produce tyrosine from phenylalanine. This has similarities to the disease phenylketonuria, which arises from mutation in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or from a decrease in the supply of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4). Immunoblot and kinetic analysis of liver from tRNA guanine transglycosylase-deficient animals indicates normal expression and activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. By contrast, BH 4 levels are significantly decreased in the plasma, and both plasma and urine show a clear elevation in dihydrobiopterin, an oxidation product of BH 4, despite normal activity of the salvage enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Our data suggest that queuosine modification limits BH 4 oxidation in vivo and thereby potentially impacts on numerous physiological processes in eukaryotes...|$|E

Furthermore, we have identified three different tRNA(Asp) species which all carry three pseudouridines and two methylations but have the anticodons GCC, GUC and QUC respectively, the latter representing a rare example of <b>queuine</b> incorporation into a mitochondrial tRNA.

In order to gain insight into {{the influence of the}} nucleosides in position 36, 37 and 38 of an anticodon loop on the potential of a tRNA to become a substrate for the two modifying enzymes, we have constructed several variants of yeast tRNAs in which the normal anticodon has been replaced by one of the synthetic anticodons GUA, GUC, GUG or GUU. In yeast tRNAAsp, the nucleosides 37 (m 1 G) and 38 (C) have also been replaced by an adenosine. These reconstructed chimerical tRNAs were microinjected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus laevis oocytes and tested for their ability to react with the oocyte maturation enzymes. Our results indicate that the nucleosides in positions 36, 37 and 38 influence the efficiencies of conversion of G- 34 to Q- 34 and of Q- 34 to glycosyl Q- 34; the importance of their effects are much more pronounced on the glycosylation of Q- 34 than on the insertion of <b>queuine.</b> The effect of the nucleoside in position 37 is of particular importance in the case of yeast tRNAAsp: the replacement of the naturally occurring m 1 G- 37 by an unmodified adenosine (as it is in X. laevis tRNAAsp), considerably increases the yield of the glycosylation reaction catalysed by the X. laevis tRNA-queuine glycosyltransferase. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

While ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (USP 14) has been proposed to act as a regulatory subunit of the eukaryotic TGT, the mouse TGT has recently been shown to be a <b>queuine</b> tRNA-ribosyltransferase 1 (QTRT 1, eubacterial TGT homolog) ·queuine tRNA-ribosyltransferase domain-containing 1 (QTRTD 1) heterodimer. We find that human QTRTD 1 (hQTRTD 1) co-purifies with polyhistidine-tagged human QTRT 1 (ht-hQTRT 1) via Ni 2 + affinity chromatography. Cross-linking experiments, mass spectrometry, and size exclusion chromatography results are consistent with the two proteins existing as a heterodimer. We {{have not been able to}} observe co-purification and/or association between hQTRT 1 and USP 14 when co-expressed in Escherichia coli. More importantly, under our experimental conditions, the transglycosylase activity of hQTRT 1 is only observed when hQTRT 1 and hQTRTD 1 have been co-expressed and co-purified. Kinetic characterization of the human TGT (hQTRT 1 ·hQTRTD 1) using human tRNATyr and guanine shows catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) similar to that of the E. coli TGT. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis confirms that the hQTRT 1 subunit is responsible for the transglycosylase activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the human TGT is composed of a catalytic subunit, hQTRT 1, and hQTRTD 1, not USP 14. hQTRTD 1 has been implicated as the salvage enzyme that generates free <b>queuine</b> from QMP. Work is ongoing in our laboratory to confirm this activity...|$|E

40|$|Transfer RNA-guanine ribosyltransferase (TGRase) irreversibly {{incorporates}} <b>queuine</b> {{into the}} first position in the anticodon of four tRNA isoacceptors. Rat brain protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to stimulate rat liver TGRase activity. TGRase preparations derived from rat liver have been observed to decrease in activity over time in storage at - 20 or - 70 degrees C. Contamination of the samples by phosphatases was indicated by a p-nitrophenylphosphate conversion test. The addition of micromolar concentrations of the phosphatase inhibitors sodium pyrophosphate and sodium fluoride into TGRase isolation buffers resulted in a greater return of TGRase activity than without these inhibitors. Inactive TGRase preparations were reactivated to their original activity {{with the addition of}} PKC. In assays combining both TGRase and PKC enzymes, inhibitors of protein kinase C (sphingosine, staurosporine, H- 7 and calphostin C) all blocked the reactivation of TGRase, whereas activators of protein kinase C (calcium, diacylglycerol and phosphatidyl serine) increased the activity of TGRase. None of the PKC modulators affected TGRase activity directly. Alkaline phosphatase, when added to assays, decreased the activity of TGRase and also blocked the reactivation of TGRase with PKC. Denaturing PAGE and autoradiography was performed on TGRase isolates that had been labelled with 32 P by PKC. The resulting strong 60 kDa band (containing the major site for phosphorylation) and weak 34. 5 kDa band (containing the TGRase activity) are suggested to associate to make up a 104 kDa heterodimer that comprises the TGRase enzyme. This was corroberated by native and denaturing size-exclusion chromatography. These results suggest that PKC-dependent phosphorylation of TGRase is tied to efficient enzymatic function and therefore control of the <b>queuine</b> modification of tRNA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe tRNA modifying enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) is {{involved}} in the exchange of guanine in the first position of the anticodon with preQ 1 as part of the biosynthesis of the hypermodified base <b>queuine</b> (Q). Mutation of Ser 90 to an alanine in Escherichia coli TGT leads to a dramatic reduction of enzymatic activity (Reuter, K. et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 7041 – 7046). To further clarify the role of this residue in the catalytic center, we have mutated the corresponding Ser 103 of the crystallizable Zymomonas mobilis TGT into alanine. The crystal structure of a TGT(S 103 A) /preQ 1 complex combined with biochemical data presented in this paper suggest that Ser 103 is essential for substrate orientation in the TGT reaction...|$|E
40|$|Annually 163 mio. {{people are}} {{affected}} by bacillary dysentery, an acute inflammatory bowel disease, caused by Shigella bacteria. Shigella {{have the ability to}} invade the colonic epithelium in humans, thereby causing an acute mucosal inflammation. The invasive phenotype is encoded on a virulence plasmid. The expression of the so-called invasion genes is controlled by a virulence factor VirF. The translation of the virF mRNA depends on the activity of a tRNA modifying enzyme – the tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT). TGT-mutants of Shigella are almost unable to penetrate host cells. In {{the first part of this}} work, the pathogenicity factor genes ipaA, ipgB 2, ospD 1, spa 15, and ipgE, which are required at different points of the Shigella invasion mechanism, were cloned into several plasmid vectors and expressed in E. coli. In case of IpaA, OspD 1, and IpgB 2 only insoluble protein was obtained while in case of IpgE a purification protocol could be successfully established. Purified IpgE was identified via mass spectrometry and crystallisation conditions were detected. In the second part of this work, mutagenesis studies on a drug design target – the TGT – were performed. Bacterial tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) catalyses the exchange of guanine in the wobble position of particular tRNAs by the modified base preQ 1. In vitro, however, the enzyme is also able to insert the immediate biosynthetic precursor, preQ 0, into those tRNAs. This substrate promiscuity is based on a peptide switch in the active site, gated by the general acid/base Glu 235. The switch alters the properties of the binding pocket to allow either the accommodation of guanine or preQ 1. The peptide conformer recognising guanine, however, is also able to bind preQ 0. To investigate selectivity regulation, kinetic data for Zymomonas mobilis TGT (ZmTGT) were recorded. They show that selectivity in favour of the actual substrate preQ 1 over preQ 0 is not achieved by a difference in affinity but via a higher turn-over rate. Moreover, a TGT(E 235 Q) variant was constructed. The mutation was intended to stabilise the peptide switch in the conformation favouring guanine and preQ 0 binding. Kinetic characterisation of the mutated enzyme revealed that the Glu 235 Gln exchange has, with respect to all substrate bases, no influence on kcat. In contrast, KM(preQ 1) is drastically increased while KM(preQ 0) seemes to be decreased. Hence, regarding kcat/KM as an indicator for catalytic efficiency, selectivity of TGT in favour of preQ 1 is abolished or even inverted in favour of preQ 0 for TGT(E 235 Q). Crystal structures of the mutated enzyme confirm that the mutation strongly favours the binding pocket conformation required for the accommodation of guanine and preQ 0. The way this is achieved, however, significantly differs from what was predicted based on crystal structures of wild type TGT. tRNA-guanine transglycosylases (TGT) - present in all three domains of life - catalyse a base exchange reaction in tRNAs. In bacteria, the mechanistic pathway of the guanine exchange towards the modified base preQ 1 is well characterised due to crystal structure analyses and elaborate kinetic studies of ZmTGT. As TGT plays a key role in pathogenicity of Shigella, the causative agent of bacterial dysentery, it has been established as a target for structure-based drug design. However, eukaryotes also possess a TGT with high homology to the bacterial one and most residues inside the binding pocket are conserved. In an analogous reaction the base <b>queuine</b> is incorporated into tRNA. Hence, it is of utmost importance to study selectivity-determining features. Since no crystal structure of an eukaryotic TGT is yet available, in this study based on ZmTGT a genetically engineered human TGT binding pocket was designed as a model system. Three amino acids specific for the human TGT binding pocket were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of the ZmTGT gene, (C 158 V, (A 232 S), V 233 G). After purification, kinetic measurements and crystallisation were performed. Modified assays showed that - surprisingly – the Zm TGT variants have dramatically slowed down so that kinetic parameters could not be determined for incorporation of <b>queuine</b> into tRNA. Nevertheless, crystal structure analysis and molecular dynamics simulations indicate a possible binding of <b>queuine</b> to the active site of the variants. Additionally, it was observed that the wild type enzyme is able to excorporate labeled guanine from tRNA in the presence of <b>queuine.</b> MD simulations indicate that the enzyme is able to open up a subpocket that potentially could accommodate <b>queuine...</b>|$|E
40|$|In eubacteria, the {{biosynthesis}} of <b>queuine,</b> {{a modified}} base {{found in the}} wobble position (# 34) of tRNAs coding for Tyr, His, Asp, and Asn, occurs via a multistep pathway. One of the key enzymes in this pathway, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), exchanges the genetically encoded guanine at position 34 with a <b>queuine</b> precursor, preQ 1. Previous studies have identified a minimal positive RNA recognition motif for Escherichia coli TGT consisting of a stable minihelix that contains a U-G-U sequence starting at the second position of its seven base anticodon loop. Recently, we reported that TGT was capable of recognizing the U-G-U sequence outside of this limited structural context. To further characterize the ability of TGT to recognize the U-G-U sequence in alternate contexts, we constructed mutants of the previously characterized E. coli tRNA(Tyr) minihelix. The U-G-U sequence was shifted to various positions within the anticodon loop of these mutants. Characterization of these analogs demonstrates {{that in addition to}} the normal U 33 G 34 U 35 position, TGT can also recognize the U 34 G 35 U 36 analog (UGU(+ 1)). The other analogs were not active. This indicates that the recognition of the U-G-U sequence is not strictly dependent upon its position relative to the stem. In E. coli, the full-length tRNA with a U 34 G 35 U 36 anticodon sequence is one of the isoacceptors that codes for threonine. We found that TGT is able to recognize tRNA(Thr(UGU)) but only {{in the absence of a}} uridine at position 33. U 33, an invariant base present in all tRNAs, has been shown to strongly influence the conformation of the anticodon loop of certain tRNAs. We find that mutation of this base confers on TGT the ability to recognize U 34 G 35 U 36, and suggests that loop conformation affects recognition. The fact that the other analogs were not active indicates that although TGT is capable of recognizing the U-G-U sequence in additional contexts, this recognition is not indiscriminate...|$|E

40|$|Shigella flexneri {{is a human}} enteropathogen that invades the {{intestinal}} mucosa and results in severe bacillary dysentery. With the emergence of multiantibiotic-resistant strains, the development of novel therapeutics against critical S. flexneri target proteins promises a more effective treatment regimen for shigellosis. VirF is the positive regulator of transcription in the Shigella spp. virulence cascade, and ∆virF mutant strains of S. flexneri are avirulent. Although many cellular factors are associated with expression of the VirF protein (i. e., temperature, pH), previous studies demonstrated that the concentration of VirF protein is decreased by 60 % in ∆vacC mutant strains of S. flexneri. VacC is tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), an RNA-modification enzyme that catalyzes the incorporation of the modified nucleoside queuosine (Q) in substrate tRNA. We have studied the VirF protein as a novel antibacterial target in Shigella flexneri, {{with a focus on}} both modulation of VirF expression by TGT and expression and activity of the VirF protein itself. We hypothesized that TGT modulates VirF protein expression through <b>queuine</b> modification at both the level of tRNA and the virF mRNA. We report that the modification state of tRNA with <b>queuine</b> and the Q-cognate codon usage (NAU versus NAC codons) in the target mRNA alters the rate of protein expression. VirF mRNA contains an overall bias of 80 % for the NAU Q-cognate codons, and it is conceivable that the subtle decrease in VirF protein expression in the S. flexneri (∆vacC) mutant results from the absence of queuine-modified tRNA. In addition, we report that the virF mRNA is itself a substrate for the eubacterial TGT in vitro. Modification of RNA sequences (termed riboswitches) with small molecule metabolites has been shown to modulate either transcription or translation of the target RNA. To measure VirF activity in the presence of small molecules, we report the development of a high-throughput cell-based reporter assay using a virB operator-β-galactosidase fusion. We have screened approximately 42, 000 small molecules and report the identification of 7 compounds with low to mid-micromolar IC 50 values in the VirF – β-galactosidase assay.

Indeed, tRNA extracted from an E. coli ΔfolE strain is devoid of Q and the deficiency is complemented by expressing GCYH-I-encoding genes from different bacterial or archaeal origins. In a similar fashion, tRNA extracted from a Haloferax volcanii strain carrying a deletion of the GCYH-I-encoding gene contains only traces of G+.
