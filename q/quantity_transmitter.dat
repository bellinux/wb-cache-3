40|$|Curarized {{cutaneous}} pectoris nerve-muscle preparations from frogs were stimulated at 10 /s or at 2 /s {{for periods}} ranging from 20 min to 4 h. End plate potential were recorded intracellularly {{and used to}} estimate the <b>quantity</b> of <b>transmitter</b> secreted {{during the period of}} stimulation. At the ends of the periods of stimulation the preparations were either fixed for electron microscopy or treated with black widow spider venom to determine the <b>quantities</b> of <b>transmitter</b> remainind in the terminal. Horseradish peroxidase or dextran was added to the bathing solution and used as a tracer to detect the formation of vesicles from the axolemma. During 4 h of stimulation at 2 /s many new vesicles were formed from the axolemma and the <b>quantity</b> of <b>transmitter</b> secreted was several times greater than the quantity in the initial store. After this period of stimulation, the terminals were severely depleted of transmitter, but not of vesicles, and their general morphological organization was normal. During 20 min of stimulation at 10 /s the nerve terminals swelled and were severely depleted both of vesicles and of transmitter. During a subsequent hour of rest the changes in morphology were largely reversed, many new vesicles were formed from the axolemma and the stores of transmitter were partially replenished, These results suggest (a) that synaptic vesicles fuse with, and re-form from, the membrane of the nerve terminal during and after stimulation and (b), that the re-formed vesicles can store and release transmitter...|$|R
40|$|Neurotransmitters {{are stored}} in {{synaptic}} vesicles, {{where they have been}} assumed to be in free solution. Here we report that in Torpedo synaptic vesicles, only 5 % of the total acetylcholine (ACh) or ATP content is free, and that the rest is adsorbed to an intravesicular proteoglycan matrix. This matrix, which controls ACh and ATP release by an ion-exchange mechanism, behaves like a smart gel. That is, it releases neurotransmitter and changes its volume when challenged with small ionic concentration change. Immunodetection analysis revealed that the synaptic vesicle proteoglycan SV 2 is the core of the intravesicular matrix and is responsible for immobilization and release of ACh and ATP. We suggest that in the early steps of vesicle fusion, this internal matrix regulates the availability of free diffusible ACh and ATP, and thus serves to modulate the <b>quantity</b> of <b>transmitter</b> released...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to study the {{potentiation}} of the AMPA and NMDA components of minimal excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) evoked by activation of restricted numbers of synapses. EPSC of neurons in field CA 1 in hippocampal slices were recorded in whole-call patch-clamp conditions selected such that both (AMPA and NMDA) components were present, and these were measured in parallel using computational methods in combination with pharmacological receptor blockade. There was a quite strong correlation between the amplitudes of the AMPA and NMDA components and this was regarded as evidence that they were generated by the same synapses. In cases producing this correlation, both components showed essentially equal long-term potentiation lasting from 5 min to 2 h after afferent tetanization. The data {{did not support the}} postsynaptic hypothesis and were in better agreement with the concept that the major mechanism for the persistence of the initial phase of long-term potentiation (up to 1 – 2 h) is based on increases in the <b>quantity</b> of <b>transmitter</b> released presynaptically.

40|$|The {{action of}} an anticholinesterase and an antimuscarinic drug upon nerve-induced contractions {{of the rat}} urinary bladder were {{examined}} during transmural stimulation at 20 Hz. Responses were graded in magnitude by limiting {{the duration of the}} stimulus trains. 2 Responses of low magnitude produced by short stimulus trains were unchanged by atropine; however, maximal responses resulting from long stimulus trains were diminished in magnitude and shortened in duration. 3 Responses of small magnitude elicited by short stimulus trains involve muscarinic receptors in close proximity to the neuroeffector junction and are resistant to atropine. 4 Maximal responses elicited by long stimulus trains involve 'junctional' muscarinic receptors as well as receptors located at the periphery of the junction; the 'extrajunctional' receptors are blocked by atropine. 5 Responses of low magnitude produced by short stimulus trains were unaffected by echothiophate; however, the duration of maximal responses resulting from the long stimulus trains was extended. 6 The inhibition of cholinesterase did not increase the occupation of muscarinic receptors by the transmitter; however, after large <b>quantities</b> of <b>transmitter</b> were released by the long stimulus trains the association between the receptors and acetylcholine was prolonged...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a meal to {{increase}} or decrease brain neurotransmitter synthesis has been studied. It is concluded that brain serotonin synthesis is directly controlled by the proportions of carbohydrate to protein in meals and snacks that increase or decrease brain tryptophan levels, thereby changing the substrate saturation of tryptophan hydroxylase {{and the rate of}} serotonin synthesis. The ability of serotoninergic neurons to have their output coupled to dietary macronutrients enables them to function as sensors of peripheral metabolism, and to subserve {{an important role in the}} control of appetite. The robust and selective responses of catecholaminergic and cholinergic neurons to supplemental tyrosine and choline suggest that these compounds may become useful as a new type of drug for treating deseases or conditions in which adequate <b>quantities</b> of the <b>transmitter</b> would otherwise be unavailable...|$|R

Blind beamforming is an effective technique for beamforming and channel estimation without the need of training sequences, thus not consuming extra bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel joint power control and blind beamforming algorithm that reformulates the power control problem {{in such a way that}} it does not need any prior knowledge and additional measurements in the physical layer. In contrast to the traditional schemes that optimize SINR and, as a result, minimize bit error rate (BER), our proposed algorithm achieves the desired BER by adjusting a quantity available from blind beamforming.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the relation between}} resting intragastric pressure and neuronally evoked motility responses, the stomach of the anaesthetized ferret was inflated with two volumes within the physiological range. Vagal evoked contractions decreased as the resting pressure was increased. The decrease affected responses to high, but not low, intensity stimulation of the vagus. Vagal evoked relaxation of the stomach increased as a linear function of resting pressure. Atropine lowered the resting pressure in vagotomized ferrets but did not alter the relation between vagal evoked relaxation and resting pressure. Intra-arterial acetylcholine evoked a contraction followed by a relaxation. The contraction was reduced at higher resting pressures but the relaxation increased. Hexamethonium {{had no effect on}} the contraction but substantially reduced the relaxation. Stimulation of the greater splanchnic nerve evoked two responses. The first, direct relaxation of the stomach (independent of cholinergic activity), bore the same relation to resting pressure as vagal evoked relaxation. The second, inhibition of vagal evoked contraction, had no relation to resting pressure. The degree of reduction in the amplitude of vagal evoked contraction by an immediately preceding vagal stimulation decreased at higher resting pressures. This was the opposite of vagal evoked relaxation. The capacity of stimulation of one cervical vagus to evoke a response as large as that from stimulation of two cervical vagi was shown to depend on the use of near-maximal levels of stimulation. At low levels of stimulation the responses to two vagi were additive, and at the lowest levels there was facilitation. It was concluded that the effect of resting pressure on the amplitude of evoked contractions was mediated mainly by smooth muscle, although modulation of the <b>quantities</b> of <b>transmitter</b> released from nerves could play a minor part. The practical implications of manipulating resting pressure by changes in volume were discussed. In particular, the manipulation of resting pressure as a method of differentiating the mechanisms of central nervous influence on gastric motility was compared to surgical and pharmacological nerve block...|$|R

40|$|Spherical bushy cells (SBCs) in the anteroventral {{cochlear}} nucleus {{respond to}} acoustic stimulation with discharges that precisely encode {{the phase of}} low-frequency sound. The accuracy of spiking is crucial for sound localization and speech perception. Compared to the auditory nerve input, temporal precision of SBC spiking is improved through the engagement of acoustically evoked inhibition. Recently, the inhibition was shown to be less precise than previously understood. It shifts from predominantly glycinergic to synergistic GABA/glycine transmission in an activity-dependent manner. Concurrently, the inhibition attains a tonic character through temporal summation. The present study provides a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying this slow inhibitory input. We performed whole-cell voltage clamp recordings on SBCs from juvenile Mongolian gerbils and recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at physiological rates. The data reveal activity-dependent IPSC kinetics, i. e. the decay is slowed with increased input rates or recruitment. Lowering the release probability yielded faster decay kinetics of the single- and short train-IPSCs at 100 Hz, suggesting that <b>transmitter</b> <b>quantity</b> {{plays an important role}} in controlling the decay. Slow transmitter clearance from the synaptic cleft caused prolonged receptor binding and, in the case of glycine, spillover to nearby synapses. The GABAergic component prolonged the decay by contributing to the asynchronous vesicle release depending on the input rate. Hence, the different factors controlling the amount of transmitters in the synapse jointly slow the inhibition during physiologically relevant activity. Taken together, the slow time course is predominantly determined by the receptor kinetics and transmitter clearance during short stimuli, whereas long duration or high frequency stimulation additionally engage asynchronous release to prolong IPSCs...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this project {{is to develop a}} high {{performance}} air water heat pump which is able to be introducted in the retrofit market. The system requirements of this market are heating temperatures of 65 °C, at ambient temperatures descending until - 12 °C. To provide higher base performance ratings, the choice of the thermodynamic system is a two stage heat pump with economizer exchanger. This type of heat pump has improved performances over a large range of application. For heat output adjustment it can be switched to different heating modes (single stage and two stage). For the two stage cycle, the lubrification of the compressors is a major aspect to be studied. A new online measurement method is applied to evaluate the oil quantity which migrates through the cycle. The absorption spectre of the refrigerant - oil mixture is analysed with a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and oil quantity can be extracted with high precision. (The analysis method has still to be refined). The infrared spectometers also allow to control the composition of the refrigerant mixture. A single capture of the spectre needs about 30 seconds. The measurements have to be referred to a regularly updated background spectre, which requests to vacuumize and clean the measurement cell. The oil migration is simultaneously measured with a high precision densitymeter. The output signal allows a real time follow of the oil <b>quantity</b> and the <b>transmitter</b> will give reliable results after calibration over the application range. Any change of the refrigerant composition cannot be captured by the densitymeter. The resulting density shift would therefore not be attributed correctly to the amount of oil. For the analysis of oil distribution in the whole heat pump, the measurement method to determine the oil level in the compressor crankcase, and the observation of the oil retention in the evaporator are also discussed in this project. The heat pump design has been made, based on simulations of the thermodynamic cycle and using existing parts in the laboratory, such as the evaporator and the condenser. The design aim is to avoid oil trapping and to ensure oil transport in the vapour lines of the heat pump. free download : www. waermepumpe. ch/fe/berichte. htm...|$|R
40|$|Post-testicular sperm {{maturation}} {{occurs in}} the epididymis. The ion concentration and proteins secreted into the epididymal lumen, together with testicular factors, {{are believed to be}} responsible for the maturation of spermatozoa. Disruption of the maturation of spermatozoa in the epididymis provides a promising strategy for generating a male contraceptive. However, {{little is known about the}} proteins involved. For drug development, it is also essential to have tools to study the function of these proteins in vitro. One approach for screening novel targets is to study the secretory products of the epididymis or the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are involved in the maturation process of the spermatozoa. The modified Ca 2 + imaging technique to monitor release from PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells can also be applied to monitor secretory products involved in the maturational processes of spermatozoa. PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells were chosen for evaluation of this technique as they release catecholamines from their cell body, thus behaving like endocrine secretory cells. The results of the study demonstrate that depolarisation of nerve growth factor -differentiated PC 12 cells releases factors which activate nearby randomly distributed HEL erythroleukemia cells. Thus, during the release process, the ligands reach concentrations high enough to activate receptors even in cells some distance from the release site. This suggests that communication between randomly dispersed cells is possible even if the actual <b>quantities</b> of <b>transmitter</b> released are extremely small. The development of a novel method to analyse GPCR-dependent Ca 2 + signalling in living slices of mouse caput epididymis is an additional tool for screening for drug targets. By this technique it was possible to analyse functional GPCRs in the epithelial cells of the ductus epididymis. The results revealed that, both P 2 X- and P 2 Y-type purinergic receptors are responsible for the rapid and transient Ca 2 + signal detected in the epithelial cells of caput epididymides. Immunohistochemical and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analyses showed the expression of at least P 2 X 1, P 2 X 2, P 2 X 4 and P 2 X 7, and P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 2 receptors in the epididymis. Searching for epididymis-specific promoters for transgene delivery into the epididymis is of key importance for the development of specific models for drug development. We used EGFP as the reporter gene to identify proper promoters to deliver transgenes into the epithelial cells of the mouse epididymis in vivo. Our results revealed that the 5. 0 kb murine Glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX 5) promoter can be used to target transgene expression into the epididymis while the 3. 8 kb Cysteine-rich secretory protein- 1 (CRISP- 1) promoter can be used to target transgene expression into the testis. Although the visualisation of EGFP in living cells in culture usually poses few problems, the detection of EGFP in tissue sections can be more difficult because soluble EGFP molecules can be lost if the cell membrane is damaged by freezing, sectioning, or permeabilisation. Furthermore, the fluorescence of EGFP is dependent on its conformation. Therefore, fixation protocols that immobilise EGFP may also destroy its usefulness as a fluorescent reporter. We therefore developed a novel tissue preparation and preservation techniques for EGFP. In addition, fluorescence spectrophotometry with epididymal epithelial cells in suspension revealed the expression of functional purinergic, adrenergic, cholinergic and bradykinin receptors in these cell lines (mE-Cap 27 and mE-Cap 28). In conclusion, we developed new tools for studying the role of the epididymis in sperm maturation. We developed a new technique to analyse GPCR dependent Ca 2 + signalling in living slices of mouse caput epididymis. In addition, we improved the method of detecting reporter gene expression. Furthermore, we characterised two epididymis-specific gene promoters, analysed the expression of GPCRs in epididymal epithelial cells and developed a novel technique for measurement of secretion from cells...|$|R
