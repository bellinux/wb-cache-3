Harrison tried to rest in the White House, but could not find a <b>quiet</b> <b>room</b> because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule also made rest time scarce.|$|E

The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a <b>quiet</b> <b>room</b> because of the steady crowd of office seekers.

25|$|During the 1990s Eno became {{increasingly}} interested in self-generating musical systems, {{the results of}} which he called generative music. The basic premise of generative music is the blending of several independent musical tracks, of varying sounds, length, and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again mixing with the other tracks allowing the listener to hear an almost infinite combination. In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated {{that it would take}} almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. He has presented this music in his own, and other artists', art and sound installations, most notably I Dormienti (The Sleepers), , Music for Civic Recovery Centre, The <b>Quiet</b> <b>Room</b> and Music for Prague.|$|E

2500|$|Personal Sound Amplification Products (abbreviated PSAP) are {{classified}} by the FDA as [...] "personal sound amplification devices." [...] These compact electronic devices {{are designed for}} people without hearing loss. Unlike hearing aids (which FDA classifies as devices to compensate for hearing impairment) use of PSAP does not require medical prescription.

2500|$|As a boy, Thomas Carnegie was [...] "the {{beautiful}} white-haired {{child with}} lustrous black eyes, who everywhere attracted attention". He was generally considered well-mannered but reserved, and often {{went into a}} <b>quiet</b> <b>room</b> during social gatherings. He was also noted for his quick and wry sense of humor. And while some, such as Andrew Carnegie biographer Joseph Frazier Wall have concluded that Margaret Carnegie secretly favored Thomas, others such as Richard S. Tedlow disagree and conclude that Thomas was largely isolated and lonely within the extended Carnegie family and their large coterie of friends. It is well documented that Andrew and Thomas {{did not have the}} same group of friends, and that Thomas' group was smaller. In time, Thomas Carnegie became a lifelong heavy drinker.|$|E

2500|$|SCDS-related autophony differs {{greatly in}} quality and {{range from the}} more common form which results from an open, or patulous Eustachian tube through which sufferers of this {{disorder}} {{hear the sound of}} their own voice and breathing. In contrast, patients with SCDS-related autophony report hearing their own voice as a disturbingly loud and distorted [...] "kazoo-like" [...] sound deep inside the head as if relayed through [...] "a cracked loudspeaker." [...] Additionally they may hear the creaking and cracking of joints, the sound of their footsteps when walking or running, their heartbeat and the sound of chewing and other digestive noises. Some sufferers of this condition experience such a high level of conductive hyperacusis that a tuning fork placed on the ankle will be heard in the affected ear. The bizarre phenomenon of being able to hear the sound of the eyeballs moving in their sockets (e.g. when reading in a <b>quiet</b> <b>room)</b> [...] "like sandpaper on wood" [...] {{is one of the more}} distinctive features of this condition and is almost exclusively associated with SCDS.|$|E
2500|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{successful}} method of treatment that [...] "cures" [...] musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression. Sanchez reported that some authors {{have suggested that the}} use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms. They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones. Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an [...] "ocean of sound" [...] despite being in a <b>quiet</b> <b>room</b> due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, [...] "I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again." [...] Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said [...] "Not on your life." ...|$|E

50|$|The effect reverses in a {{reverberation}} room, which echoes {{real life}} {{more so than}} the typical <b>quiet</b> <b>rooms</b> used for experimentation.

2500|$|The {{passenger}} terminal covers [...] and is [...] long. The terminal area has 52 aircraft parking stands, of which 34 are connected with bridges and 18 are remotely parked. Domestic gates {{are located in}} the west wing, while gates for international flights are in the east, with gates for non-Schengen area flights {{at the very end of}} the wing. Four gates near the end of the east wing are flexigates where doors can be opened or closed to switch between Schengen and non-Schengen flights. EU controllers have been somewhat sceptical of the Schengen/non-Schengen flexigates, and there were a few incidents where the wrong doors were opened so that passengers who should have gone through the border control did not. A new pier that extends northwards from the terminal was opened in 2017. To compensate for the gates lost in the interim period, an extra pier south of and parallel to the west wing was constructed in 2012 for domestic flights. This [...] "pier south" [...] has eight gates that all lack jet bridges, and was intended for demolition after five years. The extension gives a capacity of 32 million; in 2016, 25.7 million passengers used the airport. The airport is [...] "silent", so announcements for flights are only done in the immediate vicinity of the gate. There is a playground in both the domestic and international sections, and a <b>quiet</b> <b>room</b> in the domestic section. Medical personnel is stationed at the airport.|$|E
2500|$|The {{limitations}} {{stemming from}} adapting an existing building as the Black Swan {{led to the}} design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan. Opened in March 2002 and originally named the New Theatre, it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 {{as a result of}} a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name is in recognition of long-time OSF development director Peter Thomas who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. Richard L. Hay designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of [...] is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a [...] stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a [...] stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a trap room under the stage and a fly loft at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry, green room, quiet green room, <b>quiet</b> <b>room,</b> warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, stage manager's office, maintenance space, storage for props and set pieces, and trap.|$|E
