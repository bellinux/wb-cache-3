6000|$|Now, the {{language}} of poetry is simpler than that of prose; as anyone can see who has read what the old-fashioned protestant used to call confidently [...] "his" [...] Bible. And, being simpler, it is also truer; and, being truer, it is also fiercer. And, {{for most of the}} infamies of our time, there is really nothing plain enough, except the plain language of poetry. Take, let us say, the ease of the recent railway disaster, and the acquittal of the capitalists' interest. It is not a scientific problem for us to investigate. It is a crime committed before our eyes; committed, perhaps, by blind men or maniacs, or men hypnotised, or men in some other ways unconscious; but committed in broad daylight, so that the corpse is bleeding on our door-step. Good lives were lost, because good lives do not pay; and bad coals do pay. It seems simply impossible to get any other meaning out of the matter except that. And, if in human history there be anything simple and anything horrible, it seems to have been present in this matter. If, even after some study and understanding of the old religious passions which were the resurrection of Europe, we cannot endure the extreme infamy of witches and heretics literally burned alive--well, the people in this affair were <b>quite</b> as <b>literally</b> burned alive. If, when we have really tried to extend our charity beyond the borders of personal sympathy, to all the complexities of class and creed, we still feel something insolent about the triumphant and acquitted man who is in the wrong, here the men who are in the wrong are triumphant and acquitted. It is no subject for science. It is a subject for poetry. But for poetry of a terrible sort.|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Shipment {{consolidation}} is a laborious and, sometimes, tedious {{task for}} airfreight forwarders {{since there is}} enormous information to be considered and <b>literally</b> <b>quite</b> a number of practical constraints to be fulfilled. In Hong Kong, the unique forwarding operation and rapid cargo flow has further complicated the consolidating process {{in such a way}} that local forwarders are almost impossible to achieve the best selection of logistics workflow through the functions of human brain solely. However, none of the currently available intelligent logistics system is able to aid forwarders in making decisions on this crucial operation through the entire supply chain. This paper presents a Heuristics Iterative Reasoning System (HIRS) for solving shipment consolidation problem, adopting rule-based reasoning to provide expert advice for cargo allocation and subsequently applying container loading specific heuristics to support the cargo loading process. Afterwards, the iterative improvement mechanism of HIRS undertakes all outcomes until the most optimal solution is found. A presentation of the concept of HIRS and its development are included in this paper with a case study conducted in Oriented Delivery Limited (a Hong Kong-based company) to validate its feasibility.

40|$|This study investigates {{strategies}} used when translating compound nouns from German to Swedish. The source text translated {{and used for}} the analysis stems from the travel book Couchsurfing im Iran. Meine Reise hinter verschlossene T√ºren by Stephan Orth (2015). The focus {{of the study is}} twofold: 1) examining established compounds and 2) ad hoc compounds. The quantitative part of the analysis is based on Fleischer/Barz‚Äô (2007) morphological classification of compound nouns and Vinay/Darbelnet‚Äôs (1995 / 2004) translation procedures, and also forms the basis for the qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis shows that while nearly 60 % of the established compound nouns were translated <b>literally,</b> <b>quite</b> a large number were rendered using other strategies, mainly paraphrases with nominal phrases. The translations of the ad hoc compounds showed the reverse pattern: only 36 % were translated literally, while nearly 60 % were translated with nominal phrases. The qualitative analysis suggests four major explanations for these shifts. The first is morphological limitation, where the Swedish language in some instances does not allow a certain word {{to be used as a}} compound modifier. The second is language preference, where a tendency towards a more verbal paraphrase in Swedish was noticed. The third is based on Toury‚Äôs law of growing standardization, which states that translations tend to be more explicit, in this case preferring longer and more transparent paraphrases to denser compounds. The fourth explanation is the lexical gap where ad hoc compounds proved to be particularly difficult to translate when one of their units did not have a direct counterpart in Swedish...|$|R
60|$|A part of {{the mixture}} of my {{thoughts}} during these seconds had been the possibility--absurd, preposterous though it looks when phrased here--of some change in her person that would correspond, for me to the other changes I had had such keen moments of flattering myself I had made out. I had just had them over in the smoking-room, some of these differences, and then had had time to ask myself if I were not now to be treated to the vision of the greatest, the most wonderful, of all. I had already, on facing her, after my last moments with Lady John, seen difference peep out at me, and I had seen the impression of it confirmed by what had afterwards happened. It had been in her way of turning from me after that brief passage; it had been in her going up to bed without seeing me again; it had been once more in her thinking, for reasons of her own, better of that; and it had been most of all in her sending her husband down to me. Well, wouldn't it finally be, still more than most of all----? But I scarce had known, at this point, what grossness or what fineness of material correspondence to forecast. I only had waited there with these general symptoms so present that almost any further development of them occurred to me as conceivable. So much as this was true, but I was after a moment to become aware of something by which I was as strongly affected as if I had been <b>quite</b> unprepared. Yes, <b>literally,</b> that final note, in the smoking-room, the note struck in Obert's ejaculation on poor Briss's hundred years, had failed to achieve for me a worthy implication. I was forced, after looking at Grace Brissenden a minute, to recognise that my imagination had not risen to its opportunity. The full impression took a minute--a minute during which she said nothing; then it left me deeply and above all, as I felt, discernibly conscious of the prodigious thing, the thing, I had not thought of. This it was that gave her such a beautiful chance not to speak: she was so quite sufficiently occupied with seeing what I hadn't thought of, and with seeing me, {{to make up for lost}} time, breathlessly think of it while she watched me.|$|R

6000|$|He {{was rather}} glad, none the less, {{that they had}} {{in point of fact}} not parted at the Cheval Blanc, that he hadn't been reduced to giving them his blessing for an idyllic retreat down the river. He had had in the actual case to make-believe more than he liked, but this was nothing, it struck him, to what the other event would have required.

This was {{what he was trying to}} do now; but with the {{advantage}} of his being able to give more time to it a good deal counteracted by his sense of what, over and above the central fact itself, he had to swallow. It was the quantity of make-believe involved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his spiritual stomach. He moved, however, from the consideration of that quantity--to say nothing of the consciousness of that organ--back to the other feature of the show, the deep, deep truth of the intimacy revealed. That was what, in his vain vigil, he oftenest reverted to: intimacy, at such a point, was LIKE that--and what in the world else would one have wished it to be like? It was all very well for him to feel the pity of its being so much like lying; he almost blushed, in the dark, for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness, as a little girl might have dressed her doll. He had made them--and by no fault of their own--momentarily pull it for him, the possibility, out of this vagueness; and must he not therefore take it now as they had had simply, with whatever thin attenuations, to give it to him? The very question, it may be added, made him feel lonely and cold. There was the element of the awkward all round, but Chad and Madame de Vionnet had at least the comfort that they could talk it over together. With whom could HE talk of such things?--unless indeed always, at almost any stage, with Maria?

6000|$|And for the rest, {{there is}} {{undoubtedly}} an enormous mass of sensible, rather thoughtless people, whose rooted sentiment {{it is that}} any deep change in our society must be in some way infinitely distant. They cannot believe that men in hats and coats like themselves can be preparing a revolution; all their Victorian philosophy has taught them that such transformations are always slow. Therefore, when I speak of Eugenic legislation, or {{the coming of the}} Eugenic State, they think of it as something like The Time Machine or Looking Backward: a thing that, good or bad, will have to fit itself to their great-great-great-grandchild, who may be very different and may like it; and who in any case is rather a distant relative. To all this I have, to begin with, a very short and simple answer. The Eugenic State has begun. The first of the Eugenic Laws has already been adopted by the Government of this country; and passed with the applause of both parties through the dominant House of Parliament. This first Eugenic Law clears the ground and may be said to proclaim negative Eugenics; but it cannot be defended, and nobody has attempted to defend it, except on the Eugenic theory. I will call it the Feeble-Minded Bill both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate. It is, <b>quite</b> simply and <b>literally,</b> a Bill for incarcerating as madmen those whom no doctor will consent to call mad. It is enough if some doctor or other may happen to call them weak-minded. Since there is scarcely any human being to whom this term has not been conversationally applied by his own friends and relatives on some occasion or other (unless his friends and relatives have been lamentably lacking in spirit), it can be clearly seen that this law, like the early Christian Church (to which, however, it presents points of dissimilarity), is a net drawing in of all kinds. It must not be supposed that we have a stricter definition incorporated in the Bill. Indeed, the first definition of [...] "feeble-minded" [...] in the Bill was much looser and vaguer than the phrase [...] "feeble-minded" [...] itself. It is a piece of yawning idiocy about [...] "persons who though capable of earning their living under favourable circumstances" [...] (as if anyone could earn his living if circumstances were directly unfavourable to his doing so), are nevertheless [...] "incapable of managing their affairs with proper prudence"; which is exactly what all the world and his wife are saying about their neighbours all over this planet. But as an incapacity for any kind of thought is now regarded as statesmanship, there is nothing so very novel about such slovenly drafting. What is novel and what is vital is this: that the defence of this crazy Coercion Act is a Eugenic defence. It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged, that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children. Every tramp who is sulky, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point. England has forgotten the Feudal State; it is in the last anarchy of the Industrial State; there is much in Mr. Belloc's theory that it is approaching the Servile State; it cannot at present get at the Distributive State; it has almost certainly missed the Socialist State. But we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.|$|R
6000|$|The {{particular}} {{ground for}} our defection, which I obscurely pronounced mistaken, was that since William was {{to embrace the}} artistic career--and freedom for this experiment had been after all, as I repeat that it was always in like cases to be, {{not in the least}} grudgingly granted him--our return to America would place him in prompt and happy relation to William Hunt, then the most distinguished of our painters as well {{as one of the most}} original and delightful of men, and who had cordially assured us that he would welcome such a pupil. This was judged among us at large, other considerations aiding, a sound basis for action; but never surely had so odd a motive operated for a break with the spell of Paris. We named the motive generally, I think, and to the credit of our earnest good faith, with confidence--and I am of course not sure how often our dear father may not explicatively have mentioned the shy fact that he himself in any case had gradually ceased to [...] "like" [...] Europe. This affects me at present as in the highest degree natural: it was to be his fortune for the rest of his life to find himself, as a worker in his own field and as to what he held most dear, scantly enough heeded, reported or assimilated even in his own air, no brisk conductor at any time of his remarkable voice; but in Europe his isolation had been utter--he had there had the sense of playing his mature and ardent thought over great dense constituted presences and opaque surfaces that could by their very nature scarce give back so much as a shudder. No more admirable case of apostolic energy combined with philosophic patience, of constancy of conviction and solitary singleness of production unperturbed, can I well conceive; and I certainly came later on to rejoice in his having had after a certain date to walk, if there was a preference, rather in the thin wilderness than in the thick. I dare say that when we returned to America toward the end of 1860, some five years and a half after our departure, it may have been with illusions not a few for him about the nature of the desert, or in other words about the degree of sensibility of the public, there awaiting him; but the pretext given him by his so prized and admired eldest son was at the worst, and however eccentric our action, inspiring: I alone of the family perhaps made bold not to say <b>quite</b> directly or <b>literally</b> that we went home to learn to paint. People stared or laughed when we said it, and I disliked their thinking us so simple--though dreaming too a little perhaps that they might have been struck with our patriotism. This however conveyed but a chill the more--since we didn't in the least go to our friend, who had been Couture's and Fr√®re's pupil, who had spent years in France and of whom it was the common belief that you couldn't for the life of you tell him from a French painter, because he was patriotic; but because he was distinguished and accomplished, charming and kind, and above all known to us and thereby in a manner guaranteed. He looked, as people get to look under such enjoyed or even suffered exposures, extremely like a Frenchman, and, what was noteworthy, still more like a sculptor of the race than a painter; which doubtless had to do with my personally, though I hope, in present cultivated anxiety, not too officiously, sighing at all the explanation the whole thing took. I am bound to add none the less that later on, repatriated and, as to my few contacts, reassured, I found this amount, the apprehension of which had haunted me, no great charge; and seem even to make out that for the first six months of our Newport phase at least we might have passed for strikingly wise. For here was, beyond doubt, a genial, an admirable master; and here also--at such a rate did sparse individuals, scattered notches in the long plain stick, count--was John La Farge. Here moreover--here and everywhere about me, before we could quite turn round--was the War, with its infinite, its truly quite humiliating correction of my (as I now can but so far call it) fatuous little confidence that [...] "appearances," [...] on the native scene, would run short. They were in the event, taking one thing with another, never to hold out for me as they held during those four years. Wondrous this force in them as I at present look back--wondrous I mean in view of that indirectness of its play which my conditions confined me, with such private, though I must add, alas, such helplessly unapplied resentment, to knowing it by. If the force was great the attenuation of its reach was none the less preappointed and constant; so that the case must have come back again but to the degree--call it too, frankly, the force--of one's sensibility, or in other words the blest resource, the supremely breatheable and thereby nourishing and favouring air of one's imaginative life. There were of a truth during that time probably more appearances at one's command in the way of felt aspects, images, apprehended living relations and impressions of the stress of life, than during any other season one was to know; only doubtless with more of the work of their figuring to their utmost, their giving all they could, to do by one's self and, in the last resort, deep within one's breast. The point to be made just here, in any case, is that if we had not recrossed the sea, by way, rather, of such an anticlimax, to William Hunt, we should certainly with brief delay have found ourselves doing it, on the first alarm of War, for the experience I thus too summarily glance at and which I don't pretend to speak of as all my own.|$|R

She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, <b>quite</b> <b>literally,</b> the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E
500|$|Grant's Treasury Secretary, George S. Boutwell, sent Sherman (who was by now Senate Finance Committee Chairman) a {{draft of}} {{what would become the}} Coinage Act of 1873. The list of legal coins {{duplicated}} that of the previous coinage act, leaving off only the silver dollar and two smaller coins. The rationale given in the Treasury report accompanying the draft bill was that to mint a gold dollar and a silver dollar with different intrinsic values was problematic; as the silver dollar did not circulate and the gold did, it made sense to drop the unused coin. Opponents of the bill would later call this omission the [...] "Crime of '73," [...] and would mean it <b>quite</b> <b>literally,</b> circulating tales of widespread bribery of Congressmen by foreign agents. Sherman emphasized in his memoirs that the bill was openly debated for several years and passed both Houses with overwhelming support and that, given the continued circulation of smaller silver coins at the same 16:1 ratio, nothing had been [...] "demonetized," [...] as his opponents claimed. Silver was still legal tender, but only for sums up to five dollars. On the other hand, later scholars have suggested that Sherman and others wished to demonetize silver for years and move the country onto a gold-only standard of currency‚Äînot for some corrupt gain, but because they believed it was the path to a strong, secure currency.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics who praised the collaboration between Rowland and Guetta. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said [...] "It {{looks as though}} they're going to be ruling the airwaves all over again... After she lulls us into {{a false sense of}} security ("I feel like the DJ is bodyguard / You see the way he keeps me safe? / With the treble and the bass?"), the track plunges into a pounding electro-house chorus that <b>quite</b> <b>literally</b> orders us to the dance floor... The result isn't quite as fresh and inventive as some of Guetta's recent output ‚Äì Kelis' [...] 'Acapella', for example ‚Äì but it goes a long way towards recapturing some of last summer's magic." [...] The site's other reviewer, Nick Levine, agreed saying that the song [...] "thumps as persuasively as Muhammad Ali circa 1967." [...] Robert Daw of Idolator said [...] "if you think Ms. Kelly is taking the go-go boots off anytime soon, then you'd best go lean against the wall, flower. Rowland's Guetta-produced new single 'Commander' is pure strobe-light adrenaline rush... will appear on Kelly's as-yet-untitled third solo album... we're predicting a full on Rowland Renaissance!". With Alex Catarinella of Paper saying [...] "she belts out soaring vocals, is further proof that she's no longer the cute teenage girl sharing a chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{an advance}} {{screening}} at CinemaCon on April 22, 2015, {{the film was}} well received by audiences. Praise was aimed for its smart storyline, although some wondered whether the concept was too complicated for young audiences and to attract family crowds. After premiering at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film attracted praise from film critics. Peter Debruge of Variety was effusive, calling it the studio's [...] "greatest idea" [...] and [...] "a stunningly original concept that [...] promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips called it the studio's best since Up (also directed by Docter), a [...] "consistently inventive and a heartening corrective to recent, stockholder-driven inferiorities." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter deemed it an [...] "audacious concept" [...] that stands among the most [...] "conceptually trippy films" [...] for family audiences. [...] "With its <b>quite</b> <b>literally</b> cerebral bent, I think Inside Out might have some trouble fully connecting with younger kids, but grown-ups are likely to shed {{more than a few}} tears," [...] remarked Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw felt it [...] "buoyant and sweet-natured," [...] though slightly inferior to Pixar's best. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club, while overall positive on the film, said it [...] "trades the wordless gracefulness and sense of discovery of the animation studio's best work for explanatory voice-over and nonstop exposition," [...] also arguing that the Pixar animators could have been more visually adventurous to match the conceptual ambition.|$|E
