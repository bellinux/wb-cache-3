5|$|The {{naming of}} Q4 {{presented}} a headache for Smallpeice, realising {{that he could}} not seek permission to call the ship the <b>Queen</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> II, as only Royal Navy battleships had been named after a reigning monarch. Smallpeice discussed the issue with the Queen's Private Secretary Sir Michael Adeane and it was agreed that they would recommend to Her Majesty that the ship be named <b>Queen</b> <b>Elizabeth.</b> This was in keeping with normal Cunard practice of reusing previous ships names and didn't present any issues as {{the old and the new}} ships would not be in Cunard service at the same time. Elizabeth II launched the ship on 20 September 1967 but surprised and delighted Smallpeice and the invited guests when she named the ship <b>Queen</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> the Second. Smallpeice believed using the style <b>Queen</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> II wasn't entirely appropriate, it being the designation of the sovereign, and sought permission to use an Arabic 2 in place of Roman numerals.|$|E
