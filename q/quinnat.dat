40|$|This study {{investigated}} smoltification and seawater adaptability of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and <b>quinnat</b> salmon (O. tshawytscha). Both species were introduced into New Zealand with an anadromous population of <b>quinnat</b> and a totally freshwater population of sockeye salmon becoming established. The sockeye {{were found to}} be capable of successfully adapting to sea water and appeared not to have lost their hypoosmoregulatory ability despite being landlocked for approximately 90 years. The physiological changes associated with smoltification and seawater adaptation were studied and were viewed in part with reference to physiological stress. Salmon exposed to a handling or temperature stressor showed an increase in plasma cortisol concentrations and depending on the severity of the stressor, a change in haematocrit and an osmotic imbalance could also result. The physiological state of the salmon (pre-smoltified, smoltified, desmoltified) was assessed {{in a variety of ways}} and the reliability of the parameters measured related to the seawater adaptability of the salmon. Increased gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity provided the best indicator of smoltification. Plasma cortisol concentrations also increased in smoltifying salmon. The seawater adaptability of the salmon was found to be dependent on both the degree of smoltification that had occurred in the salmon and on the temperature of the sea water. High seawater temperatures limited the ability of the salmon to successfully adapt. Rapid increases in plasma cortisol occurred when salmon were transferred directly to sea water, but returned to basal levels within 12 hours in the fish that successfully adapted. Plasma cortisol concentrations remained elevated in the salmon that failed to adapt to the sea water. Morphological changes in the gills of sockeye salmon that successfully and unsuccessfully adapted to sea water were also investigated...|$|E
40|$|Gill morphometry and {{hematology}} {{of juvenile}} chinook salmon chronically exposed to treated (elemental chlorine-free) {{bleached kraft pulp}} mill effluent at low temperature to simulate winter exposure G. M. Kruzynski, A. P. Farrell, K. B. Tierney, S. M. Sanders, and I. K. Birtwell Abstract: We used an on-site mobile laboratory to assess the effects of pulp mill effluent on juvenile (~ 0. 9 g) chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792), that normally overwinter under ice in the upper Fraser River at Prince George, British Columbia. After a 28 -day exposure at 0. 4 – 2. 7 °C to secondary-treated bleached kraft mill effluent (TBKME; 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, 8 %, or 16 %) under both normoxic and hypoxic (~ 67 % air saturation) conditions, hematocrit (Hct), leucocrit (Lct), and differential {{white blood cell counts}} were determined and gills were examined for gross and fine morphometry. TBKME had no effect on either Hct or Lct, but the highest TBKME concentration (16 %) increased lymphocyte numbers, reduced secondary lamellae numbers, and increased the blood–water diffusion distance of secondary lamellae. Given the relatively high TBKME concentration, compared with actual discharges to the river, and the small physiological changes observed, it appears that chronic winter exposure of juvenile chinook salmon to TBKME under hypoxic winter conditions is unlikely to produce major disturbances to these aspects of the fish’s physi-ology.

40|$|Many {{groups and}} {{individuals}} are involved in decision making for the allocation of the salmon resource. A comprehensive study of the economics of salmon ranching in New Zealand has not previously been undertaken. Before informed decisions can be made, such a study is essential. In this project, the economic potential of salmon ranching is examined, and the major variables that influence the economic return are identified. Preliminary to the economic analysis, the features of commercial salmon ranching in New Zealand are outlined. <b>Quinnat</b> salmon biology is described, and the environmental parameters that influence the operation of a salmon ranch are discussed. The history of commercial harvesting of salmon in New Zealand is detailed, along with the influence of salmon anglers on ranching policy. Local and export markets for salmon are examined for each product category, and the prospects in the major markets are assessed. A simulation model that incorporates the important linkages between biological and economic variables is developed. The model is {{used to determine the}} net benefits to the nation from operating a salmon ranch. Subsequently, the sensitivity of economic return to the biological and economic variables is tested. Finally, the model is used to evaluate the effect of three aspects of salmon management policy on economic return, namely; ranch location, other forms of salmon aquaculture, and disposal of salmon caught at sea. Results show that salmon ranching can yield an "acceptable" economic return to the nation under certain conditions. Economic return is found to be most sensitive to the biological variables of hatchery carrying capacity, hatchery mortality, and survival of released salmon. Market price and feed costs are identified as the most significant of the economic variables. Ranch location is revealed to be a crucial factor in determining the economic return from salmon ranching. Taking these results into account, the characteristics of a salmon ranching investment are examined and found to diverge significantly from alternative investments. From this, it is concluded that unless salmon ranches can be located at or near river mouths, development of a salmon ranching industry that also enhances the sports fishery is unlikely to occur...|$|E
40|$|Chinook / <b>quinnat</b> salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) {{is unique}} to New Zealand insofar as it is an {{introduced}} species that receives special provisions for conservation and enhancement under the Conservation Act 1987 and habitat protection under the Resource Management Act 1991. In the past, however, the species has held differing statuses. Over 100 years ago, salmon were imported and released into New Zealand rivers to establish a commercial wild fishery, but since then their status has generally shifted between commercial product and recreational resource due to environmental limitations and pressures from various interest groups. More recently, 'wild' salmon have been promoted for their significant conservation role for conserving rivers and water. This has added further complexity to assessing their perceived status in wildlife management in New Zealand. In order to better understand how salmon have arrived at such a unique position {{in the context of}} wildlife management in New Zealand, a review of the social, cultural, political, and economic pressures to management are necessary. As the management of this species has become a very topical issue, it is becoming increasingly important to better understand the social dimensions involved in the management of salmon. Thus, it is appropriate to draw on a theoretical position offered by the social sciences. The momentum in social constructivist work provides a fitting starting point. Increasingly, social constructivists are constructing views of wildlife species and their management to develop understandings and make transparent the influences and interactions between society and wildlife management. This thesis roots itself in social construction theory and attempts to adopt an interdisciplinary approach towards constructing salmon from a "moderate constructivist" position. By assessing the historical and current literature as well as deploying quantitative surveys in respect to the New Zealand Salmon Anglers Association and qualitative interviews with targeted stakeholder groups, this thesis illustrates the historical and current constructions of salmon in New Zealand. The thesis provides an in-depth understanding of how salmon are currently framed, lending insight to the most recent management movement; Fish & Game New Zealand's proposed salmon management plan. The thesis then makes recommendations and offers an interpretation on the proposed salmon management plan from a moderate constructivist position, suggests areas for further research, and discusses what lies ahead for salmon management in New Zealand. The thesis concludes with a brief commentary on how this thesis may contribute towards social construction theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bulletin}} is primarily to establish official common names of the California fishes which are handled commercially, or which are {{of particular interest to}} fishermen or dealers. The authority for this work is derived from a State law enacted in 1919, which provides that "the Fish and Game Commission shall have the power to decide what is the common usage name of any variety. " Incidentally, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has attempted to provide a handbook for the convenience of marketmen, sportsmen and others who are interested in our natural resources. The restricted number and character of the species considered, the lack of complete keys, and the brevity of the description will make the book of small if any value to the pure scientist, for whom the work is not intended. The need for this work has arisen out of a confusion of names, which has interfered with obtaining the utmost value possible from the catch records. There are, for example, two species of salmon in California of significant commercial importance. They are both listed in the records as "salmon," although it would be advantageous to salmon investigations to have each species recorded separately. One species has been called the king salmon, Sacramento River salmon, Chinook salmon, <b>quinnat</b> salmon, Columbia River salmon, or spring salmon; the other species when recognized was known as silver salmon or silversides. Again, the young of the white sea bass was called sea trout in southern California; {{in the northern part of}} the State the sea trout is an entirely different species, not even closely related to the southern form. A very common category listed on the original records was the bluefish, a mythical species which might be Pacific cultus, cabezone, halfmoon, rockfish, opal-eye, sea trout, or corbina, depending on where and by whom the fish was caught. Any number of other examples might be given of this chaotic state of the common names of our fish, but those cited should suffice; the desirability of establishing a definite official name for each species is patent. The criterion "common usage name" has not been easy to apply. In California as elsewhere throughout the new world, common nomenclature did not grow up with the language as in Europe. The people who settled here naturally named things because of similarities—either real or apparent, superficial or significant—to familiar species in their homelands. Consequently these adopted names are not always expressions of true relationships. The horse mackerel, for example, is not a mackerel; the jack smelt bears little relationship to the true smelts; the white sea-bass is not a bass but a croaker. Where common usage requires, these names have been designated as official. However, where there have been many names for one kind of fish or many species of fish for one name, names least likely to cause confusion with other species have been adopted. Thus, it has been thought wise to call all of the species of the genus Sebastodes "rockfish," with certain individual descriptive adjectives; to abolish the term bluefish. Sometimes it has been necessary to assign adjectives to the specific names in order to distinguish between closely related species, as for example, Mexican corbina, California corbina, king salmon, silver salmon. In some instances it has been expedient arbitrarily to designate entirely new names. The scope of the book includes primarily the fish of importance and interest to commercial fishermen and dealers, although several species of slight significance are described. Purely game fishes like the trout, calico bass, large-mouthed black bass, are included because of their interest commercially from the legal point of view. The reader might be disappointed not to find some forms which appear occasionally in the markets in negligible quantities, such as the señorita or kelp fish, the dolphin, the cusk eel, or many of the kinds of shark or skate. These we have not felt of sufficient importance to be included in the scope of this bulletin. Where there are many closely related species listed under the same name, as for example, the rockfish, we present only those most frequently seen in the markets. It is our intention to revise this work in later years when there comes a shift in commercial importance of any of the species not described in the present compilation. The exploitation of certain marine or aquatic animals other than fish also comes within the governance of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the Division of Fish and Game. These are the crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, lobsters, crayfish), the mollusks (abalones, squids, octopi, clams, cockles, scallops, oysters), and certain mammals (whales and seals). The crustaceans of commercial importance and three of the mollusks (squids, octopi, and abalone) are treated in this paper. The other mollusks, and the whales and seals have been the subject of other publications issued by the Bureau. The article on scientific names and the glossary of fishing gear have been included in the hope of promoting a better understanding of these subjects...|$|E
