25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell the two apart {{is to put}} them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from the meanest bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E
25|$|Another anthropologist, Kristen Hawkes, has criticised both {{of these}} theories. On the one hand, {{opposing}} Harris, she says both that the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get more male warriors {{would have been to}} have more females as child-bearers and that having more females in a village would increase the potential for marriage alliances with other villages. Against the procreative imperative theory she points out that the corollary to well-off elites such as those in northern India wanting to maximise reproduction is that poor people would want to minimise it and thus in theory should have practiced male infanticide, which it seems they did not.|$|E

Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|When the 183rd Division {{arrived in}} Flanders became an Eingreifdivisionen for Gruppe Ypren. The divisional {{artillery}} had been reorganised, with the medium and heavy guns participating in conventional artillery bombardments {{and the three}} battalions of Field Artillery Regiment 183 being divided between the three infantry regiments. Each infantry regiment received two assault batteries and a platoon of Reserve Engineer Battalion 16, to provide observed and direct fire. Training in the new role led to infantry companies being reorganised and new specialisms being introduced. The three platoons in each company became a rifle section, an assault group, a grenade-launcher troop and a light machine-gun section. The use of hand grenades became more important and coloured flares were used as the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> signal to the rear.|$|E

500|$|During the Song dynasty, {{for those}} without formal education, the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{power and the}} upper echelons of society was to join the military. [...] If a man had a {{successful}} career {{in the military and}} could boast of victorious battles, he had a sure path to success in politics. [...] Exam-drafted scholar-officials came mostly from prominent families and could rely on their clan status to advance their careers and place in society. Many Song military officers did not have this advantage, and owed their status in society to the advantage that military power granted them. [...] Many court eunuchs such as Tong Guan (1054–1126) were eager to enlist as officers in the central army since this was a means to elevate their position at court.|$|E

A 2008 GAO report found that Marine combat planners had delayed [...] "an urgent request in 2005 for 1,169 MRAPs", primarily because then-Commandant General Michael Hagee wanted to preserve funding for up-armoring Humvees, believing they were the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> protect Marines from roadside bomb threats.|$|E

2500|$|According to Richard Pipes, {{violence}} was implicit in Marxism itself. He {{has argued that}} terror inevitably resulted from what Lenin saw as a Marxist belief that human lives are expendable {{in the cause of}} building Communism. He quoted Marx: [...] "The present generation resembles the Jews whom Moses led through the wilderness. It must not only conquer a new world, it must also perish {{in order to make a}} room for the people who are fit for a new world." [...] In 1848 Marx, commenting on a failed Vienna Uprising, wrote: [...] "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror." [...] Edvard Radzinsky noted that Joseph Stalin wrote a nota bene: [...] "Terror is the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> new society" [...] aside of the above quote in Kautsky's book, Terrorism and Communism.|$|E
2500|$|Bacteria were {{at first}} {{classified}} {{based solely on}} their shape (vibrio, bacillus, coccus etc.), presence of endospores, gram stain, aerobic conditions and motility. This system changed with the study of metabolic phenotypes, where metabolic characteristics were used. Recently, {{with the advent of}} molecular phylogeny, several genes are used to identify species, the most important of which is the 16S rRNA gene, followed by 23S, ITS region, gyrB and others to confirm a better resolution. The <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> identify to match an isolated strain to a species or genus today is done by amplifying it's 16S gene with universal primers and sequence the 1.4kb amplicon and submit it to a specialised web-based identification database, namely either Ribosomal Database Project, which align the sequence to other 16S sequences using infernal, a secondary structure bases global alignment, or ARB SILVA, which aligns sequences via SINA (SILVA incremental aligner), which does a local alignment of a seed and extends it [...]|$|E

2500|$|The precise {{number of}} creole {{languages}} is not known, particularly as many are poorly attested or documented, but {{the list of}} creole languages shows that creoles exist around the world. About one hundred creole languages have arisen since 1500. [...] These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French due to the Age of Discovery and the Atlantic slave trade that arose at that time. With the improvements in ship-building and navigation, traders {{had to learn to}} communicate with people around the world, and the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do this was to develop a pidgin, or simplified language suited to the purpose; in turn, full creole languages developed from these pidgins. In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The Middle English creole hypothesis argues that English is itself a creole. If so, this would make it the creole with the largest number of speakers. If this hypothesis is untrue, the creole with the largest number of speakers is Haitian Creole, with almost ten million native speakers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} of slavery {{was one of}} the burning issues of the day, and one that often put Wilbur Fisk at odds with many of his fellow Methodists. [...] He was a colonizationist who favored sending America's slaves to Africa. [...] He opposed the abolitionists within the church who sought to deny membership to any slaveholder or any supporter of slavery. [...] Wilbur felt that the abolitionist approach would split the church and prevent those who needed Christian love and teachings the most from receiving it. [...] He endorsed what he believed was a truly Christian, non-violent way of solving this social evil. Many felt his approach would not bring about emancipation. [...] Toward {{the end of his life}} he regretted some of his arguments, but still stood on the principle that a unified church was the <b>quickest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> emancipate slaves. [...] Whether his way would have worked is open to debate, however, in one sense he was correct—in 1844 the Methodist church did split along exactly the lines that he predicted, and only twenty years after his death the nation was plunged into war as the time for talking about slavery ended.|$|E
