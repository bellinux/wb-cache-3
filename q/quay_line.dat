50|$|Ellesmere Port {{railway station}} {{is located in}} the town of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, England. It is the {{terminal}} station of two lines on separate rail networks. The station is one of the termini of the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. The station is also the terminus of Northern's Ellesmere Port to Warrington Bank <b>Quay</b> <b>line.</b> Departures and arrivals of Merseyrail services are on platform 1 with departures and arrivals for the Warrington Bank <b>Quay</b> <b>Line</b> on platform 2.|$|E
50|$|However the <b>Quay</b> <b>line</b> served {{numerous}} industrial premises {{and remained}} in occasional use; it closed for general goods on 14 June 1965, {{and the service}} to the private sidings finished after 4 December 1967.|$|E
50|$|The London and South Western Railway's built {{twenty to}} a design by their Locomotive Superintendent William Adams at its Nine Elms Works during the 1891-1893 period. They were {{designed}} for shunting in locations with sharp curvature, and were used {{in places such as}} Southampton Docks (which the LSWR purchased in November 1892), the Poole <b>Quay</b> <b>Line,</b> and the Hamworthy Freight Branch.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Emily Jackson of the Toronto Star {{reported}} that budget over-runs on the Queens <b>Quay</b> West <b>line</b> had not left enough funds {{to start the}} Queens <b>Quay</b> East <b>line.</b>|$|R
50|$|The North Cornwall line {{closed on}} 1 October 1966 and Wadebridge station, {{along with the}} line from Bodmin, closed to {{passengers}} on 30 January 1967. The line to Padstow remained {{for a quarter of}} a mile beyond the level crossing to allow access to the <b>lines</b> serving the <b>quays</b> on the river, but the remainder of the track to Padstow, and the whole of the line to Okehampton, were lifted. Even the <b>quay</b> <b>lines</b> did not last long, with the ancillary sidings being removed in November 1971 and the <b>quay</b> <b>lines</b> themselves in April 1973, the line then being terminated short of the level crossing at Molesworth Street. In keeping with its reduced status, the buildings on the island platform and the engine shed were demolished in the years after closure with the remains of the concrete footbridge being dumped unceremoniously in the turntable pit.|$|R
50|$|Tanjung Tokong is {{a suburb}} of George Town in Penang, Malaysia. It is located along the northeastern coast of Penang Island, next to Pulau Tikus and 4 km {{northwest}} of George Town proper. Over the recent decades, the former fishing village {{has been transformed into}} an upper class residential suburb of George Town, with high-rises such as Straits <b>Quay</b> <b>lining</b> the coast.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the tramway to the Quays had not been carried out with the main line, but by October 1873 {{it was reported that}} it was completed, but could not be opened because of required alterations to the signalling on the SDR at the junction with that company's main line at Totnes. However this was soon rectified and the <b>Quay</b> <b>line</b> opened 10 November 1873; it was for goods traffic only, and was horse-operated.|$|E
50|$|Pure Grain {{was a dark}} bay {{or brown}} mare with a white star bred by William and Robert Barnett. She was sired by Polish Precedent, a lightly-raced horse who won the Prix Jacques le Marois and the Prix du Moulin in 1989 before {{sustaining}} his only defeat when finishing second to Zilzal in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring Pilsudski, Rakti, Darsi, Court Masterpiece and Polish Summer (Dubai Sheema Classic). Pure Grain's dam Mill Line was a daughter of the Barnetts' racemare <b>Quay</b> <b>Line,</b> who won the Park Hill Stakes in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{stages of}} {{constructing}} the line were proceeding and on 1 August 1857 {{the directors of}} the company announced that they had arranged with the Bristol and Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway to lease their line for ten years at £3,000 per annum. However at the shareholder meeting, the shareholders appointed a committee to review the cost of the construction, (estimated at £94,435) and the committee reported back rejecting the lease to the broad gauge interest, and recommending altering the route of the line to join the anticipated route of the L&SWR into Exeter. The L&SWR had by now made real progress in constructing a direct line to Exeter, and its subsidiary, the Yeovil and Exeter Railway, undertook to make a branch line between Exeter and Topsham; the Exeter and Exmouth Company would confine its endeavours to the section between Topsham and Exmouth. The L&SWR would work the entire line for 50% of the gross receipts in proportion to the mileages respectively constructed. The costs of Topsham station and the <b>quay</b> <b>line</b> there would be shared, ...|$|E
5000|$|The canal was {{designed}} by Peter Joseph Lenné based on earlier plans by Johann Carl Ludwig Schmid and was built between 1848 and 1852. Besides its water transport and land drainage roles, it was also conceived as a design element {{in the development of}} the surrounding area, and {{was designed}} as a decorative strip, flanked by <b>quays</b> <b>lined</b> with neoclassical buildings.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1960s Beeching Axe, Wisbech {{had three}} railway branch lines: the 1847/1848-1968 GER March to Watlington (junction), Norfolk (on the Ely to King's Lynn main line) via Wisbech East (Victoria Road); the 1866-1959 M&GN Peterborough to Sutton Bridge via Wisbech North (on Harecroft Road); and the 1883/1884-1966 GER Wisbech and Upwell Tramway. There were also harbour <b>quay</b> <b>lines</b> {{either side of}} the River Nene - M&GN Harbour West branch and GER Harbour East branch.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} threats to the sensitive marine ecosystem by toxic metals, this study investigated the metal build-up on impervious surfaces specific to commercial seaports. The knowledge generated in this study will contribute to managing toxic metal pollution of the marine ecosystem. The study found that inter-modal operations and main access roadway had the highest loads followed by container storage and vehicle marshalling sites, while the <b>quay</b> <b>line</b> and short term storage areas had the lowest. Additionally, {{it was found that}} Cr, Al, Pb, Cu and Zn were predominantly attached to solids, while significant amount of Cu, Pb and Zn were found as nutrient complexes. As such, treatment options based on solids retention can be effective for some metal species, while ineffective for other species. Furthermore, Cu and Zn are more likely to become bioavailable in seawater due to their strong association with nutrients. Mathematical models to replicate the metal build-up process were also developed using experimental design approach and partial least square regression. The models for Cr and Pb were found to be reliable, while those for Al, Zn and Cu were relatively less reliable, but could be employed for preliminary investigations...|$|E
50|$|Line B {{serves the}} western side along Mao Tse Tung Boulevard, going to Ta Khmao, {{the capital of the}} Kandal Province. Line B terminates at Night Market on Sisowath <b>Quay.</b> This <b>line</b> does not take you to Choeung Ek killing fields, as some sources claim. If you mention the killing fields the driver will tell you not to get on.|$|R
50|$|Otto Wagner was tasked by the Kommission für Verkehrsanlagen (Commission for Transport Facilities) in December 1896 {{with the}} design of the <b>quays.</b> In <b>line</b> with his plans, the 15-metre wide quays were built with sites for a fish market, a berth for {{passenger}} ships and loading bays for freight. Wager also designed the Nußdorf and Kaiserbadwehr locks and weirs and the attached houses.|$|R
50|$|The LSWR {{opened a}} route from Friary station to North Quay on 22 October 1879 {{and this was}} {{connected}} to the GWR's Sutton Harbour yard on 6 November 1879 and trains of both gauges could shunt the <b>quays.</b> These <b>lines</b> carried on beyond North Quay to Sutton Wharf and Vauxhall Quay; a short piece of this mixed gauge track still survives on this section.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011 reports {{indicated}} that the Cardiff City Council held discussions with MonoMetro about {{the construction of a}} line from Cardiff Central station to Mermaid <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line</b> would be privately financed and {{was supposed to be a}} demonstration of the technology. [...] There are no reports of further progress on this proposal and it was not included in the plan for a Cardiff light rail system.|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the local}} tramway system was closed, {{electric}} trams ran to Dulwich Hill and the Cooks River from Circular <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line</b> to Dulwich Hill branched from the Cooks River line at Newtown, turning off King Street into Enmore Road, [...] travelling through Marrickville and Dulwich Hill, via Victoria and Marrickville Roads. [...] A tram tuning loop was provided at the Canterbury Road terminus.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} route {{was from}} Looe Quay to Moorswater; {{the former is}} sometimes quoted as Looe Bridge, the southern extremity of the running line, but it ran on as sidings to the quayside south of the bridge, on Buller <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line</b> was opened to passenger services on 11 September 1879, and ran two trains each way daily {{to connect with the}} Cornwall line; there was an additional train on Saturday evenings.|$|R
50|$|The station’s {{placement}} {{reflects the}} reasons for the line’s construction: it is located {{on the banks of the}} Oder at the foot of the hill on which the centre of the city is located. The station building does not face the city, but rather the promenade next to the <b>quay.</b> The <b>line</b> was Berlin's first fast connection to the sea, which connected Prussia to the rest of world by steamship from Stettin.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} again closed in June 1890 due to low {{passenger}} numbers. The station was permanently reopened on 18 May 1896 as the northern terminus {{of the new}} North Wales and Liverpool Railway. The southern terminus was at Hawarden Bridge, which joined onto the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's <b>Quay</b> Railway <b>line</b> to Wrexham Central. In 1898 Bidston {{ceased to be a}} terminus station with the line extended to Seacombe in Wallasey. Bidston became a passenger interchange station.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the state}} of the tide, racing starts from a {{starting}} platform at the end of Bosham <b>Quay,</b> a starting <b>line</b> at Cobnor near the entrance to the Bosham Channel, or from the club's Committee Boat ("Glad Emma") anchored in Chichester Harbour.|$|R
25|$|This short line {{branched}} {{from the}} Alexandria line tracks {{at the corner}} of Henderson and Mitchell Roads in Alexandria and passed along Henderson Road to Park Street in Erskineville, and later to Bridge Street adjacent to Erskineville railway station. Services operated from Circular <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line</b> was an electrified single track throughout. The line opened to Park Street in 1906 and to Bridge Street in 1909. The line was an early closure, in 1933. It was replaced by a private bus service that no longer operates.|$|R
60|$|On the cut-stone <b>quay</b> above, a <b>line</b> of cab drivers--a ticca-gharri stand, nothing less--lolled and chaffed and {{tinkered with}} their {{harnesses}} in every beautiful {{attitude of the}} ungirt East. All the ground about was spotted with chewed sugarcane--first sign of the hot weather all the world over.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the first}} bodies were brought into Falmouth {{by the local}} lifeboat, the <b>quays</b> were <b>lined</b> with {{hundreds}} of people who watched in silence as the victims were landed and driven away in hearses. All commercial activity in the harbour was suspended; the royal yacht Britannia, at anchor {{on a visit to}} the port, removed its ceremonial bunting and dipped the White Ensign as a mark of respect. The crowds returned to the harbour on 7 August for the town's annual lifeboat service, this year transformed into a memorial service for Darlwynes lost party.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Act authorising the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway {{had included}} powers {{to connect to}} the harbour, but any such branch extension was forgotten. A local company, the Weymouth and Portland Railway was authorised to build a branch on to the Isle of Portland, with a street tramway from Weymouth station to the Channel Islands <b>quay.</b> The <b>line</b> was opened on 18 October 1865; locomotives were prohibited on the tramway to the quay, and horse traction was used; the line was leased jointly to the LSWR and the GWR.|$|R
5000|$|Dublin was {{for much}} of its {{existence}} a medieval city, marked by {{the existence of a}} particular style of buildings, built on narrow winding medieval streets. The first major changes to this pattern occurred during the reign of King Charles II when the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Ormonde (later made Duke of Ormonde) issued an instruction which was to have dramatic repercussions for the city as it exists today. Though the city over the century had grown around the River Liffey, as in many other medieval cities, buildings backed onto the river. This allowed the dumping of household waste directly into the river, creating a form of collective sewer. As Dublin's quays underwent development, Ormonde insisted that the frontages of the houses, not their rears, should face the quay sides, with a street to run along each quay. By this single regulation Ormonde changed the face of the city. No longer would the river be a sewer hidden between buildings. Instead it became a central feature of the city, with its <b>quays</b> <b>lined</b> by large three and four storey houses and classic public buildings, such as the Four Courts, the old Custom House and, later and grander, The Custom House designed, as was the Four Courts, by master architect James Gandon. For his initiative, Ormonde's name is now given to one of the city quays.|$|R
50|$|The service also {{travelled}} via Paddington and Bellevue Hill. Heading south down Elizabeth Street from Circular <b>Quay,</b> the <b>line</b> {{turned left}} into Park Street, then wound through East Sydney. A feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Avenue and Boundary Street in Darlinghurst as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct {{is now a}} road bridge. The line then travelled to Paddington and down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via the Bondi Junction line on Campbell Parade, to the North Bondi terminus. The line follows approximately the current route of bus 389.|$|R
50|$|The Harbourfront LRT began {{service in}} 1990 as the 604 Harbourfront. It {{was the first}} new Toronto {{streetcar}} route in many years, {{and the first to}} employ a dedicated tunnel, approximately 600 metres long. This starts with an underground loop at Union Station, runs south along Bay Street to the underground Queens Quay station, then turns west and emerges onto Queens <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line's</b> original terminus was Queens Quay and Spadina Loop, at the foot of Spadina Avenue; beyond this point non-revenue trackage ran north on Spadina to King, as otherwise the new line would have been disconnected {{from the rest of the}} network.|$|R
50|$|The {{line would}} {{start in the}} {{underground}} loop at Union Station, and proceed underground to Queens <b>Quay.</b> The <b>line</b> would then turn east and emerge from the tunnel 250 metres east of Yonge Street at Freeland Street. Both the eastbound and westbound tracks {{would be in a}} dedicated right of way along the south side of Queens Quay so as to reduce the need for rail vehicles to stop for road traffic, as there are fewer street intersections {{on the south side of}} Queens Quay than on its north side. The line would end in a temporary loop at Small Street, just west of Parliament Street.|$|R
50|$|Kinsale {{was linked}} by a branch line via Farrangalway and Ballymartle to the Irish railway {{system of the}} Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway and its successors from 1863 until 1931, when the branch was closed by the Great Southern Railways during a low point in Kinsale's {{economic}} fortunes. The station, inconveniently located for the town and harbour, was on Barrack Hill and the line ran to a junction at Crossbarry on the Cork (Albert <b>Quay)</b> to Bandon <b>line.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{authoritative}} TRACKmaps labels {{a wholly}} different, surviving, line as [...] "Widnes Loop", this being what was historically {{referred to as}} [...] "The Deviation". This line - part of the former Ditton Junction to Warrington Bank <b>Quay</b> Low Level <b>line</b> - runs through the sites of West Deviation Junction and Carterhouse Junction which are nowadays plain line. Presumably, as the original loop has long been closed and lifted {{there will be no}} source of operational confusion.|$|R
5000|$|Winter floods were {{a normal}} {{occurrence}} in Paris but, on 21 January, the river {{began to rise}} more rapidly than normal. Over {{the course of the}} following week, thousands of Parisians evacuated their homes as water infiltrated buildings and streets throughout the city, shutting down much of Paris' basic infrastructure. Police, fire-fighters, and soldiers moved through waterlogged streets in boats to rescue stranded residents from second-story windows and to distribute aid. Refugees gathered in makeshift shelters in churches, schools, and government buildings. Although the water threatened to overflow the tops of the <b>quay</b> walls that <b>line</b> the river, workmen were able to keep the Seine back with hastily built levees.|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} bodies were brought into Falmouth {{by the local}} lifeboat, the <b>quays</b> were <b>lined</b> with {{hundreds}} of people who watched in silence as the victims were landed and driven away in hearses. All commercial activity in the harbour was suspended; the royal yacht Britannia, at anchor {{on a visit to}} the port, removed its ceremonial bunting and dipped the White Ensign as a mark of respect. The crowds returned to the harbour on 7 August for the annual lifeboat service, this year transformed into a memorial service for Darlwynes lost party. In the days and weeks that followed, relatives and friends of the victims took the bodies for private burial and collected the abandoned belongings from the Greathead. Meantime the sea search for the Darlwyne wreck continued, through the autumn and into 1967, led by HMS Iveston. This navy minesweeper, equipped with the latest sonar equipment, carried out exhaustive searches in the area around Dodman Point, thought to be the vessel's most likely resting place. Although more than 600 dives were carried out, no sign of Darlwyne was discovered. In December 1966 the navy storeship HMS Maxim investigated the seabed around Looe, after reports that a trawler had lost its nets after they caught on an unidentified object.|$|R
50|$|After his {{bankruptcy}} {{he moved}} to a little, but still operating saw mill in Gjølanger (Fjaler municipality, Sogn og Fjordane county), which his creditors had not attacked. He built a dam to float timber to the mill and a salmon ladder. He also established a grain mill, a grocery shop, a steam ship <b>quay,</b> a telephone <b>line</b> and a power station. He also operated a lime kiln in Smilden, on the north bank of Åfjorden (a fjord), between Hyllestad and Sørbøvåg. It was a hard life with little sleep. While building a new house for himself in Gjøanger he lived in Hellevik and had to walk the distance of five kilometers twice each day. From Hellevik to the Smilden kiln the distance was 20 km along a footpath. He also started a forestry operation. By {{the beginning of the}} 60's, some 30 years later, he had planted altogether 200,000 spruce trees.|$|R
2500|$|Heading south down Elizabeth Street from Circular <b>Quay,</b> the <b>line</b> {{turned left}} into Park Street, then wound through East Sydney via a right turn into Yurong Street, {{a left turn}} into Stanley Street, a right turn into Bourke Street, then a left turn into Burton Street. According to plans held in the {{archives}} of the City of Sydney a spur line existed linking Burton Street to the prisoners entrance on Forbes Street {{at the rear of the}} Darlinghurst Courthouse. This may have allowed prisoners from Long Bay Gaol or elsewhere to be transported by tram to Darlinghurst Courthouse [...] A feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Avenue and Boundary Street in Darlinghurst as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct is now a road bridge. The line then twisted down Glenmore, Gurner and Hargrave Streets in Paddington, then Moncur and Queen Streets in Woollahra. Here, a connection to Oxford Street allowed access to Waverley Tram Depot. The line then travelled down Edgecliff and Victoria Roads, then wound along Birriga Road in Bellevue Hill, finally running down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction line on Campbell Parade, to the North Bondi terminus. The line was double track throughout with numerous points to allow short working. Services operated from Circular Quay via Elizabeth Street and Park Street. The line opened to Bellevue Hill in 1909, and to Bondi Beach in 1914. The line was cut back to Ocean Street, Woollahra in 1955; the remainder closed on 27 June 1959. The line followed approximately the current route of Sydney Buses' route 389 between the city and Woollahra and route X84 between Woollahra and Bondi Beach.|$|R
