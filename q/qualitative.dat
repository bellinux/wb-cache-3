5|$|<b>Qualitative</b> {{models are}} {{occasionally}} used. One example is <b>qualitative</b> scenario planning in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. <b>Qualitative</b> models often suffer {{from lack of}} precision.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either <b>qualitative</b> or quantitative. <b>Qualitative</b> metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. <b>Qualitative</b> chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost to the plant. <b>Qualitative</b> allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Content analysis: The {{content of}} {{interviews}} and other texts is systematically analysed. Often data is 'coded' {{as a part}} of the 'grounded theory' approach using <b>qualitative</b> data analysis (QDA) software, such as Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, or QDA Miner.|$|E
5|$|Surfactant {{homeostasis}} {{is critical}} for breathing (and thus survival) in the prematurely born infant, but also for maintaining lung health, and normal lung function throughout life. Quantitative and/or <b>qualitative</b> alterations in surfactant composition and/or function are associated with respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a <b>qualitative</b> interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
25|$|Most {{psychological}} researchers probably {{use both}} types of method. In particular, <b>qualitative</b> methods are widely used as exploratory methods; the results of <b>qualitative</b> analysis are used to design quantitative research which tests null hypotheses derived from the <b>qualitative</b> observations.|$|E
25|$|I/O {{psychologists have}} also {{employed}} <b>qualitative</b> methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A <b>qualitative</b> technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> methods in concert. OHP {{researchers have also}} combined and coordinated quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> methods within a single study.|$|E
25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, <b>qualitative</b> {{research is}} used to address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good <b>qualitative</b> research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. <b>Qualitative</b> logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on <b>qualitative</b> literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. It does appear, however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using <b>qualitative</b> design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. <b>Qualitative</b> formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that concisely show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between quantitative research method and <b>qualitative</b> research method is about the data, how the data collected and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how the data collected and analyzed by researchers in <b>qualitative</b> research.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{computer}} programs {{are available to}} help in analyzing <b>qualitative</b> data. The capacity of computers to effectively sort, store and retrieve information makes their use in <b>qualitative</b> data analysis appealing. However, {{it is important to}} notice that computers can only aid in some parts of analysis; computer software do not code data or replace the conceptual processes. It cannot analyse <b>qualitative</b> data for the researcher.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> assays, i.e. assays which {{generally}} give just a pass or fail, or {{positive or negative}} or some such sort of only small number of <b>qualitative</b> gradation rather than an exact quantity.|$|E
25|$|Indices of <b>qualitative</b> {{variation}} {{are then}} analogous to information entropy, which is minimized when all cases {{belong to a}} single category and maximized in a uniform distribution. Indeed, information entropy {{can be used as}} an index of <b>qualitative</b> variation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> {{psychological}} {{research has}} crystallised {{as one of}} the most effective ways of gathering insight into the behaviours, attitudes and decision-making processes of consumers and customers. Most <b>qualitative</b> research companies in the world will claim that they employ psychologists and base their findings on psychological theories. The psychology backed methodologies applied in <b>qualitative</b> marketing research are continuously changing and being further developed. One of the examples of psychology theory developed specifically for use in marketing research is morphological psychology.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> {{psychological}} {{research methods}} include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for <b>qualitative</b> research, including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. <b>Qualitative</b> researchers sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or critiques of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can {{give rise to}} quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of Nazi voting or Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> {{research}} methodologies are oriented towards developing {{understanding of the}} meaning and experience dimensions of human lives and their social worlds. Good <b>qualitative</b> research is characterized by congruence between the perspective that informs the research questions and the research methods used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> data {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing and interpreting data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the <b>qualitative</b> research process is analysis of data. Analyzing <b>qualitative</b> data also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, try to understand the subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an effective system for retrieving data because of the identity of <b>qualitative</b> {{data analysis}}, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E

25|$|Those {{psychological}} {{researchers who}} prefer <b>qualitative</b> research argue that statistically based research has limitations {{because it is}} less able {{to take into consideration}} the context of behaviour. <b>Qualitative</b> researchers have developed their own criteria for assessing reliability and validity. The work of Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba is an example of this.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, <b>qualitative</b> {{data can}} be used to {{strengthen}} quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, quasi-experimental) in particular. For example, in educational psychology, researchers could conduct a <b>qualitative</b> pilot study to determine which group of students should be selected for quantitative study by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E
