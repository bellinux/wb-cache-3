40|$|Virginia Tech, Utah State University, and the University of Washington were teamed to {{form the}} Ionospheric Observation Nanosat Formation to {{investigate}} formationflying requirements for multiple spacecraft missions. A communication subsystem for the mission will comprise an uplink, downlink and a satellite-to-satellite crosslink. A linearly polarized resonant loop antenna mounted above the bottom surface of the spacecraft was selected for a possible satellite uplink receive antenna. The resonant loop was chosen to satisfy the physical requirements of the spacecraft while still achieving efficient operation for a UHF signal. A full-scale prototype was fabricated to measure frequency dependent characteristics of the antenna. A gamma match and a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>sleeve</b> balun transformer were integrated to the system to minimize the power reflected at the antenna input and to isolate the antenna from the feed line. The uplink antenna demonstrated sufficient performance; however, the final bandwidth of {{less than one percent}} will require additional tuning as other subsystems are integrated into the final flight-ready prototype. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The author would like to express his appreciation to R. Michael Barts for his invaluable technical assistance and direction in completing this project. Additional thanks are owed to Josh Arritt, Derek Wells, Koichiro Takamizawa, and other students in the Virginia Tech Antenna Group (VTAG) who offered their assistance in the final preparation of this document. iv Table of Contents Abstract [...] . ii Acknowledgements [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Utah State University, the University of Washington, and Virginia Tech are teamed to {{form the}} Ionospheric Observation Nanosatellite Formation (IONF) to {{investigate}} ionospheric turbulence and formation-flying requirements for multiple small satellite missions. A communication subsystem for the mission will be composed of an uplink, a downlink, and satellite-tosatellite crosslink. The uplink will operate at UHF. The downlink and crosslink both will operate in the S-band. The design and successful implementation of a low profile, compact element with desirable properties at UHF within the physical constraints of a nanosatellite is a challenge. A resonant loop antenna mounted above the bottom surface of the spacecraft was selected for a possible satellite antenna. The linearly polarized resonant loop was chosen to satisfy the physical requirements of the spacecraft while still achieving efficient operation for a UHF signal. A full-scale prototype was fabricated to measure the frequency dependent characteristics of the antenna. A gamma match and a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>sleeve</b> balun transformer were integrated to the system to optimize the impedance match between the antenna and the transmission line. Measured results {{presented in this paper}} indicate sufficient performance for the initial design. The antenna operating bandwidth of approximately one percent covers the estimated bandwidth of the uplink channel. However, integration with other components during fabrication could easily detune the resonant frequency of the loop antenna out of the required band. Further development of the uplink antenna design should include adjustable mounts and a capacitive tuning element...|$|E
