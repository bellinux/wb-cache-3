40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the fast}} {{advancement}} of manufacturing technologies for micro- and nanostructured components [1] {{the need for}} sophisticated inspection methods increases. The paper on hand discusses the prerequisites for automatic execution of inspection plans. Main goal is to enable auto-mated dimensional measurements of micro- and nanostruc-tured components instead of executing functional tests. Besides reducing manufacturing cost this approach enables the setup of a closed <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> which allows {{a higher level of}} efficiency. It provides a constant feedback to the manufacturing processes and to the design process. Based on the latest state-of-the-art the setup and operating principle of a closed <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> for dimensional inspections is de-scribed. Vital part of the closed <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> is a multisensor system consisting of adaptive, intelligent sensors with cas-caded measuring ranges. The paper provides a novel and consistent overall view of dimensional inspections of micro-and nanostructured components and how they will be exe-cuted in the future.

The authors searched multiple electronic databases from 1966 until 26 June 2014. Studies were included if they reported incident reporting systems on the adult ICU. Data on study design, characteristics of the incident reporting system, implementation, feedback and improvement measures were collected using structured data extraction forms. A total of 2098 studies were identified and 36 studies reported IRSs on the adult ICU. Studies were divided into: ICU-specific IRSs and general IRSs.

Feedback has different functions in the production quality management – starting from diversion of defects and until initiation of new and innovative production. Feedback could be pointed to the input of the system or to a particular element of the quality control system thus reducing quality correction time and costs. Assurance of the feedback incurs certain costs that are part of total quality costs. These costs could be described in a form of information model. Determining quality costs all stages of <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> have to be considered. Costs of marketing research, designing costs etc. have to be attributed to quality costs.

The DLC-STC Scheme 1 {{is for the}} case of the complete loop channel cancellation, which achieves the full asynchronous cooperative diversity. The DLC-STC Scheme 2 is for {{the case of the}} partial loop channel cancellation and amplifying, where some loop signals are used as the self-coding instead of treated as interference to be directly cancelled. We show this scheme can achieve full asynchronous cooperative diversity. We then evaluate the performance of the two schemes when loop channel information is not accurate and present an amplifying factor control method for the DLC-STC Scheme 2 to improve its performance with inaccurate loop channel information. Simulation results show that the DLC-STC Scheme 1 outperforms the DLC-STC Scheme 2 and the delay diversity scheme if perfect or high <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> channel information is available at the relay, while the DLC-STC Scheme 2 achieves better performance if the loop channel information is imperfect.

The irregularity and flexibility of loops make their structures {{difficult to determine}} experimentally and challenging to model computationally. Conformation sampling and energy evaluation are the two key components in loop modeling. We have developed a new method for loop conformation sampling and prediction based on a chain growth sequential Monte Carlo sampling strategy, called Distance-guided Sequential chain-Growth Monte Carlo (DISGRO). With an energy function designed specifically for loops, our method can efficiently generate high <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> conformations with low energy that are enriched with near-native loop structures. The average minimum global backbone RMSD for 1, 000 conformations of 12 -residue loops is 1 : 53 Å, with a lowest energy RMSD of 2 : 99 Å, and an average ensemble RMSD of 5 : 23 Å. A novel geometric criterion is applied to speed up calculations. The computational cost of generating 1, 000 conformations {{for each of the}} x loops in a benchmark dataset is only about 10 cpu minutes for 12 -residue loops, compared to ca 180 cpu minutes using the FALCm method.

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to ensure {{effectiveness}} of implementation of management objectives of an educational organization by identifying business processes of the quality management system of the educational organization and justifying the choice of language and diagrams of their modeling. The author emphasizes that the approach to identifying business processes of the quality management system of an educational organization should be based not on the types but {{on the results of}} the organization’s activity in higher education. It is determined that an effective approach to identifying business processes of the quality management system of an educational organization should be based on the life cycle of the educational service (<b>quality</b> <b>loop),</b> the requirements of the ISO 9001 : 2015 standard for building the processes of the quality management system and the standardized list of business processes International Benchmarking Clearinghouse.

40|$|Quality system {{auditing}} {{has been}} a topic of much recent discussion but {{there has not been}} a commensurate amount of research on how the audit process can make more effective use of auditor time and improve the quality of their judgements. An approach certification bodies and their clients may adopt is to measure the quality system activities of the client, and use these measurements (or metrics) to improve their understand of the quality system. If these metrics were available to auditors, they could identify the strengths and weaknesses of the quality system and assist in deciding if the client complies with ISO 9000. This could make the audit process more cost-effective and focused. A detailed study of the current auditing process used by certification bodies, and a survey of auditors, identified the quality system activities that provide the most confidence that the company has a compliant quality system. The "quality loop" activities of internal audit/management review and corrective action were found to be both the most important activities in showing compliance and provide the basis of metrics that can inform the auditor about the state of health of these activities. Metrics capable of measuring the other quality system activities required by ISO 9000 are identified, and their effectiveness in monitoring the quality system is discussed. The research shows that metrics concerned with the <b>quality</b> <b>loop</b> can provide useful information to an auditor and can help them in reaching a judgement. It is also shown that the use of metrics is constrained by organisational and technical factors, such as the size of the organisation being measured and the correspondence between the activity being measured and the requirements of ISO 9000...|$|E

Based on the international audit team’s recommendation and the audit report, the Evaluation Council has decided to require the institution to undergo a re-audit. In its current state the quality system of Hanken School of Economics does not fulfil the national criteria set for the quality management of higher education institutions, and thus the system cannot be said to correspond to the European quality assurance principles and recommendations for higher education institutions. The object of the audit was the quality system that the Hanken School of Economics has developed based on its own needs and goals. The optional audit target chosen by the institution was the Assurance of Learning process. The following were regarded as key strengths of the quality system: n There is a strong organisational culture characterized by {{a strong sense of}} purpose, result orientation and a commitment to advancement of the university. n Student feedback is taken seriously and leads to changes at course level. n There are established and natural ways of involving alumni and corporate connections in the operations. n There is a very systematic process for implementing the strategy throughout the organisation using performance agreements and development discussions. Among other things, the following recommendations were made for the Hanken School of Economics: n The accreditations that Hanken has pursued have {{led to the development of}} many established quality management procedures which contribute to the development of the operations. However, Hanken would benefit from integrating these into one overall quality system and defining the objectives, structure and operating principles of this system. This would provide opportunities to enhance efficiency, to reduce risk and to help Hanken respond to change. n It would be desirable if Hanken were to develop more systematic methods to manage its quality processes in order to give more emphasis to the evaluation and improvement stages of the Hanken <b>Quality</b> <b>Loop</b> 2013. n It is recommended that Hanken structure the documentation of the procedures, processes and systems that it uses to maintain and develop the quality of its activities, paying particular attention to access to information. This would lead to better traceability and would help identify inefficiencies and areas in need of development in its operations.
