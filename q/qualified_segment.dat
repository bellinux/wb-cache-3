40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1980 s {{telework}} {{has been}} a central subject of political and scientific debates about the structural change in the economy and society. The main focus of attention has so far been the work in the field of information and communication (I&C) technology which is performed outside the place of business and predominantly close to the place of residence. As a result of the increasing networking of information and communication technology and the move towards more flexibility in the organisation of work and business processes, telework has been discussed as a forward-looking employment form, whereby on the whole rather positive employment and labour market effects were expected. This paper takes up this subject taking the Rhine-Main region as an example. On the basis of the results of an establishment survey carried out in 1998 it is shown that the number of telework firms and telework jobs is falling behind the prognoses made so far. In this region {{at the time of the}} survey, about 4. 6 % of the establishments had set up telework jobs and the proportion of these jobs among all jobs was approximately 1. 25 %. The spread of telework is encouraged by the decentral restructuring of the organisation of work and firms, which is supported by I&C technology, although no in total positive employment effects can be determined that are causally related to the introduction of telework. It is more the case that telework is used as an element of functional flexibility, is predominantly established in the highly <b>qualified</b> <b>segment</b> of the labour market, and is implemented in the context of regular employment relationships. Regional labour markets are experiencing in parts a blurring of spatial borders through telework, though on the whole the social-spatial integration of work dominates, so that is has not so far seemed justified to assume a deterritorialisation or globalisation of the labour markets through this form of telework. As a result of the growing networking of information and communication technology and the decentralisation of work on the one hand and - contrary to expectations - the comparatively lower increase in the number of telework jobs on the other hand, it appears to be worthwhile to conceptualise telework not primarily from the difference between proximity to the place of residence and place of business. It is more important to take into account also those forms of work which are distributed throughout the location, decentral and supported by I&C technology within and between organisations and people, in order to be able to record the changes in the organisation of work as a result of the use of modern I&C technologies and their effects on regional employment and labour market structures.

50|$|Before 2001, NASCAR used {{a two-day}} {{qualifying}} format in its national series. Before 2002 only one lap was run on oval tracks except short tracks and restrictor plate tracks. Until 2014, the pole {{position has been}} determined by a two-lap time trial (one lap on road courses) with the faster lap time used as the driver's qualifying speed. In 2014, NASCAR used a knockout qualifying format for all races except the Daytona 500, non-points races, and the Camping World Truck Series' Aspen Dental Eldora Dirt Derby: after a 25-minute session (on tracks longer than 1.25 mi; tracks shorter than 1.25 miles have a 30-minute session), the 24 fastest cars advance to a ten-minute session, with the top 12 advancing to a final five-minute session. Starting in 2003, if a driver's team changed their car's engine after the <b>qualifying</b> <b>segment</b> was over, the car would be relegated {{to the rear of}} the 43-car field. In the case of multiple teams changing engines on the same weekend after a <b>qualifying</b> <b>segment</b> (although this is a rare occurrence), qualifying times from that segment are used to determine the starting order for those cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{match play}} format at the PGA Championship in 1957 called for nine rounds (162 holes) in five days.As in 1956, the two-day stroke play <b>qualifying</b> <b>segment</b> (36 holes) was eliminated; 128 players were {{entered in the}} single-elimination bracket. The PGA Championship had {{concluded}} on Tuesday since 1947; this year's schedule was modified for a Sunday final, with match play beginning on Wednesday. The first five rounds were 18-hole matches contested over the first three days, which reduced the field to four players for the weekend. The semifinals and finals were 36-hole matches played on the final two days, Saturday and Sunday.|$|R

50|$|The rules {{regarding}} qualifying and {{the start}} times of some races were tweaked. The qualifying procedure was further clarified to cater to different sizes of starting grids: if twenty-four cars were entered for the race, seven would have been eliminated after {{each of the first}} two qualifying segments; if twenty-two were entered, six would have been eliminated after each <b>qualifying</b> <b>segment</b> and so on if fewer cars were eligible. In light of a regulation introduced in 2014 dictating that a race could not run for more than four hours and following recommendations from the report into Jules Bianchi's accident the previous season, the start times of five Grands Prix were moved forward by an hour, so that races did not start with less than four hours until dusk. Thus, the Australian, Malaysia, Chinese, Japanese and Russian Grands Prix started an hour earlier than in 2014.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Process models play {{important}} role in computer aided process engineering. Although the structure of these models is a priori known, model parameters should be estimated based on experiments. The accuracy of the estimated parameters largely depends on the information content of the experimental data presented to the parameter identification algorithm. Optimal Experiment Design (OED) can maximize the confidence on the model parameters. Considering that OED is an iterative process, it may happen that the designed experiment contains segments which are not or less useful for parameter identification. Using {{the tools of the}} OED there is the opportunity to <b>qualify</b> the <b>segments</b> of the time-series of different data sets. After the segmentation, {{it will be possible to}} choose the most appropriate segments for identification of each parameter, i. e. to determine the parameters as accurate as possible...|$|R

40|$|Glaucoma, {{a leading}} cause of {{blindness}} worldwide, can be detected using retinal thicknesses from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the macula. We calculate the desired thickness maps as the distance between the inner-limiting membrane (ILM) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) of the retina. To delineate these two layers, we use a set of two deformable open surfaces that are driven by intensity contrast, while preserving their shape and topology properties, i. e. local surface smoothness and inter-surface distance smoothness. To evaluate our method, <b>qualified</b> graders manually <b>segmented</b> 30 random sections from 20 OCT image stacks, in triplicate; we make comparisons with obtained ground-truth and the clinically tested Heidelberg Spectralis segmentation.

40|$|This qualitative, explorative study {{seeks to}} broaden the scope of normativity in {{collaborative}} decision-making in Dutch Catholic school management teams beyond ethical reasoning by the inclusion of reasons that relate to a vision of good education. It introduces the concept of ‘discernment’ as a heuristic for {{the description of the}} content and process of decision-making, and thus positions the weighing of reasons with reference to the good at the heart of decision-making. Also it explores other modes than normative modes of reasoning in collaborative decision-making in school management teams. The data were collected through focus group discussions (2 groups) and half-structured interviews (6 respondents). The data were subjected to deductive coding, assigning theory-based codes to data segments. This coding method was completed with inductive coding, introducing new codes when the pre-given codes did not match or <b>qualify</b> certain data <b>segments</b> properly. The data set includes the following files: a readme file that explains the data set, the anonymised data (Atlas. ti files, a XML export and PdfA files of the interviews), the codebook that describes the data, an interview protocol (for the interviews) and the topics lists (for the focus group discussions) ...|$|R
