40|$|Actuality of the research. Development of {{standard}} samples (SS) of food colour content {{continues to be}} relevant to enhance safety and quality of food products, additives and other micro-ingredients {{as well as to}} deal with import substitution. Work objective. The objective of this work is to develop SS for the basic substance and toxic elements in the most frequently used in food technologies synthetic food colours: Tartrazine E 102, <b>Yellow</b> <b>Quinoline</b> E 104, Azorubine E 122 and Ponseau 4 R E 124. Research techniques. Mass fraction of colour in the samples was determined by spectrophotometry as per 320502013 GOST Standard; colour samples for toxic elements were evaluated according to 26929 - 94 GOST Standard; content of lead and cadmium was determined by atomic absorption analysis defined in the GOST 30178 - 96, arsenic -by calorimetry as per GOST 26930 - 94, mercury - by flameless atomic sorption spectrometry according to MU № 5178 - 90, homogeneity and shelf life - in conformity with RMG 93 - 2009, GOST 8. 531 - 2002 and Р 50. 2. 031 - 2003.

50|$|In the 20th century, the {{improvement}} of chemical analysis {{and the development of}} trials to identify the toxic features of substances added to foods led to the replacement of the negative lists by lists of substances allowed to be used for the production and {{the improvement}} of foods. This principle is called a positive listing, and almost all recent legislations are based on it. Positive listing implies that substances meant for human consumption have been tested for their safety, and that they have to meet specified purity criteria prior to their approval by the corresponding authorities. In 1962, the first EU directive (62/2645/EEC) approved 36 colorants, of which 20 were naturally derived and 16 were synthetic. This directive did not list which food products the colorants could or could not be used in. At that time, each member state could designate where certain colors could and could not be used. In Germany, for example, <b>quinoline</b> <b>yellow</b> was allowed in puddings and desserts, but tartrazine was not. The reverse was true in France. This was updated in 1989 with 89/107/EEC, which concerned food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs.|$|E
5000|$|After {{concerns}} were expressed that food colorings may cause ADHD-like behavior in children, the collective evidence {{do not support}} this assertion.

The U.S. FDA did not make changes following the publication of the Southampton study, but following a citizen petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest in 2008, requesting the FDA ban several food additives, the FDA reviewed the available evidence, and still made no changes.|$|E

The maximum safe concentration was 25 mg Quinoline Yellow/kg complete feed for all non food-producing animals.
