A molybdenum-based microreactor has been designed for the screening of catalytic coatings in the 100 - 800 DegC temp. range in gas phase reactions involving large heat effects (DH 298 = +- 500 kJ/mol). The microreactor consists of eight microstructured compartments, each with {{a cross section of}} 2. 28 mm * 10. 18 mm and 40 mm in length. Eight 100 mm thick molybdenum plates with a deposited catalytic layer with a thickness up to 10 mm are to be inserted in each compartment at distances of 130 mm from each other. Using the CFD code Fluent 6. 0, it is demonstrated that a low-pressure drop flow diffuser, positioned upstream of the microreactor, distributes reactants evenly in a flow range of 50 - 1000 cm 3 /min (STP) throughout all compartments.

Furthermore, the existing cold syngas cleaning technology also requires that the syngas temperature to be reduced below 600 oF. Direct water quenching of syngas is one of the cooling schemes that can not only provide the necessary cooling, but also help to drive the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction to convert steam and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, which is an important process for systems implementing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). To assist designing an adequate syngas quench cooling section, this study has employed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the performance of a preliminary design of a water quench system in a downdraft entrained flow coal gasifier.

Sixty configurations have been analyzed in both circular and annular geometries in a fully reacting environment simulating the operating condition of an actual RQL gas turbine combustion liner.

Other parameters such as J (momentum-flux ratio), MR (mass flowrate ratio), DR (density ratio), and mixer sector orifice ACd (effective orifice area) were maintained constant throughout the entire study. The results indicate that the mixing flow field can be correlated with the NOx production if they are referenced with the stoichiometric equivalence ratio value and not the equilibrium value. The mixing flowfields in both circular and annular mixers are different. The penetration of equal jets in both annular and circular geometries is vastly different which significantly affects the performance of the mixing section. In the computational results with the circular mixer, most of the NOx formation occurred behind the orifice starting at the orifice wake region. General trends have been observed in the NOx production as the number of orifices is changed and this appears to be common for all hole configurations and mixer types (circular or annular).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practicality}} {{of using a}} liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry preparation and feed system for the E-Gas™ gasifier in an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) electric power generation plant configuration. Liquid CO{sub 2 } has several property differences from water that make it attractive for the coal slurries used in coal gasification-based power plants. First, the viscosity of liquid CO{sub 2 } is much lower than water. This means it should take less energy to pump liquid CO{sub 2 } through a pipe compared to water. This also means that a higher solids concentration can be fed to the gasifier, which should decrease the heat requirement needed to vaporize the slurry. Second, the heat of vaporization of liquid CO{sub 2 } is about 80 % lower than water. This means that less heat from the gasification reactions is needed to vaporize the slurry. This should result in less oxygen needed to achieve a given gasifier temperature. And third, the surface tension of liquid CO{sub 2 } is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than water, which should result in finer atomization of the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry, faster reaction times between the oxygen and coal particles, and better carbon conversion at the same gasifier temperature. EPRI and others have recognized the potential that liquid CO{sub 2 } has in improving the performance of an IGCC plant and have previously conducted systemslevel analyses to evaluate this concept. These {{past studies have shown}} that a significant increase in IGCC performance can be achieved with liquid CO{sub 2 } over water with certain gasifiers. Although these previous analyses had produced some positive results, they were still based on various assumptions for liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry properties. This low-rank coal study extends the existing knowledge base to evaluate the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry concept on an E-Gas™-based IGCC plant with full 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture. The overall objective is to determine if this technology could be used to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency of IGCC plants. The study goes beyond the systems-level analyses and initial lab work that formed the bases of previous studies and includes the following tasks: performing laboratory tests to quantify slurry properties; developing an engineering design of a liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry preparation and feed system; conducting a full IGCC plant techno-economic analysis for Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and North Dakota lignite in both water and liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries; and identifying a technology development plan to continue the due diligence to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this technology. The initial task included rheology tests and slurry data analyses that would increase the knowledge and understanding of maximum solids loading capability for both PRB and lignite. Higher coal concentrations have been verified in liquid CO{sub 2 } over water slurries, and a coal concentration of 75 % by weight in liquid CO{sub 2 } has been estimated to be achievable in a commercial application. In addition, lower slurry viscosities have been verified in liquid CO{sub 2 } at the same solids loading, where the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry viscosity has been measured to be about a factor of 10 lower than the comparable water slurry and estimated to be less than 100 centipoise in a commercial application. In the following task, an engineering design of a liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry preparation and mixing system has been developed for both a batch and continuous system. The capital cost of the design has also been estimated so that it could be used in the economic analysis. An industry search and survey has been conducted to determine if essential components required to construct the feed system are available from commercial sources or if targeted R&D efforts are required. The search and survey concluded that commercial sources are available for selected components that comprise both the batch and continuous type systems. During normal operation, the fuel exits the bottom of the coal silo and is fed to a rod mill for grinding to the desired particle size. From the rod mill, the coal is transported in a dense phase pneumatic transport system {{to the top of a}} solids heat exchanger, wherein the ground coal is chilled to a low temperature (in the range of - 23. 3 °C (- 10 °F)) prior to mixing with liquid CO{sub 2 }. This temperature was selected based on evaluating trade-offs between refrigeration work and the cost of the system pressure boundary at various combinations of pressure and temperature that correspond to the gas/liquid phase boundary for CO{sub 2 }. Electrical loads to drive the equipment comprising the liquid CO{sub 2 } feed system are significantly greater than those for a water slurry system, and this effect has been captured in the technical performance analysis. In the next task, a plant-wide techno-economic analysis has been conducted for PRB coal and lignite in both liquid CO{sub 2 } and water slurry feed. The IGCC cases using a liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry system show reduced plant output and higher heat rate for PRB coal and for ND lignite at 90 % CO{sub 2 } capture. Some of these performance differences can be attributed to the higher requirement for steam for the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry cases to drive the water-gas shift reaction, thereby reducing steam turbine power generation. Other factors contributing to the calculated performance differences are the increase in parasitic loads attributable to refrigeration to produce liquid CO{sub 2 } and chilled coal and the reduction in enthalpy of the inlet streams to the gasifier associated with the low temperature liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry feed. The capital costs for the complete plant are slightly higher for the liquid CO{sub 2 } slurry cases for PRB coal but somewhat reduced for ND lignite relative to the corresponding water slurry cases. Differences in dollar/kWe costs are higher for both coals due to the reduction in net output. The cost of electricity computed for the liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurry cases is greater for both PRB and ND Lignite coals. It does not appear that there is any benefit to using liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries for feeding low rank coals to the E-Gas™ gasifier. Any incidental benefits in improved cold gas efficiency are more than compensated for in higher overall plant costs, increased complexity, and reduced power output and efficiency. The results of the study are compared with previous published analyses, and the differences in model assumptions, approach and basis are summarized. It has been concluded that the use of liquid CO{sub 2 } may still prove to have a significant advantage in a different type of gasifier, i. e., single-stage entrained flow with radiant <b>quench</b> <b>section,</b> but some key questions remain unanswered that can validate the potential improvement of gasifier performance using liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries. In order to provide a path to answering these questions, a technology development roadmap has been developed to resolve fundamental issues and to better define the operation aspects of using liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries. The fundamental issues could be resolved by conducting additional laboratory analyses consisting of: • A rheological test program to quantitatively evaluate slurry preparation and handling for liquid CO{sub 2 } including experiments to evaluate preparation systems. • An experimental program on CO{sub 2 }-assisted gasification in order to obtain the most relevant experimental data from drop tube furnace studies to aid in verifying the potential advantages of direct feed of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal as gasifier feedstocks. Quantifying the operational aspects of liquid CO{sub 2 } slurries can best be achieved with: • An experimental program using a flow test loop to evaluate equipment performance and handling properties of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries for gasifier feedstocks on a scale sufficient to predict full scale operating parameters. • Spray atomization studies necessary to evaluate the effect of atomization properties of liquid CO{sub 2 }/coal slurries that could be significantly different than those of water/coal slurries...|$|E

40|$|The mixed quantum/classical {{approach}} {{is applied to}} the problem of ro-vibrational energy transfer in the inelastic collisions of CO(v = 1) with He atom, in order to predict the quenching rate coefficient in a broad range of temperatures 5 3 ̆c T 3 ̆c 2500 [*]K. Scattering calculations are done in two different ways: direct calculations of <b>quenching</b> cross <b>sections</b> and, alternatively, calculations of the excitation cross sections plus microscopic reversibility. In addition, a symmetrized average-velocity method of Billing is tried. Combination of these methods allows reproducing experiment in a broad range of temperatures. Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained at 400 3 ̆c T 3 ̆c 2500 [*]K (within 10...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} measurements of fluorescence lifetimes of two species along a line is described. The experimental setup {{is based on}} picosecond laser pulses from two tunable optical parametric generator/optical parametric amplifier systems together with a streak camera. With an appropriate optical time delay between the two laser pulses, whose wavelengths are tuned to excite two different species, laser-induced fluorescence can be both detected temporally and spatially resolved by the streak camera. Hence, our method enables one-dimensional imaging of fluorescence lifetimes of two species in the same streak camera recording. The concept is demonstrated for fluorescence lifetime measurements of CO and OH in a laminar methane/air flame on a Bunsen-type burner. Measurements were taken in flames with four different equivalence ratios, namely I center dot = 0. 9, 1. 0, 1. 15, and 1. 25. The measured one-dimensional lifetime profiles generally agree well with lifetimes calculated from <b>quenching</b> cross <b>sections</b> {{found in the literature}} and quencher concentrations predicted by the GRI 3. 0 mechanism. For OH, there is a systematic deviation of approximately 30 % between calculated and measured lifetimes. It is found that this is mainly due to the adiabatic assumption regarding the flame and uncertainty in H 2 O <b>quenching</b> cross <b>section.</b> This emphasizes the strength of measuring the quenching rates rather than relying on models. The measurement concept might be useful for single-shot measurements of fluorescence lifetimes of several species pairs of vital importance in combustion processes, hence allowing fluorescence signals to be corrected for quenching and ultimately yield quantitative concentration profiles...|$|R
40|$|A {{turnable}} {{dye laser}} {{was used to}} measure the radiative lifetime of the individual rotational levels of the B 2 Sigma (+) state of CN. The radiative lifetime of the unperturbed rotational levels is 65. 6 plus or minus 1. 0 nsec. A longer radiative lifetime of 72 plus or minus 1 nsec is observed for the Kaon prime = 4 level of the B state. The measured values of the perturbed and unperturbed levels support the longer lifetimes for the A 2 meson pion state of CN. The <b>quenching</b> cross <b>section</b> of the B 2 Sigma state of CN is 41 plus or minus 20 Angstroms squared and is independent of the rotational energy of the B state...|$|R
40|$|Quenching of {{individual}} metastable states of antiprotonic helium (pHe /sup +/) in collisions with H/sub 2 / and D/sub 2 / in gas phase was studied using a laser-resonance method at CERN's antiproton decelerator. The temperature {{dependence of the}} <b>quenching</b> cross- <b>sections</b> of the pHe/sup +/ states (n, l) =(37, 34), (38, 35), and (38, 37) in the reactions pHe/sup +/sub (n, l) /+H/sub 2 / and pHe /sup +/sub (n, l) /+D/sub 2 / was investigated in the temperature range of 25 - 300 K.

40|$|Bound-free {{fluorescence}} of HeH, NeH, ArH, KrH and XeH is reported. The excimers {{are formed}} via a photochemical reaction between H 2 (C 1 Πu, B 1 Σu+) and rare gases following excitation with synchrotron radiation. Broad fluorescence continua {{in the near}} UV are observed and assigned to the rare gas hydride transition B 2 π→ X 2 Σ+. In the case of NeH, the A 2 Σ+ state also contributes to the fluorescence spectrum. Experimentally derived binding energies for the B state and bound-free spectra of HeH and ArH are in good agreement with recent ab initio calculations.

40|$|This {{work has}} used high range imaging mass {{spectrometry}} {{to study a}} coal sample that has undergone heating with a temperature gradient. A custom made hotplate was heated to 1000 °C and the coal was allowed to heat naturally through conduction to produce a large thermal gradient typical of conditions in a coke oven. The sample was <b>quenched,</b> <b>sectioned</b> and analysed using laser desorption time of flight imaging mass spectrometry (LDI-TOF-IMS) to study the molecular changes that occur within the plastic layer and in the semi-coke. The raw coal was observed to have a molecular weight range between 500 and 20, 000 Da with a peak occurring at 2000 Da. The plastic layer was observed to have a prevalence for increasing 500 – 1000 Da structures though this formed {{part of the larger}} molecular weight range. Resolidification of the plastic layer coincided with a rise in 4000 Da structures. The semi-coke spectrum had a series of repeating peaks separated by 24 Da extending from 1000 Da to 3000 Da. This was considered evidence of broad molecular ordering. A second phenomenon was observed in the semi-coke associated with low range molecular weights (50 – 300 Da). This appeared as high intensity signals in a molecular range typically considered as ion fragments (being too low in size to remain in the high vacuum environment). It was speculated that these low range structures may be associated with the coking of volatile tars exiting the hot-side of the plastic layer through high temperature semi-coke. Overall, this preliminary work provides a novel methodology to study the heating impacts during coking on a molecular level...|$|R
