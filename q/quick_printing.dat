40|$|New {{technologies}} for the fabrication of on-demand oral dosage forms {{are needed in}} order to provide personalized medicine accessible to patients at pharmacies and point-of-care locations. 3 D Pharming, the direct printing of pharmaceutical tablets, is an attractive technology towards the manufacture of oral dosage forms with controlled dosages, drug release kinetics, and the potential to combine multiple drugs into a single tablet. Powder bed 3 D printing and fused deposition modeling (FDM) have been the two most explored 3 D printing technologies towards the manufacture of personalized medicine. However, these techniques experience limitations in terms of printing speed and operation at high temperatures causing potential drug degradation, respectively. To overcome these limitations, the objective of this dissertation was to design a 3 D Pharming system based on the inkjet printing of photocurable bioinks, capable of dispensing hydrophilic and hydrophobic APIs, with <b>quick</b> <b>printing</b> speeds at room temperature. The procedure included the dispensing of drug loaded bioinks onto blank preform tablets, their subsequent light induced polymerization, and the attachment of a preform cap to complete the oral dosage form. This objective was achieved by 1) chemically manipulating hyaluronic acid to incorporate norbornene moieties into its backbone, resulting in a photoreactive biocompatible polymer to be used as the main component of a hydrophilic bioink; 2) designing a poly(ethylene glycol) based photocurable formulation for the dispensing of hydrophobic compounds; and 3) demonstrating the use of these bioinks towards the fabrication of combination therapies by creating a polypill including two drugs for the treatment of hypertension. The capacity of these bioinks for droplet formation was analyzed by calculating the inverse of the Ohnesorge number and the mechanical properties of the polymerized gels were assessed. Dissolution tests were performed on fabricated tablets containing the hydrophilic drug Ropinirole, Naproxen as a hydrophobic compound, and the combination of Lisinopril and Spironolactone within a polypill for the treatment of hypertension. Immediate and sustained release profiles were achieved for Ropinirole and Naproxen, respectively, demonstrating control over drug release kinetics.

In the majority cases the damage of the optic nerve is irreversible and it happens due to increase of intraocular pressure. One of main challenge for the diagnosis is to find out this disease, because any symptoms are not present in the initial stage. When is detected, it is already in the advanced stage.

In a situation reminiscent of the potlatch that so fascinated Bataille, these artists engaged in a competition of giving that introduced rivalry and antagonism into the mail art network. Attempting to gain prestige by demonstrating their ability to absorb great expenditures, they also took a perverse approach towards the idea of gift exchange.... Many experienced mail artists complained of an 'explosion of junk mail and self-serving egotism.'" [...] Citing Fluxus historian Ken Friedman, Ferranto argues that many such projects were originated by [...] "artists unaware of history and community trying to become the leading figure in the network," [...] whose aggressive actions spoiled their own nest. The paradoxical issue of mail art fame was already noted by Chuck Welch, in 1986, in his book Networking Currents. Indeed, this was one among the many complaints made by Jacob, the editor as petulant chief despoiler, in a series of essays disclosing his gradual alienation from the mail art community.

40|$|Many {{companies}} have developed websites that their customers {{can use to}} diagnose product problems. However, {{it is often difficult}} for nonnative English users to read, understand, and follow information written in English. In this study, a query translation-based cross-language diagnosis (Q-CLD) tool for assisting nonnative English users diagnosing print defects was developed and then evaluated. ^ The first step in developing the Q-CLD tool involved collecting print defect descriptions in Korean and English from 40 subjects in five universities in Korea. The remaining 40 subjects were from Purdue University. In the next step, three fuzzy Bayesian models were developed: one was based on English descriptions provided by English speaking subjects (referred to as the native English model); the second used English descriptions provided by Korean subjects (referred to as the nonnative English model); and the third used Korean descriptions provided by Korean subjects (referred to as the Korean model). Performance of the models was then evaluated using five different types of input descriptions: English descriptions given by English subjects (referred to as the native English descriptions); English descriptions given by Korean subjects (referred to as the nonnative English descriptions); Korean descriptions given by Korean subjects; descriptions translated from Korean into English using the Google translator (referred to as the Google translations); and descriptions translated from Korean into English using a keywords matching method developed in this dissertation (referred to as the keywords matching translations). Native English descriptions, Google translations, and keywords matching translations were used as inputs to evaluate the native English model. Korean descriptions were used as inputs to evaluate the Korean model. Nonnative English descriptions were used as inputs to evaluate both the native English model and the nonnative English model. ^ The native English model using the native English descriptions gave the most accurate predictions of the tested models. In this case, the native English model correctly predicted 45 % of the print defects with its top prediction, and in 87 % of the cases the actual defect was one of the top five predictions. The keywords matching translations were nearly as accurate as the native English descriptions. Using the keywords matching translations, the native English model correctly predicted 37 % of the print defects with its top prediction and, in 80 % of the cases the actual defect was one of the top five predictions. Both were better than the predictions of the other tested models. ^ The query translation-based Korean-English cross-language diagnosis (Q-KE-CLD) tool used for print quality troubleshooting was then implemented and evaluated through a human factors experiment conducted in four universities in South Korea. The experimental results showed that Korean subjects both generated Korean queries faster (p = 0. 008) and identified print defects faster (p = 0. 051) when they entered Korean queries. In addition, the subjects rated Korean queries as being easier to generate (p = 0. 004). Untrained subjects reported that use of the Korean language made it easier to generate queries and identify print defects. Overall, the Q-KE-CLD tool resulted in <b>quicker</b> identification of <b>print</b> defects at all user levels. ...|$|R
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionInequality {{of green}} space distribution {{is a type}} of social production which by creating uneven ecological conditions in a feedback cycle plays its role on the quality of environment and intensification of imbalances inside the urban living environment. Most of the studies conducted so far have focused on the development or distribution of public green space {{but the truth is that}} public green spaces have not been the only source of urban metabolism (from the viewpoint of green space function) and a great part of the role of urban green space is undertaken by private green spaces. “What effect do private greeneries located in residential areas have on the quality of citizens’ life or what kind of reality is asserted by their development and distribution pattern in the urban life of today’s modern society” were issues of less attention. Thus, considering the interconnection of green space production and distribution pattern (public and private) with the rest of natural, social, economic and fabric conditions, the present research benefits from NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as a dependent variable which has been influenced by ecological, social, fabric and economic variables and has analyzed them to identify effective factors in Tehran inequality urban green space. The present article theoretically makes use of urban political ecology approach and is considered a correlational research. The required data have been prepared and analyzed by some types of software such as ArcGIS, ArcView, IDRISI, ERDAS Imagine, and SPSS. In conducting this research some techniques have been used such as; “Average Distance to Nearest Neighbor”, “Square Analysis”, “Correlational Analysis and Factor Analysis”. 2 -Theoretical basis The present study is theoretically based on an urban political ecology approach. Urban components including green space from urban political ecological perspective are considered a kind of social production whose imagination and change are influenced by political economy, dominant pattern of public and private ownership in society (Heynen, Perkins and Roy, 2006 : 3). The aforementioned perspective clearly states that urban material conditions which includes urban environment too are controlled and manipulated by the elite and city experts to serve their interests. This issue is conducive to make some of the urban social groups marginalized and deprived from natural riches and urban environmental artifacts. As a result, the quality of urban environment (physically and socially) increases in some neighborhoods and decreases in others (Heynen, Kaika and Swyngedouw, 2006 : 1 - 15). Since unequal greenery distribution with creating imbalanced ecological conditions often plays its role in a feedback cycle on environment quality and intensification of inequalities within urban life environment, the present study uses pattern of canopy distribution located in areas of residential uses (private and public) to reveal social, economic and spatial inequalities in Tehran. 3 - DiscussionThe results of this research in relation to Tehran city confirm the determining position of urban political ecology in forming distribution pattern and density of trees canopy located in areas of Tehran. This is a subject which is confirmed by studies conducted on urban green space (including public and private) in the cities such as San Diego, Toronto (by Perkins, Heynen and Wilson 2004, Scobedo and colleagues 2005, Heynen, Perkins and Roy 2006 and Conway, Shakeel and Atallah 2011). Also, so far many researchers on the urban issues of Tehran city (such as Madanipoor 2005, Horkad 2009) have emphasized the conformity of natural topography over social topography in Tehran. The result f this attempt, while confirming aforementioned perspectives, indicated that the distribution pattern of canopy density in residential areas(private urban green space) has a greater capability to portray social classifications and environmental quality and as a result spatial inequalities in Tehran city due to the fact that their production, distribution and density are performed in relation to different natural, social, economic and fabric-spatial factors. 4 - Conclusion The attained results from the analysis of canopy density dispersion in Tehran residential areas indicated that areas with thick and very thick tree-coverage density possess quite clustered patterns and geographically are almost conformed to the northern urban regions which have a more desirable environmental quality. Also, the areas with average density have an almost scattered pattern and geographically show more development in the northern half of Tehran. Areas with low density or without tree coverage at all have also scattered patterns. Nevertheless, with respect to the concentration of residential blocks without tree coverage, their spatial dispersion pattern have changed to quite scattered patterns which are geographically conformed to the areas with thick density population, problematic, old and low environmental quality tissues. According to the results obtained from Rotated Component Matrix of factor analysis, five main components which indicate spatial inequality in Tehran are: economical – ecological factors, settlement pattern of social classes and residential quality factors, structure quality and city texture, family density in residential units and density and centralization of population and contaminant uses. 5 - SuggestionsIn a society like Iran, whose almost 70 percent population are urban, it is vital to schedule justly to decrease social and economic inequalities and their bad functional outcomes in cities. This subject is of particular importance in relation to Tehran and its urban collection which accommodates 19 percent of the total country’s population and which plays an important role in political stability of Iran. After the victory of Islamic revolution the economic powers had fewer facilities to show luxurious and lavish styles and this was because they had a cultural and fair approach. As a result, the dimensions of social inequality are not much visible in the society. Therefore, with respect to difficulties of access to sources of documented information (such as families’ income and their financial and non- financial facilities), it is suggested to seriously pay attention to technology development in using variables and spatial indicators such as the use of Normalized Vegetarian Index (NDVI) in the present article which has an interactive relationship with social and economic conditions to measure spatial inequality in cities and metropolises.
