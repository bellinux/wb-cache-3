25|$|Predators of queen snakes are raccoons, otters, mink, hawks and herons. Large {{frogs and}} fish will also eat the young snakes. The main {{threat to the}} <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> is habitat loss as {{waterways}} are drained, disturbed or polluted. Crayfish, their main food, are sensitive to acidification and accumulation of heavy metals. Thus, as waterways have become polluted and crayfish have died out, the <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> population has declined throughout its former range. In many areas the <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> has disappeared or has become in danger of doing so.|$|E

25|$|R. septemvittata {{is known}} by many common names, {{including}} the following: banded water snake, brown <b>queen</b> <b>snake,</b> diamond-back water snake, leather snake, moon snake, North American seven-banded snake, olive water snake, pale snake, queen water snake, seven-striped water snake, striped water snake, three-striped water snake, willow snake, and yellow-bellied snake.|$|E
25|$|Other {{sources of}} food include frogs, tadpoles, newts, minnows, snails, and fairy shrimp. The <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> does not find its food by sight or heat detection, but by smell, using its tongue {{to carry the}} scent of its prey to receptors within its mouth.

25|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to a garter snake, genus Thamnophis, so is often confused with that group. The <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> is olive to gray or dark brown in overall coloration, with peach or yellow stripes that run down its length at the first scale row. There are also four prominent ventral stripes of a darker colour, and as no other similar species has stripes running {{down the length of}} its belly, this is an important feature in identifying this snake. In the young and juvenile snakes there are three extra stripes: one stripe that runs along the vertebral dorsal scales, and two stripes (one on each side) that run {{down the length of the}} body at scale rows five and six. These extra stripes tend to fade as the snake matures, but when young the snake will have a total of seven stripes, three on the back and four on the belly, which gives cause for its taxonomical reference name, Regina (queen) septemvittata (seven-striped). The belly of the snake is a cream to yellow colour.|$|E

25|$|The {{head of the}} <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> is {{narrow and}} has nine large plate-like scales on the top, and the chin has several rows of thicker scales. This is a {{protective}} adaptation, for the snake's feeding habit of chasing its prey under rocks. The pupil of the eye is round, a feature shared with most other colubrids. There are 19 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and the anal plate is divided. The sexes are often difficult to distinguish based on external characteristics. Male queen snakes have relatively longer tails than females. Males have from 65 to 89 subcaudal scutes (average 76), with the tail from 23% to 34% of the snake's total length. Females have 54 to 87 subcaudals (average 69), with tails equal to 19% to 27% of total length.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>snake</b> is in {{a period}} of brumation {{throughout}} the winter months, and groups of them can be found in [...] "hibernacula", near water.

40|$|Abstract—Although mercury (Hg) is a well-studied contaminant, {{knowledge}} about Hg accumulation in snakes is limited. The authors evaluated Hg bioaccumulation within and among four snake species (northern watersnakes, Nerodia sipedon; <b>queen</b> <b>snakes,</b> Regina septemvittata; common garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis; and rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta [Pantherophis alleghaniensis]) from a contaminated {{site on the}} South River (Waynesboro, VA, USA) and two nearby reference sites. Total Hg (THg) concentrations in northern watersnake tail tissue at the contaminated site ranged from 2. 25 to 13. 84 mg/kg dry weight (mean: 4. 85 0. 29), or 11 to 19 times higher than reference sites. Blood THg concentrations (0. 03 – 7. 04 mg/kg wet wt; mean: 2. 24 0. 42) were strongly correlated with tail concentrations and were the highest yet reported in a snake species. Within watersnakes, nitrogen stable isotope values indicated ontogenetic trophic shifts that correlated with THg bioaccumulation, suggesting that diet plays a substantial role in Hg exposure. Female watersnakes had higher mean THg concentrations (5. 67 0. 46 mg/kg) than males (4. 93 0. 49 mg/kg), but {{no significant differences between}} sexes were observed after correcting for body size. Interspecific comparisons identified differences in THg concentrations among snake species, with more aquatic species (watersnakes and <b>queen</b> <b>snakes)</b> accumulating higher mean concentrations (5. 60 0. 40 and 4. 59 0. 38 mg/kg in tail tissue, respectively) than the more terrestrial species, garter snakes and rat snakes (1. 28 0. 32 and 0. 26 0. 09 mg/kg, respectively).

25|$|It is a diurnal species, {{but it can}} {{be found}} moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit. They will also come out of the water to bask in the sun, often {{perching}} on branches or roots above or near the waters edge. <b>Queen</b> <b>snakes</b> are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in this defense.|$|R
25|$|Female <b>queen</b> <b>snakes</b> will {{be fully}} sexually mature at three years of age, males at two years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} spring and autumn months. If mating was in the autumn, the female can delay giving birth till spring, storing the energy she will need through the months that she will be in a period of brumation. This snake is ovoviviparous, the female giving birth to live young after {{carrying}} the eggs within her body. This differs from oviparous and viviparous snakes. Litter size can vary from 5 to 20, and the time for an individual birth is from 1.5 to 2.5 minutes. Time between individual births is 4 minutes to 1 hour, with the average time being 11 minutes.|$|R

40|$|The latent multinomial model (LMM) {{model of}} Link et al. (2010) {{provided}} a general framework for modelling mark-recapture data with potential errors in identification. Key to {{this approach was}} a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for sampling possible configurations of the counts true capture histories that could have generated the observed data. This MCMC algorithm used vectors from {{a basis for the}} kernel of the linear map between the true and observed counts to move between the possible configurations of the true data. Schofield and Bonner (2015) showed that a strict basis was sufficient for some models of the errors, including the model presented by Link et al. (2010), but a larger set called a Markov basis may be required for more complex models. We address two further challenges with this approach: 1) that models with more complex error mechanisms do not fit easily within the LMM and 2) that the Markov basis can be difficult or impossible to compute for even moderate sized studies. We address these issues by extending the LMM to separately model the capture/demographic process and the error process and by developing a new MCMC sampling scheme using dynamic Markov bases. Our work is motivated by a study of <b>Queen</b> <b>snakes</b> (Regina septemvittata) in Kentucky, USA, and we use simulation to compare the use of PIT tags, with perfect identification, and brands, which are prone to error, when estimating survival rates...|$|R
