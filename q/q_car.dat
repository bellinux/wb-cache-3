40|$|We {{report on}} {{variations}} in important X-ray emission lines {{in a series}} of Chandra grating spectra of the supermassive colliding wind binary star eta Car, including key phases around the X-ray minimum/periastron passage in 2003. 5. The X-rays arise from the collision of the slow, dense wind of eta Car with the fast, low-density wind of an otherwise hidden companion star. The X-ray emission lines provide the only direct measure of the flow dynamics of the companion's wind along the wind-wind collision zone. We concentrate here on the silicon and sulfur lines, which are the strongest and best resolved lines in the X-ray spectra. Most of the line profiles can be adequately fit with symmetric Gaussians with little significant skewness. Both the silicon and sulfur lines show significant velocity shifts and correlated increases in line widths through the observations. The R = forbidden-to-intercombination ratio from the Si XIII and S XV triplets is near or above the low-density limit in all observations, suggesting that the line-forming region is > 1. 6 stellar radii from the companion star, and that the emitting plasma may be in a non-equilibrium state. We show that simple geometrical models cannot simultaneously fit both the observed centroid variations and changes in line width as a function of phase. We show that the observed profiles can be fitted with synthetic profiles with a reasonable model of the emissivity along the wind-wind collision boundary. We use this analysis to help constrain the line formation region as a function of orbital phase, and the orbital geometry.

40|$|Aims: Vascular {{calcification}} (VC) {{is highly}} correlated with increased morbidity and mortality in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Allosteric modulation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) by calcimimetics inhibits VC in animal models of advanced CKD. Here, we investigated {{the expression of the}} CaR in the vasculature and tested the ability of calcimimetics to prevent vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification in vitro. Methods and results: Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that CaR protein is present in VSMC in normal, non-calcified human arteries. In contrast, low levels of CaR immunoreactivity were detected in atherosclerotic, calcified arteries. Immunfluorescence and immunoblotting revealed that CaR protein was also expressed by human and bovine VSMC in vitro. Acute stimulation of VSMC with increased Ca 2 + stimulated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation, suggesting that the VSMC CaR is functional. VSMC CaR expression decreased when these cells deposited a mineralized matrix or following 24 h incubation in mineralization medium with increased (i. e. 1. 8 or 2. 5 mM) Ca 2 +. Culturing VSMC in mineralization medium containing 1. 8 and 2. 5 mM Ca 2 + or with the membrane-impermeant CaR agonist Gd 3 + enhanced mineral deposition compared with that observed in 1. 2 mM Ca 2 +. Over-expression of dominant-negative (R 185 <b>Q)</b> <b>CaR</b> enhanced, whereas the calcimimetic R- 568 attenuated, VSMC mineral deposition. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that: (i) VSMCs express a functional CaR; (ii) a reduction in CaR expression is associated with increased mineralization in vivo and in vitro; (iii) calcimimetics decrease mineral deposition by VSMC. These data suggest that calcimimetics may inhibit the development of VC in CKD patients...|$|E
40|$|We {{characterized}} the in vivo, cellular and molecular pathophysiology {{of a case}} of neonatal hyperparathyroidism (NHPT) resulting from a de novo, heterozygous missense mutation in the gene for the extracellular Ca 2 + (Ca 2 +(o)) -sensing receptor (CaR). The female neonate presented with moderately severe hypercalcemia, markedly undermineralized bones, and multiple metaphyseal fractures. Subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed at 6 wk; hypercalcemia recurred rapidly but the bone disease improved gradually with reversion to an asymptomatic state resembling familial benign hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FBHH). Dispersed parathyroid cells from the resected tissue showed a set-point (the level of Ca 2 +(o) half maximally inhibiting PTH secretion) substantially higher than for normal human parathyroid cells (approximately 1. 8 vs. approximately 1. 0 mM, respectively); a similar increase in set-point was observed in vivo. The proband's CaR gene showed a missense mutation (R 185 Q) at codon 185, while her normocalcemic parents were homozygous for wild type (WT) CaR sequence. Transient expression of the mutant R 185 <b>Q</b> <b>CaR</b> in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells revealed a substantially attenuated Ca 2 +(o) -evoked accumulation of total inositol phosphates (IP), while cotransfection of normal and mutant receptors showed an EC 50 (the level of Ca 2 +(o) eliciting a half-maximal increase in IPs) 37 % higher than for WT CaR alone (6. 3 +/- 0. 4 vs. 4. 6 +/- 0. 3 mM Ca 2 +(o), respectively). Thus this de novo, heterozygous CaR mutation may exert a dominant negative action on the normal CaR, producing NHPT and more severe hypercalcemia than typically seen with FBHH. Moreover, normal maternal calcium homeostasis promoted additional secondary hyperparathyroidism in the fetus, contributing to {{the severity of the}} NHPT in this case with FBHH...|$|E

40|$|The 20 q 13 {{chromosomal}} region {{has been previously}} identified as the hereditary prostate cancer geneticsusceptibility locus on chromosome 20 (HPC 20). In this study, the 20 q 13 region was shown to be frequently co-amplified with the androgen receptor (AR) inmetastatic prostate cancer. Furthermore, the ARsignaling axis,which plays {{an essential role in}} the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, was demonstrated to be central to the regulation of the 20 q 13 common amplified region (CAR). High-resolution mapping analyses revealed hot spots of AR recruitment to response elements in the vicinity ofmost genes located on the 20 <b>q</b> 13 <b>CAR.</b> Moreover, amplification ofAR significantly co-occurred with CAR amplification on 20 q 13 and it was confirmed that the majority of AR-bound genes on the 20 <b>q</b> 13 <b>CAR</b> were indeed regulated by androgens. These data reveal that amplification of the AR is tightly linked to amplification of the AR-regulated CAR region on 20 q 13. These results suggest that the cross-talk between gene amplification and gene transcription is an important step in the development of castration-resistantmetastatic disease. Implications: These novel results are a noteworthy example of the cross-talk between gene amplification and gene transcription in the development of advanced prostate cancer.

40|$|This study {{draws upon}} {{organizational}} {{learning in the}} management domain and analogical reasoning in the psychology arena to examine the antecedents of acquisition success {{in a study of}} 655 firms from 54 industries that conducted 2622 acquisitions from 1991 through 2005. Where previous work in this domain focused on cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) as the measure of performance and ordinary least squares as the method of analysis, this work extends the literature by introducing Tobin's Q-ratio as the measure of performance and autoregressive, integrated, moving average (ARIMA) model with transfer functions as the methodological approach. Earlier research on the influence of prior experience on focal acquisition performance has yielded interesting insights despite variation in findings. However, CAR is a short-term measure that is dependent upon stockholder reaction and does not fully anticipate the long-term fitness of the acquisition event. Ex ante, this study expected to result in a meta-narrative applicable to all merger and acquisition activity that could guide management of an acquisition program through the identification of the antecedent conditions of success. Prior research suggests that the Q measure is more relevant to managerial understanding and strategic orientation than insights gained from investor opinion as measured from cumulative abnormal returns. This study's findings suggest that acquisition experience, timing, antecedent performance, and, interaction between experience, timing and performance are all related to focal acquisition results. Further, when ARIMA is used to analyze the data and Q is the dependent variable, additional details and richer insights about the influence of the independent measures are gained. These findings justify the additional effort and time necessary for managers to use Tobin's <b>Q.</b> Additionally, while <b>CAR</b> does provide a particular set of actionable information, Tobin's Q-ratio provides a more robust long-term indicator of acquisition performance especially where analogical reasoning is the process through which learning is demonstrated...|$|R
