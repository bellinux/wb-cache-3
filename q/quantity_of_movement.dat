6000|$|The {{weeks have}} been many and crowded since I received, not very many days after my arrival, your incisive letter {{from the depths of}} the so {{different}} world (from this here;) but it's just because they have been so animated, peopled and pervaded, that they have rushed by like loud-puffing motor-cars, passing out of my sight before I could step back out of the dust and the noise long enough to dash you off such a response as I could fling after them to be carried to you. And during my first three or four here my postbag was enormously--appallingly--heavy: I almost turned tail and re-embarked at the sight of it. And then I wanted above all, before writing you, to make myself a notion of how, and where, and even what, I was. I have turned round now a good many times, though still, for two months, only in this corner of a corner of a corner, that is round New England; and the postbag has, happily, shrunken a good bit (though with liabilities, I fear, of re-expanding,) and this exquisite Indian summer day sleeps upon these really admirable little Massachusetts mountains, lakes and woods, in a way that lulls my perpetual sense of precipitation. I have moved from my own fireside for long years so little (have been abroad, till now, but once, for ten years previous) that the mere <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> remains something of a terror and a paralysis to me--though I am getting to brave it, and to like it, as the sense of adventure, of holiday and romance, and above all of the great so visible and observable world that stretches before one more and more, comes through and makes the tone of one's days and the counterpoise of one's homesickness. I am, {{at the back of my}} head and at the bottom of my heart, transcendently homesick, and with a sustaining private reference, all the while (at every moment, verily,) to the fact that I have a tight anchorage, a definite little downward burrow, in the ancient world--a secret consciousness that I chink in my pocket as if it were a fortune in a handful of silver. But, with this, I have a most charming and interesting time, and [am] seeing, feeling, how agreeable it is, in the maturity of age, to revisit the long neglected and long unseen land of one's birth--especially when that land affects one as such a living and breathing and feeling and moving great monster as this one is. It is all very interesting and quite unexpectedly and almost uncannily delightful and sympathetic--partly, or largely from my intense impression (all this glorious golden autumn, with weather like tinkling crystal and colours like molten jewels) of the sweetness of the country itself, this New England rural vastness, which is all that I've seen. I've been only in the country--shamelessly visiting and almost only old friends and scattered relations--but have found it far more beautiful and amiable than I had ever dreamed, or than I ventured to remember. I had seen too little, in fact, of old, to have anything, to speak of, to remember--so that seeing so many charming things for the first time I quite thrill with the romance of elderly and belated discovery. Of Boston I haven't even had a full day--of N.Y. but three hours, and I have seen nothing whatever, thank heaven, of the [...] "littery" [...] world. I have spent a few days at Cambridge, Mass., with my brother, and have been greatly struck with the way that in the last 25 years Harvard has come to mass so much larger and to have gathered about her such a swarm of distinguished specialists and such a big organization of learning. This impression is increased this year by the crowd of foreign experts of sorts (mainly philosophic etc.) who have been at the St. Louis congress and who appear to be turning up overwhelmingly under my brother's roof--but who will have vanished, I hope, when I go to spend the month of November with him--when I shall see something of the goodly Boston. The blot on my vision and the shadow on my path is that I have contracted to write a book of Notes--without which contraction I simply couldn't have come; and that the conditions of life, time, space, movement etc. (really to see, to get one's material,) are such as to threaten utterly to frustrate for me any prospect of simultaneous work--which is the rock on which I may split altogether--wherefore my alarm is great and my project much disconcerted; for I have as yet scarce dipped into the great Basin at all. Only a large measure of Time can help me--to do anything as decent as I want: wherefore pray for me constantly; and all the more that if I can only arrive at a means of application (for I see, already, from here, my Tone) I shall do, verily, a lovely book. I am interested, up to my eyes--at least I think I am! But you will fear, at this rate, that I am trying the book on you already. I may have to return to England only as a saturated sponge and wring myself out there. I hope meanwhile that your own saturations, and Mrs. Nelly's, prosper, and that the Pyrenean, in particular, continued rich and ample. If you are having the easy part of your year now, I hope you are finding in it the lordliest, or rather the unlordliest leisure....

In IUGR fetuses, cross-sectional comparisons were {{made between the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> fetal <b>movements</b> and (1) the fetal clinical condition and (2) the quality <b>of</b> general <b>movements.</b> In addition, the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> fetal <b>movements</b> in IUGR was compared with that in uncomplicated pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by premature rupture of the amniotic membranes. In IUGR, the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> declined from 25 weeks gestation onwards, whereas the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> fetal breathing <b>movements</b> increased. Longitudinal assessment of these parameters was obtained in four cases and showed a decline <b>of</b> general <b>movements.</b> No relationship between prenatal longitudinal data and neonatal outcome could be observed. Relating the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> and breathing movements to the fetal condition, growth retarded fetuses were divided into three groups according to fetal deterioration. 1. Normal amount of amniotic fluid and normal fetal heart rate patterns. 2. Reduced amount of amniotic fluid. 3. Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns. The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> {{as well as that}} <b>of</b> breathing <b>movements</b> was low in group 3, compared to group 1. In group 2 only the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> breathing <b>movements</b> and not <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> was low. A similar pattern was found in the relation with the quality <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> observed during fetal deterioration. Cross-sectional analysis of median values (28 - 31 weeks gestation) did not reveal differences in the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> general <b>movements</b> when IUGR, normal pregnancies and premature rupture of the membranes (with or without oligohydramnios) were compared.

This study investigates the development of day- and night-time as well as intensity and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> circadian motor activity during a 4 -week course of treatment among 27 patients with depression compared to 27 healthy controls. A diagnosis of major depression was made using SCID. Motor activity was continuously measured with an actigraph during the study and clinical course of depression with HAM-D- 21. Motor activity was described as the <b>quantity</b> and intensity <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> during day- and night- time. Clinically improved patients had significantly intensified movements after 4 weeks, compared to subjects with < 50 % improvement on HAM-D. While the measures of day-time level <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> captured the clinical improvement of depression, clinical improvement was not reflected by the night-time measurements. This study demonstrates that the separated analysis <b>of</b> level and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movements</b> supports {{a better understanding of the}} nature of psychomotor retardation during depression. The subdivision in day- and night-time activity objectively measured with actigraphy captures distinct patterns of motor activity and represents prognostic factors in the treatment outcome of depression.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a finite cellular automaton with particles where each site can host at most one particle.

Such a configuration corresponds in fact to a regular placement. This problem is a cellular automata equivalent of load-balancing in parallel computing, where each task is a particle and each processor a connected set of sites. We present a cellular automata rule that solves this problem in the 1 D case, and is convergent, i. e. once the regular placement is achieved, the configuration does not change anymore. The rule is inspired from the Lloyd algorithm, computing a centroidal Voronoi tessellation. The dynamic of the rule is described at a higher level, using self-explanatory space-time diagrams.

We argue that such a classification not only depicts the status quo of qualitative and quantitative movement analysis, but also allows for identifying those aspects of movement for which similarity measures are scarce or entirely missing. In this review paper we, first, decompose movement into its spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal movement parameters. A movement parameter is a physical <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement,</b> such as speed, spatial path, or temporal duration.

40|$|Abstract: Limited {{behavioural}} repertoire impacts {{quality of life}} in chronic schizophrenia. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> can be increased by modafinil. However, increased movement in itself may be of limited clinical significance. Hence, we sought to analyse the ‘structure ’ of spontaneous movement in patients with schizophrenia and to examine whether the chunking of spontaneous activity has a neuroanatomical basis. ‘Actiwatches’ were used to record spontaneous motor activity over a 20 hour period in sixteen male patients with schizophrenia. Time-series data were analysed for the number of discrete spontaneous activities, which might indicate a degree of structure to ongoing activity. Subjects underwent a whole-brain structural MRI scan. The ‘number of discrete movement epochs ’ correlated with volumes of regions within bilateral rostro-ventral putamen and temporal poles. These data suggest that in people with schizophrenia the volume of bilateral putamen may influence the complexity of their behaviours, as distinct from the overall amount of behaviour.

Methods: We used wearable inertial movement sensors to record full-day leg movement activity from 12 infants with typical development, ages 1 – 12 months. Each infant was tested three times across 5 months, and followed until the onset of independent walking. We developed and validated an algorithm to identify infant-produced leg movements. Results: Infants moved their legs tens of thousands of times per day. There was a significant effect <b>of</b> leg <b>movement</b> <b>quantity</b> on walking onset. Infants who moved their legs more walked later than infants who moved their legs less, even when adjusting for age, developmental level or percentile length. We will need a much larger sample to adequately capture and describe the effect <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> experience on developmental rate. Our algorithm defines a leg movement in a specific way (each pause or change in direction is counted as a new movement), and further assessment <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> characteristics are necessary before we can fully understand and interpret our finding that infants who moved their legs more walked later than infants who moved their legs less. Conclusions: We have shown that typically-developing infants produce thousands <b>of</b> leg <b>movements</b> in a typical day, and that this can be accurately captured in the home environment using wearable sensors.

Study Design: Motor activity was assessed from repeated videotape recordings in 32 preterm infants (less {{than or equal to}} 33 weeks gestation). Sixteen infants required indomethacin therapy for treatment of PDA, 16 were control infants, matched for gestational age. Indomethacin (0. 2 mg/kg i. v. in 5 min) was given thrice, with an interval of 12 h. One-hour record ings were made immediately before and immediately after the first dose of indomethacin and 24 h later before and after the third dose. The same recording schedule was used for the control infants. Th effects <b>of</b> indomethacin on <b>quantity</b> and quality <b>of</b> spontaneous motor activity were examined. Results: A significant reduction in the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> several spontaneous <b>movement</b> patterns and an increase in the occurrence of rest periods were found following the first indomethacin administration (p < 0. 01). Concerning the quality <b>of</b> general <b>movements,</b> a reduction in the speed was found (p < 0. 05). Both effects were not found after the third indomethacin administration. Conclusion: In preterm infants with a PDA, treatment with indomethacin leads to a transient reduction in the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>movement</b> patterns and to a decrease in the speed <b>of</b> general <b>movements.</b> We recommend a cautious use of bolus indomethacin for the treatment of PDA.

40|$|In {{clinical}} settings, functional {{evaluation of}} shoulder movement is primarily {{based on what}} the patient thinks he/she is able to do rather than what he/she is actually performing. We proposed a new approach for shoulder assessment based on inertial sensors to monitor arm movement in the daily routine. The detection of movement of the humerus relative to the trunk was first validated in a laboratory setting (sensitivity> 95 %, specificity> 97 %). Then, 41 control subjects and 21 patients suffering from a rotator cuff tear were evaluated (before and after surgery) using clinical questionnaires and a one-day measurement of arm movement. The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> was estimated with the movement frequency and its symmetry index (SIFr). The quality of movement was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance (KS) between the cumulative distribution of the arm velocity for controls and the same distribution for each patient. SIFr presented differences between patients and controls at 3 month follow-up (p< 0. 05) while KS showed differences also after 6 months (p< 0. 01). SIFr illustrated a change in dominance due to the disorder whereas KS, which appeared independent of the dominance and occupation, showed a change in movement velocity. Both parameters were correlated to clinical scores (R(2) reaching 0. 5). This approach provides clinicians with new objective parameters for evaluating the functional ability of the shoulder in daily conditions, which could be useful for outcome assessment after surgery...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{solution}} to the problem of self-deploying a network of wireless mobile robots with simultaneous consideration to several criteria, that are, the fault-tolerance (biconnectivity) of the resulting network, its coverage, its diameter, and the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> required to complete the deployment. These criteria have already been addressed individually in previous works, but we propose here an elegant solution to address all of them at once. Our approach is based on combining two complementary sets of virtual forces: spring forces, whose properties are well known to provide optimal coverage at reasonable movement cost, and angular forces, a new type of force proposed here whose effect is to rotate two angularly consecutive neighbors of a node toward one another when the corresponding angle is larger than 60 ◦ (even if these two nodes are not themselves neighbors). Angular forces have the global effect of biconnecting the network and reducing its diameter, while not affecting the benefits obtained by spring forces on coverage. In this paper we give a detailed description of both types of forces, whose combination poses a number of technical challenges. We also provide an implementation that relies only on position exchanges within two hops. Extensive simulations are finally presented to evaluate the solution against all criteria (coverage, biconnectivity, quantity of movements, and diameter), and show its advantages over prior solutions.

40|$|Landslide {{communities}} and the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> the surface layer were studied in Doudaira, Mt. Tanzawa, Central Japan. In this district, landslide communities have been classified into four types; Agrostis alba stand (A), Cirsio-Campanuletum hondoensis typical subassociation (Ba), Cirsio-Campanuletum hondoensis subassociation of Rubus illecebrosus (Bb), and Leucosceptrum japonicum f. barbinerve-Deutzia crenata ommunity (C). Community A is mainly found on slopes where revegetation has been carried out; the other types are found on natural slopes. The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> surface <b>movement</b> in each community on natural slopes {{has a tendency to}} decrease, in the order Ba>Bb>C. It is shown that the types of appearance in landslide communities strongly depend on surface disturbances.

40|$|Mobilities {{scholarship}} has provided convincing {{accounts of the}} increase in the <b>quantity</b> and range <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> people and things. Literary texts have responded to this increased mobility. Drawing on Rancière’s notion of the ‘distribution of the sensible’ and Badiou’s idea of literature as an ‘event’, this paper develops the idea of mobile forms that identify the literary text as an aesthetic object that is realised in moments and always on the point of disappearing...|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} {{of this paper}} is as follows: section “The mathematical model” is devoted to describing in mathematical terms the functioning of the cash flow of any branch, by separating the different types of deposits and expenditures and modeling them. In this section, we also choose the variables and we design a proper objective function which captures all the costs involved in the cash movements. In section “The random deposits and expenditures”, we catch the random elements of the model, such as number of branch users or number and <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> cash <b>movements</b> (deposits and withdrawals), by defining suitable Poisson (compound) processes. In addition, we extract some useful properties to be used in later sections.|$|R
