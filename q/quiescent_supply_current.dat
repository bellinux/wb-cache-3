40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} {{distinguishing}} and classifying {{the responses of}} analog integrated circuits containing catastrophic faults has aroused recent interest. The problem is made more difficult when parametric variations are taken into account. Hence, statistical methods and techniques such as neural networks have been employed to automate classification. The major drawback to such techniques has been the implicit assumption that the variances of the responses of faulty circuits {{have been the same}} as each other and {{the same as that of}} the fault-free circuit. This assumption can be shown to be false. Neural networks, moreover, have proved to be slow. This paper describes a new neural network structure that clusters responses assuming different means and variances. Sophisticated statistical techniques are employed to handle situations where the variance tends to zero, such as happens with a fault that causes a response to be stuck at a supply rail. Two example circuits are used to show that this technique is significantly more accurate than other classification methods. A set of responses can be classified in the order of 1 s.

The device was characterized in terms of output voltage and supply current at different input voltage levels {{as a function of}} temperature between + 210 C and - 190 C. Line and load regulation characteristics were also established at six load levels and at different temperatures. Restart capability at extreme temperatures and the effects of thermal cycling, covering the test temperature range, on its operation and stability were also investigated. Under no load condition, the voltage reference chip exhibited good stability in its output over the temperature range of - 50 C to + 200 C. Outside that temperature range, output voltage did change as temperature was changed. For example, at the extreme temperatures of + 210 C and - 190 C, the output level dropped to 2. 43 V and 2. 32 V, respectively as compared to the nominal value of 2. 5 V. At cryogenic test temperatures of - 100 C and - 150 C the output voltage dropped by about 20 %. The <b>quiescent</b> <b>supply</b> <b>current</b> of the voltage reference varied slightly with temperature but remained close to its specified value.
