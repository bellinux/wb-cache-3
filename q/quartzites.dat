50|$|Baraboo <b>Quartzite</b> is a Precambrian {{geological}} formation of <b>quartzite,</b> {{found in the}} region of Baraboo, Wisconsin. While pure <b>quartzite</b> is usually white or gray, Baraboo <b>Quartzite</b> is typically dark purple to maroon in color, due to the presence of iron (hematite) and other impurities. Baraboo <b>Quartzite</b> may display strata created by progressive deposition of layers of sand in the original sandstone from which the <b>quartzite</b> was formed (through metamorphism). Specimens of Baraboo <b>quartzite</b> may also display ripple marks that appear visually similar to the patterns one might see in the sand at a beach. Ripples indicate that the sandstone from which the <b>quartzite</b> was metamorphosed was originally water-laid sediment.|$|R
50|$|Van Hise Rock {{is made of}} Baraboo <b>quartzite,</b> a type of pink-purple <b>quartzite</b> {{found in}} south central Wisconsin. It {{is one of the}} best-exposed parts of the Baraboo Range, a ring of <b>quartzite</b> hills that passes through Columbia and Sauk Counties. The <b>quartzite</b> in the range was formed as {{sandstone}} during the Precambrian Supereon; then a greenschist phase changed it to <b>quartzite.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bedrock is the Lower Cambrian Sugarloaf Mountain <b>Quartzite,</b> {{a massive}} white <b>quartzite</b> {{interbedded}} with softer sericitic <b>quartzite,</b> slate, and phyllite. The formation {{is divided into}} upper, middle, and lower members.|$|R
25|$|The {{conglomerate}} {{is typically}} a medium to fine grained brown to buff sandstone consisting of angular to sub angular grains with scattered flakes of mica; {{it makes a}} good building stone. Conglomerates occur in the basal part of the sequence and shale bands that are micaceous occur in the highest beds. Viewed regionally, the conglomerates appear to be impersistent. Near {{the southern end of}} the district where the ground is not covered by drift three conglomerates can be mapped. The bottom and most important is mostly pebbles - quartz and <b>quartzites</b> with occasional grits and rarely some igneous. These are set in a medium to coarse grained sand matrix. the pebbles can be up to 100mm long.|$|E
25|$|The Wicklow Mountains are {{primarily}} composed of granite {{surrounded by an}} envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. The oldest rocks are the <b>quartzites</b> of the Bray Group that include Bray Head and the Little Sugar Loaf and Great Sugar Loaf mountains. These metamorphosed from sandstone deposited in the deep waters of the primeval Iapetus Ocean during the Cambrian period (542-488 million years ago). Layers of sediment continued to form slates and shales along the ocean floor mixed with volcanic rock pushed up as Iapetus began to shrink {{by the process of}} subduction during the Ordovician period (488-443 million years ago). These rocks now underlie the uplifted peneplain of the Vartry Plateau between the Bray Group and the main range.|$|E
25|$|During the {{break-up}} of Gondwana {{and the formation}} of the Atlantic Ocean some 200 million years ago, minor crustal fragments that were to become the Falkland Islands detached themselves from the nascent African continent and drifted westwards, dividing and rotating as they did so before settling on the Patagonian Shelf. Most of the layers of West Falkland and its surrounding islands are slightly inclined from the horizontal. This inclination shows different types of rocks in different places. The <b>quartzites</b> of Port Stephens and Stanley are more resistant than the arenaceous sediments of the formation at Fox Bay. The Hornby Mountains, near Falkland Sound have experienced tectonic forces of uplift and folding which has inclined the quartzite beds of Stanley to the vertical.|$|E

25|$|The Cesar-Ranchería Basin is {{underlain}} by Neoproterozoic basement. The Sierra Nevada Metamorphic Belt {{was formed}} during the Grenville orogeny, when the supercontinent Rodinia was formed {{due to the}} collision of Amazonia, Baltica and Laurentia. The granulites and gneisses of the complex have been dated to 1.5 to 1.0 Ga. The phyllites and <b>quartzites</b> of the Perijá Formation were formed during the Early Paleozoic and {{are related to the}} Caledonian orogeny. The shales of the Río Cachirí Group were deposited in the Devonian and contain abundant fossils of brachiopods, bryozoa, corals and crinoids. The formation is time-equivalent with the fossiliferous Floresta and Cuche Formations of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense. The sediments were deposited in an epicontinental sea {{at the edge of the}} Paleo-Tethys Ocean, the last remnant of the Rheic Ocean.|$|E
25|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to argillaceous strata above and below it, the Shinumo Quartzite consists characteristically of beds that are red, brown, or purple sedimentary <b>quartzites</b> and lesser massive white, red, or purple sandstone; also conglomeratic sandstone. Within these cliff-forming sandstones, mudstone-rich intervals occur. Some of these sandstone beds exhibit well-developed soft-sediment deformation structures. No fossils {{have been found in}} the Shinumo Quartzite. The lower and middle parts of the Shinumo Quartzite accumulated in coastal tidal flats and the upper part of it represents the deposits of river deltas. The gradational contact between the Shinumo Quartzite and Dox Formation above indicates a shift from deposition in coastal deltas – to fluvial deposition by a large river system. Of note, the 'soft-sediment deformation' seen in this Shinumo Quartzite formation indicates significant earthquake and tectonic activity during its deposition.|$|E
25|$|In prehistoric times, chert {{was often}} used as a raw {{material}} {{for the construction of}} stone tools. Like obsidian, as well as some rhyolites, felsites, <b>quartzites,</b> and other tool stones used in lithic reduction, chert fractures in a Hertzian cone when struck with sufficient force. This results in conchoidal fractures, a characteristic of all minerals with no cleavage planes. In this kind of fracture, a cone of force propagates through the material from the point of impact, eventually removing a full or partial cone; this result is familiar to anyone who has seen what happens to a plate-glass window when struck by a small object, such as an air gun projectile. The partial Hertzian cones produced during lithic reduction are called flakes, and exhibit features characteristic of this sort of breakage, including striking platforms, bulbs of force, and occasionally eraillures, which are small secondary flakes detached from the flake's bulb of force.|$|E

25|$|Some {{crystals}} {{have formed}} by magmatic and metamorphic processes, giving origin to large masses of crystalline rock. The {{vast majority of}} igneous rocks are formed from molten magma {{and the degree of}} crystallization depends primarily on the conditions under which they solidified. Such rocks as granite, which have cooled very slowly and under great pressures, have completely crystallized; but many kinds of lava were poured out at the surface and cooled very rapidly, and in this latter group a small amount of amorphous or glassy matter is common. Other crystalline rocks, the metamorphic rocks such as marbles, mica-schists and <b>quartzites,</b> are recrystallized. This means that they were at first fragmental rocks like limestone, shale and sandstone and have never been in a molten condition nor entirely in solution, but the high temperature and pressure conditions of metamorphism have acted on them by erasing their original structures and inducing recrystallization in the solid state.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} of K2 and Broad Peak, {{and the area}} westward to the lower reaches of Sarpo Laggo glacier consist of metamorphic rocks, known as the K2 Gneiss {{and part of the}} Karakroam Metamorphic Complex. The K2 Gneiss consists of a mixture of orthogneiss and biotite-rich paragneiss. On the south and southeast face of K2, the orthogneiss consists of a mixture of a strongly foliated plagioclase-hornblende gneiss and a biotite-hornblende-K-feldspar orthogneiss, which has been intruded by garnet-mica leucogranitic dikes. In places, the paragneisses include clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing psammites, garnet (grossular)-diopside marbles, and biotite-graphite phyllites. Near the memorial to the climbers, who have died on K2, above Base Camp on the south spur, thin impure marbles with <b>quartzites</b> and mica schists, called the Gilkey-Puchoz sequence, are interbanded within the orthogneisses. On the west face of Broad Peak and south spur of K2, lamprophyre dikes, which consist of clinopyroxene and biotite-porphyritic vogesites and minettes, have intruded the K2 gneiss. The K2 Gneiss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks of the surrounding Karakoram Metamorphic Complex by normal faults. For example, a fault separates the K2 gneiss of the east face of K2 from limestones and slates comprising nearby Skyang Kangri.|$|E
500|$|The {{side road}} to Aguereberry Point {{successively}} traverses the shaly Johnnie Formation, the white Stirling Quartzite, and dark <b>quartzites</b> of the Wood Canyon Formation; at the Point {{itself is the}} great light-colored band of Zabriskie Quartzite dipping away toward Death Valley. Prominent outcrops are located between Death Valley Buttes and Daylight Pass, in upper Echo Canyon, and just west of Mare Spring in Titus Canyon. Before tilting to their present orientation, these four formations were a continuous pile of mud and sand [...] deep that accumulated slowly on the nearshore ocean bottom.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, the La Cloche Mountains in Ontario are {{composed}} primarily of white <b>quartzite.</b> The highest mountain in Mozambique, Monte Binga (2436 m), {{as well as}} the rest of the surrounding Chimanimani Plateau {{are composed}} of very hard, pale grey, precambrian <b>quartzite.</b> <b>Quartzite</b> is also mined in Brazil for use in kitchen countertops.|$|R

50|$|The {{age of the}} Shinumo <b>Quartzite</b> is {{approximately}} known. Based upon recent dates of volcanic ash layers, detrital zircon grains, and detrital mica flakes, geologists agree that the Unkar Group was deposited between about 1254 and 1100 Ma. The Hakatai Shale, Shinumo <b>Quartzite,</b> and Dox Formation samples yield clusters of zircons as young as 1170 Ma. Thus, these strata must be younger than 1170 Ma. The Dox Formation, which overlies the Shinumo <b>Quartzite</b> is estimated to have accumulated between 1150 and 1140 and 1100 Ma. Thus, the Shinumo <b>Quartzite</b> must date to between 1170 and 1150 to 1140 Ma. This {{would suggest that the}} disconformity {{at the base of the}} Shinumo <b>Quartzite</b> in a minor one.|$|R
2500|$|Part of the {{evidence}} for the first Laramide mountain building west of the Teton region is the several hundred cubic miles of quartzite boulders derived from the Targhee uplift, which was located north and west of {{the northern end of}} the present-day Teton Range. Streams carried boulders, sand, and clay from the uplift eastward and southeastward across what would become Jackson Hole. Flakes of gold and some mercury are in the resulting Harebell Formation. Two huge depositional troughs were formed in central and southern Wyoming from fine-grained debris carried farther east and southeast. Many of the larger boulders were derived from Precambrian and possibly lower Paleozoic <b>quartzites,</b> meaning that at least [...] of Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock must have been stripped from the Targhee uplift before the <b>quartzites</b> were exposed to erosion.|$|E
2500|$|Copper and {{molybdenum}} sulfide minerals are dispersed in the intruded {{stock and}} in the adjoining carbonate sedimentary skarns. The main stratigraphic rocks in Bingham Canyon are Upper Pennsylvanian sandstones, <b>quartzites,</b> and limestones known as the Bingham Mine Formation in the Oquirrh Group. [...] The central porphyry ores formed from mantle hydrothermal circulation while the outer vein and deposits in the sedimentary rocks formed at lower temperature when magmatic and meteoric waters mixed.|$|E
2500|$|... {{sedimentary}} formations - includes sediments {{deposited in}} Silurian waters and metamorphosed during the Devonian period, {{as well as}} carbon and more recent sediments, resulting during the Quaternary. The first group includes principally schists and quartz-feldspar, greywackes and <b>quartzites</b> with meta-crystals, such as andalusite, cordierite and sillimanite. These sedminentary deposits are prominently preserved in two linear patches: Vale das Antas and Louriça, near Castro Laboreiro, between two granite structures. The most recent geological formations are those created by fluvial, torrential and glacial deposits.|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} ridge, {{to which}} the Hohe Kanzel also belongs, is made of hard, weathered, but also cracked and permeable <b>quartzite</b> rock. Its layers are set steeply and often vertically. This yellowish-white, sometimes cherry-red-streaked Taunus <b>quartzite</b> arose from sandy sea depositions.

2500|$|Rocks of the {{earliest}} part of the Cambrian Period {{are found in the}} Salt range in Punjab and the Spiti are in central Himalayas and consist of a thick sequence of fossiliferous sediments. In the Salt range, the stratigraphy starts with the Salt Pseudomorph zone, which has a thickness of [...] and consists of dolomites and sandstones. It is overlain by magnesian sandstones with a thickness of , similar to the underlying dolomites. These sandstones have very few fossils. Overlying the sandstones is the Neobolus Shale, which is composed of dark shales with a thickness of [...] Finally there is a zone consisting of red or purple sandstones having a thickness of [...] to [...] called the Purple Sandstone. These are unfossiliferous and show sun-cracks and worm burrows which are typical of subaerial weathering. The deposits in Spiti are known as the Haimanta system and they consist of slates, micaceous quartzite and dolomitic limestones. The Ordovician rocks comprise flaggy shales, limestones, red <b>quartzites,</b> <b>quartzites,</b> sandstones and conglomerates. Siliceous limestones belonging to the Silurian overlie the Ordovician rocks. These limestones are in turn overlain by white quartzite and this is known as Muth quartzite. Silurian rocks which contain typical Silurian fauna are also found in the Vihi district of Kashmir.|$|E
2500|$|The {{region is}} {{dominated}} by the Quaternary Chaves sedimentary basin, a graben aligned on a north-northeast to south-southwest orientation bounded by the Hercynian massif and metamorphic schistose formations. Mixed with the schistose complex, there are bands of graphitic slates, mainly {{in the southern part of}} the urbanized area of Chaves and south-east of Faiões. To the north, and into Galicia, the basin extends into the depression of the Verin Basin. One of the oldest formations in the region, it dates back to the Ordovician period ( [...] between 488.3±1.7 to 443.7±1.5 million years ago), is composed of schist and graywacke deposits. During the Ordovician-Silurian geological periods <b>quartzites</b> and schists were formed, metamorphosed by Hercynian granitic intrusions, at the end of the Paleozoic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lower contact}} of the Dox Formation with the {{underlying}} Shinumo Quartzite {{appears to be}} gradational and {{is marked by a}} change in topographic expression and color.
