40|$|Once {{considered}} the nation's most regulated industry, the electric utility industry is evolving {{into a more}} competitive environment. At the current time, {{the focus of this}} development is the generating sector, where the advent of new generating technologies, such as gas-fired combined cycle, has lowered both entry barriers to competitors of traditional utilities and lowered the marginal costs of those competitors below those of some traditional utilities. This technological advance has been combined with legislative initiatives, such as the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), to encourage the introduction of competitive forces into the electric generating sector. The <b>questions</b> <b>now</b> <b>are</b> <b>whether</b> further legislative action is desirable to encourage competition in the electric utility sector and how the transition between a comprehensive regulatory regime to a more competitive electric utility sector can be made with the least amount of economic and service disruption...|$|R

5000|$|Also {{crucial to}} any {{understanding}} of Fox's political career {{from this point}} was his mutual antipathy with George III - probably the most enthusiastic prosecutor of the American war.

The historical record – in wrings and archaeological artefacts – provides {{evidence of the}} growth and collapse of political organisations and societies. In the institutions of Western civilisation, some traditions have endured over millennia where the roles of monarchs and public officials have been organised in perpetual succession. These roles were developed as conventions in the British Parliament after 1295 and provided the models of corporate governance in {{both public and private}} enterprise that have been continuously refined to the present day. In 2011, the Queensland Parliament legislated to introduce a new and more open system of scrutiny of legislation through a system of portfolio-based parliamentary committees.

40|$|The Serbian Health Insurance Act of 2005 was {{supposed}} to be a corner stone for a more decentralised health care system, which offers to the insured, an opportunity for greater self-management. The <b>questions</b> <b>now</b> <b>are</b> <b>whether</b> the new organisational structure would foster a transition from a socialistic health care system to a more contribution driven system (which also is based on a rather decentralised decision making and funding), and how the balance of power is institutionalised. We have studied the structure of the Serbian health care system and describe how the various players are positioned in the network applying Social Network Analysis (SNA). Power arises from occupying advantageous positions. The distribution and balance of power may be depicted by three measures of advantage (indices) : degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. The SNA was set up applying a position approach for two reasons: firstly, to analyse the formal structure as it is laid down in the law and, secondly, it is less time-consuming. Other options like reputation approach and decision approach would have to refer to surveys and questionnaires. The matrix of connectivity representing the directed links was exported to Visone 2. 6. 2 for further analysis and visualisation. The SNA depicted here and the corresponding distribution of power is a snapshot of players, their links and the associated possibilities to exercise power. The structure found is therefore the framework for concrete policy-making, enabling or impeding political problem solving. Our findings could be seen as a basis for further analyses of specific decisions/non-decisions where capacity is converted into concrete action...|$|R
