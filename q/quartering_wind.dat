2500|$|Due to {{a design}} {{oversight}} and changes during construction, {{the building as}} initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated wind load on the building when wind blew perpendicularly {{against the side of}} the building—wind from due north, east, south, or west—all that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented [...] "quartering winds" [...] (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at Princeton University, Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building, this time including quartering winds. This recalculation revealed that with a <b>quartering</b> <b>wind,</b> there was a 40% increase in wind loads, resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints.|$|E

Quarter-wind names {{are constructed}} with the names [...] "X by Y", which can be read as [...] "one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from X toward Y", where X is one of the eight principal winds and Y is one of the two adjacent cardinal directions. E.g. North-by-east (NbE) is one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from North towards East, Northeast-by-north (NEbN) is one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from Northeast toward North.

50|$|This method can be {{used for}} any {{intended}} bearing and deviation, as the only purpose is to solve the triangle by dividers and scale. e.g. using our first Corsica-to-Genoa example, where intended bearing was North but the ship actually sailed Northwest, the navigator would set the dividers at length 70 miles and lay it along the fourth <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> (= SE ray in the tondo e quadro, as NW is four <b>quarter</b> <b>winds</b> away from North).

5000|$|Now for the ritorno. The landmark, as noted, is WSW of {{the ship}}'s morning {{position}} (C).

5000|$|The 32-point compass {{used for}} {{navigation}} in the Mediterranean by the 14th century, had increments of 11° between points. Only the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) were given special names. The eight half-winds just combined {{the names of}} the two principal winds, e.g. Greco-Tramontana for NNE, Greco-Levante for ENE, and so on. Quarter-winds were more cumbersomely phrased, with the closest principal wind named first and the next-closest principal wind second, e.g. [...] "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco" [...] (literally, [...] "one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from North towards Northeast", i.e. North by East), and [...] "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana" [...] ("one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from NE towards N", i.e. Northeast by North). Boxing the compass (naming all 32 winds) was expected of all Medieval mariners.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name of a}} quarter-wind is [...] "X by Y", where X is a {{principal}} wind and Y is a cardinal wind. As a mnemonic device, {{it is useful to}} think of [...] "X by Y" [...] as a shortcut for the phrase [...] "one <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> from X towards Y", where a [...] "quarter" [...] is °, X is the nearest principal wind, and Y the next (more distant) cardinal wind. So [...] "northeast by east" [...] means [...] "one quarter from NE towards E", [...] "southwest by south" [...] means [...] "one quarter from SW towards S". The eight principal winds, eight half-winds and sixteen <b>quarter</b> <b>winds</b> together yield a 32-wind compass rose, with each compass direction point at ° angle from the next. In the mariner's exercise of boxing the compass, all thirty-two points of the compass are named in clockwise order.|$|R
50|$|The {{title of}} the Alfred Hitchcock 1959 movie, North by Northwest, is {{actually}} not a direction point on the 32-wind compass, but the film contains a reference to Northwest Airlines.

50|$|Before the {{development}} of the compass rose, a wind rose was included on maps in order to let the reader know which directions the 8 major winds (and sometimes 8 half <b>winds</b> and 16 <b>quarter</b> <b>winds)</b> blew within the plan view. No differentiation was made between cardinal directions and the winds which blew from said directions. North was depicted with a fleur de lis, while east was shown as a Christian cross to indicate the direction of Jerusalem from Europe.|$|R

2500|$|Example: [...] {{suppose a}} ship {{intended}} to sail bearing east ("Levante") from point A to point B.

[...] Southeast-by-east is three <b>quarter</b> <b>winds</b> (or 33.75°) away from east (on a 32-point compass, {{in order of}} quarter-winds away from east, 1 quarter is east-by-south, 2 quarters is East-southeast, 3 quarters is southeast-by-east).

2500|$|The [...] "Regiment of the Leagues" [...] is {{not very}} {{different}} from the rule of marteloio. The Regiment of the Leagues always considers the west-east bearing as the [...] "intended course" [...] and measures set deviations from it. [...] More specifically, the league table considers a fixed value of alargar – set at 1 latitude degree (or, in the measurements of the time, 17.5 (Portuguese) leagues, or equivalently 70 (Italian) miles). [...] It then gives for every different <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> of sailing direction (always designated as quarters away from the north-south axis, rather than away from the intended course), the relevar and the afastar. [...] The relevar is the number of leagues on the actual course that a ship must sail in order to cover the pre-set 1 degree of latitude (17.5 leagues of alargar from the starting parallel). The afastar is merely the corresponding avanzar on the west-east bearing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental and simulation studies that aimed at investigating {{the characteristics of the}} stopping motion of a ship with a single controllable pitch propeller (CPP) and single rudder. In a full-scale experiment, stopping tests were performed to compare the stopping motion between CPP ships and that of fixed pitch propeller (FPP) ships and the turning motion of a CPP ship was found to be less stable than that of a FPP ship, particularly under windy condition. A simulation study was also conducted to investigate the effect of wind on the stopping motion of CPP ships by which it can be proved that CPP ships are forced to turn her head windward and to drift leeward considerably under beam or <b>quarter</b> <b>wind</b> conditions. Based on the results of these full-scale and simulation studies, a method can be proposed to estimate the critical range of stopping maneuver without tug assistance and effective stopping maneuver for berthing and anchoring under windy condition...|$|R
50|$|After halftime, Washington {{took their}} first drive {{of the second}} half into the endzone on a 7-yard pass from Mark Brunell to Mike Sellers, {{followed}} by a converted 2-point conversion on a pass to Clinton Portis, tying the game.

As the third <b>quarter</b> <b>winded</b> down, Simms completed a 4-yard pass to Ike Hilliard to tie the game at 28-28 entering the fourth quarter. Portis added a 5-yard touchdown run to give the Redskins a 35-28 lead. With the game on the line, Simms led Tampa Bay to a game-winning touchdown drive with a 30-yard pass to Edell Shepherd. The Redskins appeared to have blocked the extra point attempt, but were ruled offsides. As a result, Tampa Bay elected to go for two, and successfully converted on a controversial run by Alstott, handing the Redskins a 36-35 loss and dropping them to 5-4 on the season.|$|R

5000|$|In the English compass, all wind {{names are}} {{constructed}} {{on the basis}} of the cardinal four names (N, E, S, W). In the traditional compass, one needs to memorize eight basic names - one for each of the eight principal winds (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW.) While there are more names to memorize, the payoff is that the name construction rules for the 32-wind compass are more straightforward. The half-winds are just a combination of the two principal winds it bisects, with the shortest name usually coming first (e.g. NNE is [...] "Greco-Tramontana", ENE is [...] "Greco-Levante", SSE is [...] "Ostro-Scirocco", etc.). The <b>quarter</b> <b>winds</b> are expressed with an Italian phrase, [...] "Quarto di X verso Y" [...] (one quarter from X towards Y, [...] ) or [...] "X al Y" [...] (X to Y) or [...] "X per Y" [...] (X by Y). There are no irregularities to trip over: the nearest principal wind always comes first, the more distant one second, e.g. North-by-east is [...] "Quarto di Tramontana verso Greco", northeast-by-north [...] "Quarto di Greco verso Tramontana". The names are perfectly symmetric.|$|R
