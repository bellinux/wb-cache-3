50|$|The {{seasonal}} trend of typical infections exhibits low levels during summer, a small peak in autumn, and a slow rise of infection during winter. It {{is more common}} during times of confinement - winter and spring. In the spring, the level of infection increases rapidly as brood-rearing starts and while flight possibilities are still limited. Colonies in northern climates are more seriously affected than colonies in the south because of the increased amount of time bees are confined in the hive.

40|$|Hamilton¿s ¿rst papers {{concerned}} {{social evolution}} and revolutionized {{our understanding of}} reproductive con¿ict in insect societies. The revolution continues. Recent research at the University of Shef¿eld has investigated two topics previously not considered from an inclusive ¿tness perspective: dominance hierarchies and queen¿ worker caste con¿ict. The theory makes predictions close to that occurring in hierarchies of Dinoponera queenless ants and queen overproduction in Melipona bees. An earlier prediction, that multiple paternity favours worker policing, is supported by research on Vespula and Dolichovespula wasps. However, worker policing also occurs in the hornet, Vespa crabro, which has low paternity (effective queen mating 1. 1). Worker policing in Vespinae wasps has two novel facultative features. In Dolichovespula saxonica, worker policing occurs in colonies headed by a multiple-mated queen but not by a single-mated queen. In Vespa crabro, queenless colonies accept worker-laid eggs but reject queen-laid eggs, probably because <b>queen</b> <b>supersedure</b> does not occur but queen parasitism doe...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Ant {{workers are}} very often reproductively dege-nerate females, {{but in some}} species from {{subfamily}} Poneri-nae, the workers can mate and lay fertilized eggs just like queens (they are then termed “gamergates”). In Harpegna-thos saltator, new colonies are founded independently by single queens, and when senescent they are replaced by several gamergates. This secondary polygyny is distinguis-hed by three features: (1) behavioural data indicate that young workers copulate with their brothers, unlike the queens who disperse and mate outside the nests; (2) gamergate colo-nies produce {{both male and female}} sexuals annually; (3) gamergate colonies appear not to fission. Our evidence for the lack of fission is indirect: the nests of H. saltator are un-usually elaborate for ponerine ants, and gamergate colonies produce many young queens (at the expense of investing in workers). <b>Queen</b> <b>supersedure</b> results in an extension of colony lifespan, thus making complex constructions possible with a small colony size (65 ± 40 workers in a western Ghats population; N = 59). In turn, these nests represent a valuable resource to be inherited by successive generations of worker offspring. This life history contrasts with that of other ponerine ants having both queens and gamergates (e. g. in Rhytidoponera confusa, nests are simple and short-lived, gamergates are not inbred and their colonies can fission while producing mostly males; Ward, 1981 a, 1983 a) ...|$|E
40|$|In several stingless bee species many males {{aggregate}} in {{the vicinity}} of a nest when a virgin queen is present in the colony and is preparing for the nuptial flight. We report such male assemblage for Tetragonisca angustula. The departure of a virgin queen from the colony and the subsequent mating could be video-recorded, because the queen and the males that had mounted her fell to the ground. Since at least two males had lost their genitalia, multiple mating seems to have occurred. This is in contrast with the prevailing view found in literature concerning the mating biology of stingless bees. In many species of stingless bees mating involves drone aggregations in front of the nests where <b>queen</b> <b>supersedure</b> or swarm settlement has taken place and where, consequently, a young queen will leave for her nuptial flight (Engels and Engels, 1988; Roubik, 1990). In the genus Melipona, such drone aggregation is reported for M. favosa (Sommeijer and de Bruijn, 1995), and M. fasciata (Veen et al., 1997) and here too the aggregation appeared to be linked to one or more colonies nearby. Direct observations of natural matings do not exist, and therefore, our under-standing of the process is only of an indirect nature. It is based on comparisons of the amount of sperm produced by a drone compared to the amount present in the spermatheca of a mated queen (Kerr and Krause, 1950; Kerr et al., 1962; Camargo, 1972; Almeida, 1981), and on studies concerning allozyme variation (Kerr, 1969...|$|E
40|$|Nosema ceranae, a microsporidian {{parasite}} originally {{described in}} the Asian honey bee Apis cerana, has recently {{been found to be}} cross-infective and to also parasitize the European honey bee Apis mellifera. Since this discovery, many studies have attempted to characterize the impact of this parasite in A. mellifera honey bees. Nosema species can infect all colony members, workers, drones and queens, but the pathological effects of this microsporidium has been mainly investigated in workers, despite the prime importance of the queen, who monopolizes the reproduction and regulates the cohesion of the society via pheromones. We therefore analyzed the impact of N. ceranae on queen physiology. We found that infection by N. ceranae did not affect the fat body content (an indicator of energy stores) but did alter the vitellogenin titer (an indicator of fertility and longevity), the total antioxidant capacity and the queen mandibular pheromones, which surprisingly were all significantly increased in Nosema-infected queens. Thus, such physiological changes may impact queen health, leading to changes in pheromone production, that could explain Nosema-induced <b>supersedure</b> (<b>queen</b> replacement...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was three-fold: 1) to examine the {{acceptance}} by the bees of artificially inseminated honeybee queens which have bodily injuries and 2) the effect of different kinds of injuries on the egg-laying abilities of the queens and 3) the propensity of the bees to supersedure. A total of 396 honeybee queens were studied. Their condition was examined under a microscope prior to and after introduction into bee colonies. Among the 330 queens introduced into the colonies, 31 had their claws and arolia injured. Their claws and arolia were injured prior to the introduction into the bee colonies. The bees did not accept 13. 0 % of the uninjured and 3. 2 % of the injured queens. The colonies with the uninjured queens occupied only slightly more combs (10. 5) than did the colonies with queens, which had injuries to their claws and arolia (9. 7) or with queens with paralyzed legs (10. 2). The colonies with queens with missing parts of their legs and with injured antennae were weaker as they occupied significantly fewer combs; 8. 6 and 7. 6, respectively. The greatest average brood area in the first ten days of June was in colonies with uninjured queens (54. 5 dm 2). The brood area was lower, although insignificantly, in the colonies where the queens had injured arolia and claws or paralyzed legs; 51. 8 and 51. 7 dm 2, respectively. There was significantly less brood area in the colonies where the queens had some leg parts missing or had injured antennae; 30. 8 dm 2 and 34. 6 dm 2, respectively. Out of 396 examined queens, 18. 7 % were <b>supersedured.</b> Uninjured <b>queens</b> were significantly less frequently supersedured by bees (11. 3 %) than the injured ones. <b>Supersedured</b> <b>queens</b> with injuries to their arolia and claws accounted for 11. 3 %, those with paralyzed legs and missing leg parts for 33. 3 and 37. 5 %, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Honeybees provide {{economically}} and ecologically vital pollination services to crops and wild plants. During {{the last decade}} elevated colony losses have been documented in Europe and North America. Despite growing consensus on the involvement of multiple causal factors, the underlying interactions impacting on honeybee health and colony failure are not fully resolved. Parasites and pathogens are among the main candidates, but sublethal exposure to widespread agricultural pesticides may also affect bees. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To investigate effects of sublethal dietary neonicotinoid exposure on honeybee colony performance, a fully crossed experimental design was implemented using 24 colonies, including sister-queens from two different strains, and experimental in-hive pollen feeding with or without environmentally relevant concentrations of thiamethoxam and clothianidin. Honeybee colonies chronically exposed to both neonicotinoids over two brood cycles exhibited decreased performance in the short-term resulting in declining numbers of adult bees (- 28 %) and brood (- 13 %), {{as well as a}} reduction in honey production (- 29 %) and pollen collections (- 19 %), but colonies recovered in the medium-term and overwintered successfully. However, significantly decelerated growth of neonicotinoid-exposed colonies during the following spring was associated with queen failure, revealing previously undocumented long-term impacts of neonicotinoids: <b>queen</b> <b>supersedure</b> was observed for 60 % of the neonicotinoid-exposed colonies within a one year period, but not for control colonies. Linked to this, neonicotinoid exposure was significantly associated with a reduced propensity to swarm during the next spring. Both short-term and long-term effects of neonicotinoids on colony performance were significantly influenced by the honeybees' genetic background. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Sublethal neonicotinoid exposure did not provoke increased winter losses. Yet, significant detrimental short and long-term impacts on colony performance and queen fate suggest that neonicotinoids may contribute to colony weakening in a complex manner. Further, we highlight the importance of the genetic basis of neonicotinoid susceptibility in honeybees which can vary substantially...|$|E
40|$|In {{social insect}} colonies workers realize their {{reproductive}} potential through rearing the queen's brood. In the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes exclamans (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) castes are not morphologically distinct. This species has an annual colony cycle that begins when mated, hibernated females start colonies in the spring. One foundress becomes the queen {{while the rest}} become workers. The worker population grows throughout the year until the appearance of gynes, females that do not work but become foundresses the following spring. Males are also produced {{by the end of}} the season, but they die in winter with the workers. While morphological caste differences are absent, caste can be identified using behavioral and physiological parameters. In contrast with other social insects, female caste remains undetermined until adulthood, and even then females switch between castes under the appropriate circumstances. This can be advantageous since high nest predation rates and unpredictable environmental variation, accompanied by frequent <b>queen</b> <b>supersedure</b> are typical. I studied three aspects of the P. exclamans caste system: (i) morphology and physiology in gynes and workers; (ii) seasonal resource allocation into brood and (iii) effects of brood loss on caste determination. Physiological indicators were derived from qualitative and quantitative studies of biochemical components, and from measurements of metabolic rates. I show that differences between castes are mostly quantitative, rather than qualitative. I suggest that lack of physical and qualitative differentiation is what allows caste transitions. Seasonal resource allocation on brood shows that while young, adult females produced throughout the season increase in weight and size, energy reserves lipids peak in May and June. I suggest that this peak in reserves is related to high predation experienced by colonies during that time and that it allows females to reconstruct their nests more efficiently. Finally, I examine effects of loss of brood in late summer and early fall colonies showing that females that do not have the opportunity to care for brood develop gyne-like characters, but that females that have develop worker-like characters. These results show that caste in P. exclamans is plastic, behaviorally and physiologically, allowing individuals to respond to varying environmental and social conditions...|$|E
