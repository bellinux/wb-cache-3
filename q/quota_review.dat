40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{has long}} been under fire for not {{adapting}} its governance and quota structure to the growing economic weight of emerging and developing {{countries in the world}} order. Starting from the preferences of the main players (BRICS, US and advanced European countries), this chapter discusses the 2010 quota and governance reform package to address this problem and advances explanations for its modest outcome. It is argued that the US and the European countries enjoyed substantial ‘structural’ and ‘institutional’ power in ways that reduced the influence of the BRICS to impose a more generous reshuffling of voting power within the IMF. Furthermore, we assess the current state of implementation of the 2010 reforms and discuss its follow-up, namely the debate on the new quota formula and the next <b>quota</b> <b>review.</b> While large emerging and developing countries might develop alternative options to reduce their dependency on the IMF, they have definitely not turned their back on the IMF in the face of lack of progress in the reform process...|$|E
40|$|The International Monetary Fund {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{international}} organizations using a weighted voting system. The weights of its 188 members are determined by a fixed amount of basic votes plus some extra votes for so-called Special Drawing Rights (SDR). On January 26, 2016, the conditions for the SDRs were increased at the 14 th General <b>Quota</b> <b>Review,</b> which drastically changed the corresponding voting weights. However, since the share of voting weights in general is not equal to the influence, of a committee member on the committees overall decision, so-called power indices were introduced. So far the power distribution of the IMF was only computed by either approximation procedures or smaller games than then entire Board of Governors consisting of 188 members. We improve existing algorithms, based on dynamic programming, for the computation of power indices and provide the exact results for the IMF Board of Governors before and after the increase of voting weights. Tuned low-level details of the algorithms allow the repeated routine with sparse computational resources and can of course be applied to other large voting bodies. It turned out that the Banzhaf power shares are rather sensitive to changes of the quota. Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures, 13 table...|$|E
40|$|End {{of project}} reportThe {{aim of the}} project was to produce quality, {{scientific}} based policy advice on the most efficient means for the transfer of milk quota between dairy farmers. The main objective {{of the project was}} to identify milk quota transfer mechanisms that would ensure the viability of the maximum number of farmers in Ireland while still supporting an internationally competitive agricultural sector. During the course of the project the Irish Department of Agriculture introduced a new milk quota transfer scheme. The milk quota exchange scheme was launched in November 2006. At this stage the objectives of the project were altered to be more policy relevant. Rather than exploring the efficiency of various milk quota transfer models, the aim of the project was redirected to explore the efficiency of the scheme as it was operated in Ireland. The rationale for this change was to provide relevant and timely feedback to policy makers on the operation of the new scheme. While the MTR agreement guaranteed the continuation of the EU milk quota regime until 2014 / 15, it also made provisions for a review of the milk quota system to be conducted in 2008. Clearly any changes to EU milk quota policy would have implications for farmers in Ireland. A second objective of this project was to explore some policy scenarios that may transpire from the milk <b>quota</b> <b>review</b> and to estimate the implications for farmers in Ireland...|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Managing Director of the IMF, a group of experts, chaired by Professor Richard Cooper of Harvard University {{prepared}} a report on the adequacy of quota formulas, including proposals for changes. The paper reviews the recommendations of the <b>Quota</b> Formula <b>Review</b> Group and finds that the Report failed to address such key issues as the size of the Fund or overall adequacy of quotas, and the question of basic votes and the distribution of voting power. It questions the reasons for the rejection of PPP-based GDP in the proposed formula for quota determination and considers that this introduces a bias against developing countries; the exclusion of short-term capital movements in the measurement of countries external vulnerability also appears questionable...|$|R
40|$|On January 1, 2005, the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, which {{established}} quotas on different categories of apparel and textile imports to the European Union, was phased out. This article synthesizes {{the determinants of}} trade patterns {{in the absence of}} <b>quotas</b> and <b>reviews</b> their impact for the UK apparel retailermarket. It assesses international strategic merchandising from China, post-quota elimination for the UK apparel market with particular reference to global adjustment to apparel supply. However, to sustain their domination of global fashion textile supply, particularly to EU markets, China will need to face the challenges of anti-dumping, technical regulations or standards, preferential trade agreements, regional free trade zones and other non-tariff trading barriers. The article concludes that China is well placed to exploit her position of dominance but suggests that sub-optimal considerations of cost versus response time to the EUretailer will provide a challenge for the future supply of fashion retail products...|$|R

The use of these measures is demonstrated on a real life dataset obtained from the human resource field and is validated on set of benchmark datasets. 1...|$|R

40|$|Automatic review {{assignment}} can signicantly {{improve the}} productivity of many people such as conference organizers, journal editors and grant administrators. Most previous works have set the problem up as using a paper as a query to independently "a set of reviewers that should review the paper. A more appropriate formulation of the problem would be to simultaneously optimize the assignments of all the papers to an entire committee of reviewers under con-straints such as the <b>review</b> <b>quota.</b> In this paper, we {{solve the problem of}} committee review assignment with multi-aspect expertise matching by casting it as an integer linear pro-gramming problem. The proposed algorithm can naturally accommodate any probabilistic or deterministic method for modeling multiple aspects to automate committee review as-signments. Evaluation using an existing data set shows that the proposed algorithm is eective for committee review as-signments based on multi-aspect expertise matching...|$|R

The general tone was of sneering condescension, with the film's action often being dismissed in class-based terms. Kine Weekly described it as: [...] "a slow, meandering romantic drama, a dilatory tale of life below stairs...the theme deals with domestics and its suitability is confined mainly to picturegoers of that class." [...] Film Weekly took a similar line, stating: [...] "Slow and sloppy servant-girl romance that just goes on and on. Feeble entertainment." [...] The Monthly Film Bulletin, while not overly-enthusiastic, took a somewhat more constructive approach, writing: [...] "This is a pleasant unpretentious story, pleasantly told. The direction, however, lacks polish and is not convincing. It is full of good ideas insufficiently carried out." ...|$|R
40|$|The current {{allocation}} {{of decision making}} in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined largely by the distribution of members' quotas, has failed {{to keep up with}} the changing world economy. The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of Fund quotas is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance IMF quota reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new IMF quota formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the IMF governors at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the <b>quota</b> formula <b>review</b> group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their quota shares to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of quota shares toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the Fund (total quotas) by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of quota and voting shares under the new quota formula. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rationale}} for writing this thesis {{was prompted by}} years of working with displaced people and refugees in Africa. Though the African people north of the equator are generally regarded as transient people, very few move {{beyond the boundaries of}} the continent of Africa. The instability of the political and socio-economic conditions on the continent has exacerbated the current volatile cycle of poverty and human instability. The effects of the political and socio-economic conditions have resulted in a huge displacement of people and the emergence of refugees. Few refugees are able to be identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for resettlement outside Africa, while others take the courageous step of fleeing and seeking refuge on another continent as asylum seekers. In 1960 New Zealand ascribed to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of refugees and actively participated in a refugee quota programme and allowed asylum seekers to apply for refugee status. In an endeavour to answer the question "why long-term welfare beneficiaries" in relation to African people, this thesis analysed the integration process of African people and sought to establish what domestic or public policies impact or influence the settlement and integration of refugees and asylum seekers in New Zealand. While there are many factors that influence successful integration, however this study identifies barriers to sustainable employment as one of the major contributors. The literature review and the outcome of the research undertaken showed that barriers to employment do exist for refugees and asylum seekers. The literature review analyses the legal aspect that defines a refugee and also outlines the process followed for the determination of <b>quota</b> refugees. The <b>review</b> further describes the journey of the study population to New Zealand. New Zealand has an established welfare system therefore the study traces the discourse within welfare history and policy that relate to the criteria and obligations under which benefits are granted to refugees and asylum seekers. It is argued that present jobseeker agreements and work test provisions when agreed upon does assist the development and work readiness of the refugee and asylum seeker and does not contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries. It is concluded that the absence of an overarching national domestic or public policy on settlement and integration could contribute to long-term welfare beneficiaries (as defined in the welfare policy of the Ministry for Social Development). In conclusion, policy changes to certain aspects of the Social Security Act 1964, language training, organs of civil society intervention and employer interaction need to be addressed in relation to refugees from the Horn of Africa living in New Zealand to allow them to become employable in a shorter period of time...|$|R
