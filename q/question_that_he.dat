25|$|The famously {{articulate}} Muhammad Ali {{launched into}} an extraordinary tirade — even by his standards — when Parkinson challenged {{him on the}} nature of his religious beliefs.

25|$|Justice Byron White wrote a {{concurring opinion}} raising a <b>question</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> agreed with Marshall, was not before the Court in this {{particular}} case but was ancillary to it. Indeed, he noted, it had been raised in another case a decade earlier, where it was also not before the Court. Specifically, he questioned whether the federal claims were indeed not arbitrable.|$|E

25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, there is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{had a high}} {{reputation}} {{among his}} peers and received considerable praise from the film industry. After his death, Dore Schary, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, said, [...] "There can be no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{the best and most}} protean actor of our screen." [...] Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, James Cagney, John Ford, Garson Kanin and Katharine Hepburn also called Tracy the greatest actor of his generation. Richard Widmark, who idolized Tracy, said: [...] "He's the greatest movie actor there ever was ... I've learned more about acting from watching Tracy than in any other way." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope {{was raised}} as a Quaker, and was taught that the Bible was literal truth. Although he never confronted his family about their {{religious}} views, Osborn writes that Cope {{was at least}} aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion. Osborn writes: [...] "If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible... he did not express them in his letters to his family but {{there can be little}} <b>question...</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> shared the intellectual unrest of the period." [...] Lanham writes that Cope's religious fervor (which seems to have subsided after his father's death) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates. Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope's internal religious conflicts. She ascribes Cope's deference to his father's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father's financial support. Frazer's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear, rather than his true views.|$|E

CIA Director, former Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, a 1960 Santa Clara classmate of Locatelli's, stated after Father Locatelli's death that, [...] "What Paul told you was always the truth. He didn't play games. You knew that {{what he said was}} what he believed.

2500|$|Australia's first innings was {{notable for}} Graham Yallop {{being the first}} batsman to wear a full {{protective}} helmet in test cricket and Bruce Yardley's knock of 74 off 48 balls. Jeff Thomson then delivered an inspiring spell of bowling which Simpsons said [...] "proved beyond <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the world's fastest bowler". Thomson ended up taking 6–77, limiting the West Indies lead to 38, but Australia collapsed in their second innings (despite another Yardley cameo) and the hosts had little difficulty in winning by nine wickets.|$|E

2500|$|In the Court of Appeal {{summary of}} the case, Williams stated that various jurors misconstrued as a threat a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> asked defense counsel {{at the close of}} the guilt phase. The trial record shows that after the jurors {{returned}} their guilty verdicts, Williams said, [...] "Sons of bitches" [...] in a voice sufficiently loud that the court reporter included it in the trial transcript.

2500|$|As {{an airline}} manager, he gained a {{reputation}} of union busting, stemming from his leadership during the 1983 bankruptcy of Continental that enabled the company to void its union contracts, and during the strike and bankruptcy of Eastern that eventually led to its permanent shutdown in 1991. Lorenzo’s history is contentious, both “despised by unions and admired by airline strategists.” In 1990, after Lorenzo liquidated his holdings after 18 years in the airline industry, Alfred E. Kahn, the “main architect of airline deregulation,” offered this perspective on Lorenzo’s leadership: “I don’t {{think there is any}} <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saved Continental, but his tactics obviously didn’t work when he took over Eastern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{commander}} of the only remaining organized army of France, Bazaine took it upon himself, perhaps justifiably, to control the country's destiny. He refused to recognise the new Government of National Defence, formed following Napoleon's capture and the resulting collapse of his government, and instead engaged {{in a series of}} diplomatic negotiations with the Prussian high command and Empress Eugenie who with the Prince Imperial had fled to Hastings, England. The purport of these negotiations still remain to some extent obscure, but it is beyond <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> proposed with the permission of the Prussians to employ his army in [...] "saving France from herself", perhaps to ignite a revolution against the government of the Third Republic. When considered {{in light of the fact}} that Bazaine had long been a known Bonapartist, his actions were clearly designed to forge a way to restore the monarchy.|$|E

"As a writer, a speaker, and a converser", he begins, Mackintosh is [...] "one of the ablest {{and most}} {{accomplished}} {{men of the}} age", [...] "a man of the world", and a [...] "scholar" [...] of impressive learning, [...] "master of almost every known topic". [...] "His Vindiciae Gallicae {{is a work of}} great labour, great ingenuity, great brilliancy, and great vigour." [...] After he changed political sides for a time, Mackintosh then began to excel as an [...] "intellectual gladiator". Of his qualifications in this regard, Hazlitt remarks, [...] "Few subjects can be started, on which he is not qualified to appear to advantage as the gentleman and scholar. ... There is scarce an author he has not read; a period of history he is not conversant with; a celebrated name of which he has not a number of anecdotes to relate; an intricate <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not prepared to enter upon in a popular or scientific manner." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 August 1939, Papen {{presented}} the Turks with a diplomatic note {{that was almost}} an ultimatum threatening the cancellation of all arms contacts and for the Reich to impose economic sanctions if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the Anglo-French [...] "peace front". Papen approved of the German-Soviet nonaggression pact, sending Hitler a telegram congratulating him on his [...] "brilliant diplomatic victory" [...] as Papen believed that Britain and France would never go to war for Poland without the Soviet Union; accordingly he drew the conclusion that Germany could now invade Poland without fear of a world war. After the signing of German-Soviet non-aggression pact in Moscow on 24 August 1939, for a moment, the Turks considered giving in. However, the Turks recovered their nerve, and on 26 August 1939 Saracoğlu told Papen that Germany had broken every promise it had ever made to the Turks, {{and he did not}} care if Germany ceased trading with Turkey. On 29 August 1939, İnönü told Papen that Turkey was a sovereign country that nobody would dictate to, and observed that if the Germans did not want Turkish chrome, {{they did not have to}} buy it, with İnönü adding just whom the Germans would buy chrome from was an interesting <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not answer. The İnönü-Papen meeting of 29 August 1939 left the ambassador [...] "thoroughly uneasy" [...] and he left the meeting in [...] "acute perspiration" [...] as Germany needed Turkish chrome very badly. As Turkey was the only place in the world that the Germans could buy chrome from after the British blockade came into effect on 3 September 1939, the Turks had called the German bluff, and the threat of severing German-Turkish trade was not put into practice.|$|E
