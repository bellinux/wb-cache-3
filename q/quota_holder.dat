40|$|Hake is {{the most}} {{valuable}} fisheries species in South Africa, with an estimated landed value of R 658 million in 1997. The fishery is presently managed under an individual quota system, where total allowable catch (TAC) is set annually and divided up amongst <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> according to past performance, without <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> having to pay for it. Fundamental restructuring of the South African hake quota market is however due {{to take place in}} the near future as recommended by the White Paper on Marine Fisheries Policy (1997). Factor analysis of data collected from a postal survey of existing South African hake <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> and rejected hake quota applicants suggests that distinct differences in attitudes towards restructuring exist amongst respondents. Four factors, representing groups of respondents defined as (1) applicants, (2) <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> (3) small scale respondents (comprising of both applicants and <b>quota</b> <b>holders),</b> and (4) larger, longer established <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> sharing similar attitudes towards restructuring were extracted. It was also calculated that a substantial annual rent of approximately R 279 million is generated by the South African hake industry, which is presently harvested free of charge by those issued with quota. It is stated policy of the White Paper to capture these rents, however methods of accomplishing this have not been well accepted by the industry. This study aims at providing some solutions to these problems of restructuring. Agricultural and Food Policy, Crop Production/Industries,...|$|R

50|$|The grant {{approach}} is inherently political, with attendant benefits and costs. For example, related {{industries such as}} fish processing and other non-participants may seek quota grants. Also, fishermen are often excluded from receiving quota {{if they are not}} also boat owners, however boat owners who do not fish do receive quota, such {{as was the case in}} Alaskan IFQ distributions.

40|$|Research PaperQuota {{management}} systems (QMS) provide faith-based incentives for individual <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> to conserve the resource voluntarily; <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> expect {{the system to}} work and to be enforced and their expectations are usually realized despite imperfect incentives and significant enforcement burdens. Even with QMS there is never an individual incentive to invest in conservation by harvesting less than the quota. Fish are mobile in varying degrees and fishers do no have their own growth function as does the hypothetical sole owner made famous by Gordon's paper (Gordon, 1954). To provide incentives for voluntary conservation, "Virtual Population Units" (VPUs) can be used. An economic agent (individual, port, region etc) is given exclusive right to manage its own virtual population. However, the suggested harvest levels (quotas under a QMS) next year will be based not on behavior of others, but on how that VPU managed the virtual population to which it has exclusive access rights. In this paper we apply a VPU regime to the Atlantic herring fishery in New England to illustrate numerically how multiple VPUs as economic agents might rationally allocate their efforts to optimize {{the present value of}} own profits and to measure the discrepancies form a sole owner solution...|$|R
50|$|In 1995, the Alaskan halibut fishery {{converted}} to ITQs, after regulators cut the season from {{about four months}} down {{to two or three}} days. Today, due to the pre-allocation of catch that accompanies IFQs, the season lasts nearly eight months and boats deliver fresh fish at a steadier pace. However, halibut stocks have been in continuous decline for over a decade, as poor stock assessments leading to overfishing have caused a substantial decline in biomass.Additionally, despite the increase in landings value, the number of <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> has declined by 44%, as consolidation and quota pricing has served to prevent new entrants.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{fisheries}} require <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> to be participating fishermen {{to prevent}} absentee ownership {{and limit the}} quota that a captain can accumulate. In the Alaska halibut and black cod fisheries, only active fishermen can buy quota, and new entrants may not sub-lease their quota. However, these measures have only served to mitigate outside speculation in IFQs by non-fishermen. A lack of regulatory policy or enforcement still results in the prevalence of [...] "armchair fishermen" [...] (those who own quota but do not materially participate in the fishery). [...] Since IFQs began in 1995, the commercial longline fleet has never exceeded these fisheries' TACs.|$|R

5000|$|During the 2008 season, due to surging {{demand and}} {{decreasing}} catches, a quota of 36,800 tonnes {{was introduced to}} manage the resource and commercial fishing was restricted to the Younghusband Peninsula, from a point 2 km east of {{the centre of the}} Murray Mouth to Kingston with recreational fishers banned from catching in these areas. The quota became controversial when it was found that 11 of the licences, primarily multi generational local family fishing companies, were allocated only 1% of the quota each, which would fail to cover their overheads; conversely, 10 licences supplying European markets were allocated up to 15% of the quota each. Two groups were formed to lobby Parliament to protect their interests: the Goolwa Cockle Working Group, to represent the 10 large <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> and the Southern Fisherman’s Association representing the small quotas. A politician supporting the small <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> Mitch Williams, claimed the government was deliberately trying to cut {{the number of people in}} the industry to possibly just five or six. The South Australian Legislative Council overturned the quotas on 23 June 2008, citing that [...] "they tip the balance in favour of some fishers to the detriment of others". The Fisheries Minister, Rory McEwen threatened to re-promulgate the quotas and the Legislative Council has still to decide whether to disallow the regulation a second time if it is re-introduced. Due to the controversy, it remains unknown whether fishermen would harvest as much and as quickly as possible until the total quota limit is reached, or abide by their existing share allocation for the 2009 season.|$|R

40|$|An ITQ {{system that}} relies on a single price to {{allocate}} harvest rights will not be fully efficient unless the stock in question is uniform {{in terms of its}} economic value. Variations in the location or density of portions of a stock can give rise to corresponding variations in value, leading harvesters to compete for the best portions of the stock. The size of the waste that can arise from this competition is governed in part by the degree of heterogeneity—greater heterogeneity leads to greater losses. Similar losses can arise from inefficient search in cases where rights are not spatially delineated. We argue that these potential losses can be eliminated either by fully delineating ITQ harvest rights or by coordinating the fishing effort expended by <b>quota</b> <b>holders.</b> Evidence on practices adopted by harvesters operating under ITQ and other forms of regulation indicate that the issues we raise have practical relevance. ...|$|R

The stakeholders in focus are <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> non-quota-holding fishing firms (skippers) and processors. It is shown, utilizing a simple model, that non-quota holding fish firms would argue for smaller steady-state size of the fish stock than would quota holding firms.

40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) {{are primarily}} tools to achieve economic efficiency {{and do not}} amount to ownership of fish stocks. The 200 mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) {{went a long way}} to establish national jurisdiction over fish stocks, and without this ITQs would not have been possible. Shortly after the EEZs were established, Norway and the neighboring countries agreed on the sharing of fish stocks in the EEZ. The road to ITQs in Norway has, however, been long and winding. The paper discusses the obstacles to ITQs in general and how they have played out in Norway in particular. Despite not being conservation tools, individual vessel quotas have been considered helpful in enforcing overall catch limits. The driving forces behind transferability are partly the capital gains <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> can make, and partly the fleet rationalization that transferability generates. Main obstacles are controversies over initial allocation and ideological opposition against privatization and reliance on market forces. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

Once under the quota management system (QMS), however, allocations for allowable catch do not reflect the harvest potential for this fishery. Expectations for quota value and welfare are reduced by the fishery costs of production combined with the capital needed to develop the fishery.

In particular, females are found to be more risk averse than their male counterparts, while <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> are more risk loving. Logistic regression analysis indicates that risk attitudes have implications for non-compliance with fisheries regulation. Specifically, greater risk aversion translates into a reduction in the odds of catching illegally. Furthermore, in the case of gender, female fishers and female fishers with fishing rights are more likely to comply with fisheries regulation. These findings have important implications for the characterisation of risk attitudes in fisheries policy applications and for the management of marine resources. risk attitudes risk aversion experiments fishing rights compliance and South Africa...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of a centralized institution for trading production rights in quota-regulated agricultural sectors can dramatically improve {{the flow of information}} among market partici-pants and increase efficiency.

In this paper, we modify the normal allocation rule of the k-double auction (kDA) to counter thin market conditions and to favor buyers who bid low prices. In laboratory experiments, we test the “truncated ” kDA (T-kDA) against a regular kDA for its ability to affect buyer and seller behavior and decrease equilibrium prices, and assess how it impacts efficiency. The results show that the T-kDA significantly lowers the equilibrium price and results in moderate effi-ciency losses. Most importantly, the T-kDA effectively counters the market power of oligo-polists when demand far outstrips supply...|$|R
40|$|Quota {{management}} {{systems such as}} individual quotas (IQs) and individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are said to provide incentives for individual <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> to conserve the resource voluntarily since increased stock by an individual fisherman 2 ̆ 7 s harvest reduction is shared by all other fishermen. To the extent that this is true if it is because <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> expect the system to work and to be enforced. However, there is no obvious individual incentive to harvest less than the quota. Voluntary harvest reduction by one resource user is not compensated and this provides incentive for free riding under a traditional quota management system. Fishery resources are mobile in varying degrees, and individual resource users do not have their own growth function for own stock such as aquaculture or the hypothetical sole owner made famous by Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s paper (Gordon, 1954). In order to provide incentive for voluntary conservation, virtual populations are proposed. An economic agent (individual, port, region, etc.) is given sole right to manage its own virtual population. However, the recommended harvest levels (quotas under a quota management system) next year will be based not {{on the status of}} the real resource but on how that agent managed the virtual population with which it has been entrusted. ^ Management using virtual populations has features of flexible quota management through virtual population units and this provides strong incentive {{to take into account the}} impact individual virtual population unit (VPU) holders impose on the total population and growth rate change.

40|$|Research PaperThe {{strategic}} direction of fisheries management in New Zealand is changing from merely ensuring sustainability to enabling New Zealanders {{to maximize the}} value they obtain from the sustainable use of fisheries resources and protection of the aquatic environment. Allocating rights and responsibilities is crucial to achieving this goal of maximizing value. Introducing green-lipped mussel into the quota management system (QMS) illustrates how the Ministry is implementing its new {{strategic direction}} and what fisheries management in New Zeland may look like in the future. Green-lipped mussel poses distinct fisheries management challenges as it is harvested at both the juvenile and adult life stages. This paper focuses on the juvenile green-lipped mussel fishery. The fishery supplies seed stock for the New Zealand mussel farming industry. Non-QMS management of the juvenile mussel fishery consisted of a stop-gap permitting regime, method controls and closed areas. Despite there being no pressing sustainability concerns with the fishery, it has been introduced into the QMS to provide for efficient utilization and future development.

40|$|In 2011 an {{individual}} fishing quota (IFQ) system was implemented for the limited entry trawl {{component of the}} Pacific groundfish fishery in the US. The IFQ system allocates quota shares (QS) for 29 IFQ stocks and individual bycatch quota (IBQ) shares for Pacific halibut. Each year quota shareholders are issued quota pounds (QP) {{which can be used}} to balance their own catches of IFQ species or can be traded. The complex multispecies nature of this fishery and the requirement to balance all catch with QP makes QP transferability a critical part of this IFQ system since fishermen have limited ability to control the species composition of their catch and may need to acquire QP to cover unplanned catch. Although a web-based system was created to enable QP transfers, this did not create a functional QP market automatically. Rather the market (and a variety of other mechanisms for distributing QP) is developing organically as <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> fishermen, and intermediaries develop trading and contractual relationships, and QP values are determined and evolve.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} {{took the}} lead in the negotiations to dismantle the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) : (a) a phaseout with the framework of the MFA, proposed by developing countries, the European Community, Japan, and the Nordic countries; and (b) a new transitional structure relying on global quotas with country allotments for current <b>quota</b> <b>holders,</b> suggested by the United States and Canada. Under both scenarios, accelerated quota growth is the main device for phaseout. Country quotas, in the first approach, and global quotas in the second, will have to expand in such a way to avoid a"shock"when they are abolished {{at the end of the}} phaseout. The second most important element in the phaseout proposals, besides expanding quotas and abolishing them at the end of the phaseout period, is scrapping them along the way according to some predetermined criteria and scheme. In the proposals, this is defined in terms of country characteristics, specific products, product characteristics, or some criterion pertaining to the historical record, such a quota use. The historical record reveals that growth in highly utilized quotas was significantly lower compared with unfilled quotas. There is one important virtue in a phaseout based on the current structure of the MFA. Not only are the mechanisms in place familiar to the negotiating parties, but so are the magnitudes of most of the parameters: current quota levels, quota growth rates over the last few years, and their use ratios.

40|$|During {{the recent}} {{deliberation}} of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Controls, considerable attention {{was devoted to}} the question whether, regardless {{of the level of}} imports which should be allowed, the control should {{take the form of a}} quota or a tariff. Occasionally reference was made to a well-known equivalence theorem which holds that when there is perfect competition in the product market a tariff will generate a volume of imports which, if alternatively set as a quota, produces an identical discrepancy between foreign and domestic prices. Therefore, other than the transfer of revenues from <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> to the treasury, there should be no difference between the two types of control. Nevertheless, some support for a quota persisted on the grounds that “A tariff can’t do anything to help the consumer. It will have the same effect in limiting imports as a quota, but all the money goes into the treasury. With quotas, on the other hand, there’s some chance of benefits trickling down to consumers in the form of lower prices. ” Since the market conditions and import regulations for oil differ somewhat from the textbook examples, it is worthwhile to consider whether, in this particular case, there is some reason for consumers to prefer quotas to an “equivalent” tariff. It will turn out that due to the peculiar nature of oil quotas which are set as a fraction of refinery output, such a proposition can be shown to be true under a very restrictive set of assumptions...|$|R

In China, the transaction of Land Use Rights providing farmers’ ability {{to buy or sell}} Land Use Rights has been seriously considered by the Chinese government. The uncertainty in household income and changes in economic environment during the US Tobacco Transition Payment Program and the Chinese Land Use Rights Regime lead many individuals into entrepreneurial activities. Entrepreneurship often means making changes in livelihood activities that involve substantial risks to income. While the rewards may be substantial, transactions costs may make decisions irreversible. This paper draws a comparison between entrepreneurship and technology adoption. Adopting a new production technology also involves substantial risks. The economics of technology adoption is a well developed literature with many accepted and testable models. Most prominent are the theories of learning by using and learning by doing. We review the technology adoption literature, drawing out lessons for entrepreneurship research. We then apply an ‘entrepreneurship as technology adoption’ model to a unique dataset collected in Kentucky, US and in Shaanxi province, China. Using a sample of 702 Kentucky farmers {{at the time of the}} buyout and 730 Chinese farmers, we test several of the implications of this model and compare significant results between Kentucky and Shaanxi farmers.

40|$|In {{fisheries}} managed using individual transferable quotas (ITQs) it {{is generally}} assumed that quota markets are well-functioning, allowing quota to flow on either a temporary or permanent basis to those able to make best use of it. However, despite {{an increasing number of}} fisheries being managed under ITQs, empirical assessments of the quota markets that have actually evolved in these fisheries remain scarce. The Queensland Coral Reef Fin-Fish Fishery (CRFFF) on the Great Barrier Reef has been managed under a system of ITQs since 2004. Data on individual quota holdings and trades for the period 2004 - 2012 were used to assess the CRFFF quota market and its evolution through time. Network analysis was applied to assess market structure and the nature of lease-trading relationships. An assessment of market participants' abilities to balance their quota accounts, i. e., gap analysis, provided insights into market functionality and how this may have changed in the period observed. Trends in ownership and trade were determined, and market participants were identified as belonging to one out of a set of seven generalized types. The emergence of groups such as investors and lease-dependent fishers is clear. In 2011 - 2012, 41 % of coral trout quota was owned by participants that did not fish it, and 64 % of total coral trout landings were made by fishers that owned only 10 % of the quota. Quota brokers emerged whose influence on the market varied with the bioeconomic conditions of the fishery. Throughout the study period some quota was found to remain inactive, implying potential market inefficiencies. Contribution to this inactivity appeared asymmetrical, with most residing in the hands of smaller <b>quota</b> <b>holders.</b> The importance of transaction costs in the operation of the quota market and the inequalities that may result are discussed in light of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The seafood {{industry}} is New Zealand's fifth largest export sector by value {{and a major}} contributor to the nation's economy. However, for decades a sizeable portion of annual total industry catch within the Exclusive Economic Zone has been caught by overseas flagged vessels (‘Foreign Charter Fishing Vessels’ or ‘FCVs’) crewed by foreign guestworkers on contract to New Zealand based fishing <b>quota</b> <b>holders.</b> Concerns relating to guestworker welfare, working conditions aboard vessels, and regulatory compliance have characterised their controversial presence in New Zealand waters. In July 2011 the New Zealand Ministers for Labour and Primary Industries jointly announced the establishment of a Ministerial Inquiry to consider the use and operation of FCVs in New Zealand’s waters following the emergence of reports of widespread exploitation of guestworkers aboard vessels. In August 2011 a high profile report by University of Auckland researchers detailed allegations raised by groups of FCV guestworkers who claimed they had been the victims of sustained physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at sea. The implication is that many guestworkers had been 'trafficked' into the industry to labour for little or no remuneration. The terms of reference for the Ministerial Inquiry directed the Inquiry Panel to review the use of FCVs against the Government’s articulated priorities for the industry. These priorities were to ‘protect New Zealand’s international reputation and trade access’; ‘maximise economic return to New Zealand from fisheries resources’; and to ‘ensure acceptable and equitable labour standards are applied on vessels operating in New Zealand’s fisheries waters’. This thesis applies critical discourse analysis methodology to analyse the establishment of the Ministerial Inquiry, the Inquiry’s public consultation process, and the public policy recommendations contained in its final report to Government in order to examine how the experiences and allegations of guestworkers were framed, ordered, and considered throughout the Inquiry process. The research findings suggest that the Inquiry process has marginalised guestworker perspectives and that this has implications for the pursuit of social justice. As such the thesis contributes to an emerging academic literature on the experiences of guestworkers in the New Zealand fishing industry {{and the ways in which}} allegations of exploitation and mistreatment have been viewed and responded to by the New Zealand authorities...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide {{an analysis of the}} economic logic behind fisheries policy and redistribution in South African. An examination of the institutional and organizational evolution reveals that South African fisheries policy followed the world trend in the movement toward quota management systems. However, it is argued that due to the peculiarities of the Apartheid political system, South Africa developed a unique and persistent structure of individual fishing rights that resulted in a transfer of power from the fisher to monopsonistic, and subsequently vertically integrated, fish processing companies. Problems, however, arose with the need to redistribute fishing rights to previously repressed racial groups. It is proposed that, within a specific form (TAC), the structure of individual fishing rights can be decomposed into four operational rules, namely, the right of participation, asset size, tradability and duration of term. Policy design is restricted to a feasible set of rules that impact on the flexibility of the system, the incentives facing private fishing companies and fishers, the efficiency of the fisheries management plan and finally the effect it has on a redistribution strategy. Within this analytical framework, South Africa's policy yields a very flexible system favourable to monopsonistic industrial organisation. However, by adding a redistribution constraint, this structure has a number of important effects. First, as new <b>quota</b> <b>holders</b> are added the information costs for effective fisheries management increase exponentially. Second, the transaction costs to private fishing companies are increased. Third, only the resource rent is redistributed (weak redistribution). Next, the micro to small vessel fisheries, the medium vessel fisheries and the large vessel fisheries are examined separately. The major aim is to determine, within the available data, the effect that a weak redistribution policy (redistribution of the resource rent), has on strong redistribution (redistribution of fishing capital and skills). The evidence definitely supports the analytical framework and suggests that fundamentally the structure of individual fishing rights, which evolved in response to a monopsonistic industrial organisation during the apartheid era in South Africa, works against strong redistribution. Also, that different fisheries face different constraints and that these should in certain instances be treated separately...|$|R

The preferred alternative would implement a catch sharing plan for the charter and commercial sectors in these areas to resolve conservation and allocation concerns that have resulted from increased harvests in the charter halibut fishery in both areas, and decreased catch limits in the commercial setline fisheries in Area 2 C. The plan would (1) replace the current guideline harvest levels (GHLs); (2) set initial allocations for each sector; (3) implement management measures to limit charter harvests to the allocations; and (4) allow charter halibut limited entry permit (LEP) holders to lease halibut individual fishing quota from commercial <b>quota</b> share <b>holders,</b> to increase their seasonal allocations for use by their clients. The plan would require pre-season notice of upcoming management measures to allow an uninterrupted charter season. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) intends that the allocations to both sectors vary with halibut abundance; hence, its preferred alternative includes a fixed percentage allocation. The initial charter sector allocation would be 17. 3 percent of the Area 2 C combined commercial and charter catch limit when it {{is determined by the}} IPHC to be less than 5 Mlb; the allocation would be 15. 1 percent when the combined catch limit is 5 Mlb or more. The initial charter secto...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperNorway has {{for years}} managed its coastal {{fisheries}} through {{a regime that}} {{for all practical purposes}} has acted as open access, that is, open for bona fide fishers. The trawling sector was closed already in the 1930 s, and the large offshore fleet was regulated through limited entry licensing from the early 1970 s, while the coastal fishers were free to enter up to 1990. At that time the serious crisis in the cod sector implied a strict vessel quota system, a system that has been extended after the crisis passed away and that is now gradually being expanded to all other important fisheries as well. Add to this that through central allocation keys the distribution of rights and quotas has been fixed for longer periods (at present up to 2007). From nearly open access Norwegian fisheries have in twelve years moved to a situation where more than 90 % of the resources are allocated and defined as accessible only for a limited number of <b>quota</b> and right <b>holders.</b> While the process has been heavily disputed within the fishermen’s organisations, the Norwegian Fishermen’s Association has all along played its part and accepted the preferred solutions. The same {{seems to be the case}} for politicians and the surrounding society, although more critical voices are also heard, not least among the representatives of the small-scale operators and the part-timers. The main question is, however, to identify the driving forces behind this process. Is it an inevitable outcome of technical rationalisation, whereby each vessel has become technically more efficient over time, facing a limited resource (fixed TACs) ? Or is it a result of a “bureaucratic plot” as claimed by some researchers, where the fisheries administrators have been intent on closing the fisheries for years and are now using the crisis to implement an administrative plan? Or could it be that the fishers themselves, through various co-management institutions like the Regulatory Council, have fronted the closing process in order to improve their own economic position? Whatever the explanation, there seems to be no way back and the article ends up discussing possible future scenarios...|$|R
