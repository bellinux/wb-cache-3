25|$|With the two China teams merging into {{a single}} one, the league reduced the amount of games to only 30 in the 2007–08 season. Prior {{to the start of}} the season Kangwon Land changed their name to High1. The team again won the Korea Domestic Championship in November 2007. High1 further {{improved}} and finished the season in second place with 58 points which included a sweep of the newly formed China Sharks. Coach Kim credit the entire team for doing well but singled out their goalie, Eum Hyun-seung as really shining. The team's home schedule was not as mixed as the previous season and they played 13 games in Chuncheon while playing two in Goyang. There was further improvement in the point rankings as Alex Kim ranked first in goals, third in assists and first points in the league with 23, 28 and 51 respectively. Tim Smith was tied with Kim for first with 23 goals and finished third in points with 46. The team had three other top 10 showings in the points rankings. Alex Kim also led the team in plus-minus with +32. Finishing in second place had High1 playing the Oji Paper in the semi-finals. Unfortunately for High1 Oji would sweep every series they played that year and capture the cup. Due to their <b>quick</b> <b>exit,</b> High1 failed to register in the postseason points race.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, United Airlines began flights between Manchester and Washington Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C. But {{creation}} of a north-south hub at Dulles did not work for United, and heavy competition in this market led to a <b>quick</b> <b>exit.</b> The Boeing 737 was used for this short-lived service, which comprised about four daily circuits between the two airports. US Airways started service at Manchester in early 1986, by connecting their hubs at Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The carrier used the DC-9, BAC 111, and 737-200 aircraft. Both carriers expanded service at Manchester over the years with larger planes and more flights. United now runs a strict non-stop schedule to and from Chicago with no intermediate stops or tag-ons. The 757 {{has been used by}} both United and US Airways at Manchester, which stands as the largest passenger-carrying plane to serve the airport in scheduled service. The Airbus A320 series of aircraft is also commonly used by United, Northwest Airlines (merged with Delta Air Lines), and occasionally by US Airways. In April 2010, Delta enhanced service to Manchester; it dropped its daily CRJ-700 service to Atlanta and replaced the aircraft with an MD-88 with seating for 149. Delta also switched all its Delta Connection service to Detroit with mainline service on DC-9's. Delta and Southwest are the only airlines serving Manchester with all mainline jets, Southwest with the Boeing 737.|$|E

25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and would go out on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in the USOC match and by all accounts looked very much as if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a <b>quick</b> <b>exit</b> from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including a dreary 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E

40|$|In this article, we {{analyze the}} {{dynamics}} of temporary workers’ transitions into permanent contracts for workers related to the tourism industry. For this purpose, we use an administrative retrospective dataset from Spanish Social security records. Results show that while individuals with a weaker attachment to the tourism industry achieve open-ended contracts sooner than in most other industries, on the contrary, it takes more time to those with a greater attachment to the tourism industry to exit from the temporary status. In addition, we find that for workers substantially engaged in the tourism industry, it takes more time to reach an open-ended contract when they have held between six and ten contracts in the past (as opposed to holding only one previous contract). On the contrary, for individuals with a weaker attachment to the tourism industry, holding between two and ten previous contracts implies a <b>quicker</b> <b>exit</b> from temporality.

The first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{juvenile}} songbird movement in response to timber harvest, particularly in the boreal forest. If clearcut land cover facilitates movement, the availability of resources may increase. However, if clearcut land cover impedes movement, important post-fledging resources may be rendered inaccessible. Using radio telemetry, we tested the hypothesis that regenerating clearcut land cover would affect the movement of recently independent Yellow-rumped Myrtle Warblers (Dendroica coronata coronata) and Blackpoll Warblers (Dendroica striata) differently than forested land cover owing to intrinsic differences in each land-cover type or in how they are perceived. We found that both species moved extensively before migration. We also found that Blackpoll Warblers were <b>quick</b> to <b>exit</b> local areas composed of clearcut land cover and that both species were <b>quick</b> to <b>exit</b> neighborhoods composed of large proportions of clearcut land cover. However, if individuals encountered clearcut land cover when exiting the neighborhood, movement rate was slowed. Effectively, residency time decreased in clearcut neighborhoods and landscape connectivity was impeded by clearcut land cover. Our results suggest that clearcut land cover may represent low-quality habitat for both species during the post-fledging period. Further {{research is needed to}} determine if changes in movement behavior associated with landscape structure affect individual condition and higher-level ecological processes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Commuters {{leaving a}} station often choose the stair as a <b>quicker</b> <b>exit</b> than the escalator. This paper models {{the effects of}} speed leaving the station and stair width on choice of the stairs or escalator. METHODS: Aggregated data from {{previous}} studies (n= 82, 347) revealed a plateau at about 45 % stair use as the number leaving each train rose. Subsequently, the time taken by passengers on the stairs and escalator was measured in a station in Birmingham, UK in 2007 (n= 5848). The resulting transport rates (passengers s(- 1)) for stairs and escalators at the average commuting traffic were used to estimate the effects of increases in stair width on choice of the stairs. RESULTS: Average transport rates were higher for the escalator (0. 93 +/- 0. 33 passengers s(- 1)) than the stairs (0. 58 +/- 0. 24 passengers s(- 1)). Modelling {{of the effects of}} transport rate with multiple regression suggested 40. 1 % of passengers would use the stairs, a figure close to the observed rate. Using similar calculations, a doubling of width of the stairs could result maximally in a 17. 2 % increase in stair use. CONCLUSIONS: Changes to the width of stairs could produce a permanent increase in lifestyle physical activity immune to the effects of time on healthy intentions...|$|R
