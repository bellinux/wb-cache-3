5|$|Climate models use <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> to {{simulate}} the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> {{are often}} used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many of the concepts of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E

In 1898, he founded L'Année Sociologique, the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, {{he published}} Suicide, a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

40|$|Background: Salivary {{infection}} due to Streptococci mutans {{is considered}} the main microbiological risk factor for the initiation of dental caries. Aim: To evaluate a semi-quantitative method to assess Streptococci mutans salivary infection and compare it with the existing <b>quantitative</b> <b>method.</b> Patient and methods: Saliva samples were obtained from 650 pre-school children aged 2 to 6 years old using a TYCSB liquid medium for counting Streptococci mutans. Results were compared with quantitative cultures. Results: There was a 99. 3 % linear correlation coefficient between both methods. The correlation coefficients with dental caries prevalence were 97 % for the semi <b>quantitative</b> <b>method</b> and 90 % for the <b>quantitative</b> <b>method.</b> Conclusions: The semi-quantitative method to assess oral infection with Streptococci mutans, is accurate enough {{to be used in}} population studies and oral infection prevention programs in developing countries (Rev Méd Chile 2003; 131 : 412 - 8) ...|$|R
40|$|Setting up a <b>quantitative</b> <b>method</b> for {{a global}} {{evaluation}} of farmland: application to the Walloon Region (Belgium). To counteract the wasteful use of good quality farmlands by other land uses, we have developed a <b>quantitative</b> <b>method</b> for land evaluation. By splitting up soil map symbols, we have drawn up suitabilility maps for cultivation and for grazing. Farming factors, such as slope, closeness to the farmhouses {{and size of the}} farmland blocks, were integrated in the soil suitability map {{with the help of a}} geographic information system. The multiplication of the weighted coefficients linked to these factors lead to a global farmland evaluation map. This method has been tested in 10 districts of the Walloon Region. Results seem to be close to farmers practices. The validation problems of this map and the benefits of a factorial and <b>quantitative</b> <b>method</b> are also discussed in this paper...|$|R

The use of IP-LC-MS not only allows a <b>quantitative</b> <b>method</b> for Aβ 1 – 40 and Aβ 1 – 42 peptides present in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but allows {{detection of}} other Aβ peptide species that may also {{play a role in the}} onset of AD in humans...|$|R
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} is {{the branch of}} psychology concerned with {{the scientific study of}} human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods,</b> including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} {{school of}} symbolic interactionism uses shared social knowledge from a macro-level culture, natural language, social institution, or organization to explain relatively enduring patterns {{of social interaction}} and psychology at the micro-level, typically investigating these matters with <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods.</b> Identity theory, affect control theory, and the Iowa School are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings Affect Control Theory provides a mathematical model of role theory and of labeling theory.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}}, {{as much as}} {{any other}} field of psychology heavily relies on a balance of pure observation and <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> in psychology. The study of education generally combines the studies of history, sociology, and ethics with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to sociology and psychology has opened the door for new findings in education as a social science. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.|$|E

The project published a further report in June 2014 saying that greater online activity for Yes Scotland had continued.|$|E
25|$|Although {{these three}} phylogenetic {{features}} are useful rules of thumb to identify epidemiological, immunological, and evolutionary processes {{that might be}} impacting viral genetic variation, there is growing recognition that the mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern can be many-to-one. For instance, although ladder-like trees {{such as the one}} shown in figure 3A could reflect the presence of directional selection, ladder-like trees could also reflect sequential genetic bottlenecks that might occur with rapid spatial spread, {{as in the case of}} rabies virus. Because of this many-to-one mapping between process and phylogenetic pattern, research in the field of viral phylodynamics has sought to develop and apply <b>quantitative</b> <b>methods</b> to effectively infer process from reconstructed viral phylogenies (see Methods). The consideration of other data sources (e.g., incidence patterns) may aid in distinguishing between competing phylodynamic hypotheses. Combining disparate sources of data for phylodynamic analysis remains a major challenge in the field and is an active area of research.|$|E
