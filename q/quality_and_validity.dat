Introduction. Estimates on the epidemiology of chronic pain vary widely throughout Europe. It is unclear whether this variation reflects true differences between populations or methodological factors. Information on the epidemiology of chronic pain can support decision makers in allocating adequate health care resources. Methods. In order to obtain epidemiological data on chronic pain in Denmark and Sweden, we conducted a literature review of epidemiological data primarily on chronic noncancer pain, prioritising studies of highest <b>quality,</b> recency, <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> by conducting a systematic search for relevant studies.

In order to increase empirical validity of content analyses Krippendorff (2004) suggested concentrating {{on the structure of}} the analysis, validity of the data, and the relational aspects of the findings. Fereday and Muir-Cochrane introduced a step-by-step analysis process containing deductive and inductive coding, allowing their research to begin grounded and then progress to a thematic, data-driven discovery. Ethnographic Content Analysis (Altheide, 1987) disregards a priori coding as a quantitative characteristic; however, the etic (<b>and</b> emic) <b>quality</b> of the Fereday & Muir-Cochrane methodology adds grounding and structure to ECA without disrupting the discovery, descriptive nature of the methodology.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Systematic reviews are an {{appraised}} {{method to}} summarize research in a concise and transparent way, and may enable {{to draw conclusions}} beyond the sum of results of individual studies. We assessed the results, <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> external <b>validity</b> of systematic reviews on diet in patients with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, SUBJECTS: We systematically searched for systematic reviews on nutritional interventions in patients with type 2 diabetes that used a reproducible search strategy {{in at least one}} major database that applied some form of quality assessment. We assessed <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> the external <b>validity</b> of the retrieved systematic reviews. Outcomes were defined as statistical meta-analyses or narrative results using a predefined and reproducible method. RESULTS: Six systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria, investigating dietary interventions in general (n= 3), chromium supplementation (n= 1), fish-oil (n= 1) or herbs and nutrition supplements (n= 1). Quality assessment showed minimal/minor flaws in four cases and major/extensive flaws in two cases. All reviews had insufficient data needed to judge external validity. In reviews with minimal/minor flaws, we found beneficial effects of very-low-calorie diets and fish-oil supplements. However, the external validity of these results could not be assessed sufficiently. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews largely failed to produce knowledge beyond the sum of the original studies. Furthermore, judgment of external validity was hampered in most cases owing to missing data. To improve the <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> usefulness of systematic reviews of dietary interventions, we recommend the application of more focused research questions, but with broader inclusion criteria, for example, the use of observational studies.
