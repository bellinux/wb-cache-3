40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} actuarial {{applications of}} modern statistical methods that are ap-plied to detailed, micro-level automobile insurance records. We consider 1993 - 2001 data con-sisting {{of policy and}} claims files from a major Singaporean insurance company. A hierarchical statistical model, developed in prior work Frees and Valdez (2008), is fit using the micro-level data. This model allows us to study the accident frequency, loss type and severity jointly and to incorporate individual characteristics such as age, gender and driving history that explain heterogeneity among policyholders. Based on this hierarchical model, one can analyze the risk profile of either a single policy (micro-level) or a portfolio of business (macro-level). This paper investigates three types of actuarial applications. First, we demonstrate the calculation of the predictive mean of losses for individual risk rating. This allows the actuary to differentiate prices based on policyholder char-acteristics. The nonlinear effects of coverage modifications such as deductibles, policy limits and coinsurance are quantified. Moreover, our flexible structure allows us to “unbundle ” contracts and price more primitive elements of the contract, such as coverage type. The second application concerns the predictive distribution of a portfolio of business. We demonstrate the calculation of various risk measures, including value at risk and conditional tail expectation, that are use-ful in determining economic capital for insurance companies. Third, we {{examine the effects of}} several reinsurance treaties. Specifically, we show the predictive loss distributions for both the insurer and reinsurer under <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> and excess-of-loss <b>reinsurance</b> agreements. In addition, we present an example of portfolio reinsurance, in which the combined effect of reinsurance agreements on the risk characteristics of ceding and reinsuring company are described. ∗Keywords: Long-tail regression, copulas, risk measures, reinsurance...|$|R

40|$|Alaska fishing {{charter service}} owners are seeking an {{increased}} share of halibut fish resources {{be reserved for}} the recreational guided angler sector. An organization representing the owners who fish in the International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Area 2 C (southeast Alaska) and Area 3 A (southcentral Alaska) titled the Catch Accountability through Compensated Halibut (CATCH) Project are designing a plan whereby <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> owned by commercial fishing sector are purchased and the quota pounds they represent are annually deposited in a guided angler harvest common pool. If necessary to assist in augmenting available harvestable fish from stock abundance to attain the same management regulations for both guided and unguided anglers in both regulatory areas, then the inter-sector transfers through purchases would be used. While this could {{be perceived as a}} fishery resource allocation dispute, the organization is not attempting to influence management bodies in reallocating the resource based on optimizing social welfare and economic development values. Instead the organization is looking for mechanisms that would allow it to purchase <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> using voluntary market approaches consistent with privatized user rights and privileges. The <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> inter-sector transfer procedures will necessarily be complex for several reasons. The amount to purchase needs to be estimated within the bounds of possible future resource abundances and what new effort might be attracted into the guided angler sector. Guided angler trip demand forecasts must be developed to account for less restrictive regulations, possibly higher angler costs, and other guided angler motivations for trip making such as nationwide general economic conditions. The possible cost increases are because one <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> purchase fund raising option is to use proceeds from imposing a guided angler fishing license endorsement fee. Diverting quota pounds from the seafood market for the <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> amounts to be purchased during years of lower exploitable stock abundance (range of 500 thousand to one million net weight pounds in Area 2 C) will not in itself appreciably influence harvest price. Another reason the plan is complex is that the existing program's <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> sales rules are highly regulated in order to satisfy an objective to retain the pre-privatized fishery structure. <b>Quota</b> <b>share</b> sales in recent years are very small and amounts needed for the inter-sector transfer would greatly exceed amounts annually coming to market. The inter-sector ask price would have to be high enough to incentivize new holders to the market. It is suggested that program rules on restraining certain transfers may need to be relaxed for sufficient purchases to occur. The acquisition is for an asset that is primarily needed by the guided angler sector during periods of relative low fish resource abundances. If stock recovery is sufficient, then the asset could be leased or even divested back to the commercial fishing sector. A report was developed by economists to assist in the CATCH Project design. The report explains there will be significant challenges in conducting purchases for the benefit of a heterogeneous set of fishing charter service firms. There will be plan design problems associated with determining own industry needs; estimating angler response to fees and the changed quality of the angling experience; and, assessing commercial fishing industry <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> supply functions. There is probably sufficient flexibility for federal authorization of such a program, although establishing one is without precedent. The approval of a design is neither imminent nor assured given the required state legislative and administrative processes, the many federal and international treaty implementing unknowns, judicial review avenues, etc. However, the innovative process is deserving of consideration due to higher marginal economic benefits to local communities and the nation from reserving additional recreationally harvested fish, and concerns for a viable charter industry from customer demand response for the unequal fishery access...|$|R

Instead of allocating {{the full 100}} % of shares to fishermen, the Pacific Fishery Management Council made a bold decision to hold 10 % of the <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> for each of 28 species aside in an adaptive management program. These shares were an insurance policy for the substantial changes occurring under the new management regime; by holding something aside, the Council could later direct these shares toward {{one or more of}} the five adaptive management program objectives: stabilizing fishing communities, stabilizing fish processors, facilitating new entrants, addressing conservation concerns, or responding to other unintended outcomes of the individual fishing quota program. But after almost five years, the Council has not yet developed the adaptive management program and the shares have not been assigned to meet their intended objectives. Instead current <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> owners receive adaptive management program quota pounds in addition to what they already own. Here, I suggest six policy options for the adaptive management program to meet the Council’s stated objectives, and consider each option in terms of effectiveness, politically viability and implementation feasibility.

The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of Fund quotas is key to IMF reform.

(2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> toward the nonindustrial countries.

40|$|Since their inception, Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) crab {{fisheries}} {{have attracted}} participants willing to undertake great financial and personal risks {{to participate in}} these high valued fisheries. Although entry to the fisheries is limited, excess capital and overcapacity, together with stock declines, {{have resulted in a}} race for fish. The shortest season is in the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery, which has been prosecuted for less than one week in recent years. Efforts of managers to protect declining stocks by reducing allowable catch have increased the economic stress on participants and communities that depend on these fisheries and increased pressure on participants to take greater risks. For several years, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council worked with participants to address these problems in the crab fisheries through series of working groups and management measures. In 2001, Congress stepped in, directing the Council to assess various rationalization programs for the fisheries, including individual fishing <b>quotas</b> (IFQs), processor <b>shares,</b> cooperatives, and <b>quotas</b> held by communities. The outcome of the Council process is a new and unique management program selected by a unanimous vote of the North Pacific Council. The program reflects the Council's desire to accommodate the interests of several groups dependent on these fisheries-vessel owners, processors, captains and crew, and communities. Under the program, harvest <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> (QS) will be issued to vessel owners and captains. Processors will be issued processing <b>quota</b> <b>shares.</b> Under these allocations, 90 percent of harvest <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> are designated for delivery to holders of processing <b>quota</b> <b>shares.</b> Community interests are protected by a requirement that a certain portion of the catch be landed and processed in designated regions. An arbitration program is included to resolve price disputes, which could arise because of the constraints on markets created by the dual share allocations. The result of the Council's action {{is one of the most}} complex fishery management programs to date. The attempt to satisfy many interests creates significant hurdles that must be overcome for the program to succeed economically and environmentally. This paper describes key dimensions of the proposed crab fishery management program and identifies the most substantial hurdles that the program must overcome for the Council to judge it a successful management program for the fisheries. First, managers will be challenged by program implementation. Implementation will require initial allocations of harvesting shares to vessel owners and captains and processing shares to processors. Most shares will be regionally designated based on the participant's landings history. Second, managers will face the challenge of protecting stocks as the incentives to high grade increase in the share-based fishery. Third, the markets for the harvest shares, captains shares, and processing shares must develop in a manner that facilitates coordination of harvesting and processing activity required by the share system and the regional landing and processing requirements. Lastly, market opportunities for harvest landings will be constrained by the requirement that deliveries be made to a processing share holder in a designated region. For the program to be considered a success, price formation in the market for landings must be perceived as fair. Each of these issues is described in a manner that provides the reader with a perspective of the institutional challenges faced by a program that attempts to address the concerns of several different interests. In addition, characteristics of the fisheries that contribute to the potential to overcome these obstacles are discussed. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
