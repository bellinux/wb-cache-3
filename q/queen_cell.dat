25|$|As {{the young}} queen larva pupates {{with her head}} down, the workers cap the <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> with beeswax.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the rearing of drone larvae grafted in <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> From the 1200 drone larvae that were grafted during spring and autumn, 875 were accepted (72. 9 %) and reared as queens. Drone larvae in false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> received royal jelly {{of the same}} composition and of the same amounts as queen larvae. Workers capped the <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> {{as if they were}} drones, 9 - 10 days after the egg laying. Out of 60 accepted false <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> 21 (35 %) were capped. The shape of false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> with drone larvae is unusually long with a characteristically elongate tip which is probably due to the falling of larvae. Bees start the destruction of the cells when the larvae were 3 days old and maximised it before and after capping. Protecting false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> in the colony by wrapping, reversing them upside down, or placing in a horizontal position, did not help. The only adult drones that emerged from the false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> were those protected in an incubator and in push-in cages. Adult drones from false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> had smaller wings, legs, and proboscis than regular drones. The results of this study verify previous reports that the bees do not recognise the different sex of the larvae at least at the early stage of larval development. The late destruction of false <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> the similarity in quality and quantity of the produced royal jelly, and the bigger drone cells, allow for the use of drone larvae in cups for the production of royal jelly...|$|R
5000|$|Stage 4: After finishing, you {{can either}} cut out the <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> {{and place them in}} mating nucs, or place an entire frame with {{finished}} <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> in a mating nuc.|$|R
25|$|Acute bee {{paralysis}} virus {{is considered to}} be a common infective agent of bees. It belongs to the family Dicistroviridae, as does the Israel acute paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus, and the black <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> virus. It is frequently detected in apparently healthy colonies. Apparently, this virus plays a role in cases of sudden collapse of honey bee colonies infested with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{factor that}} determines a female's social caste {{is known to}} be its nest position. The location of each cell {{is directly related to the}} amount of food a larva can receive, and the <b>queen</b> <b>cell,</b> being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female – the queen.|$|E
25|$|Larval {{stages of}} G. mellonella parasitize both wild and {{cultivated}} honeybees.  Eggs are laid within the hive, and the larva that hatch tunnel through {{and destroy the}} honeycombs that contain honeybee larva and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees. Destruction of honeycombs also result in honey leaking and being wasted. Finally, both G. mellonella adults and larvae can be vectors for pathogens that can infect honeybees, including the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the black <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> virus (BQCV).|$|E
50|$|Following {{the removal}} of the ripe <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> the cloake board can be removed to re-establish the single united colony.|$|R
5000|$|In the Demaree method a {{frame of}} capped brood is removed with the old queen. This frame is put in a hive box with empty drawn frames and {{foundation}} at the same location of the old hive. A honey super {{is added to the}} top of this hive topped by a crown board (known as an [...] "inner cover" [...] in America). The remaining hive box sans queen is inspected for <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> All <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> are destroyed. This hive box, which has most of the bees, is put on top of the crown board. Foraging bees will return to the lower box depleting the population of the upper box. After a week to ten days both parts are inspected again and any subsequent <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> destroyed. After another period of separation the swarming drive is extinguished and the hives can be re-combined.|$|R
50|$|Beekeepers {{monitor their}} colonies {{carefully}} {{in spring and}} watch for the appearance of <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> which are a dramatic signal that the colony is determined to swarm.|$|R
25|$|When <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> {{construction}} {{begins in}} late August to early September, {{it is in}} the male’s best interest to mate with a queen and produce a gyne. Similar wasp species illustrate workers that help their own kin or harm nonrelatives from growing as a gyne. Thus, reproductive competition occurs so that the genes of specific subfamilies can be passed on and survive. However, no evidence of reproductive competition exists within V. maculifrons colonies. Although a second male may occasionally attempt to grasp a queen immediately after copulation with another male, postcopulatory sperm competition is not common. In addition, reproductive skew among males is low.|$|E
2500|$|Nosema apis is a microsporidian that invades the {{intestinal}} tracts of adult bees and causes nosema disease, {{also known as}} nosemosis. [...] Nosema infection is also associated with black <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> virus. [...] It is normally only a problem when the bees cannot leave the hive to eliminate waste (for example, during an extended cold spell in winter or when the hives are enclosed in a wintering barn). [...] When the bees are unable to void (cleansing flights), they can develop dysentery.|$|E
2500|$|When a young virgin queen {{emerges from}} a <b>queen</b> <b>cell,</b> she will {{generally}} seek out virgin queen rivals and attempt to kill them. Virgin queens will quickly find and kill (by stinging) any other emerged virgin queen (or be dispatched themselves), {{as well as any}} unemerged queens. [...] Queen cells that are opened on the side indicate that a virgin queen was likely killed by a rival virgin queen. [...] When a colony remains in swarm mode after the prime swarm has left, the workers may prevent virgins from fighting and one or several virgins may go with after-swarms. [...] Other virgins may stay behind with the remnant of the hive. Some virgins have been seen to escape the hive to avoid being killed and seek out another without a queen, such as in the eusocial bee Melipona scutellaris. As many as 21 virgin queens have been counted in a single large swarm. When the after-swarm settles into a new home, the virgins will then resume normal behavior and fight to the death until only one remains.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} workers in a colony {{increases}} over the summer months with worker cell construction being greatest in early July. By the end of June there are about 100 worker cells, and in early July there are 200-300 cells with a maximum of 700-900 {{by the end of}} July. There is a switch from worker cell construction to <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> construction in the beginning of July, and <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> construction is greatest in late July. By early August, the nest will contain 2-3 <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> combs but never more than 3. In mature nests, the number of queen cells ranges from 200-900 cells.|$|E
50|$|Swarm cell {{production}} involves creating many <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> {{typically a}} dozen or more. These are located {{around the edges of}} a broodcomb, often at the sides and the bottom.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} at Khon Kaen and Maha Sarakham Provinces in northeastern region of Thailand. The work designed to investigate ecological locations and types of sugar in honey of Little Honeybee (Apis florea F.). The results showed that there were four types of ecological locations found, i. e. cropland and degradation forest, orchard farm, villages, and housing area of government�s official. Five types of sugar contents in honey were found with majority of fructose followed by glucose, lactose, maltose, and least with sucrose. The highest amounts of sugar in honey were highest in June followed by February, December, January, March, September, April, October and November. All types of sugar {{had no effect on}} egg rate, worker, and drone cells except fructose where it had highly significant effect on number of <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> A range of 1 - 1. 05 (g ml - 1) of total sugar had highly significant effect on number of <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> but with higher range number of <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> was decline...|$|R
40|$|When a {{honeybee}} queen {{starts to}} fail, she is often superseded {{by a young}} queen that takes over reproduction inside the colony. Natural supersedure in winter leads to an unfertilised young queen and colony loss. To reduce these losses we tried to stimulate supersedure of queens earlier in the season. In 50 colonies we introduced <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> with one-day-old larvae and capped <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> Although many larvae were fed initially, few of them were reared to mature queens {{and none of the}} cases resulted in supersedure. This suggests that supersedure cannot be evoked by artificially bypassing the initial phases of the process...|$|R
5000|$|Queen {{bees are}} not {{raised in the}} {{hexagonal}} brood comb but require a special <b>queen</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{swarming}} season, the old queen {{will likely}} leave {{with the prime}} swarm before the first virgin queen emerges from a <b>queen</b> <b>cell.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{bumblebee}} is {{susceptible to}} certain viruses that infect honey bees, such as Black <b>Queen</b> <b>Cell</b> Virus (BQCV) and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV).|$|E
25|$|After the {{founding}} phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> Once the workers start {{building on the}} <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers are fed to the queen larvae, known as gynes {{and the lack of}} feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods. To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers will remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as worker policing.|$|R
50|$|Queens {{are raised}} in {{specially}} constructed <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> The fully constructed <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> have a peanut-like shape and texture.Queen cells {{start out as}} queen cups. Queen cups are larger than the cells of normal brood comb and are oriented vertically instead of horizontally. Worker bees will only further build up the queen cup once the queen has laid an egg in a queen cup. In general, the old queen starts laying eggs into queen cups when conditions are right for swarming or supersedure. Swarm cells hang {{from the bottom of}} a frame while supersedure queens or emergency queens are generally raised in cells built out from the face of a frame.|$|R
50|$|When {{a colony}} {{has decided to}} swarm, <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> are {{produced}} in numbers varying to a dozen or more. When {{the first of these}} <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> is sealed after eight days of larval feeding, a virgin queen pupates and is due to emerge seven days later. Before leaving, the worker bees fill their stomachs with honey in preparation for the creation of new honeycombs in a new home. This cargo of honey also makes swarming bees less inclined to sting. A newly issued swarm is noticeably gentle for up to 24 hours and is often capable of being handled by a beekeeper without gloves or veil.|$|R
50|$|In a walk-away split, frames {{with eggs}} and worker bees are removed and the bees {{will create a}} <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> out of a {{suitable}} egg. Once the queen hatches, successfully mates {{and returns to the}} hive, the hive will be queenright.|$|E
5000|$|This {{method of}} mating is called [...] "open mating."Once a queen is mated and the {{beekeeper}} observes the laying pattern, the queen will be removed, caged and sold. The mating nuc will receive another <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> or virgin queen {{and the process}} will repeat.|$|E
50|$|As {{the young}} queen larva pupates {{with her head}} down, the workers cap the <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a {{circular}} cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open {{when most of the}} cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.|$|E
40|$|Nepotism is an {{important}} potential conflict in animal societies. However, clear evidence of nepotism in the rearing of queens in social insects is limited and controversial. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, multiple mating by queens leads {{to the presence of}} many patrilines within each colony. When the colonies reproduce through swarming, workers rear a number of new queens, only a few of which will ultimately head a colony. Workers can potentially increase their inclusive fitness by nepotistically favoring full-sister over half-sister queens during the queen rearing and elimination process. Most studies have focused on interactions between workers and immature queens (eggs and larvae) or adult queens who have exited their <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> However, adult <b>queens</b> often remain in their <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> for up to 1 week after emerging from their pupa. In this situation, workers prevent the queens from emerging, feed them, and protect them from other emerged queens. This stage in queen rearing is therefore one in which nepotism could occur. The current study is the first to investigate the kinship between workers and adult queens who have not emerged from their <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> We observed the full suite of behaviors expected during this phase of colony reproduction. Although there was no evidence for nepotism in the worker [...] queen interactions, there was a nonrandom distribution across patrilines of the workers interacting with the <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, in one colony we found differential treatment of fostered (nonkin) -queen cells.

5000|$|Stage 2: Before sliding {{the floor}} in place, inspect the top brood box and {{determine}} {{there is at least}} one frame with new unhatched eggs. Multiple frames with new eggs will often result in multiple frames with <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cloake {{method of}} queen rearing {{involves}} {{a series of}} stages which divide a colony into a queenright lower colony and a queenless upper colony to improve acceptance of grafted larva, or to facilitate creation of <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> naturally.|$|R
