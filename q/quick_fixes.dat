25|$|The {{energy crisis}} led to greater {{interest}} in renewable energy, nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels. According to Peter Grossman, American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive <b>quick</b> <b>fixes</b> and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. He wrote that instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{criticism}} that federal energy policies since the 1973 oil crisis have {{been dominated by}} crisis-mentality thinking, promoting expensive <b>quick</b> <b>fixes</b> and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities. Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for American entrepreneurship and innovation, congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient, but whose prospects are doubtful, without adequate consideration of the dollar costs, environmental costs, or national security costs of their actions.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{a series}} of <b>quick</b> <b>fixes</b> {{followed}} to ensure that American forces would not be caught completely off guard {{in the event of}} war. More important was the sensitivity with which American officials now treated the nervousness of their European counterparts; the Americans now became more willing to take steps to boost morale in Europe and ease the now-widespread anxieties there. The coup and the Berlin Blockade that June made clear that constant reassurance was needed to bind the Europeans to the U.S. system; hence, the remobilization of U.S. armed forces began.|$|E

25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting hard resets of the servers and applying <b>quick</b> <b>fixes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The G8 {{summit is}} an {{international}} event which is observed and reported by news media, but the G8's continuing relevance after more than 30 years is somewhat unclear. More than one analyst suggests that a G-8 summit {{is not the place}} to flesh out the details of any difficult or controversial policy issue in the context of a three-day event. Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues. The G8 summit brings leaders together [...] "not so they can dream up <b>quick</b> <b>fixes,</b> but to talk and think about them together." ...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{integrated}} development environments {{make recommendations}} and automate common tasks, such as refactorings, auto-completions, and error corrections. However, these tools present {{little or no}} information {{about the consequences of}} the recommended changes. For example, a rename refactoring may: modify the source code without changing program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) change program semantics; modify the source code and (incorrectly) create compilation errors; show a name collision warning and require developer input; or show an error and not change the source code. Having to compute the consequences of a recommendation — either mentally or by making source code changes — puts an extra burden on the developers. This paper aims to reduce this burden with a technique that informs developers of the consequences of code transformations. Using Eclipse <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> as a domain, we describe a plug-in, <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> Scout, that computes the consequences of <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> recommendations. In our experiments, developers completed compilation-error removal tasks 10 % faster when using <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix</b> Scout than <b>Quick</b> <b>Fix,</b> although the sample size was not large enough to show statistical significance.

2500|$|Plants used {{to treat}} snakebites in Trinidad and Tobago are made into tinctures with alcohol or olive oil and kept in rum flasks called 'snake bottles'. Snake bottles contain several {{different}} plants and/or insects. The plants used include the vine called monkey ladder (Bauhinia cumanensis or Bauhinia excisa, Fabaceae) which is pounded {{and put on the}} bite. Alternatively a tincture is made with a piece of the vine and kept in a snake bottle. [...] Other plants used include: mat root (Aristolochia rugosa), cat's claw (Pithecellobim unguis-cati), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), snake bush (Barleria lupulina), obie seed (Cola nitida), and wild gri gri root (Acrocomia aculeata). Some snake bottles also contain the caterpillars (Battus polydamas, Papilionidae) that eat tree leaves (Aristolochia trilobata). Emergency snake medicines are obtained by chewing a three-inch piece of the root of bois canôt (Cecropia peltata) and administering this chewed-root solution to the bitten subject (usually a hunting dog). This is a common native plant of Latin America and the Caribbean which makes it appropriate as an emergency remedy. Another native plant used is mardi gras (Renealmia alpinia)(berries), which are crushed together with the juice of wild cane (Costus scaber) and given to the bitten. <b>Quick</b> <b>fixes</b> have included applying chewed tobacco from cigarettes, cigars or pipes. Making cuts around the puncture or sucking out the venom had been thought helpful in the past, but this course of treatment is now strongly discouraged, due to the risk of self-envenomation through knife cuts or cuts in the mouth (suction cups from snake bite kits can be used, but suctioning seldom provides any measurable benefit).|$|E

40|$|Continual {{improvement}} {{is central to}} all organizational frameworks such as the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL). Typically, data are collected through the lifecycle of a business process and analyzed asynchronously to identify long-term improvements. This position paper illustrates a limitation of this approach of continual improvement. When a support process is spawned to address a customer issue, quite often, a <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> is provided to minimize the immediate annoyance to the customer. However, the <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> often provides a lower quality solution than the service the customer regularly enjoys. For customers who fall into {{the gap between the}} quality of service they have come to rely on, the repair process and the <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> may be a wholly unsatisfactory experience. As a result, even if the service provided by the main business process is improved on a long-term basis through the continual improvement mechanism, customers may still be unsatisfied. We believe that the continual improvement process should address the life cycle and level of service of the combination formed by the main support process and the <b>quick</b> <b>fix.</b> ...|$|R
