Being wooden, lapstrake boats, they were sturdy, but unable to withstand the neglect inherent in ownership by a rather nomadic, casual student sailing club. During my prep school days I had enjoyed considerable summer success sailing scows in Wisconsin, and so when I appeared on the New Haven scene in September 1949, I immediately joined the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, hoping {{to be able to}} represent the University in sailing competition. In the years immediately prior to 1949, the YCYC had done extremely well in InterCollegiate competition, and I was eager to join the team. Easily done, as it turned out, because the sailing stars, especially Dick Carter, had graduated, and after their exodus I {{was one of the few}} YCYC members that had any racing experience whatsoever. As I recall, David Toy, a California Snipe sailor and I, both Class of '53, were about the only YCYC members who had much of any racing experience as skippers. And both David and I, sloop racers, learned quickly that sailing without a jib was very, very different than sailing a balanced boat. We were rotten, just rotten.The four Dyers were kept in Milford, upside down on the beach, with the sails and other paraphernalia in a shed at the edge of the Milford Yacht Club property. Since the YCYC had no University support, the operation was shoestring, to say the least. The Dyers were intended only for practice, and all competitions were staged at the magnificent facilities of Harvard/MIT (shared on the Charles River), Brown, the Coast Guard Academy, Kings Point and the Naval Academy in Annapolis, the latter a really significant drive pre-Interstate system.Fiberglass was brand new, then, and MIT had designed in fiberglass a new [...] "Tech Dinghy", built by the Beetle Boat Company of New Bedford to withstand the rigors of college neglect, rather than built for speed. When I became Commodore in my sophomore year, I embarked on a program to raise money to replace our four tired wooden Dyers. Each hull cost $569.00, delivered, sans sails (down from a list of $660.00 - <b>quantity</b> <b>discount).</b> Sails were ordered out of the new synthetic material called Orlon, 3 1/2 oz, for $72.00 each, including racing numbers, battens and bag from Ratsey & Lapthorn of City Island, NYC. I did not turn out to be a very effective fund raiser, but I managed to amass funds for one boat, prevail on Harry Anderson to donate the second and, con my Dad to (unconsciously) donate the other two. In the spring of 1953, with our four new boats, we moved from the kind hospitality of the Milford Yacht Club to the Branford Yacht Club facilities, an easier venue to get to from campus. As a thank you to Milford, we gave the tired Dyers to Milford for use as rowing tenders for their members.|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a large customer-level database {{and use it}} to study electricity pricing patterns from 1963 to 2000. The data show tremendous cross-sectional dispersion in the electricity prices paid by manufacturing plants, reflecting spatial price differences and <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts.</b> Price dispersion declined sharply between 1967 and 1977 because of erosion in <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts.</b> To estimate the role of cost factors and markups in <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts,</b> we exploit differences among utilities in the purchases distribution of their customers.

Prior to the mid 1970 s, marginal price and marginal cost schedules with respect to annual purchase quantity are remarkably similar, in line with efficient pricing. In later years, marginal supply costs exceed marginal prices for smaller manufacturing customers by 10 % or more.

In this study, we establish a robust conjecture as a stronger statement than Khouja’s findings with regard to the general relationship among the expected profits of newsvendor models {{in the sense that the}} con-jecture holds for every order quantity as well as the optimal order quantity. The conjecture encourages the newsvendor facing <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts</b> to safely implement her own discounts policy to customer or accept <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts</b> offered by the supplier even if the optimal order quantity cannot be ordered due to additional restrictions such as budget or warehouse capacity constraints because the newsvendor models with <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts</b> always yield higher expected profit than the classic newsvendor model without <b>quantity</b> <b>discounts</b> regardless of the order quantity.

40|$|Coordinating {{activities}} {{among members}} in {{a supply chain}} has been a subject of great attention {{in the past two}} decades. Among various methods of coordination, <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> has been suggested in a number of studies as a mechanism to achieve incentive-compatible coordination between a supplier and his buyer, which does not require coercive measures to enforce cooperative behavior of a channel partner. Two separate streams of <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> models have been developed in the literature. The operations management literature views <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> as a way to minimize the system-wide cost of operation. The marketing literature employs <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> to induce the buyer to lower the retail price in order to increase demand. In both models, the supply chain members ’ profit goals are aligned with the total system’s profit, and the resulting coordination creates efficiency gains that can be shared between the members. This paper presents a model of <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> that combines these two sources of efficiency gains. We briefly review the existing approaches, and then develop a combined model of <b>quantity</b> <b>discount</b> that also includes a third-party logistics partner.
