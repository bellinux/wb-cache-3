25|$|Thomson {{did more}} than any other {{electrician}} up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of William Snow Harris were in accordance with the laws of Coulomb. In the Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring electrometer, based on the old electroscope of Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the <b>quadrant</b> <b>electrometer,</b> which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the current balance, also known as the Kelvin balance or Ampere balance (SiC), for the precise specification of the ampere, the standard unit of electric current. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer Magnus Maclean FRSE in his electrical experiments.|$|E
2500|$|Francis Ronalds, {{the inaugural}} Director of the Kew Observatory, made {{important}} {{improvements to the}} Coulomb torsion balance around 1844 and the modified instrument was sold by London instrument-makers. [...] Ronalds used a thin suspended needle rather than the gum lac bar and replaced the carrier rod with a fixed piece in {{the plane of the}} needle. [...] Both were metal, as was the suspending line and its surrounding tube, so that the needle and the fixed piece could be charged directly through wire connections. Ronalds also employed a Faraday cage and trialled photography to record the readings continuously. [...] It was the forerunner of Kelvin’s <b>quadrant</b> <b>electrometer</b> (described below).|$|E
50|$|Hallwachs was a {{known as}} a builder of {{scientific}} instruments. Among the devices he invented are the <b>electrometer</b> <b>quadrant</b> and a double refractometer of great precision. Hallwachs was an assistant of Heinrich Hertz, in 1886, before the photoelectric effect was discovered. Hallwachs and Hertz, in 1887, carried on the investigations of electromagnetic waves. In 1888 Hallwachs formulated the hypothesis that a conductive plate on which to focus ultraviolet light carries a positive charge because the electrons are gouged out. Interestingly this happened with more intensity in selenium. The phenomenon {{was seen in the}} same year by A. Righi. The phenomenon was called 'Hallwachs-Effekt', now called the photoelectric effect. The investigation of the photoelectric effect laid the foundation {{for the development of the}} photoelectric cell, photo electricity and Albert Einstein's quantum light hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|In 1853, Sir William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{predicted}} as a resultof mathematical calculations {{the oscillatory}} {{nature of the}} electric discharge of a condenser circuit. To Henry, however, belongs the credit of discerning {{as a result of}} his experiments in 1842 the oscillatory nature of the Leyden jar discharge. He wrote: The phenomena require us to admit the existence of a principal discharge in one direction, and then several reflex actions backward and forward, each more feeble than the preceding, until the equilibrium is obtained. These oscillations were subsequently observed by B. W. Feddersen (1857) who using a rotating concave mirror projected an image of the electric spark upon a sensitive plate, thereby obtaining a photograph of the spark which plainly indicated the alternating nature of the discharge. Sir William Thomson was also the discoverer of the electric convection of heat (the [...] "Thomson" [...] effect). He designed for electrical measurements of precision his <b>quadrant</b> and absolute <b>electrometers.</b> The reflecting galvanometer and siphon recorder, as applied to submarine cable signaling, are also due to him.|$|R
2500|$|Electricity {{readings}} may {{be recorded}} continuously with a device {{known as an}} electrograph. [...] Francis Ronalds created an early electrograph around 1814 in which the changing electricity made a pattern in a rotating resin-coated plate. [...] It was employed at Kew Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1840s to create records of variations in atmospheric electricity. In 1845, Ronalds invented photographic means of registering the atmospheric electricity. [...] The photosensitive surface was pulled slowly past of the aperture diaphragm of the camera box, which also housed an electrometer, and captured ongoing movements of the electrometer indices as a trace. [...] Kelvin used similar photographic means for his <b>quadrant</b> <b>electrometer</b> (see above) in the 1860s.|$|E

50|$|An early ionometer {{is due to}} the Swiss {{physicist}} Heinrich Greinacher in 1913. However, Greinacher was not {{the first}} to build an ionometer, he credits one Bronson with building an instrument upon which Greinacher's was an improvement.

40|$|In {{order to}} insure a {{perfectly}} clean surface of mercury for test, the apparatus was arranged so that carefully purified mercury flowed intermittently into a shallow iron cup and out through an overflow {{opening at the}} surface back into an electrically heated still. Direct observation showed that with such a flow the surface cleans itself of any added contamination very quickly. Also, {{the results for the}} wave-length limit were found to be independent of the rate of flow, to a rate far below that normally used, and also unaffected by the presence of gases (air, H 2, O 2, He and CO 2) and even of traces of water vapor in the photochamber. The photo-currents to a copper oxide receiver were measured by means of a <b>quadrant</b> <b>electrometer</b> to within about 1 percent for various Hg lines from a Cooper-Hewitt quartz mercury arc, correction being made for stray light by means of intermediate readings. This arc operated at 92 - 93 volts with 2. 1 amp., was constant to 1 percent. Intensity measurements accurate to 1 percent were made by means of a vacuum thermopile connected to a d'Arsonval galvanometer (sensitivity 10 (- 9) amp.) using a Hilger monochromator to disperse the light and making correction for stray light by taking readings between the lines. Plots of the ratio of corrected photo-current to corrected light intensity as a function of wave-length give the threshold at 2735 A. The corresponding photo-electric work function is 4. 52 volts. This result is free from the objections raised to those of previous observers and seems clearly to be the evaluation of an intrinsic property of mercury uncontaminated by surface impurities...|$|E
