25|$|The use of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> {{also called}} {{inverted}} commas or speech marks, {{is complicated by}} the fact that there are two kinds: single <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (') and double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> ("). British usage, at one stage in the recent past, preferred single <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> for ordinary use, but double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are again now increasingly common; American usage has always preferred double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> as does Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand English. It is the practice to alternate the type of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> used where there is a quotation within a quotation.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} {{rebalancing}} unclosed <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> or even adding <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> to unquoted parameters on parameters to CSS font-family.|$|E
25|$|The {{convention}} used to be, and in American English still is, to put full stops (periods) and commas {{inside the}} <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> {{irrespective of the}} sense. British English has moved away from this style while American English has kept it. British style now prefers to punctuate according to the sense, in which punctuation marks only appear inside <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> if they were there in the original. Formal British English practice requires a full stop to be put inside the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> if the quoted item is a full sentence that ends where the main sentence ends, but {{it is common to}} see the stop outside the ending <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There is {{generally}} no space between an opening <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> {{and the following}} word, or a closing <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> and the preceding word. When a double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> or a single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility may suggest that a thin space (...) or larger non-breaking space (...) be inserted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{straight}} double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> [...] is {{from the}} typewriter era, {{when there were no}} resources to type the curved <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> (”); ...|$|R

25|$|PowerShell accepts strings, both raw and escaped. A string {{enclosed}} between single <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> is a raw string while {{a string}} enclosed between double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> is an escaped string. PowerShell treats straight and curly quotes as equivalent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> {{may be used}} (though {{should not}} be overused) to express ironic or other {{emotional}} overtones. <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> can be used around the titles of books, works, articles etc. – in this case, suffixes can be connected with a hyphen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> {{show the}} {{greatest}} variety of any punctuation. The use of Esperanto <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> was never stated in Zamenhof's work; {{it was assumed}} that a printer would use whatever he had available (usually the national standard of the printer's country). —Dashes, «guillemets» (often »reversed«), “double apostrophes” (also often „reversed“), and more are all found. Since the age of word processing, however, the standard English <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> have become most widespread. Quotations may be introduced with either a comma or colon.|$|E
50|$|To {{include a}} double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> in a string, precede {{it with a}} {{backslash}} or enclose the string in single quotes. To include a single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark,</b> precede it with a backslash or enclose the string in double quotes.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{languages}} either allow or mandate the use {{of single}} quotations instead of double quotations (the string must begin and end {{with the same kind}} of <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> and the type of <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> may give slightly different semantics): ...|$|R
50|$|British English often {{uses the}} single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> where American English {{would use the}} double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b> Thus American style treats the double as the root or default, and {{alternates}} to single when nesting, whereas British style often does the reverse.|$|R
25|$|<b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> {{are placed}} below at the {{beginning}} and above at the ending of a quotation, both signs turning left, being curly and double. If another quotation is included in a quotation, angle <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (guillemets) are used, directed towards each other with their tips: („quote1 »quote2« quote1”).|$|E

25|$|Quoted text is {{surrounded}} by un-spaced guillemets (angle-quotes), or lower and upper <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shift key: {{when one}} presses shift and a letter, it will {{capitalize}} the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than {{appear to be}} available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> on the top. If one wants to type the <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed.|$|R
50|$|The closing single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is {{identical}} or similar in {{form to the}} apostrophe and similar to the prime symbol. However, these three characters have quite different purposes. The double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is similar to—and often used to represent—the ditto mark and the double prime symbol.|$|R
5000|$|When quoted text is interrupted, such as {{with the}} phrase he said, a closing <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is used before the interruption, and an opening <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> after. Commas are also often used {{before and after the}} interruption, more often for {{quotations}} of speech than for quotations of text: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{similarity}} between the dakuten and <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (") is not a problem, as written Japanese uses corner brackets (「」).|$|E
25|$|The {{apostrophe}} represents sounds {{resembling the}} glottal {{stop in the}} Turkic languages and in some romanizations of Semitic languages, including Arabic. In typography, this function may be performed by the closing single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b> In that case, the Arabic letter ‘ayn (ع) is correspondingly transliterated with the opening single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|R
50|$|The closing single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is {{identical}} or similar in form (depending on the font) to the apostrophe and {{similar to the}} prime symbol. The double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> {{is identical}} to the ditto mark and similar to—and often used to represent—the double prime symbol. However, all of these three characters have quite different purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} standard symbols {{for these}} schemes for transliterating [...] and [...] is by Modifier letter apostrophe &lang;ʼ&rang; and Modifier letter turned comma &lang;ʻ&rang;, respectively. However, {{there is a}} common practice to instead use Right single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> &lang;’&rang; and Left single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> &lang;‘&rang;, respectively. The glottal stop (...) in these romanizations isn't written word-initially.|$|R
25|$|Arabic {{punctuation}} marks {{can be used}} with Xiao'erjing as can Chinese {{punctuation marks}}, they can also be mixed (Chinese pauses and periods with Arabic commas and <b>quotation</b> <b>marks).</b>|$|E
25|$|If the {{quotation}} is organically interwoven into one’s own text, the quoted part is marked with <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> and common words beginning {{the quotation}} {{are written in}} lowercase (even despite the original). For example: A tanterv szerint az iskola egyik célja, hogy „testileg, szellemileg egészséges nemzedéket neveljen”. ‘According to the syllabus, {{one of the goals}} of a school is “to bring up a generation healthy in body and mind.”’ When quoting others’ words in terms of their content, the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are not used: Alkotmányunk kimondja, hogy társadalmi rendszerünknek a munka az alapja. ‘Our constitution states that our social system is based on work.’ Indirect (reported) speech is treated in the same way.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} table {{shows some}} of the various Middle English pronouns, together with their modern (in <b>quotation</b> <b>marks)</b> and (sometimes) Old English equivalents. Many other variations are noted in Middle English sources because of differences in spellings and pronunciations at different times and in different dialects.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a {{situation}} that demands contextual kerning in the Minion Pro font is the sequence of three characters f.&rdquo; (f, period, <b>quotation</b> <b>mark),</b> as is often found {{at the end of}} a quotation. Using the font's kerning tables, the <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is too close to the f, although without the period between them their spacing is adequate. The period, in other words, reduces their spacing instead of increasing it. The explanation is this: Without the period, their kerning is a positive 121 (expressed as 1000 units/em). The period's width is 228, but the kerning between f and the period is &minus;5, and between the period and the <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> &minus;138. The total is a positive 85, as opposed to the original 121: a net loss of 36 units, which explains why the <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is now closer to the f. Contextual kerning would recognize the sequence of three characters, and would increase one or both inter-character spaces. A similar problem exists with the letters F, P, T, V, W, and Y; with comma rather than period; or with single rather than double <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the Dutch language, {{the word}} '''''' (...) is a {{contraction}} {{of the article}} [...] "het", meaning [...] "the". 't can be found as a tussenvoegsel, a word that is positioned between a person's first and last name. Careful writers should use a right <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> (unicode 2019) {{in front of the}} t and not confuse it with a left <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> (unicode 2018).|$|R
25|$|This {{is a list}} of hobbits {{that are}} {{mentioned}} by name in Tolkien's works. They are ordered alphabetically by first name. In cases where a hobbit’s family name was changed, usually through marriage, their original family name is given in parentheses. Nicknames are given in <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Contemporary Gujarati uses European punctuation, {{such as the}} {{question}} mark, exclamation mark, comma, and full stop. Apostrophes are used for the rarely written clitic. <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are not as often used for direct quotes. The full stop replaced the traditional vertical bar, and the colon, mostly obsolete in its Sanskritic capacity (see below), follows the European usage.|$|E
25|$|Death {{appears in}} every novel except The Wee Free Men and Snuff, {{although}} sometimes {{with only a}} few lines. As dictated by tradition, he is a seven-foot-tall skeleton in a black robe who sits astride a pale horse (called Binky). His dialogue is always depicted in , and without <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> as several characters state that Death's voice seems to arrive in their heads without actually passing through their ears as sound.|$|E
