5000|$|Heinrich Lohse is {{a manager}} at the [...] "Deutsche Röhren AG" [...] who {{increasingly}} tends to lose control. After ordering a 40-year supply of typewriting paper and erasers (because of <b>quantity</b> <b>rebate),</b> his boss forces him to retire. Confronted with this new situation, Lohse's family reacts in shock. It turns out Heinrich's wife Renate and his son Dieter were quite comfortable with the absent husband and father and don't {{want to see their}} situation disrupted. Heinrich, however, refuses to allow his career to end and immediately begins to rearrange the Lohse household based on his questionable managerial skills. This leads to a steadily increasing series of conflicts with his wife, son, and friends that get more and more bizarre. Starting out with buying a ridiculous amount of mustard to get discount, Heinrich finally invites a film crew to shoot a TV series in the Lohse household in order to impress his wife. The more he tries, however, the worse it gets, and Renate seriously questions her marriage.In the end, both visit the birthday party of Renate's mother which brings to light conflicts of other family members that seem even more dramatic than those of Heinrich and Renate. In realising this, both accept their new situation and try to find together again as a couple. The last shot shows Heinrich and Renate playing a flute concert in their living room in front of their son Dieter and Frau Kleinert, their housecleaner.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} exclusionary {{properties}} of nonlinear price-quantity schedules in an Aghion-Bolton style model with elastic demand and product differentiation. We distinguish three regimes {{depending on whether}} and how {{the price of the}} incumbent good is linked to the quantity purchased from the rival firm. We find that the supply of rival good is distorted downwards. Moreover, given the quantity supplied from the rival, the buyer may opportunistically purchase inefficiently many units from the incumbent to pocket <b>quantity</b> <b>rebates.</b> We show that the possibility for the buyer to dispose of unconsumed units attenuates the opportunism problem and limits the exclusionary effects of nonlinear pricing...|$|R

For the recently introduced music downloads, reference prices are still developing and to find a revenue maximizing pricing scheme is a challenging task. The most commonly used approach is to employ linear pricing (e. g., iTunes, musicload). Lately, subscription models have emerged, offering their customers unlimited access to streaming music for a monthly fee (e. g., Napster, RealNetworks). However, other pricing strategies could also be used, such as <b>quantity</b> <b>rebates</b> starting at certain download volumes. Research {{has been done in}} this field and Buxmann et al. (2005) have shown that price cuts can improve revenue. In this paper we apply different approaches to estimate consumer’s willingness to pay (WTP) for music downloads and compare our findings with the pricing strategies currently used in the market. To make informed decisions about pricing, knowledge about the consumer’s WTP is essential. Three approaches based on adaptive conjoint analysis to estimate the WTP for bundles of music downloads are compared. Two of the approaches are based on a status-quo product (at market price and alternatively at an individually self-stated price), the third approach uses a linear model assuming a fixed utility per title. All three methods seem to be robust and deliver reasonable estimations of the respondent’s WTPs. However, all but the linear model need an externally set price for the status-quo product which can introduce a bias. ...|$|R
40|$|A supply contract, which {{achieves}} {{the optimal}} {{performance for the}} buyer or the supply chain as a whole, does not necessarily maximize the supplier’s expected profit. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the impacts of supply contracts and their differences from a supplier’s perspective, which is the aim of this thesis. This thesis considers six types of supply contracts, namely, Returns Policy, <b>Quantity</b> Discount, Channel <b>Rebate,</b> Backup Agreement, <b>Quantity</b> Flexibility, and Quantity Commitment, in a supply chain of seasonal goods with a single selling season with a retailer and a supplier. Each contract is modelled in the framework of the interaction between the retailer’s and the supplier’s decisions. The contract parameters are optimized to maximise the supplier’s expected profit with consideration of retailer’s acceptance. Furthermore, the impacts of the demand pattern and cost structure on the performance of each contract are investigated. These contracts are then compared with each other and the best contracts are identified for various situations. In order to facilitate the supply contract selection in practice, a rule-based decision support system has been developed using Visual Basic, for user interfaces and MATLAB for the optimization engine. The rule base embodies the outcome of the comparison of supply contracts, and therefore is able to direct the system to select the best supply contract for a particular situation.
