40|$|An {{analytical}} method {{was developed for}} the accurate determination of benzoic acid in commercial <b>quasi-drug</b> drinks using isotope dilution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ID-LC/MS). Sample drinks were spiked with 13 C 6 -benzoic acid and these mixtures were cleaned by a nylon membrane filter. The sample mixtures were then analyzed using LC/Tandem MS in the negative ion mode without further clean-up or extraction steps. For the chromatographic separation, a C 18 column with isocratic mobile phase of 50 : 50 (v/v) ammonium acetate buffer at pH 4. 5 and methanol mixture was used. MS was operated with electrospray ionization in the negative mode. Benzoic acid and its isotope analogue were detected by selectively monitoring the collisionally-induced dissociation channels of [M-H] − → [M-CO 2 H] − at m/z 121 → 77 and m/z 127 → 83, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility studies showed that the ID-LC/MS/MS method is a reliable and reproducible method which can provide less than 0. 3 % of relative standard deviation (RSTD) of method precision for analysis of benzoic acid.

40|$|Abstract: Excess {{production}} of melanin or its abnormal distribution, or both, can cause irregular hyperpigmentation of the skin, leading to melasma and age spots. To date, various <b>quasi-drugs</b> that prevent or improve hyperpigmentary disorders {{have been developed}} and officially approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan. Many of these inhibit the activity of tyrosinase, an enzyme required for melanin synthesis, for example, by competitive or non-competitive inhibition of its catalytic activity, by inhibiting its maturation, or by accelerating its degradation. In this review, we categorize the <b>quasi-drugs</b> developed in Japan to prevent or treat hyperpigmentary disorders, or both, and discuss perspectives for future development...|$|R
40|$|Many active {{cosmetic}} ingredients formulated as medicated whitening products (<b>quasi-drugs)</b> {{achieve their}} effect through inhibition of tyrosinase activity, but no products can achieve this effect through degradation of intramelanosomal tyrosinase. Melanin is synthesized by tyrosinase, which is localized to the membrane of melanosomes in melanocytes. It {{has been reported}} that the optimal pH of tyrosinase activity is nearly neutral and decreases under acidic conditions. The environment in melanosomes that tyrosinase acts on has attracted attention from researchers. We found that tyrosinase was degraded by acidification of melanosomes, thereby decreasing its activity. We found that both inhibitors of aspartic protease and cysteine protease decreased the degradation of tyrosinase. It is thought that aspartic protease and cysteine protease are participating in the degradation of tyrosinase in acid melanosome. Melanosomal pH is regulated by Na+/H+ exchangers and V-ATPase. We investigated the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of melanin production of propylparaben using B 16 melanoma cells. The expression level of mRNA of tyrosinase and related proteins (Trp- 1 and Dct) was not affected by propylparaben; however, the protein levels in melanosomes decreased. We investigated the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of propylparaben on melanin production using B 16 melanoma cells. The effects of propylparaben on the mRNA expression of Na+/H+ exchangers and Na+/Ca 2 + exchangers, as well as the melanosome pH levels were examined. Propylparaben decreased gene expression in both exchangers. It was confirmed that propylparaben decreased melanosomal pH by staining using an intracellular pH indicator. The results suggest that propylparaben down-regulated melanin production through acidification of melanosomes...|$|R
