Hanson, helping in the posthumous publication of several volumes. While at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Toulmin published Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts (1972), which examines the causes and the processes of conceptual change. In this book, Toulmin uses a novel comparison between conceptual change and Charles Darwin's model of biological evolution to analyse the process of conceptual change as an evolutionary process. The book confronts major philosophical questions as well. In 1973, while {{a professor in the}} Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, he collaborated with Allan Janik, a philosophy professor at La Salle University, on the book Wittgenstein's Vienna, which advanced a thesis that underscores the significance of history to human reasoning: Contrary to philosophers who believe the absolute truth advocated in Plato's idealized formal logic, Toulmin argues that truth can be a relative <b>quality,</b> <b>dependent</b> on historical and cultural contexts (what other authors have termed [...] "conceptual schemata").|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} an approach for the <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> reconstruction of building façades using 3 D point clouds from mobile terrestrial laser scanning. Due to different look angles, such measurements frequently suffer from different point densities at the respective building façades. In {{order to support}} the interpretation at areas, where no or only limited LiDAR measurements are available, a <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> processing is implemented. First, façades are reconstructed at areas of sufficient LiDAR point availability. Based on this reconstruction, rules are derived automatically, which together with the respective façade elements constitute a so-called façade grammar. It holds all the information which is necessary to reconstruct façades {{in the style of}} the given building. In our <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> approach, this grammar is used as knowledge base for the verification of a façade model reconstructed at areas of limited sensor data quality. Additionally, it is applied for the generation of synthetic façades where no LiDAR measurement is available...|$|E

Reinforced fibers which are abrasive in nature {{make it hard}} to machine by the traditional machining. Dissipation of heat into workpiece which in turn results in enhanced cutting tool wear and damage to the workpiece is the common problems faced in traditional machining of FRP’s.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an approach for the <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> reconstruction of building facades using 3 D point clouds from mobile terrestrial laser scanning and coarse building models.

In {{order to support}} the automatic generation of facade structure in regions where no or only limited LiDAR measurements are available, a <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> processing is implemented. For this purpose, facades are reconstructed at areas of sufficient LiDAR point densities in a first processing step.

This grammar holds {{all the information that}} is necessary to reconstruct facades {{in the style of the}} given building. Thus, it can be used as knowledge base in order to improve and complete facade reconstructions at areas of limited sensor data.

40|$|A liquid-gel {{transition}} measured for a polymerically stabilized dispersion as {{a function}} of solvent quality and particle volume fraction is compared with theoretical predictions of phase behavior. The experimental liquid-gel transition is interpreted from rheological measurements of 360 nm polystyrene (PS) particles with adsorbed F 108 Pluronic (PEO-PPO-PEO) layers in aqueous 0. 5 M NaCl {{as a function}} of temperature, which controls solvent quality for the adsorbed Pluronic. The measured liquid-gel transition occurs at temperatures when attractive interactions are not expected to occur from either core PS particle van der Waals forces or Pluronic mixing interactions. To consider an alternative temperature dependent attraction, an adhesive sphere (AS) phase diagram is constructed using a theoretical potential that includes the solvent <b>quality</b> <b>dependent</b> continuum van der Waals attraction due to the nonuniform dielectric properties of the adsorbed Pluronic. An impressive correspondence is found between the experimental liquid-gel transition and the theoretical AS percolation threshold with no adjustable parameters using the nonuniform film model.

[...] By 2004, he had developed his views on the topic, referring to reductions in manufacturing in the United States, outsourcing to India and China, excess of supply and the global marketplace, all leading to the increasing conceptualization of economic output.In his book A Whole New Mind, Daniel H.
