40|$|For this thesis, I {{examined}} the effects of the re-introduction of fluctuating surface water levels in freshwater wetlands. These systems, and especially the rich fen wetlands that I focused on, often consist of a mosaic of aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial vegetation types, including many biodiverse communities with high numbers of endangered species. Rich fens are protected under the European Habitat Directive (transition mires and <b>quaking</b> <b>bogs,</b> type H 7140), and are characteristic for well-buffered (with respect to acidity) and nutrient-poor conditions. Next to overall eutrophication, high NH 4 -concentrations may specifically be toxic to bryophytes and vascular plants in rich fens. For the preservation and restoration of rich fens, it is therefore important to prevent acidification, eutrophication and toxicity. As a general conclusion, I have been able to unravel the differential effects of water table fluctuation in rich fens in relation to surface water quality, peat quality and season, by the combination of correlative field research, large-scale and smaller scale field manipulation experiments, climate room and peat incubation experiments. In this way, this thesis not only contributes to more fundamental biogeochemical and ecological issues related to surface water level fluctuations, but can also be used for decision support in the hydrological management of rich fens...|$|R

The vegetation normally has intimate mixtures of species considered to be acidophile and others thought of as calciphile or basophile. In some cases the mire occupies a physically transitional location between bog and fen vegetation, as for example on the marginal lagg of raised bog or associated with certain valley and basin mires. In other cases these intermediate properties may reflect the actual process of succession, as peat accumulates in groundwater-fed fen or open water to produce rainwater-fed bog isolated from groundwater influence. Many of these systems are very unstable underfoot and can therefore also be described as 'quaking bogs'.Depressions on peat substrates of the Rhynchosporion described as:occurring in complex mosaics with lowland wet heath and valley mire vegetation, in transition mires, and {{on the margins of}} bog pools and hollows in both raised and blanket bogs. The vegetation is typically very open, usually characterised by an abundance of white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba, often with well-developed algal mats, the bog moss Sphagnum denticulatum, round-leaved sundew Drosera rotundifolia and, in relatively base-rich sites, brown mosses such as Drepanocladus revolvens and Scorpidium scorpioides. The nationally scarce species brown beak-sedge Rhynchospora fusca and marsh clubmoss Lycopodiella inundata also occur in this habitat.On lowland heaths in southern and eastern England this habitat occurs on humid, bare or recently exposed peat in three distinct situations:*in and around the edges of seasonal bog pools, particularly on patterned areas of valley mire,*in flushes on the edges of valley mires in heathlands, and*in areas that are artificially disturbed, such as along footpaths and trackways and in old peat-cuttings and abandoned ditches.|$|R
6000|$|But {{how does}} this theory explain the perfect purity of the coal? I think Sir C. Lyell answers that {{question}} fully in p. 383 of his [...] "Student's Elements of Geology." [...] He {{tells us that the}} dense growths of reeds and herbage which encompass the margins of forest-covered swamps in the valley and delta of the Mississippi, in passing through them, are filtered and made to clear themselves entirely before they reach the areas in which vegetable matter may accumulate for centuries, forming coal if the climate be favourable; and that in the cypress-swamps of that region no sediment mingles with the vegetable matter accumulated from the decay of trees and semi-aquatic plants; so that when, in a very dry season, the swamp is set on fire, pits are burnt into the ground many feet deep, or as far as the fire can go down without reaching water, and scarcely any earthy residuum is left; just as when the soil of the English fens catches fire, red-hot holes are eaten down through pure peat till the water-bearing clay below is reached. But the purity of the water in peaty lagoons is observable elsewhere than in the delta of the Mississippi. What can be more transparent than many a pool surrounded by <b>quaking</b> <b>bogs,</b> fringed, as they are in Ireland, with a ring of white water-lilies, which you dare not stoop to pick, lest the peat, bending inward, slide you down into that clear dark gulf some twenty feet in depth, bottomed and walled with yielding ooze, from which there is no escape? Most transparent, likewise, is the water of the West Indian swamps. Though it is of the colour of coffee, or rather of dark beer, and so impregnated with gases that it produces fever or cholera when drunk, yet it is--at least when it does not mingle with the salt water--so clear, that one might see every marking on a boa- constrictor or alligator, if he glided along the bottom under the canoe.|$|R

40|$|Manmade {{changes of}} landscapes {{and the loss}} of {{biodiversity}} through an on-going intensification of agricultural land use demand for the monitoring of natural habitats, vegetation types and their changes. EU Policies like the Flora-Fauna-Habitat (FFH) directive or the High Nature Value (HNV) farmland (EU rural policy framework) request the observation and conservation of natural vegetation with a reporting duty on the conservation status of these areas every six and four years. The FFH directive includes natural and semi-natural vegetation identified as Natura 2000 conservation areas and the HNV farmlands are areas in which the major land use is agriculture but also include a high species and habitat diversity or species of European conservation concern. In the context of this major demand of reporting, remote sensing has great advantages as basis for monitoring of vegetation types and habitats, as it is able to provide large-scale up-to-date geo-information for these monitoring and management activities. However, the monitoring of vegetation demands for data acquisitions at specific times during the growing season. SAR-based systems have the great advantage of acquiring data of the Earth surface within these crucial time frames weather and daytime independent. TerraSAR-X (TS-X) has the potential to acquire images with a high spatial resolution of less than 10 m {{and at the same time}} a high temporal resolution of 11 days repetition rate. In addition, textural information and the potential to analyse dielectric characteristics (e. g. moisture) enable the differentiation of various vegetation types and the deduction of biophysical characteristics. Within the project MSAVE, the applicability of temporally and geometrically high resolution data of optical, SAR and hyperspectral sensors for the monitoring of vegetation is evaluated and new methods for the analysis of multi-seasonal remote sensing data are developed, which are suited for the identification and quantification of habitats. The herein presented work as part of the project centres the evaluation of the differentiability of NATURA 2000 habitats and HNV grassland with TS-X time series data. Thereby, a TS-X time series consisting of 11 dual-pol (VV/VH) acquisitions in 2011 for the test area located in Southern Bavaria as well as reference data collected during several field surveys within the SAR data collection period are used for the classification of different grassland types, which include the FFH habitat types 6410 (Molinia meadows), 7120 (Degraded raised bogs still capable of natural regeneration), 7140 (Transition mires and <b>quaking</b> <b>bogs)</b> and 7230 (Alkaline fens), as well as HNV grassland. Up-to-now, the TS-X time series has been pre-processed including multi-temporal filtering and the Kennaugh decomposition developed by Schmitt, A. (2012) has been applied to the data. Furthermore, texture features were derived. After a separability analysis for defining the best suitable features for discriminating the different grassland types, the classification is performed with the Maximum-Entropy algorithm. First results show that the high temporal and geometric resolution time series of TS-X allows for a detailed analysis on the usability of polarimetric SAR data for the classification of different vegetation types. The distribution of FFH habitats and HNV grassland can be modelled by means of Kennaugh elements of cross-polar TS-X time series data. The discrimination of the different grassland types is further improved including texture features in the classification...|$|R
40|$|R. temporaria and R. arvalis are {{widespread}} species, {{and their}} sympatry zone extends for some 4000 kilometers from {{west to east}} and in the widest part along meridian 33 º east longitude about 2000 kilometers. The distinction in the physiology of hibernation {{and the nature of}} their winter shelters between R. temporaria and R. arvalis is principial. The common frog, as a kind of a potential water-hibernator, can remain in the terrestrial shelters where a local climate permits. Moor frog which is capable to cope with body freezing is a potential land hibernator, but certain situations make it spend winter under water. Both species can use bogs as wintering shelters. Strategy of R. temporaria spawning was formed in the conditions of small river basins not exposed to vast floods, with the accompanying streams-tributaries, inlets, flow-through lakes, oxbows, potholes, etc. Breeding behavior of frogs consists in forming a «mat» or «cushion» of the spawn clumps, which prevent their drifting towards deep water. In contrast, the «core» breeding habitat of R. arvalis is flat lowland areas with a non-static level of shallow water. Scattered oviposition of this frog significantly increases the chances of larvae to complete their development in isolated pools and ponds remaining after drying shallow water areas. The congestion of clutches can occur only at a high density of breeding specimens of the moor frog in some circumstances. In fact, this is only a reduction to the minimum the distance between males, but not a desire of animals to aggregate. In favorable conditions and living side by side, R. temporaria and R. arvalis have always some extent overlap of spawning habitats, and they can spawn close to each other. Common frog is a mobile and terrestrial species. Therefore it occupies the wide range of summer foraging habitats in the area having a certain landscape. Usually, this is a variety of forest habitats, scrubs and nearby meadow areas, rocky tundra, and marshy runoff beds covered with shrubbery or uneven scrub mires. Summer habitats of R. arvalis are primarily open or semi-open landscape faces, often soggy. In European mountains, R. temporaria is known to occur up to 2750 m above sea level, and in the south it does not come down to the lowlands. R. arvalis usually avoids areas located above 500 – 600 m, and they are rarely found at the height exceeding 900 m a. s. l. However, in the mountains of Southern Siberia populations of this species are common at altitudes up to 1800 m a. s. l., and the documented upper limit is 2400 m a. s. l. The causes of such differences in vertical distribution of the species are fundamental differences in the geomorphological properties of the landscape of mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. All european mountains (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Scandinavia and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula), including the Urals, are mostly folded structures that arose in the process of deformation (folds and thrust faults) of the Earth crust in its horizontal motions. A less important role play blocky and arched uplifts, which are expressed only in the relief of midlands and lowlands of Central Europe (Slate Mountains, Schwarzwald, Bohemian Massif, etc.), stretching between the Central European plain and the systems of the Alps and Western Carpathians. Mountain systems are linearly elongated, dissected by weakly developed river valleys, which are narrow and steep-sided. These mountains do not have any large horizontal troughs, and the width of sloping valleys is less than a few kilometers everywhere. The bottoms of the valleys are seldom flat over large areas. Midlands and lowlands have the character of erosion dissected plateaus with narrow canyons. In contrast to the mountain areas in Europe, in Siberia {{we have to deal with}} the compound such as single mountain zone countries (Altai, Sayany, Baikal, Aldan). In the formation of the belt which stretches almost 3. 500 kilometers arched and arched-block lifting plays the main role. In this case, the vast areas of the Earth crust experienced bending, followed by block division. Raised relict surfaces of alignment occupy areas on the flat hilly plains, uplands and tablelands, and form the bottom of the intermountain basins. Numerous valleys and hollows of South Siberian mountain belt sometimes so extensive, that separated highlands, ridges, river valleys with alluvium exist within them. Populations of R. temporaria in the European mountains are confined to the wooded valleys with rivers and streams running through them, to the shores of lakes in all altitudinal belts. In such circumstances, R. arvalis is deprived of its «core» landscape — flat marshy areas with stagnant water that impedes the penetration of this species to a mountainous terrain. In the mountains of Southern Siberia, uplifted hilly plains and plateaus are abundantly watered due to climatic conditions and water-physical properties of crumbly sediments. They are favorable for wide distribution of diverse bogs. Viable populations of R. arvalis inhabit all the altitudinal belts of mountain areas in Siberia where there are spacious and level surfaces: from waterlogged floodplains (Vitim river) to alpine tundra (Altai Mts.) The distribution of R. temporaria, the European species, everywhere in the area is associated with the landscapes, which are characterized by a pronounced micro- or mesorelief. The presence of small permanent and temporary streams and lakes with renewed water is necessary. Various small ponds usually present as well. General features of the relief does not permit significant overflows and floods of rivers and lake-river systems (areas affected by extensive flooding are avoided by the species categorically). Small marshes of eutrophic-mesotrophic series and the areas of wetlands are often present (in vast marshy terrains this frog does not occur). Spawning takes place in different riparian ponds, as well as in closed, relatively deep, temporary and permanent water bodies with similar hydrological regime, sometimes at a large distance from their hibernation sites. Obvious «outposts» of R. temporaria distribution are mountains. Of geographic range for some 15 thousand kilometers, if it is outlined on the extreme points of findings this species on the mainland, one half falls on the mountain massifs. As for the habitats of R. arvalis, the Europaean and Siberian species, a fundamentally different morphology of the landscape is inherent. This is a kind of flat and concave mesoforms and hydromorphic areas of the smooth relief with stagnant ponds. In any terrain, species demonstrates stronger preference for marshy landscape tracts, flooded areas of river valleys, reed <b>quaking</b> <b>bogs,</b> raw moorlands, and other wetlands. In different geographical conditions, such tract may be narrowed to the rim along the shores of lakes and rivers drying up in the steppe zone and in coastal meadows in northern Europe, or it dominates in the landscape either in Western Siberia or on the flat tundra in the North. In the landscape tracts inhabited by this species, tree or shrub vegetation rarely presents. The appearance of moor frogs in some «dry» forested habitats is probably caused by the presence of marshy areas nearby. Wintering, spawning and fattening of R. arvalis often occur in the same biotope and the year around. It is only where there is the interpenetration of «core» landscapes of each species (large areas of the northern and western parts of the East European Plain, and a part of the West Siberian Plain contiguous to the Urals), one can observe the examples of real sympatry of R. arvalis and R. temporaria...|$|R

On this are found cotton-grasses such as Eriophorum angustifolium and E. vaginatum, with marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). The distinct stable central areas of the island supports Scot’s pine (Pinus sylvestris) and a ground flora of ling (Calluna vulgaris) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix). A 2009 survey found lichen (Caloplaca luteoalba) on the birch.|$|E
