The matter of doubt within his own heart was this. Should he or should he not ask for more; and if he resolved on answering this question in the affirmative, should he ask for it now? He had determined that morning that he would come to some fixed purpose on this matter before he reached Harley Street. As he crossed out of Oxford Street from the omnibus he had determined that the present was no time for love-making;--walking up Regent Street, he had told himself that if he had one faithful heart to bear him company he could bear his troubles better;--as he made his way along the north side of Cavendish Square he pictured to himself what would be the wound to his pride if he were rejected;--and in passing the ten or twelve houses which intervened in Harley Street between the corner of the square and the abode of his mistress, he told himself that the <b>question</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> by circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{justifying}} not presuming innocence {{are generally}} {{incorporated into the}} Presumption of Innocence (PoI). A confusing discourse has resulted: numerous guilt-presuming acts are deemed consistent with the PoI. I argue for an unusually broad PoI: any act that might convey to a reasonable actor {{that he is not}} presumed innocent of a punishable offence constitutes a PoI interference. Thus, academic debate need only be about the question what PoI interferences are justifiable or unjustifiable. This <b>question</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> using pro- and anti-PoI values. I analyse three PoI interferences in relation to Duff’s retributivist punishment theory: presumptions of guilt, vicarious liability of car owners and coercing non-suspects into proving their sobriety. Retributivists tend to castigate such procedures based on their (supposed) consequentialist rationale. I argue, however, that they might also be justified on retributivist grounds. The retributivist anti-PoI duty to punish the guilty may be the worst enemy of innocents...|$|E

30|$|Can this, {{besides the}} {{introduction}} of monitoring instruments, {{be taken as a}} further indication of declining trust in the education system? Again with Lepsius, this <b>question</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>answered</b> in the affirmative. This is because the existing rules and procedures seem to be regarded as ineffective – otherwise there would be no need for restructuring: “Trust in institutions reaches its breaking-point when the rules and procedures that give structure and control to their actions are no longer deemed efficient” [82 : 288]. Hence, ongoing reforms can be interpreted as expressions of perceived inefficiency. They are constantly addressed by new measures, instruments and rules. However, there is a tendency for reforms to always call for further reforms [84], thereby fostering complexity. As a consequence, the initiated continuity of reforms makes it very difficult to follow up with communication that is inherent to the system. The result of this could be that the system’s very existence might even be called into question [85].|$|E

Existing calculations reveal that the gross features of the three-nucleon system can be explained by the non-local single nucleon exchange mechanism, and that so far only the binding energy of the triton and the doublet n-d scattering length can be shown to be sensitive to the detailed physical assumptions about the two-nucleon interaction used in the calculation. It is shown that the three-particle continuum state always contains a long-range non-local effect even when the interactions between pairs are strictly local and of finite range.
