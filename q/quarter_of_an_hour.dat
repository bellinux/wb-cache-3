5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who had missed his train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored twice in the last <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to take the game 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to his joining New York City FC, Villa was {{announced}} to {{have joined the}} Australian A-League with Melbourne City, following the team's association with Manchester City. Villa was on a guest stint, allowing him to make up to ten appearances for Melbourne City during the 2014–15 season, {{taking advantage of the}} scheduling of the A-League and MLS to maintain match fitness ahead of his debut with New York City. After only joining Melbourne City for pre-season training just over a week before their first game, Villa was brought on in the 48th minute of {{the first game of the}} season against Sydney FC, and scored a debut goal a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> into his appearance. On 19 October 2014, in his second match, Villa scored an 87th-minute equaliser against the Newcastle Jets for a 11 draw.|$|E
5|$|As a Premier League team, Manchester City {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round. Their opening match was an away draw at Leicester City. Following a supporter campaign, Manchester City dedicated the match to former striker Neil Young, who was terminally ill. Young scored the winning goal when Manchester City and Leicester City met in the 1969 FA Cup Final. Manchester City fell behind after 46 seconds when Sol Bamba scored for Leicester following a corner. Manchester City took the lead by half-time through James Milner and Carlos Tevez, but Andy King equalised midway through the second half to make the score 2–2. The tie was replayed at the City of Manchester Stadium the following week. Tevez gave Manchester City the lead after <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> but the lead was brief. Four minutes later, Paul Gallagher's penalty levelled the score, after Patrick Vieira had fouled Lloyd Dyer. Before half-time, two Manchester City goals in 90 seconds shifted {{the momentum of the}} match. In the second half, Tevez missed a penalty and a goal by Dyer made the score 3–2. Leicester then pushed for an equaliser, but instead Aleksandar Kolarov scored on a counter-attack to make the final score 4–2.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

25|$|On 16 August 1804, at {{coordinates}} , Blonde {{encountered the}} frigate HMS Loire. After a chase of 20 hours, including a running fight of a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{during which the}} British had one midshipman and five men wounded, and the French lost two men killed and five wounded, Blonde struck.

'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'.|$|E
25|$|Acheron {{fought on}} for another <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before she too struck. She had lost three or four men killed and eight wounded.

Hortense had 10 men killed out of her crew of 300 men and the 350 artillerymen she was carrying.|$|E

There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial.|$|E

He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E
25|$|On 16 August 1804 Loire gave chase to a suspicious-looking sail. After a chase of 20 hours, {{including}} a running fight of a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> {{during which the}} British had one midshipman and five men wounded, and the French lost two men killed and five wounded, the latter hauled down her colours. She proved to be French privateer Blonde, of Bordeaux, mounting 30 guns, eight-pounders on the main deck, with a crew of 240 men under François Aregnaudeau; the same ship that, about five months earlier, had captured the Wolverine. Loire took the prize in tow to Plymouth where the prisoners were disembarked on 31 August.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, India toured England, in {{the first}} home series since the Ashes defeat a number of {{experienced}} players were dropped. However, Evans remained and {{in the first}} Test of the summer he justified his selection with a run-a-ball innings of 73, which contained 12 boundaries. Norman Preston in Wisden described it as 'daring hitting' which 'reduced the hitherto keen Indian bowling to a thing of shreds and patches'. In the second Test at Lord's Evans missed four stumpings off Tommy Greenhough {{in the space of a}} <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> he otherwise kept well and didn't concede a bye in the match. Evans was dropped from the team for the next Test 'in the interests of team building', the reason given by the selectors. His England test cap number is 315.|$|E

25|$|With Wheater suspended, {{and both}} Taylor and Hoyte out injured, Middlesbrough had to field a patched-up back four for their home game versus Arsenal, with Tony McMahon {{returning}} to the starting line-up after a long time out with injuries, alongside Huth and Riggott, {{both of whom were}} returning from injury. There was also a start for Adam Johnson on the right hand side of midfield, as Alves was dropped to the bench. Emmanuel Adebayor put Arsenal into the lead after <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> but Aliadière got {{on the end of a}} wonderful cross from Tuncay to head home the equaliser twelve minutes later. The home side were then denied a penalty when Johnson was brought down in the box, but the referee didn't award anything. Both sides had further chances but the game ended 1–1.|$|E
25|$|As a cricketer, domesticity {{was just}} not in his line. He began his innings usually as one who, {{suffering}} from violent astigmatism, has not only mislaid his glasses, but had in addition a fearful headache. He made a pass or two after the ball had gone past him: he lunged fitfully and missed: he stabbed down just in time at the straight ones: he sliced the rising offside ball over the second slip: he snicked hazily past his leg stump. So, for about a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> it went on: or, to such an agonized onlooker as I, it seemed to go on. Then suddenly, he would catch a half volley or a long hop such a crack that the bowler, fearful of his own safety, lost all his aggressive intention, and, with it, any idea of length.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing the Earth's magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned with the local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis with the Earth's axis. Alignment with the Earth's axis is the only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary with respect to the Earth and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment with the Earth's axis in as little as a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E

25|$|Parma {{travelled}} to Juventus {{to become}} Old Ladys first competitive {{opponents in the}} brand new Juventus Stadium on 11 September and hoping to win a fourth consecutive match against the Turin side. However, Juventus scored early on through a tidy Stephan Lichtsteiner finish off a delightful Andrea Pirlo pass. This reflected the balance of play and Juventus were unlucky to have Alessandro Matri's effort ruled out just before half-time. Simone Pepe finally doubled the lead on 57 minutes with an accomplished finish, having been put through by Alessandro Del Piero. The chances continued to flow and debutant Arturo Vidal scored a fine volley {{from the edge of}} the box to make it 3–0 with <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> to go. Pirlo found Claudio Marchisio with ten minutes to go and Marchisio chipped Parma goalkeeper Antonio Mirante to complete Juventus' scoring. A late Sebastian Giovinco run saw him fouled in the box and score the resulting penalty, leaving Parma ahead of only Atalanta who were deducted six points before the season's start. Juventus had emphatically ended Parma's 18-match unbeaten record in season openers with a 4–1 win, the Ducali losing for the first time since 1992, when they succumbed to Atalanta.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally {{came to an end}} when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from the pain in his bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E
