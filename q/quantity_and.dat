5|$|Despite {{the great}} <b>quantity</b> <b>and</b> {{excellent}} {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become the paradigm of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E

5000|$|A second {{international}} standard on <b>quantities</b> <b>and</b> units was IEC 60027 [...] The ISO 31 and IEC 60027 Standards were revised {{by the two}} standardization organizations in collaboration (http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter1/1-2.html, http://www.iec.ch/zone/si/si_present.htm) to integrate both standards into a joint standard ISO/IEC 80000 - <b>Quantities</b> <b>and</b> Units in which the <b>quantities</b> <b>and</b> equations used with SI are to be referred as the International System of Quantities (ISQ).

5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were of an unknown <b>quantity</b> <b>and</b> quality, but the {{division}} would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather a static division on anti-invasion duties, and many of its units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, many of its troops were older than was normal in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being a static division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{became a}} Member State of the United Nations on 20 September 1960, shortly after gaining its {{independence}} on 26 June 1960. As of January 2017, 34 police officers from Madagascar are deployed in Haiti {{as part of}} the United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti. Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the food insecurity issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country. Small and local farmers have also been assisted in increasing both the <b>quantity</b> <b>and</b> quality of their production, as well as improving their crop yield in unfavorable weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Noether's theorem {{has become}} a {{fundamental}} tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: if the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved <b>quantity,</b> <b>and</b> for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.|$|E

Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful {{in part due to}} British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E

The question of whether contact is physical or through electromagnetic signals will also govern the magnitude of the long-term {{implications of}} contact. In the case of communication using electromagnetic signals, the long silence between the reception of one message and another would mean that the content of any message would particularly affect the consequences of contact, as would the extent of mutual comprehension.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} grave, {{and the most}} spectacular set of artefacts, was found near {{the centre of the}} cemetery.
