40|$|Aim: The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were for comparing the effect of batteries and deep litter rearing systems of domesticated Japanese quail, Coturnix coturnix japonica, on the concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc from the quail meat and offal in Ismailia, Egypt. Materials and Methods: A total of 40 quail meat and their offal samples were randomly collected from two main <b>quail</b> <b>rearing</b> systems: Battery (Group I) and deep litter system (Group II) for determination of concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc. In addition, 80 water and feed samples were randomly collected from water and feeders of both systems in the Food Hygiene Laboratory, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Suez Canal University for heavy metals determination. Results: The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in Group I were 0. 010, 0. 027, 1. 137, and 0. 516 ppm and for Group II were 0. 093, 0. 832, 0. 601, and 1. 651 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail feed in Group I were 1. 114, 1. 606, 5. 822, and 35. 11 ppm and for Group II were 3. 010, 2. 576, 5. 852, and 23. 616 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in quail meat for Group I were 0. 058, 5. 902, 10. 244, and 290 ppm and for Group II were 0. 086, 6. 092, 0. 136, and 1. 280 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc for liver samples in Group I were 0. 15, 8. 32, 1. 05, and 3. 41 ppm and for Group II were 0. 13, 8. 88, 0. 95, and 4. 21 ppm, respectively. The mean concentration levels of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc in kidney samples for the Group I were 0. 24, 4. 21, 1. 96, and 4. 03 ppm and for Group II were 0. 20, 5. 00, 1. 56, and 3. 78 ppm, respectively. Kidney had the highest concentration levels of heavy metals followed by liver then muscles. The highest concentration levels of copper were observed in liver samples. The order of the levels of these trace elements obtained from the four different quail organs is Ca > Pb > Zn > Cu. Lead and cadmium concentration levels in quail meat samples were exceeded the Egyptian standardization limits and suggesting a health threat from lead and cadmium to the quail consumers. Conclusion: Battery rearing system is more hygienic than deep litter system from the point of heavy metals pollution of water and feeds of quail. Feed samples from battery system had means concentration levels of lead not significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than those samples from deep litter system. Meanwhile, water samples from battery system had means concentration levels of cadmium, copper, and zinc significantly higher (p> 0. 05) than those samples from deep litter system.

The findings showed no significant variations (P> 0. 05) on feed intake, weight gain and feed/gain ratio during the growing period among the vegetable protein sources fed. Attainment of sexual maturity (age at first egg laid) was 60, 61 and 62 days for SBM, CSC and GNC based diets, respectively while weight of first egg laid was 9. 95, 9. 25 and 9. 40 g, respectively. At the laying period, results indicated no significant differences among the treatment means for the performance and egg quality parameters measured. However, laying performance and egg quality traits were in general, numerically better (P> 0. 05) in quails fed SBM compared to CSC and GNC diets.

50|$|He {{enjoys the}} scent of trees before {{stumbling}} into a bush, where he hears birdsong, drawing his attention {{to a couple of}} bluebirds courting. When the bluebirds kiss, two bird chicks jump up from the nest singing. A couple of playful lambs hop by, spurring Pluto to mimic them by hopping as well. His hopping causes him to hit his head on a low-hanging branch and fall yet again into another bush, scaring out rabbits and quails. As one train of quails flees from him, one quail chick lags behind and Pluto decides to run after it, mimicking its way of running. Pluto and the quail stops abruptly as they both hear a deep, bass voice singing about springtime. The voice is echoing out of a tiny burrow in the ground, to which the quail chick puts its ears to better listen to the singing. Suddenly, a fuzzy green caterpillar pops out of the burrow and continues to sing, though now in a high falsetto. The quail is delighted to see food present itself so easily and opens its mouth in anticipation. The caterpillar, halfway through singing does a double-take as he finally notices the quail eyeing him hungrily. The caterpillar reaches out with two of his hands and daintily closes the quail's beak, smiling at it shyly. Bewildered at having its mouth closed, the quail gives the caterpillar enough time to launch itself out of the burrow only to dive headfirst back inside. Not willing to let its prey escape so easily, the quail thrusts it head into the burrow after the caterpillar, manages to bite onto the caterpillar's tail and starts to slowly pull the caterpillar back out. To continue his mimicry, Pluto clamps his teeth on the quail's tail feathers and also starts pulling, lifting the quail into the air, and stretching the caterpillar to more than three times its original length. The caterpillar continues to keep his head inside the burrow while flailing his legs in desperation even though the sound of stretching can be heard. Finally, the quail's tail feathers give out, causing the tug of war to end with Pluto's head whipping back, red feathers floating everywhere. When Pluto investigates, he can see that the force of the caterpillar snapping back to his original length had pulled the quail halfway into the burrow with its head facing out. Underground, the caterpillar sees the <b>quail's</b> <b>rear</b> plugging up his hole, so in vengeance, he uses his many legs to repeatedly kick the <b>quail's</b> <b>rear</b> until the <b>quail</b> is forced out of the burrow like popping champagne cork.|$|R

Four groups included only kin-related birds (K 1 -K 4), two mixed groups consisted of associated chicks from two families (M 1 and M 2 groups), and the seventh group (NK group) included only non-kin chicks. Numbers of chicks in a group varied from eight to 14, depending on the group. They were observed twice during their two first weeks of life (day 3 and day 10) and all activities were recorded by scan sampling. An ultradian rhythm of activity, with a period less than 20 minutes, was found. This period varied among quail families. All chick groups were globally synchronized, except group M 2 on day 3. Inter-individual levels of synchronization were calculated. Spearman rank correlation coefficients of the non-kin chicks were significantly {{lower than those of}} kin-related chicks.

Vertebrate mothers are generally the first individuals to encounter {{and interact with}} young animals. Thus, their role is primordial during ontogeny. The present study evaluated non-genomic effects of mothers {{on the development of}} rhythms of precocial Japanese quail (Coturnix c. japonica). First, we investigated the influence of mothering on the ontogeny of endogenous rhythms of young. We compared circadian and ultradian rhythms of feeding activity of <b>quail</b> <b>reared</b> with or without adoptive mothers. More brooded than non-brooded quail presented a circadian and/or an ultradian rhythm. Thus, the presence of the mother during the normal brooding period favors, in the long term, expression of rhythms in the young. Second, we investigated the influence of rhythmic phenotype of the mother on the development of endogenous rhythms of young by comparing quail brooded by circadian-rhythmic adoptive mothers (R) to quail brooded by circadian-arrhythmic adoptive mothers (A). More R-brooded than A-brooded quail expressed circadian rhythmicity, and circadian rhythm clarities were greater in R-brooded than A-brooded quail. Ultradian rhythmicity did not differ between R- and A-brooded quail, nor between R and A adoptive mothers.

This study evaluated the efficiency of electrolyte supplementation under high environmental temperature conditions by manipulating water and feed electrolyte balance (EB) on the survival and performance of European quails. In experiment 1, a completely randomized experimental design was applied in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement. Treatments consisted in four feed EB values (0, 120, 240, 360 mEq/kg), and two environmental temperatures (25 and 34 ÂºC). Feed electrolyte balance was manipulated by the addition of sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride. In experiment 2, birds were randomly distributed according to a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement. Treatments consisted in five BE values in the drinking water (0, 30, 60, 90, 120 mEq/L) and two environmental temperatures (25 and 34 Â°C).

HS decreased the total antioxidant status (TAS) and increased the total oxidative stress (TOS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) of liver compared to thermoneutral temperature (TN). The TA 200, O 200, TA 200 +OSe and O 200 +OSe diets increased TAS and decreased TOS of liver compared to those of quails fed NC. OSI was decreased by the TA 200, O 200 and TA 200 +OSe diets compared to NC and O 200 +OSe diets. HS reduced plasma albumin (A) and total protein (TP) concentrations, on the other hand, increased plasma glucose (G), total cholesterol (CHO) and triglyceride (TG) levels compared to TN.

A total of 144 quails, between 11 to 42 days old, were distributed in a completely randomized design, 4 x 2 factorial scheme, at four levels of feed restriction (ad libitum, 30 %, 50 % and 70 % restrictions on the daily intake ad libitum) for both genders. Therefore, there was eight treatments with three replicates and six birds each. At the tenth day of age, the animals were housed in cages, where remained for four days under adaptation. Dietary restriction was applied between the days 15 and 35 while refeeding was carried out from day 36 to 42. Compensatory weight gain (CWG), i. e. weight gain of organs and carcass parts, and feed efficiency (FE) were improved for quails under feed restriction. Fat (F), crude protein (CP), protein deposition rate (PDR) and fat in females (FDf) and carcass retained energy in females (CREf) increased linearly as restriction levels decreased. Maximum estimates of feed intake for males (MFIm), compensatory weight gain for males (CWGm) and females (CWGf), feed efficiency for males (FEm), protein deposition for males (PDm) and carcass retained energy in males (CREm) were obtained with restriction levels of 43. 56 %, 30. 56 %, 63. 93 %, 62. 63 %, 80. 25 %, 1. 94 % and 09. 34 % if compared to ad libitum, respectively.

40|$|A 14 -week {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify the preference of nest boxes and their colour on egg production performance in Japanese quails (Nandanam J. quail - 3) at the Institute of Poultry Production and Management, Nandanam, Chennai. A total of 1920 Japanese quails aged 5 weeks were housed in deep litter system and were randomly divided into 3 treatment groups with 2 replicates of 80 male and 240 female quails in each group. The treatment groups consisted of the following: 1) control (T 1) - without the nest boxes, 2) treatment- 2 (T 2) - one nest box / 10 females), and 3) treatment- 3 (T 3) - one nest box / 5 females. The nest boxes were painted with Blue (B), Green (G), White (W) or Brown (Br- natural colour of the nest box) colours. An Isonitrogenous and isocaloric feed was fed ad libitum under standard managemental conditions. The egg production was recorded from 7 th to 20 th weeks of age. Significant (P< 0. 05) differences were observed in the overall percentage of egg production and the values were 54. 71 Â± 1. 62, 57. 05 Â± 1. 46 and 61. 38 Â± 1. 80 for T 1, T 2 and T 3 treatments, respectively. Use of an increased number of nest boxes (T 3) resulted in a highly significant (P< 0. 01) improvement in the egg production. Significant differences (P< 0. 05) in egg production were also recorded with the use of various coloured nest boxes. The percentages of egg production in T 2 were 8. 04 Â± 0. 26, 9. 68 Â± 0. 41, 7. 82 Â± 0. 28 and 8. 22 Â± 0. 44 for B, G, W and Br colours, respectively.

In order to mimic changes in concentration of plasma testosterone during sexual development, {{the birds were}} implanted on three occasions with increasing numbers of testosterone-filled capsules. The feeding activity of each bird was recorded and concentrations of plasma testosterone were measured before and after capsules were implanted. The concentration of testosterone was around 0. 05 ng/ml and {{the period of the}} free running feeding rhythm was 22. 5 hr before testosterone-filled capsules were implanted. The free running period lengthened after testosterone-filled capsules were implanted in 79 % of the cases (N = 66), with a direct relationship between the concentration of plasma testosterone and the length of the free running period of the feeding rhythm. A direct relationship between the variation of the amount of feeding activity and the variation of the period of the free running rhythm was also established. During a seasonal breeding cycle, this change in circadian organization would lead to a slower advance of feeding activity, allowing the dawn chorus to precede the daily onset of feeding activity as well as result in a better adjustment of daily foraging time.

Quails were housed and reared from 1 - 35 days of age in litter pens in a rearing house, and then were transferred to a quail layer house. This study aimed at verifying if different beak trimming method could optimize egg production and quality by reducing stress and cannibalism among birds. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with six treatments in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, with two beak trimming ages (14 and 21 days) and three beak trimming variants (non-trimmed, 1 / 3 of the beak trimmed, or 1 / 2 of the beak trimmed), 6 replicates of 20 birds each. Performance was evaluated by feed intake, percentage of lay, egg mass, feed conversion ratio per dozen and per kg eggs, and mortality. Performance was influenced by trimming variant, with the best results obtained by birds with intact and those with 1 / 3 of the beak trimmed. Better specific gravity was in quails submitted to beak trimming at 21 days of age, whereas other egg quality parameters did not present significant results. Based the results obtained in the present study, it is recommended to submit to beak trimming either at 14 or 21 days of age...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate requirements of energy and crude protein for maintenance, weight gain and egg production of Japanese quails in the period of 67 to 107 days of age. Two experiments were performed: one, to determine the requirements for maintenance of protein, and the other, for energy. Experiments were conducted in a completely randomized design with four dietary levels of offer and four replicates of six birds. The diets offered were: ad libitum (100 %), 75 %, 50 %, and 25 % consumption ad libitum (below maintenance). The methodology used to estimate the demand for maintenance was the comparative slaughter. For estimation of the requirement for weight gain, eight groups of 15 <b>quails</b> were <b>reared</b> separately, fed ad libitum and housed under 22 ÂºC controlled temperature. From these poultry, three groups were slaughtered at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 days of the trial. The requirement for egg production was obtained by taking the ratio of energy content, egg protein, efficiency of energy use and protein for egg production. Prediction equations that estimate maintenance requirement, weight gain and egg production in energy and crude protein of Japanese quail include: metabolizable energy (kcal/bird/day) = 92. 34 *body weight 0. 75 + 6. 23 *weight gain + 4. 19 *egg mass; crude protein (g/bird/day) = 6. 71 *body weight 0. 75 + 0. 615 *weight gain + 0. 258 *egg mass...|$|R

40|$|Egg- and meat-type <b>quails</b> were <b>reared</b> {{in groups}} of {{different}} sizes with a fixed female-to-male ratio of 2 to 1 and an area of 158 cmÂ² per bird. The aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of group size on quail production and reproductive variables. To this end, 360 quails (180 meat and 180 egg-type quails) were assigned in a completely randomized experimental design to one of three treatments with ten replicates each. The treatments consisted of groups with nine, six, or three quails per cage. Birds were observed for three cycles of 14 days. Daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were influenced (p < 0. 05) by group size in both types of quails. Quail type influenced (p < 0. 05) daily feed intake, feed conversion, and egg weight due to the typical differences between meat and egg-type birds. Despite the observed differences in production parameters, the mean values observed were typical of meat- and egg-type quails. The number of hydrolysis points (holes) per mmÂ² on the vitelline membrane on the germinal disc area was higher in meat quails (2. 89 Â± 0. 21) than in egg quails (2. 15 Â± 0. 13). This parameter was not influenced by the number of birds per cage, which suggests that the number of males inside the cage did not modify the spermatozoa pool inside the female oviduct. We concluded that a ratio of two females per male in cages with three, six, and nine birds/cage is recommended, as no deleterious effect on quail reproduction was observed...|$|R
