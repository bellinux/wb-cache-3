50|$|Being {{a serial}} machine, access {{time to a}} single {{register}} was 32 microseconds, a double register 64 microseconds, and a <b>quadruple</b> <b>register</b> 128 microseconds. That for a delay line was 1024 microseconds. Instruction times were: addition, subtraction, logical operations: 64 microseconds for 32-bit words; double precision 96 microseconds; multiplication and division 2 milliseconds. For array arithmetic andtransfer operations, time per word was 33 microseconds per word for 32 words.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high-speed}} store {{consisted of}} four single-word registers of 32 bits each, three double-word registers, and two quadruple-word registers. Each 32-bit {{word of the}} double and quadruple-word registers could be addressed separately. They could also be accessed as a pair, and—in {{the case of the}} quadruple registers—as a group of three or four. The instruction store consisted of twelve mercury delay lines, each of 32 words, and numbered 1 to 12. Delay Line 11 (DL11) served as the buffer between the magnetic drum and the high-speed store. Being a [...] "transfer machine", data could be transferred a word at a time, a pair of words at a time, and any number of words up to 33 at a time. Thus, for example, 32 words read from the drum could be transferred as a block to any of the other delay lines; four words could be transferred as a block from one <b>quadruple</b> <b>register</b> to the other, or between a <b>quadruple</b> <b>register</b> and a delay line—all with one instruction. The 32 words of a delay line could be summed by passing them to the single-length adder (by means of a single instruction).|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{words of}} the <b>quadruple</b> <b>registers</b> were associated with an auto-increment/decrement facility. That facility {{could be used for}} counting and for modifying instructions (for indexing, loop control, and for changing the source or destination address of an instruction).|$|R
5000|$|Information {{for this}} new chipset remains unclear. However, the sound system may have still been {{the same as the}} {{original}} chipset. According to [...] R. J. Mical, the new chipset kept the original 13-bit DAC for its CLUT but with <b>quadrupled</b> color <b>registers</b> from 32 to 128. The color palette would have remained at 4096 colors but the resolution could go up to 1024×1024 pixels with 128 colors (7-bit color depth). Additionally the chipset can address up to 2 MB of Chip RAM space. Ranger used 2 MB VRAM as chip memory. In an interview, Jay Miner described benefits of using VRAM instead of DRAM; this gave the display system enough memory bandwidth for 1024×1024 pixel displays. From the known specification, it could be said that Ranger chipset was designed to compete with Sharp's X68000 personal computers (released in 1987) which takes advantage of VRAM technology for displaying a 1024×1024 pixel screens in 16 colors.|$|R
