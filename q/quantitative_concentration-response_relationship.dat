40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{influence}} of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rocuronium. Design: Prospective, descriptive study. Setting: Operating room at a university hospital. Participants: Ten ASA class III end IV patients, {{ranging in age from}} 35 to 75 years, scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Interventions: Neuromuscular transmission was monitored mechanomyographically. The time course of action of maintenance doses and plasma <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationships</b> were determined before, during, and after OPE. The plasma concentration decay and renal elimination were studied simultaneously. Plasma and urine concentration of rocuronium ware determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Measurements and Main Results: Hypothermic CPB prolonged the duration of action of coincided with a lower plasma concentration at a twitch response of 5 % of control. The duration of action of maintenance doses returned to prehypothermic CPB level after rewarming to a nasopharyngeal temperature of 37 degrees C. The plasma <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> did not return to precooling control value, probably owing to persisting peripheral hypothermia. Both the renal elimination of rocuronium and the plasma concentration decay after the last maintenance dose under normothermic conditions resembled values obtained in patients not undergoing hypothermic CPB. Conclusions: Hypothermic CPB prolongs the duration of action of maintenance doses and alters the plasma <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> of rocuronium. These changes may be the result of, on the one hand, an increased sensitivity of the neuromuscular transmission and/or decreased muscle contractility and, on the other hand, the result of a reduced plasma clearance during hypothermia.

40|$|Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) {{channels}} {{play a role}} in olfactory transduction. Olfactory CNG channels {{consist of}} three different subunits, 2 XCNGA 2, 1 XCNGA 4 and 1 XCNGB 1 b. Only the CNGA 2 subunits can form functional homotetrameric channels. It is still unclear how ligand binding is translated to channel gating in the homotetrameric CNGA 2 channels. Therefore, we characterized the work of only one CNGA 2 subunit in homotetrameric CNGA 2 channels. We used the concatenation technique in combination with the patch-clamp technique. Selected subunits were rendered almost insensitive to cGMP by a point mutation (R 538 E) in the binding domain. First, we show direct evidence indicating that the concatenation technique does not have any effect on channel function: 1) The <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> of wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer was almost identical to that of channels formed by non-concatenated subunits (4 wt). 2) When coexpressing wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer with mut subunits, the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> was indistinguishable from that of wt-wt-wt-wt concatemer alone. 3) The amplitude of the single-channel current and the open probability of wt-wt-wt-wt channels were not significantly different from that of 4 wt channels in the presence of saturating cGMP concentrations. Then, the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationships</b> obtained from the concatemers containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 mutated subunits showed that an increase of the number of mut subunits in the concatemeric channels caused graded losses in cGMP sensitivity (EC 50) associated with a systematic decrease of the Hill coefficient (H). Moreover, we showed that the position of the functional subunit(s) in the concatemers is irrelevant for the channel function. We further characterized the CNGA 2 -channel activation induced by the first ligand binding step in mut-mut-mut-wt channels by means of the single-channel recordings and a global fit analysis with Markovian models. We found that the first binding step is sufficient to evoke significant channel opening to the full conductance level. The second binding step is the most important step because this step drives the channel from the closed to the maximal open state.

ObjectivesThe aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> and threshold of the association between ambient O 3 concentration and non-accidental mortality in 13 Japanese and Korean cities from 2000 to 2009. MethodsWe selected Japanese and Korean cities which have population of over 1 million. We constructed Poisson regression models adjusting daily mean temperature, daily mean PM 10, humidity, time trend, season, year, day of the week, holidays and yearly population. The association between O 3 concentration and mortality was examined using linear, spline and linear-threshold models. The thresholds were estimated for each city, by constructing linear-threshold models. We also examined the city-combined association using a generalized additive mixed model. ResultsThe mean O 3 concentration did not differ greatly between Korea and Japan, which were 26. 2 ppb and 24. 2 ppb, respectively. Seven out of 13 cities showed better fits for the spline model compared with the linear model, supporting a non-linear relationships between O 3 concentration and mortality. All of the 7 cities showed J or U shaped associations suggesting the existence of thresholds. The range of city-specific thresholds was from 11 to 34 ppb. The city-combined analysis also showed a non-linear association with a threshold around 30 - 40 ppb.

Prior studies indicate that Na+o potently inhibits HERG current (IC 50 3 mm) by binding to an outer pore site, and also speeds recovery from inactivation. In this study, we sought to explore {{the relationship between the}} Na+o effect on recovery and Na+o inhibition of HERG current, and to determine whether inactivation gating plays a critical role in Na+o inhibition of HERG current. Na+o <b>concentration–response</b> <b>relationships</b> for current inhibition and speeding of recovery were different, with Na+o less potent at speeding recovery. Na+o inhibition of HERG current was relieved by physiological [K+]o, while Na+o speeded recovery from inactivation similarly in the absence or presence of physiological [K+]o. To examine the link between Na+o block and inactivation using an independent approach, we studied hyperpolarization-activated currents uncoupled from inactivation in the S 4 –S 5 linker mutant D 540 K. Depolarization-activated D 540 K currents were inhibited by Na+o, while hyperpolarization-activated currents were augmented by Na+o. This result reveals a direct link between Na+o inhibition and a depolarization-induced conformational change, most likely inactivation. We attempted to simulate the disparate <b>concentration–response</b> <b>relationships</b> for the two effects of Na+o using a kinetic model that included Na+o site(s) affected by permeation and gating.

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} shown that spinal {{reflexes}} such as the H-reflex predict motor responses to painful stimuli better than cortical parameters derived from the EEG. The precise concentration-dependence of H-reflex suppression by anaesthetics, however, is not known. Here we investigated this <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> and the equilibration between the alveolar and the effect compartment for sevoflurane. METHODS: In 26 patients, the H-reflex was recorded at a frequency of 0. 1 Hz while anaesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane at increasing and decreasing concentrations. Population pharmacodynamic modelling was performed using the NONMEM software package, yielding population mean parameters as well as indicators of interindividual variability. RESULTS: Suppression of H-reflex amplitude occurred at lower concentrations (mean EC(50) 1. 04 +/- 0. 10 vol%, SE of NONMEM estimate) than the effect on either BIS or SEF(95) of the EEG (mean EC(50) 1. 55 +/- 0. 08 and 1. 72 +/- 0. 18 vol%, respectively), and exhibited a higher interindividual variability. The concentration-response function for the H-reflex was also steeper (mean ë 2. 83 +/- 0. 25). In addition, the equilibration between alveolar and effect compartment was slower for the H-reflex (mean k(e 0) 0. 15 +/- 0. 01 min(- 1)) than for BIS or SEF(95) (mean k(e 0) 0. 22 +/- 0. 02 and 0. 41 +/- 0. 05 min(- 1)).

Analysis of ACh and NE was through two HPLC systems with electrochemical detection. Electrical field stimulation (150 mA, 0. 8 ms, 16 Hz, 5 min, biphasic pulses) released 29. 1 +/- 2. 5 pmol ACh/g tissue and 70. 2 +/- 6. 2 pmol NE/g tissue. Preincubation for 15 min with the selective beta(2) -adrenoceptor agonist fenoterol (1 mu M) increased both ACh and NE overflow to 178 +/- 28 (P < 0. 01) and 165 +/- 128 (P < 0. 01), respectively, of control values, increases that were abolished completely by the selective beta(2) -adrenoceptor antagonist ICI- 118551 (1 mu M). Further experiments with increasing fenoterol concentrations (0. 1 - 100 mu M) and different preincubation periods (1, 5, and 15 min) showed a strong and concentration-dependent facilitation of NE release, with maximum response levels decreasing (from nearly 5 -fold to only 2. 5 -fold of control value) with increasing agonist contact time. In contrast, sensitivity of facilitatory beta(2) -adrenoceptors on cholinergic nerves to fenoterol gradually increased when the incubation period was prolonged; in addition, a bell-shaped <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> was found at 15 min of preincubation.

These results indicate that, (1) reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations to adventitially administered substances can be ascribed to a diffusion barrier in the vessel wall, while enzymatic degradation, luminal pressure and precontractile responses seem not to play a role, (2) impedance planimetry applied to everted cylindrical segments could be a useful experimental approach in pharmacological studies of endothelium-dependent responses under isobaric and isometric conditions...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{ecotoxicological}} risks due {{to chemical}} substances {{is based in}} part on establishing <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationships</b> for different organisms, including plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates living on land, fresh water, or sea water. European regulations for assessing the risks due to chemical products thus recommend the measurement of toxic effects on at least three taxons (algae, crustacea, fish) [1]. The assessment becomes more relevant when based upon a variety of different organisms, with a range of different biological and ecological features (autotrophic or heterotrophic, benthic or pelagic habitat, and different modes of reproduction, growth, respiration, or feeding, etc.), but also when it describes the effects of contaminants on sensitive physiological functions such as growth and reproduction, which determine the balance of populations of terrestrial and aquatic species in their environment...|$|R
40|$|Background Ambient ozone (O 3) {{concentration}} {{has been}} reported to be significantly associated with mortality. However, linearity of the relationships and the presence of a threshold has been controversial. Objectives The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the <b>concentration-response</b> <b>relationship</b> and threshold of the association between ambient O 3 concentration and non-accidental mortali-ty in 13 Japanese and Korean cities from 2000 to 2009. Methods We selected Japanese and Korean cities which have population of over 1 million. We con-structed Poisson regression models adjusting daily mean temperature, daily mean PM 10, humidity, time trend, season, year, day of the week, holidays and yearly population. The as-sociation between O 3 concentration and mortality was examined using linear, spline and lin-ear-threshold models. The thresholds were estimated for each city, by constructing linear...|$|R
