5000|$|A typical {{integrated}} {{electric propulsion}} arrangement includes both diesel generators and gas turbines.

In naval vessels, a pool of diesel generators are typically used to provide a base load and enough power to achieve cruise speed. The gas turbines are used to provide peak power for higher speeds and may be required to operate weapon systems with high power demands. In passenger ships, one or more gas turbines are used for fast cruising. The diesels provide reliable redundancy and an efficient source of electricity when in port, at anchor, or drifting.|$|E

5000|$|Bats {{have evolved}} to use {{echolocation}} to detect and catch their prey. Moths have in turn evolved to detect the echolocation calls of hunting bats, and evoke evasive flight maneuvers, or reply with their own ultrasonic clicks to confuse the bat's echolocation. The Arctiidae subfamily of Noctuid moths uniquely respond to bat echolocation in three prevailing hypotheses: startle, sonar jamming, and acoustic aposematic defense. All these differences depend on specific environmental settings {{and the type of}} echolocation call; however, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and can be used by the same moth for defense. The different defense mechanisms {{have been shown to be}} directly responsive to bat echolocation through sympatry studies. In places with spatial or temporal isolation between bats and their prey, the moth species hearing mechanism tends to regress. Fullard et al. (2004) compared adventive and endemic Noctiid moth species in a bat-free habitat to ultrasound and found that all of the adventive species reacted to the ultrasound by slowing their flight times, while only one of the endemic species reacted to the ultrasound signal, indicating a loss of hearing over time in the endemic population. However, the degree of loss or regression depends on the amount of evolutionary time and whether or not the moth species has developed secondary uses for hearing. Some bats are known to use clicks at frequencies above or below moths' hearing ranges. This is known as the allotonic frequency hypothesis. It argues that the auditory systems in moths have driven their bat predators to use higher or lower frequency echolocation to circumvent the moth hearing.Barbastelle bats {{have evolved to}} use a <b>quieter</b> <b>mode</b> of echolocation, calling at a reduced volume and further reducing the volume of their clicks as they close in on prey moths.

40|$|Reduction of {{disk drive}} power {{consumption}} is a challenging task, {{particularly since the}} most prevalent way of achieving it, powering down idle disks, has many undesirable side-effects. Some hard disk drives support acoustic modes, meaning they can be configured to reduce the acceleration and velocity of the disk head. This reduces instantaneous power consumption but sacrifices performance. As a result, input/output (I/O) operations run longer at reduced power. This is useful for power capping since it causes significant reduction in peak power consumption of the disks. We conducted experiments on several disk drives that support acoustic management. Most of these disk drives support only two modes- quiet and normal. We ran different I/O workloads, including SPC- 1 to simulate a real-world online transaction processing workload. We found that the reduction in peak power can reach up to 23 % when using <b>quiet</b> <b>mode.</b> We show that for some workloads this translates into a reduction of 12. 5 % in overall energy consumption.

40|$|This work {{develops}} feedback controllers for bipedal {{walking in}} 3 D on level ground, both in simulation and experimentally. MARLO {{is a new}} robot that has been designed {{for the study of}} 3 D-bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated, having six actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits in a wide diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport (cmt), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency. A feedback controller is designed that balances the robot during the <b>quiet</b> standing <b>mode,</b> and another feedback policy is developed such that the robot can take a transition step from quiet standing to walking. A feedback controller is designed that stabilizes steady-state 3 D walking gaits, despite the high degree of underactuation of the robot. These controllers are combined through a state machine that handles switching among the three controllers controllers. In experiments on planarized (2 D) and untethered (3 D) versions of the robot with point feet and passive feet (prosthetic feet) walking over flat ground or on a ramp with a shallow slope, the adaptability of the designed controller to the environment (planar or untethered, flat ground or ramp), and to the morphology of the robot (point feet or passive feet), is demonstrated. In experiments on a planarized version of the robot with passive feet, the controller yielded stable walking after starting from quiet standing, autonomously and without any intervention from the operator. In experiments on an untethered (3 D) version of the robot, the controller was able to balance the robot over flat ground or on a shallow ramp during the <b>quiet</b> standing <b>mode.</b> In addition, the controller yielded six-untethered ``human-like'' steps after starting from quiet standing, autonomously without any intervention from the operator...|$|R

Of the strategies presented, we consider the hip strategy which motivated the formulation of a hip actuated robot. An investigation into the control of nonlinear underactuated robots by linear controllers is done to verify the range and efficiency of the controlled system. The second part of the thesis includes the investigation of two simplified models of the robot. Results using linear state feedback control are presented. The two models used are compared to clarify the use of one over the other. We found that for linear controls, the size of the region of convergence decreased underactuated systems of increasing complexity. For our four degrees of freedom robot, the region of convergence is of 2. 3 degrees for the actuated joints and of 1 degree for the unactuated joints.

40|$|We {{show that}} there has been a {{dramatic}} decline in the abundance of massive post-starburst galaxies from z ∼ 1. 2 to the present. Combining data from the Gemini Deep Deep and the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys to make mass-matched samples (M ⋆> 10 10. 2 M⊙), we find that the fraction of galaxies in a post-starburst phase, identified by their strong Hδ absorption lines, has decreased from about 50 % at z = 1. 2 to a few percent today. This trend originates from a (1 +z) 2. 5 ± 0. 7 evolution in the distribution of Hδ equivalent widths for massive galaxies. With few exceptions, the local and the distant massive post-starburst galaxies have high visual extinction and young luminosity-weighted ages. Spectral synthesis studies of the high-redshift population using the Pégase code, treating HδA, EW[O II], Dn 4000, and rest-frame colors, favor models in which these massive Hδ-strong systems reveal the echoes of intense episodes of star-formation that faded ≃ 1 Gyr prior to the epoch of observation on time-scales shorter than a few hundred million years. The z = 1. 4 − 2 epoch appears to be a time at which massive galaxies transition from a mode of sustained star formation to a <b>quiet</b> <b>mode</b> with weak and rare star-formation episodes.

40|$|Pulsar B 0943 + 10 is {{well known}} for its `B' (burst) mode, {{characterized}} by accurately drifting subpulses, in contrast to its chaotic `Q' (<b>quiet)</b> <b>mode.</b> Six new Arecibo observations at 327 MHz with durations of 2 + hours each have shed considerable light on the modal dynamics of this pulsar. Of these, three were found to be exclusively `B' mode, and three were discovered to exhibit transitions from the `Q' to the `B' mode. One of these observations has permitted us to determine the circulation time of the subbeam carousel in the `Q' mode for the first time, at some 36. 4 ± 0. 9 stellar rotation periods. The onset of the `B' mode is then observed to commence similarly in all three observations. The initial circulation time is about 36 periods and relaxes to nearly 38 periods in a roughly exponential fashion with a characteristic time of some 1. 2 hours. This is the longest characteristic time ever found in a mode-switching pulsar. Moreover, just after the `B'-mode onset the pulsar exhibits a symmetrical resolved-double profile form with a somewhat stronger trailing component, but this second component slowly dies away leaving the usual single `B'-mode profile with the longitude of the magnetic axis falling at about its trailing half power point. Thus it would appear that Q-to-B- and B-to-Q-transitions have different characteristic times. Some speculations are given on the nature of this slow modal alternation.

40|$|International audienceS U M M A R Y The 1000 -km-long left-lateral Dead Sea {{fault is}} a major tectonic {{structure}} of the oriental Mediterranean basin, bounding the Arabian Plate to the west. The fault {{is located in a}} region with an exceptionally long and rich historical record, allowing to document historical seismicity catalogues with unprecedented level of details. However, if the earthquake time series is well documented, location and lateral extent of past earthquakes remain often difficult to establish, if only based on historical testimonies. We excavated a palaeoseismic trench in a site located in a kilometre-size extensional jog, south of the Dead Sea, in the Wadi Araba. Based on the stratigraphy exposed in the trench, we present evidence for nine earthquakes that produced surface ruptures during a time period spanning 5000 yr. Abundance of datable material allows us to tie the five most recent events to historical earthquakes with little ambiguities, and to constrain the possible location of these historical earthquakes. The events identified at our site are the 1458 C. E., 1212 C. E., 1068 C. E., one event during the 8 th century crisis, and the 363 C. E. earthquake. Four other events are also identified, which correlation with historical events remains more speculative. The magnitude of earthquakes is difficult to assess based on evidence at one site only. The deformation observed in the excavation, however, allows discriminating between two classes of events that produced vertical deformation with one order of amplitude difference, suggesting that we could distinguish earthquakes that started/stopped at our site from earthquakes that potentially ruptured most of the Wadi Araba fault. The time distribution of earthquakes during the past 5000 yr is uneven. The early period shows little activity with return interval of ∼ 500 yr or longer. It is followed by a ∼ 1500 -yr-long period with more frequent events, about every 200 yr. Then, for the past ∼ 550 yr, the fault has switched back to a <b>quieter</b> <b>mode</b> with no significant earthquake along the entire southern part of the Dead Sea fault, between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. We computed the Coefficient of Variation for our site and three other sites along the Dead Sea fault, south of Lebanon, to compare time distribution of earthquakes at different locations along the fault. With one exception at a site located next to Lake Tiberias, the three other sites are consistent to show some temporal clustering at the scale of few thousands years...|$|R

We also explore a more extreme magnetic field configuration, where a magnetic dipole displaced {{from the center of the}} star produces two magnetic polar caps of different sizes and magnetic field strengths.
