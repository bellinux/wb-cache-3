SÃ£o apresentadas informaÃ§Ãµes sobre o ambiente e a qualidade da Ã¡gua do local de coleta da espÃ©cie. Adicionalmente, citam-se os seguintes gÃªneros e espÃ©cies de Elmidae amostradas juntamente com N. doylei: Cylloepus, Microcylloepus e Neoelmis e as espÃ©cies Xenelmis micros Grouvelle e Xenelmis tarsalis Hinton. First {{record of}} Genus and Species Neblinagena doylei Kodada & JÃ¤ch (Coleoptera: Elmidae: Larainae) in Brazil Abstract. We recorded, {{for the first}} time in Brazil, the genus and species Neblinagena doylei Kodada & JÃ¤ch, {{expanding}} the geographic distribution of the genus and species in South America. We complement this information with data on the environment and water <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locality</b> where the species was collected. Adittionally, we cited the following genera and species of Elmidae collected along with N. doylei: Cylloepus, Microcylloepus, Neoelmis, Xenelmis micros Grouvelle and Xenelmis tarsalis Hinton...|$|E
40|$|The synonymization of the cimolestan taxa Cymaprimadon and Chadronia {{from the}} Late Eocene Chadron Formation is {{consistently}} upheld, despite {{a lack of}} supporting evidence. Here we show that the synonymization is unjustified, owing to distinct differences between these taxa in the mandibular tooth count (1 - 1 - 3 - 3 vs. ?- 1 - 4 - 3), the identity of the enlarged anterior mandibular tooth (incisor versus canine), and the morphology of the crown of m 3 (e. g., paraconid on m 3 in Cymaprimadon). We also refer a specimen recently collected from the Early Oligocene Brule Formation within the Badlands National Park (BADL 16917) to Chadronia sp., thus making it the youngest occurrence of a pantolestan from North America. Examination of an additional specimen (FMNH UC 349) revealed the presence of a further cimo-lestan taxon in the White River Group of South Dakota, although the poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locality</b> and stratigraphic data associated with this specimen precludes erecting a formal name. In total, this study doubles the number of cimolestans from the Late Chadronian and Orellan (Ch 4 to Or 1) of North America from two to four, and extends the biostratigraphi...|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{concentrations}} <b>of</b> eight trace elements, Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg) and arsenic(As) in sediment {{and water}} were assessed in four artisanal and small-scale mining(ASM) <b>localities</b> in <b>the</b> Amansie West District (6 ° 282 N 1 ° 532 W) of Ghana along two river courses from May 2011 to July 2011. Triplicate {{water and sediment}} samples were randomly taken at five different points at each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>localities</b> and <b>the</b> elements determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). Using the Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo) assessment, the sediments {{were found to be}} polluted to different degrees with Cu (Uncontaminated to moderately contaminated/Moderately contaminated), Hg (Uncontaminated to moderately contaminated/Moderately contaminated) and As (Moderately contaminated/Moderately to strongly contaminated). The Enrichment Factor (EF) indicated human influence- artisanal mining activities on <b>the</b> sediment concentration <b>of</b> Cd and Pb for all <b>the</b> <b>localities</b> and only some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>localities</b> for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace elements. The elements are major sediment pollutants (EF> 2) in one or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>localities.</b> <b>The</b> Igeo and EF gave diverse status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sediment <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>localities.</b> Cd, Pb, Hg and As water concentrations in the four artisanal mining localities were all found to be above the WHO maximum acceptable of levels for drinking water.

Using a unique dataset on secondary school-age children from rural Bangladesh, we find that madrasah enrolment falls as household income increases.

However, in contrast to the theory, we find that Islamic school demand does not respond to <b>the</b> average <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> schools in <b>the</b> <b>locality...</b>|$|R
40|$|In 2000, Victoria’s largest {{regional}} council, <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> Greater Geelong, allocated $ 200, 000 to fund {{a community}} art and place-making project in inner Geelong West.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} find {{evidence}} for <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> local culture—living culture and cultural heritage—on regional socio-economic development in Greece. <b>The</b> main aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{paper is to}} operationalize the culture-based development hypothesis for <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a cumulative causation process of cultural impact on Greek local development. To test this hypothesis empirically, we employ an original and uniquely compiled dataset of over 130 economic and social indicators about Greece on a NUTS 3 level, assembled from various international and local sources. Employing a combined nonparametric partial-least squares path modelling approach, we find evidence that—in contrast to results from other European countries and the USA—in Greece, culture influences not only the human capital, but also the overall labour force structure. This appears to affect not only the economic productivity, but also <b>the</b> overall <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life in <b>the</b> <b>locality</b> concerned. These results, based on nonparametric estimations, were confirmed through triangulation with parametric 3 SLS and structural equation model tests. <b>The</b> latter use <b>of</b> parametric and nonparametric techniques in a mutually complementary manner is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novelties in this contribution...|$|R
