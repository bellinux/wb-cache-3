5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E
25|$|Roach was not <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> concede defeat however. The {{following}} year, {{he organized}} a new Brazil Line with another investor, and built three new passenger freighters for it - Advance and Finance, both of 2,600 tons, and the 2,985-ton Allianca. The new Brazil Line would struggle {{on for a}} number of years without ever making a profit, before finally failing in 1893.|$|E

25|$|Former {{students}} of Hindu College were strongly {{in favour of}} Thomas Babington Macaulay’s move for western education. They even went {{to the extent of}} supporting his theory, expounded in 1835, “I am <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> take oriental learning at the valuation of orientalists themselves. I have never found one among them, who could deny that that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” That was an age when India’s past was still to be fully realised.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Thursday, 9 May, Chamberlain {{attempted to}} form a National Coalition Government. In talks at Downing Street with Viscount Halifax and Churchill, he indicated that he was <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resign if that was necessary for Labour to enter such a government. Attlee and Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting, and when asked, they indicated that they must first consult their party (then in conference at Bournemouth), but it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; they probably {{would be able to}} serve under some other Conservative.|$|E

25|$|While {{his colleagues}} saw {{football}} {{as a marketing}} and public relation investment and were <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner (namely, himself) and so was {{more than happy to}} sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re-invested in the team, often for the acquisition of lesser-valued replacements or virtual unknowns. Thus he proved all-too-eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from the Japanese Yomiuri Verdy (a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Italian Serie A).|$|E
500|$|Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called Dwight's groveling [...] "hilarious," [...] but {{was unsure}} about Jim and Karen's ending scene, {{explaining}} that it [...] "was adorable. Too adorable. And I’m not <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> handle {{the fact that}} I’m not HATING the idea of Jim and Karen. I feel like I’m betraying Pam. I’m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it’s nice to see Jim smile again." [...] Skerry concluded that [...] "there were some seriously funny, laugh out loud moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode {{is going to make}} my favorites list. But even when The Office isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A-. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E
500|$|During the action, Tiger {{was hit by}} six German shells, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of which was a}} [...] shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 [...] shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and [...] Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a [...] "" [...] and adding [...] "The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to {{have had a lot of}} practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: [...] "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." [...] The ship was given a refit in December 1915.|$|E

According to Moreau, {{he was sent}} to do such shots when the crew was not <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> shoot a scene.

The Xianbei empires during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, for example, regarded the Han Chinese regimes of southern China as [...] "barbarians" [...] because they refused to submit to Xianbei rule.

2500|$|In {{what was}} {{supposed}} to be Cleverly's toughest fight to date, he out skilled and out pointed Krasniqi winning by unanimous decision at the Wembley Arena on 20 April 2013. The judges gave Cleverly every round (120-108) whilst one judge credited Krasniqi with some even rounds, scoring it (119-111). Cleverly set the pace of the fight throughout behind his jab and when he saw the chance, landed a flurry of punches. In the post-fight, Cleverly spoke of his game plan going into the fight, I thought sooner or later he was going to have to go but he was very tough. Plan A was to box and Plan B was to get inside. He was hurt a lot but he wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go, so in the end I had to revert to Plan A." [...] With the win, Cleverly stayed on course for a unification fight against Bernard Hopkins.|$|E
2500|$|When the Rosary Way was {{successfully}} completed, Kossowski received [...] "the biggest ceramic commission that I ever had till then", The Vision of St. Simon Stock. Kossowski recalled:At that time I {{had already had}} some experience with the famous old Fulham Pottery which was still operating. They were <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> fire for me the larger pieces of ceramics in their old-fashioned kiln, one not used anymore elsewhere, heated by coal and coke. They could get only one temperature and one kind of glaze. You could not make any changes and I realized that every piece could be fired only once. So I had to put the colours and the glazes and the body in one firing only. It was a miracle that it came out quite alright, with very few small cracks. And the temperature {{had to be very}} high - at least 1200 degrees.|$|E
