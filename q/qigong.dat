5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of <b>Qigong,</b> or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|There is {{insufficient}} historical {{evidence to support}} the claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records never once mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from mastery of the bow, double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard <b>qigong,</b> Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E
5|$|Falun Gong, a <b>qigong</b> {{practice}} that combines meditation with the moral philosophy articulated by founder Li Hongzhi, first began spreading widely in China in 1992. Li's first lectures outside mainland China {{took place in}} Paris in 1995. At the invitation of the Chinese ambassador to France, he lectured on his teachings and practice methods to the embassy staff and others. From that time on, Li gave lectures in other major cities in Europe, Asia, Oceania, and North America. He has resided permanently in the United States since 1998. Falun Gong is now practiced in some 70 countries worldwide, and the teachings have been translated to over 40 languages. The international Falun Gong community is estimated to number {{in the hundreds of}} thousands, though participation estimates are imprecise on account of a lack of formal membership.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{sources say}} that Hua Tuo rarely practiced moxibustion and acupuncture. The first {{mentioning}} of acupuncture in Chinese literature appeared in the Huangdi neijing. Acupuncture needles made of gold {{were found in the}} tomb of the Han King Liu Sheng (d. 113 BCE). Some stone-carved depictions of acupuncture date to the Eastern Han Era (25–220 CE). Hua Tuo also wrote about the allegedly life-prolonging exercises of calisthenics. In the 2nd-century-BCE medical texts excavated from the Mawangdui, illustrated diagrams of calisthenic positions are accompanied by descriptive titles and captions. Vivienne Lo writes that the modern physical exercises of taijiquan and <b>qigong</b> are derived from Han-era calisthenics.|$|E
5|$|Various wuxia {{novels and}} folk legends have endowed Zhou with {{different}} kinds of martial and supernatural skills. These range from mastery of the bow, double broadswords, and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard <b>qigong</b> and even x-ray vision. Practitioners of Eagle Claw, Chuojiao and Xingyi commonly include him within their lineage history because of his association with Yue Fei, the supposed progenitor of these styles. He is also linked to Northern Praying Mantis boxing via Lin Chong and Yan Qing. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing. However, the oldest historical record that mentions his name only says he taught archery to Yue Fei. Nothing is ever said about him knowing or teaching a specific style of Chinese martial arts.|$|E
25|$|Over time, five {{distinct}} traditions or {{schools of}} <b>qigong</b> developed in China, {{each with its}} own theories and characteristics: Chinese Medical <b>Qigong,</b> Daoist <b>Qigong,</b> Buddhist <b>Qigong,</b> Confucian <b>Qigong,</b> and martial arts <b>qigong.</b> All of these <b>qigong</b> traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance qi.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qigong</b> {{involves}} coordinated movement, breath, {{and awareness}} used for health, meditation, and martial arts training. While many scholars and practitioners consider tàijíquán to be {{a type of}} <b>qigong,</b> the two are commonly distinguished as separate but closely related practices, with <b>qigong</b> playing {{an important role in}} training for tàijíquán, and with many tàijíquán movements performed as part of <b>qigong</b> practice. The focus of <b>qigong</b> is typically more on health or meditation than martial applications. Internally the main difference is the flow of qi. In <b>qigong,</b> the flow of qi is held at a gate point for a moment to aid the opening and cleansing of the channels. In tàijíquán, the flow of qi is continuous, thus allowing the development of power for the use by the practitioner.|$|E
25|$|Falun Gong {{initially}} enjoyed considerable {{official support}} {{during the early}} years of its development. It was promoted by the state-run <b>Qigong</b> Association and other government agencies. By the mid-1990s, however, Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of <b>qigong</b> practices and enacted more stringent requirements on the country’s various <b>qigong</b> denominations. In 1995 authorities mandated that all <b>qigong</b> groups establish Communist Party branches. The government also sought to formalize ties with Falun Gong and exercise greater control over the practice. Falun Gong resisted co-optation, and instead filed to withdraw altogether from the state-run <b>qigong</b> association.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qìgōng</b> (气功 or 氣功) is a TCM {{system of}} {{exercise}} and meditation that combines regulated breathing, slow movement, and focused awareness, purportedly to cultivate and balance qi. One branch of <b>qigong</b> is <b>qigong</b> massage, in which the practitioner combines massage techniques with awareness of the acupuncture channels and points.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} <b>qigong</b> forms. 75 ancient forms {{that can be}} found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary forms have been described in a <b>qigong</b> compendium. The list is by no means exhaustive. Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after <b>qigong</b> practice.|$|E
25|$|Mid-1980s — Li begins {{studying}} and observing {{a variety of}} other <b>qigong</b> disciplines, apparently in preparation for establishing and publicizing his own <b>qigong</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Conventional or {{mainstream}} medicine includes specific {{practices and}} techniques {{based on the}} best available evidence demonstrating effectiveness and safety. <b>Qigong</b> is not {{generally considered to be}} part of mainstream medicine because clinical research concerning effectiveness of <b>qigong</b> for specific medical conditions is inconclusive at this stage, and because at present there is no medical consensus concerning effectiveness of <b>qigong.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1999 crackdown, <b>qigong</b> {{research}} and practice have only been officially supported {{in the context of}} health and traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Health <b>Qigong</b> Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public <b>qigong</b> practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state-approved forms.|$|E
25|$|He taught this <b>qigong</b> to his {{soldiers}} {{to help keep}} their bodies strong and well-prepared for battle. One legend states that Zhou Tong took young Yue to meet a Buddhist hermit who taught him Emei Dapeng <b>Qigong</b> (峨嵋大鵬氣功). His training in Dapeng <b>Qigong</b> {{was the source of}} his great strength and martial arts abilities. Modern practitioners of this style say it was passed down by Yue.|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} China, {{the emphasis}} of <b>qigong</b> practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective. <b>Qigong</b> is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional philosophical, medical, or martial arts perspectives, and even use {{the long history of}} <b>qigong</b> as evidence of its effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|Basic and {{clinical}} research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results {{were reported in}} peer-reviewed English-language journals. A 1996 review of selected Chinese research concluded {{that there are many}} potential medical applications of <b>qigong.</b> <b>Qigong</b> became known outside China in the 1990s, {{and clinical}} randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of <b>qigong</b> on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qigong</b> is {{generally}} viewed as safe. No adverse effects {{have been observed}} in clinical trials, such that <b>qigong</b> is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care. Typically the cautions associated with <b>qigong</b> {{are the same as}} those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qigong</b> {{practice}} typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, {{and calm}} meditative state of mind. <b>Qigong</b> is now practiced throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise and relaxation, preventive medicine and self-healing, alternative medicine, meditation and self-cultivation, {{and training for}} martial arts.|$|E
25|$|As moving meditation, <b>qigong</b> {{practice}} typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, {{and calm}} mental focus, with visualization of guiding qi through the body. While implementation details vary, generally <b>qigong</b> forms {{can be characterized}} as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the term}} <b>qigong</b> (氣功) has been {{traced back to}} Daoist {{literature}} of the early Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the term <b>qigong</b> as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s {{to refer to a}} broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize health and scientific approaches, while de-emphasizing spiritual practices, mysticism, and elite lineages.|$|E
25|$|T'ai Chi Ch'uan (Taijiquan) is {{a widely}} practiced Chinese {{internal}} martial style based on the theory of taiji ("grand ultimate"), closely associated with <b>qigong,</b> and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense. Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of <b>qigong,</b> traced back to an origin in the seventeenth century. In modern practice, <b>qigong</b> typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and {{plays an important role}} in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality ("life energy").|$|E
25|$|Research {{concerning}} <b>qigong</b> {{has been}} conducted {{for a wide range}} of medical conditions, including hypertension, pain, and cancer treatment. Most systematic reviews of clinical trials have not been conclusive, and all have been based on poor quality clinical studies, such that no firm conclusions about the health effects of <b>qigong</b> can be drawn at this stage.|$|E
25|$|The Baduanjin qigong(八段錦) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common forms of Chinese <b>qigong</b> used as exercise. Variously {{translated}} as Eight Pieces of Brocade, Eight-Section Brocade, Eight Silken Movements or Eight Silk Weaving, the name of the form generally refers to how the eight individual movements of the form characterize and impart a silken quality (like that of a piece of brocade) to the body and its energy. The Baduanjin is primarily designated as a form of medical <b>qigong,</b> meant to improve health. This is in contrast to religious or martial forms of <b>qigong.</b> However, this categorization does not preclude the form's use by martial artists as a supplementary exercise, and this practice is frequent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qigong</b> for self-cultivation can be {{classified}} in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian.|$|E
25|$|Falun Gong {{has been}} {{classified}} variously {{as a form}} of spiritual cultivation practice in the tradition of Chinese antiquity, as a <b>qigong</b> discipline, or as a religion or new religious movement. <b>Qigong</b> refers to a broad set of exercises, meditation and breathing methods that have long been part of the spiritual practices of select Buddhist sects, of Daoist alchemists, martial artists, and some Confucian scholars.|$|E
25|$|In Confucianism {{practices}} {{now known}} as Confucian <b>Qigong</b> provide a means to become a Junzi (君子) through awareness of morality.|$|E
25|$|In Buddhism meditative {{practices}} {{now known}} as Buddhist <b>Qigong</b> {{are part of a}} spiritual path that leads to spiritual enlightenment or Buddhahood.|$|E
25|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} effect of <b>qigong</b> exercises on movement disorders found that the evidence was insufficient to recommend its use for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|In Daoism various {{practices}} {{now known}} as Daoist <b>Qigong</b> are claimed to provide a way to achieve longevity and spiritual enlightenment, {{as well as a}} closer connection with the natural world.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{systematic}} {{reviews of}} clinical research, {{it is not}} possible within current level of available evidence to draw conclusions concerning effectiveness of <b>qigong</b> for specific medical conditions at this stage.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally Bodhidharma is {{credited}} as {{founder of the}} martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century <b>qigong</b> manual known as the Yijin Jing.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of <b>qigong</b> {{is an important}} component in both internal and external style Chinese martial arts. Focus on qi {{is considered to be a}} source of power as well as the foundation of the internal style of martial arts (Neijia). T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Xing Yi, and Baguazhang are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of qi as the foundation. Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes (Iron Shirt, 鐵衫) and the ability to break hard objects (Iron Palm, 铁掌) are abilities attributed to <b>qigong</b> training.|$|E
25|$|In many Chinese martial arts, {{meditation}} {{is considered}} to be an important component of basic training. Meditation can be used to develop focus, mental clarity and can act as a basis for <b>qigong</b> training.|$|E
25|$|In 2004 {{there were}} an {{estimated}} 56,000 Taoists in the US. Taoism was popularized throughout {{the world through the}} writings and teachings of Lao Tzu and other Taoists as well as the practice of <b>Qigong,</b> Tai Chi Chuan and other Chinese martial arts.|$|E
25|$|The Falun Gong <b>qigong</b> {{movement}} uses {{a symbol}} {{that features a}} large swastika surrounded by four smaller (and rounded) ones, interspersed with yin-and-yang symbols. The usage is taken from traditional Chinese symbolism, and here alludes to a chakra-like portion of the esoteric human anatomy, located in the stomach.|$|E
