40|$|Electron {{motion in}} a CF 4 {{magnetic}} neutral loop discharge (NLD) plasma was simulated using a Monte Carlo method. The {{spatial distribution of}} electrons illustrated the fundamental structure of the NLD plasma, and its dynamics were depicted from the distributions of the mean electron energy, the electron energy gain and the azimuthal electron flux. The peak of mean electron energy appeared at the neutral loop (NL), which confirmed that electrons gain energy near this loop. High mean electron energy was observed not only near the NL but also along the separatrices of the <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Energetic electrons were transported along the separatrices and induced ionization at those locations. However, the electron distribution had valleys along the separatrices, because electrons accelerated near the NL were likely to leave this region where the binding of the magnetic field is weak. The azimuthal electron flux representing the loop plasma current showed that the electron conduction path around the NL, which has conventionally been modelled as a ring conductor, has a particular directionality due to the rectification effect of antiparallel magnetic fields composing the <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> The directionality in {{the upper and lower}} regions of the <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> was opposite to that in the inner and outer regions...|$|E

The beam dynamics of a gas-filled helical muon beam cooling channel is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations. The results verify the cooling theory [1] of the helical magnet. The cooling performance has been improved by correcting chromatic aberration and the non-linear effects caused by the ionization energy loss process.

The width of the electron diffusion region scales with the electron skin depth (∼ 5. 5 - 7. 5 c=ωpi) and the peak electron outflow velocity scales with the electron Alfven velocity (∼ 0. 12 - 0. 16 VeA), independent of ion mass...|$|E
40|$|We present {{analytic}} {{calculations of}} the electromagnetic torques acting on a magnetic neutron star rotating in vacuum, including near-zone torques associated with the inertia of dipole and <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> We incorporate these torques into the rotational dynamics of a rigid-body neutron star, and show {{that the effects of}} the inertial torque can be understood as a modification of the moment of inertia tensor of the star. We apply our rotational dynamics equation to the Crab pulsar, including intrinsic distortions of the star and various electromagnetic torques, to investigate the possibility that the counter-alignment of the magnetic inclination angle, as suggested by recent observations, could be explained by pulsar precession. We find that if the effective principal axis of the pulsar is nearly aligned with either the magnetic dipole axis or the rotation axis, then precession may account for the observed counter-alignment over decade timescales. Over the spindown timescale of the pulsar, the magnetic inclination angle always decreases. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|New {{ideas are}} being {{developed}} to cool muon beams for colliders, neutrino factories, and muon experiments. Analytical and simulation studies have confirmed that a six-dimensional (6 D) cooling channel based on helical magnets surrounding RF cavities filled with dense hydrogen gas {{can be used to}} achieve very small emittances. This helical cooling channel (HCC) has solenoidal, helical dipole, and helical <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> to generate emittance exchange and achieve 6 D emittance reduction of over 3 orders of magnitude in a 100 m segment. Three such sequential HCC segments, where the RF frequencies are increased and transverse dimensions reduced as the beams become cooler, implies a 6 D emittance reduction of almost six orders of magnitude. Two new post-cooling ideas then can be employed to reduce transverse emittances to one or two mm-mr, which allows high luminosity with fewer muons than previously imagined. We describe the new post-cooling ideas as well as a new precooling idea based on a HCC with z-dependent fields that can be used as an exceptional 6 D cooling demonstration experiment...|$|R

For <b>quadrupole</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradients at the trap center greater than ∼ 1 kG/cm, we find that stochastic diffusion of atoms out of the trapping volume becomes the dominant particle loss mechanism, ultimately limiting the MOT size to greater than ∼ 5 μm.

In addition, for as few as two atoms, the collisional loss rates become very high for tightly confined traps, allowing the direct observation of isolated two-body atomic collisions in a MOT...|$|E
