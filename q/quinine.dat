5|$|It {{would be}} nearly 200 {{years before the}} active principles, <b>quinine</b> and other alkaloids, of cinchona bark were isolated. <b>Quinine,</b> a toxic plant alkaloid, is, in {{addition}} to its anti-malarial properties, an effective muscle relaxant, as the modern use for nocturnal leg cramps suggests (corroborating its use for shivering by the Peruvian Indians).|$|E
5|$|<b>Quinine</b> {{became the}} {{predominant}} malarial medication until the 1920s when other medications {{began to be}} developed. In the 1940s, chloroquine replaced <b>quinine</b> as the treatment of both uncomplicated and severe malaria until resistance supervened, first in Southeast Asia and South America in the 1950s and then globally in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quinine</b> wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the stereoisomers.

40|$|Garlic is a {{very useful}} bulbous plant whose bulbs have been {{researched}} and well known for its therapeutic uses. However garlic scales are less explored and their role unclear. In our study garlic scales were screened for various phytochemicals namely Coumarines, <b>Quinines,</b> Phlobotannnins, Tannins, Phenols, Cardiac Glycosides, Anthraquinones, Glycosides, Steroids, Terpenoids, etc. Numerous extraction methods were carried out such as soxhlet, cold extractions and hot extractions. Key highlights were cardiac glycosides and <b>quinines</b> observed in the garlic scales. When antibacterial assay was carried out using the garlic scale extract it was shown to inhibit the growth of E. coli significantly. Further cell viability was carried out using MG 63 cells that showed that concentrations as low 100 mg increased the proliferation ability of cells. Whereas higher concentrations proved to inhibit cell proliferation. Therefore garlic scales seem to contain phytochemicals that have significant biological functions {{that are to be}} studied further...|$|R

The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E
5|$|Recommended {{treatment}} for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs. For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate {{was superior to}} <b>quinine</b> in both children and adults. In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as <b>quinine</b> {{in the treatment of}} cerebral malaria in children. Treatment of severe malaria involves supportive measures that are best done in a critical care unit. This includes the management of high fevers and the seizures that may result from it. It also includes monitoring for poor breathing effort, low blood sugar, and low blood potassium.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, traditional herbal remedies {{have been used}} to treat malaria. The first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains <b>quinine.</b> After the link to mosquitos and their parasites were identified in the early twentieth century, mosquito control measures such as widespread use of the insecticide DDT, swamp drainage, covering or oiling the surface of open water sources, indoor residual spraying and use of insecticide treated nets was initiated. Prophylactic <b>quinine</b> was prescribed in malaria endemic areas, and new therapeutic drugs, including chloroquine and artemisinins, were used to resist the scourge. Today, artemisinin is present in every remedy applied in treatment of malaria. After introducing artemisinin as a cure administered together with other remedies, the mortality in Africa went down by a half.|$|E
5|$|Malaria: During {{the early}} 1940s, <b>quinine</b> {{was the chief}} anti-malarial drug. Made from the bark of the South American cinchona tree, <b>quinine</b> was in short supply during the war, so {{scientists}} began searching for an alternative treatment. The test subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by malarial mosquitoes and when the fever reached its peak in three to four days, were given experimental treatments. At the University of Minnesota, twelve CPS men underwent tests to determine the recovery period for those infected with malaria. This research documented the debilitating effects {{of the disease and}} the amount of time required for a complete recovery.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans began using plant alkaloids in medical preparations as early as 3000 B.C. Although the active components of most medicinal plants have been isolated only recently (beginning in the early 19th century) these substances {{have been used as}} drugs throughout the human history in potions, medicines, teas and as poisons. For example, to combat herbivory by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, Cinchona trees produce a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is <b>quinine.</b> <b>Quinine</b> is extremely bitter, making the bark of the tree quite unpalatable, it is also an anti-fever agent, known as Jesuit's bark, and is especially useful in treating malaria.|$|E

However, the detailed mechanisms of substitution {{reactions of}} quinone are not clearly understood yet. Here, the reactions of 2 -methoxy- 3 -methyl- 1, 4 - naphthoquinone with primary alkylamines are studied. In the reaction, the substitution at the 2 -methoxy group yields 2 -alkylamino- 3 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone.

The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than <b>quinine.</b> Blackwater feverâ€”which had a mortality rate of 25%â€”disappeared entirely.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, before antibiotics, {{patients}} with tertiary syphilis were intentionally infected with malaria to induce a fever; this was called malariotherapy. In 1917, Julius Wagner-Jauregg, a Viennese psychiatrist, began to treat neurosyphilitics with induced Plasmodium vivax malaria. Three or four bouts of fever were enough to kill the temperature-sensitive syphilis bacteria (Spirochaeta pallida also known as Treponema pallidum). P. vivax infections were then terminated by <b>quinine.</b> By accurately controlling the fever with <b>quinine,</b> the effects of both syphilis and malaria could be minimized. While about 15% of patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis. Therapeutic malaria opened up a wide field of chemotherapeutic research and was practised until 1950.
