50|$|He {{has made}} {{significant}} contribution to the discovery of the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) in the laboratory. This state of matter existed in the first few microsecond old Universe. In such matter, quarks and gluons are de-confined and move freely in volumes much larger than nucleonic scales. In order to achieve such matter in the laboratory, temperatures of the order of 1012 degrees Kelvin need to be created. The quark-gluon plasma allows for studying transport properties like viscosity, thermal conductivity, opacity and diffusion co-efficient of QCD matter. Dr. Mohanty has several significant papers on signatures that experimentally confirm the existence of QGP, related to observation of strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, jet <b>quenching</b> <b>effect,</b> and partonic collectivity.|$|E
50|$|Most {{detection}} mechanisms {{involved in}} small molecule sensors comprise some modulation in the fluorescent {{behavior of the}} sensing molecule upon binding the target metal. When a metal coordinates to such a sensor, it may either enhance or reduce the original fluorescent emission. The former {{is known as the}} Chelation Enhancement Fluorescence effect (CHEF), while the latter is called the Chelation Enhancement <b>Quenching</b> <b>effect</b> (CHEQ). By changing the intensity of emission at different wavelengths, the resulting fluorescent spectrum may attenuate, amplify, or shift upon the binding and dissociation of a metal. This shift in spectra can be monitored using a detector such as a microscope or a photodiode.Listed below are some examples of mechanisms by which emission is modulated. Their participation in CHEQ or CHEF is dependent on the metal and small molecule sensor in question.|$|E
50|$|TaqMan probes are {{designed}} {{such that they}} anneal within a DNA region amplified by {{a specific set of}} primers. (Unlike the diagram, the probe binds to single stranded DNA.) As the Taq polymerase extends the primer and synthesizes the nascent strand (again, on a single-strand template, but in the direction opposite to that shown in the diagram, i.e. from 3' to 5' of the complementary strand), the 5' to 3' exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase degrades the probe that has annealed to the template. Degradation of the probe releases the fluorophore from it and breaks the close proximity to the quencher, thus relieving the <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> and allowing fluorescence of the fluorophore. Hence, fluorescence detected in the quantitative PCR thermal cycler is directly proportional to the fluorophore released and the amount of DNA template present in the PCR.|$|E

5000|$|There may be {{instances}} {{where it is}} cost effective not to apply the opaque overlay and laser peen the bare surface of the work piece directly. When laser peening a bare, metallic surface a thin, micrometer-range, layer of surface material is vaporized. The rapid rise in temperature causes surface melting to a depth dependent on pulse energy and duration, and target melting point. On aluminum alloys this depth is nominally 10-20 μm, but on steels and other higher melting point alloys the depths may be just a few micrometers. Due to the short duration of the pulse, the in-depth heating of the surface {{is limited to a}} few tens of micrometers due to the rapid <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> of the cold substrate. Some superficial surface staining of the work piece may occur, typically from oxidation products. These detrimental effects of bare surface processing, both aesthetic and metallurgical, can be removed after laser peening by light grinding or honing. With an opaque overlay in place, the target surface experiences temperature rises of less than [...] on a nanosecond time scale.|$|E
5000|$|Titanite, {{which is}} named for its {{titanium}} content, occurs as translucent to transparent, reddish brown, gray, yellow, green, or red monoclinic crystals. These crystals are typically sphenoid in habit and are often twinned. Possessing a subadamantine tending to slightly resinous luster, titanite has a hardness of 5.5 and a weak cleavage. Its specific gravity varies between 3.52 and 3.54. Titanite's refractive index is 1.885-1.990 to 1.915-2.050 with a strong birefringence of 0.105 to 0.135 (biaxial positive) under the microscope {{this leads to a}} distinctive high relief which combined with the common yellow-brown colour and lozenge-shape cross-section makes the mineral easy to identify. Transparent specimens are noted for their strong trichroism, the three colours presented being dependent on body colour. Owing to the <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> of iron, sphene exhibits no fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some titanite {{has been found to be}} metamict, in consequence of structural damage due to radioactive decomposition of the often significant thorium content. When viewed in thin section with a petrographic microscope, pleochroic halos can be observed in minerals surrounding a titanite crystal.|$|E

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed We have investigated {{the effect of the}} soybean isoflavone genistein on 8 -hydroxy- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) formation in calf thymus DNA exposed to either UV irradiation or the Fenton reaction system. Under the conditions used we observed that UV light and the Fenton reaction significantly increase 8 -OHdG formation in DNA. Co-incubation with genistein inhibits the formation of 8 -OHdG induced by either UV light irradiation or the Fenton reaction in a dose-dependent manner. The <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> of genistein on 8 -OHdG formation induced by UV light is much more potent than that by the Fenton reaction, suggesting that the mechanisms of 8 -OHdG formation may differ between the two systems. We further compared the antioxidant activities and <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> on 8 -OHdG formation of genistein with biochanin A. Genistein potently scavenges both hydrogen peroxide in the medium and superoxide anion generated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase, whereas biochanin A has either a weak or no scavenging effect on these reactive oxygen species. However, both genistein and biochanin A display a similar <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> on UV light-induced 8 -OHdG formation. These results suggest that the <b>quenching</b> <b>effect</b> of genistein and biochanin A on UV light-induced 8 -OHdG formation is different from their ability to scavenge hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion.
