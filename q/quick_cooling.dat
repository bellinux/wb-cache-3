40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of cold-start engine cycles which could be run in any one day would greatly improve the {{productivity}} of an engine test facility. However {{with the introduction of}} forced cooling procedures there is the inherent risk that test-to-test repeatability will be affected. Therefore an investigation into the effects caused by forced cooling on fuel consumption and the temperature distribution through the engine and fluids is essential. Testing was completed on a 2. 4 litre diesel engine running a cold NEDC. The test facility utilises a basic ventilation system, which draws in external ambient air, which is forced past the engine and then drawn out of the cell. This can be supplemented {{with the use of a}} spot cooling fan. The forced cool down resulted in a much <b>quicker</b> <b>cool</b> down which was further reduced with spot cooling, in the region of 25 % reduction.

50|$|Nearly 200 {{million years}} ago in the Jurassic period, the Conway granite that forms the walls of the Flume was deeply buried molten rock. As it cooled, the granite was broken by closely spaced {{vertical}} fractures which lay nearly parallel in a northeasterly direction. Sometime after the fractures were formed, small dikes of basalt were forced up along the fractures. The basalt came from deep within the earth as a fluid material, and because of pressure, was able to force the Conway granite aside. The basalt crystallized quickly against the relatively cold granite. Because of this <b>quick</b> <b>cooling,</b> the basalt is a fine- grained rock. Had this material ever reached the surface, it would have become lava flows.|$|E

50|$|The {{way that}} {{crystallization}} of sugars in marshmallows work, make them an amorphous solid. This {{is because the}} crystals formed are not grained, and very fine in size, as opposed to its crystalline counterpart where the crystals are grainy, and larger in size. This is why temperature plays such {{an important role in}} the production of marshmallows. To make an amorphous solid like marshmallow, the sugar syrup solution (sucrose, corn syrup, and invert sugar) is heated at a high temperature. It is then cooled so rapidly that no crystals have time to form. The <b>quick</b> <b>cooling</b> of the liquid in open air does not allow the sucrose molecules to form crystals, so glass (amorphous) crystals are created instead. In most confections, a combination of different sugars is used, each of which influence the solubility concentration of one another. The presence of invert sugar and/or corn syrup causes a substantial decrease in sucrose solubility due to the competition among the sugar molecules for water.|$|E

The novel cast steel after various heat treatments was characterized by microstructure observations and mechanical properties measurement {{in order to achieve}} an optimal process correlated with good abrasive resistance for a long marine service. Differential scanning calorimetry and hardness analyses deduced a complete austenitizing temperature of 1 000 °C, based on the alloying element homogenization and defective structure elimination without grain coarsening. An optimal austempering process (austenitized at 1 000 °C, <b>quick</b> <b>cooled</b> for holding at 350 °C for 1. 5 h and then air-cooled to room temperature) produced a uniform mixture structure of fine carbide-free aciculate bainites and few lath martensites, resulting in the tensile strength increase of 34 % and impact toughness increase of 50 % compared with that of the as-cast steel. The abrasive wheel tests show that the austempered steel has good wear resistance with a mass-loss rate of 170 mg/(km·cm 2) under applied load of 70 N in acidic slurry. The new grade steel (containing anti-corrosion elements of Cr and rare earth) can find wide application in marine engineering, with further enhanced comprehensive properties via melting process improvement...|$|R

50|$|Having {{a single}} edge {{provides}} certain advantages; one {{being that the}} rest of the sword can be used to reinforce and support the edge. The Japanese style of sword-making takes full advantage of this. When forging is complete, the steel is not quenched in the conventional European fashion (i.e.: uniformly throughout the blade). Steel’s exact flex and strength vary dramatically with heat treating. If steel cools quickly it becomes martensite, which is very hard but brittle. Slower and it becomes pearlite, which bends easily and does not hold an edge. To maximize both the cutting edge and the resilience of the sword spine, a technique of differential heat-treatment is used. In this specific process, referred to as differential hardening or differential quenching, the sword is painted with layers of clay before heating, providing a thin layer or none at all on the edge of the sword, ensuring <b>quick</b> <b>cooling</b> to maximize the hardening for the edge. A thicker layer of clay is applied to the rest of the blade, causing slower cooling. This creates softer, more resilient steel, allowing the blade to absorb shock without breaking. This process is sometimes erroneously called differential tempering but this is actually an entirely different form of heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Cast Iron - {{the product}} {{extracted}} from iron ore. Iron oxide-rich ore is heated to a molten {{state in the}} presence of limestone within a large flask. Oxygen makes a chemical transition from the iron oxides to the calcium forming a [...] "slag" [...] which floats to the top of an increasingly iron-rich molten pool. When done, the bottom of the flask is opened and the iron pours out - historically into sand patterns to produce cast iron stoves and such, or into troughs on the foundry floor to form rough billets. The billets could be re-melted and cast into shapes at other foundries or could be hammered into wrought iron in forges. Good news is cast iron flows easily into molds and can be used to quickly form intricate articles from iron. Bad news is that cast iron is brittle and cracks rather than bends. Brittle because it is not pure iron - impurities are not completely leached from the ore and carbon from the heating fuel is absorbed into the iron pool. <b>Quick</b> <b>cooling</b> of the iron in a mold also increases brittleness - smaller, thinner pieces (like hinges) are usually more brittle than larger, heavier pieces (like machines) that [...] "hold their heat" [...] when poured and thus take longer to cool.|$|E
5000|$|A {{second example}} of ice-marginal lava flows can again {{be found in}} British Columbia, this time near the border of Alaska. The Hoodoo Mountain Volcano is located in Northwestern British Columbia The volcano formed {{underneath}} a glacier, making it a subglacial formation. The Hoodoo Mountain Volcano is a flat-topped stratovolcano {{as a result of}} its subglacial beginnings. Currently the volcano is surrounded on all sides, except the south, by glaciers. What does Hoodoo mountain have to do with ice-marginal lava flows? Well, the entirety of the mountain is also surrounded by enormous lava cliffs, ranging from 50m-200m in height, as seen in Figure 3. The clearest example of these lava cliffs is seen on the southwestern side of the mountain whereas the northern formation of these cliffs has been overridden by recent lava flows and glacial erosion. Scientists are able to diagnose these lava cliff formations as a result of ice-marginal lava flows because of specific features such as the [...] "glassy" [...] chemical composition of the lava and columnar jointing, which are evidence of fairly <b>quick</b> <b>cooling</b> of an erupted lava flow. Scientists are able to determine that about 80 thousand years ago Hoodoo Mountain was completely surrounded by ice. Also 80 thousand years ago, there was an eruption from Hoodoo Mountain and as the lava poured down the slope, the lava came into contact with the ice that completely surrounded the volcano and cooled very quickly, forming a barrier around the entire volcano. The lava cooled, pooled and as the glacial ice receded, it left behind massive lava cliffs.|$|E

The alloys were characterized by SEM BSE imaging, XRD, EBSD, TEM and micro-hardness measurements to determine processing-structure-property relations. For the as-deposited alloy, α-Ti, β-Ti, and TiCr 2 (C 15 Laves) phases exist in varying phase fractions, which were influential in determining hardness values. With the furnace cooled alloy, there was more homogeneous nucleation of α phase throughout the sample with a larger phase fraction of TiCr 2 resulting in increased hardness values. When compared to the air cooled alloy, there was absence of wide scale nucleation of α phase and formation of ω phase within the β phase due to the <b>quicker</b> <b>cooling</b> from elevated temperature. At lower concentrations of Cr, the kinetics resulted in a diffusionless phase transformation of ω phase with increased hardness and a lower phase fraction of TiCr 2. In contrast at higher Cr concentrations, α phase separation reaction occurs where the β phase is spinodally decomposed to Cr solute-lean β 1 and solute-rich β 2 resulting in reduced hardness...|$|R

DESIGN: Controlled-rate freezing of human blastocysts using different start temperatures and cooling rates. SETTING: Private assisted reproductive technology unit. PATIENT(S) : Patients donated with consent cryopreserved pronucleate embryos. INTERVENTION(S) : Culture of thawed pronucleate embryos in G III series media, containing hyaluronan, followed by cryopreservation of 36 blastocysts with subsequent noninvasive analysis of embryo metabolism. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Pyruvate and glucose consumption and blastocyst reexpansion and quality. RESULT(S) : Glucose consumption and blastocyst reexpansion after thaw were significantly higher when a start temperature of - 6 degrees C and a cooling rate of 0. 5 degrees C/min to - 32 degrees C were used compared with a start temperature of 20 degrees C and a cooling rate of 2 degrees C to - 6 degrees C, followed by cooling at 0. 3 degrees C to - 35 degrees C.
