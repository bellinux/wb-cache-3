6000|$|Looking {{around to}} find just where the natural service of the House of Commons comes in, I am {{inclined}} {{to think that it}} must be in the practice of [...] "asking questions" [...] in the House. Whenever anything goes wrong a member rises and asks a question. He gets up, for example, with a little paper in his hand, and asks the government if ministers are aware that the Khedive of Egypt was seen yesterday wearing a Turkish Tarbosh. Ministers say very humbly that they hadn't known it, and a thrill runs through the whole country. The members can apparently ask any questions they like. In the repeated visits which I made to the gallery of the House of Commons I was unable to find any particular sense or meaning in the questions asked, though no doubt they had an intimate bearing on English politics not clear to an outsider like myself. I heard one member ask the government whether they were aware that herrings were being imported from Hamburg to Harwich. The government said no. Another member rose and asked the government whether they considered Shakespere or Moliere the greater dramatic artist. The government answered that ministers were taking this under their earnest consideration and that a report would be submitted to Parliament. Another member asked the government if they knew who won the Queen's Plate this season at Toronto. They did,--in fact this member got in wrong, as this is the very thing that the government do know. Towards the close of the evening a member rose and asked the government if they knew what time it was. The Speaker, however, ruled this <b>question</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> on the ground that it had been answered before.|$|E
50|$|Lambert {{presided over}} the House of Commons during a tenuous {{minority}} government situation. As speaker, Lambert strove to be very correct in his interpretation <b>of</b> standing <b>orders,</b> ruling opposition <b>questions</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> during <b>Question</b> Period {{if they were not}} strict inquiries and strayed at all into argumentation. This displeased the Opposition and led to his rulings being appealed unsuccessfully.|$|R
50|$|Drummond {{attempts}} to question Brady about {{his knowledge of}} the writings of Charles Darwin, but the Judge rules these <b>questions</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order.</b> Drummond then asks Brady about the truthfulness behind the story of Jonah and the whale and other Biblical accounts. Brady states they are all true, and Drummond accuses him of wanting to throw all modern science <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the classroom. Davenport objects to Drummond's line of questioning, but Brady declares that Drummond is only playing into his hands. Drummond submits that science has forced the human race to abandon its faith in a literal interpretation of the Bible. God gave man the ability to reason, so why can't he use that ability to question the Bible, Drummond asks. He also asks Brady if the ability to think is what distinguishes a man from a sponge. Brady responds that God determines who shall be a man and who shall be a sponge. Drummond declares that Cates only demands the same rights as a sponge: To think. The crowd in the courtroom erupts in applause.|$|R
500|$|Weaver {{had still}} not arrived, and the Socialist Labor delegates took the {{opportunity}} to call for a re-vote on their land plank and the women's suffrage issue. The delegates overruled the chairman's decision that the <b>question</b> was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order,</b> and overwhelmingly voted that the [...] "land, air, and water" [...] plank and a plank explicitly supporting women's suffrage should be considered [...] "part of the platform". Finally, at 6:00a.m., Weaver arrived. To thunderous applause, the nominee thanked the convention for its decision and accepted the nomination. At 6:45a.m., the exhausted delegates adjourned.|$|R
5000|$|The {{characterization}} of Lindzen as a contrarian has been reinforced by {{reports that he}} claims that lung cancer has only been weakly linked to smoking. However, when asked about this during an interview {{as part of an}} Australian Broadcasting Company documentary, Lindzen said that while [...] "the case for second-hand tobacco is not very good ... the World Health Organization also said that” (referencing a 1998 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)), on the other hand [...] "With first-hand smoke it's a more interesting issue ... The case for lung cancer is very good but it also ignores {{the fact that there are}} differences in people's susceptibilities which the Japanese studies have pointed to." [...] Again, when asked to clarify his position by a climate skeptic blogger, Lindzen wrote, [...] "there was a reasonable case for the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer, but that the case was not so strong that one should rule that any <b>questions</b> were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>order</b> ... the much, much weaker case against second hand smoke is also being treated as dogma." ...|$|R
