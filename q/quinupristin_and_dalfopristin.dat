40|$|Objectives: (i) To {{determine}} the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of ABT- 773, a novel keto-lide, against sensitive and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci; (ii) to subdivide erythromycin-resistant pneumococci into resistance phenotypes, more extensive than the conventional M and MLSB groups, by assessing susceptibilities to, and interactions between, erythromycin (14 -membered macrolide), clindamycin (lincosamide), rokitamycin (16 -membered macrolide), ABT- 773 (ketolide), <b>quinupristin</b> (streptogramin B) <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> (streptogramin A). Methods: MICs and MBCs of ABT- 773 were determined for 165 strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin).

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the activities of}} quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), alone or in combination with rifampin, against three strains of Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to rifampin (MIC, 0. 06 μg/ml) and to Q-D (MICs, 0. 5 to 1 μg/ml) but displaying various phenotypes of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics: S. aureus HM 1054 was susceptible to <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> (MICs of 8 and 4 μg/ml, respectively); for S. aureus RP 13, the MIC of dalfopristin was high (MICs of <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> for strain RP 13, 8 and 32 μg/ml, respectively); and S. aureus HM 1054 R was obtained after conjugative transfer of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B constitutive resistance to HM 1054, and the MIC of quinupristin for this strain was high (MICs of <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin,</b> 64 and 4 μg/ml, respectively). In vitro time-kill curve studies showed no difference between Q-D and rifampin, at a concentration of four times the MIC, against the three strains. Rabbits with aortic endocarditis were treated 4 days with Q-D, rifampin, or their combination. In vivo, the combination was highly bactericidal and synergistic against strains susceptible to quinupristin (HM 1054 and RP 13) and sterilized 94 % of the animals. In contrast, the combination was neither synergistic nor bactericidal against the quinupristin-resistant strain (HM 1054 R) and did not prevent the emergence of mutants resistant to rifampin. We conclude that the in vivo synergistic and bactericidal activity of the combination of Q-D and rifampin against S. aureus is predicted {{by the absence of}} resistance to quinupristin but not by in vitro combination studies...|$|E

Baseline MICs/minimal bactericidal concentrations (μg/ml) for quinupristin-dalfopristin, <b>quinupristin,</b> <b>dalfopristin,</b> <b>and</b> doxycycline were 0. 25 / 2, 64 /> 512, 4 / 512, and 0. 125 / 8 for VREF 12311 and 0. 25 / 32, 128 /> 512, 2 / 128, and 0. 25 / 16 for VREF 12366, respectively. Quinupristin-dalfopristin regimens had significantly less activity against VREF 12366 than VREF 12311. An 8 -μg/ml simulated continuous infusion was the only bactericidal regimen with time to 99. 9 % killing = 90 hours. The combination of quinupristin-dalfopristin every 8 h with doxycycline resulted in more killing compared to either drug alone. Quinupristin-dalfopristin-resistant mutants (MICs, 4 μg/ml; resistance proportion, ∼ 4 × 10 − 4) emerged during the quinupristin-dalfopristin monotherapies for both VREF strains. Resistance was unstable in VREF 12311 and stable in VREF 12366. The 8 -μg/ml continuous infusion or addition of doxycycline to quinupristin-dalfopristin prevented the emergence of resistance for both strains over the 96 -h test period. These findings replicated the development of resistance reported in humans and emphasized bacterial factors (drug susceptibility, high inoculum, organism growth phase) and infectious conditions (penetration barriers) which could increase chances for clinical resistance.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} the streptogramin antibiotics <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> was studied in a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate selected under quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy, in four derivatives of S. aureus RN 4220 selected in vitro, and in a mutant selected in a model of rabbit aortic endocarditis. For all strains the MICs of erythromycin, quinupristin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were higher than those for the parental strains but the MICs of dalfopristin and lincomycin were similar. Portions of genes for domains II and V of 23 S rRNA and the genes for ribosomal proteins L 4 and L 22 were amplified and sequenced.

Since fluoroquinolones and related macrolides have displayed high intracellular concentrations inside host cells, we evaluated the intracellular activities of these agents inside neutrophils against three strains each of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF). At concentrations equal to four times the MIC, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin decreased the number of intracellular VSEF organisms, while both antibiotics were at best bacteriostatic against intracellular VREF strains. At concentrations equal to one-fourth of the MIC, both antibiotics were bacteriostatic against intracellular VSEF strains but were ineffective in inhibiting the growth of VREF strains. Despite their anticipated markedly higher intracellular human neutrophil (PMN) concentrations, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin activities in medium alone were equal to or greater than those inside PMNs against almost all strains.

We evaluated the bactericidal activity of this antimicrobial against 30 recent clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, including 23 erythromycin-resistant (MIC, > 256 microg/ml) and 7 erythromycin-intermediate (MIC, 2 to 4 microg/ml) strains. All isolates were inhibited by RP 59500 at 0. 25 to 1. 0 microg/ml. The bactericidal activity of RP 59500 was markedly influenced by the erythromycin susceptibility of the strains and by several technical factors, such as inoculum growth phase and time of incubation of counting plates. As determined by time-kill methods, RP 59500 at a concentration of 2 or 8 microg/ml failed to kill erythromycin-resistant organisms under any conditions. Bactericidal activity was observed against all seven erythromycin-intermediate isolates when log-phase inocula were used and the cells were counted after 48 h of incubation (mean reductions in viable bacteria for RP 59500 at concentrations of 2 and 8 microg/ml, 3. 45 and 3. 50 log 10 CFU/ml, respectively), but killing was diminished when the plates were examined at 72 h (mean killing, 3. 06 and 2. 95 log 10, CFU/ml, respectively). No bactericidal activity was observed when stationary-phase cultures were used. On the basis of these data, we expect that bactericidal activity of RP 59500 against the multiple-drug-resistant E. faecium strains currently encountered would be distinctly uncommon...|$|E

Comparison was made to pharmacokinetic profiles determined for eight healthy volunteers matched by age, sex, and race. Drug was measured in dialysate up to 6 h following the dose. Plasma and dialysate were assayed for parent compounds and metabolites. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between groups.

30|$|Due to few {{antibiotics}} and free availability of effective antibiotics against diverse bacterial species the antimicrobial era {{is threatened by}} high levels of antibiotic resistance (Song [2008]).

MethodsMICs were determined using a microdilution procedure in H-Medium. ResultsAll listeriae were naturally sensitive or intermediate to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, penicillins (except oxacillin), loracarbef, cefazoline, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefoperazone, carbapenems, macrolides, lincosamides, glycopeptides, dalfopristin/quinupristin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin (probably except L. grayi). Listeria spp. were naturally resistant or intermediate to most ‘modern’ cephalosporins (cefetamet, cefixime, ceftibuten, ceftazidime, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime), aztreonam, pipemidic acid, <b>dalfopristin</b> <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> sulfamethoxazole.

The following experiments investigate the ability of RP 59500 to prevent experimental endocarditis due to either of two erythromycin-susceptible streptococcal isolates or their constitutively erythromycin-resistant Tn 916 delta E transconjugants. RP 59500 had low MICs (0. 125 to 0. 5 mg/liter) for all four test organisms and was substantially bactericidal in vitro. Rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were given single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis 30 to 60 min before bacterial inoculation through a computerized pump system which permitted the simulation of drug kinetics for humans produced by either 7 mg of RP 59500 per kg of body weight or 1 g of vancomycin. Single-dose RP 59500 prophylaxis successfully prevented endocarditis due to both the erythromycin-susceptible parent strains and their erythromycin-resistant derivatives in rats challenged with the minimal inoculum infecting 90 % of controls. In addition, RP 59500 also prevented infection in animals challenged with fivefold-larger inocula of the erythromycin-susceptible parent strains.

Quinupristin/dalfopristin (3 : 7) has been {{examined in this}} context. Methods <b>Quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> were used separately or mixed. Strains used were: (i) methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA); (ii) one vat(B) MSSA and msr(A/B) MRSA; (iii) erm(A) (+) [MSSA, MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) ]; and (iv) one erm(A/B) (+) cfr(+) MRSA resistant to quinupristin, dalfopristin and their combination. Assessment of activity was determined by: (i) MICs (CLSI method); and (ii) concentration-response curves in broth and after phagocytosis by THP- 1 macrophages, with descriptors of the model (E(min)) and the pharmacodynamic response [maximal relative efficacy (E(max)), relative potency (EC(50)) and apparent static concentration (C(static)) ]. Results erm(A) -positive strains were all susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin (except strain CM 05), with MICs not adversely influenced by acid pH or by the MRSA, VISA or VRSA character of the strain. In concentration-response experiments, quinupristin/dalfopristin showed similar patterns for all strains (except strain CM 05), with a > 3 log(10) cfu decrease in broth and a 1. 3 [erm(A) strain] to 2. 6 [fully susceptible, vat(B) and msr(A/B) strains] log(10) cfu decrease for intracellular bacteria at the maximal extracellular concentration tested (25 mg/L). Maximal extracellular and intracellular activity was obtained for a quinupristin/dalfopristin ratio of 3 : 7. For strain CM 05, quinupristin/dalfopristin was static in all conditions.

This phenotype was also detected in eight other strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. No genes already known and conferring resistance to dalfopristin by acetylation or active efflux were detected in these LSA strains. Nineteen other strains resistant to erythromycin but susceptible to the quinupristin-dalfopristin combination displayed elevated MICs of quinupristin after induction (from 16 to > 128 μg/ml) and contained ermB genes.

For 261 pneumococci, XRP 2868 and pristinamycin MICs were similar, irrespective of penicillin G and erythromycin A susceptibilities (MIC at which 50 % of isolates were inhibited [MIC 50], 0. 25 μg/ml; MIC 90, 0. 5 μg/ml), while quinupristin/dalfopristin had MICs which were 1 to 2 dilutions higher. Single components of both XRP 2868 and quinupristin/dalfopristin had higher MICs. Erythromycin A, azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin MICs were higher for penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant than -susceptible pneumococci.

40|$|Combinations {{of group}} A and B streptogramins (i. e., <b>dalfopristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>quinupristin)</b> are “last-resort ” {{antibiotics}} for the treat-ment of infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Resistance to streptogramins has arisen via multiple mechanisms, including the deactivation {{of the group}} A component by the large family of virginiamycin O-acetyltransferase (Vat) enzymes. Despite the structural elucida-tion performed for the VatD acetyltransferase, which provided a general molecular framework for activity, a detailed character-ization of the essential catalytic and antibiotic substrate-binding determinants in Vat enzymes is still lacking. We have deter-mined the crystal structure of S. aureus VatA in apo, virginiamycin M 1 - and acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) -bound forms and provide an extensive mutagenesis and functional analysis of the structural determinants required for catalysis and streptogramin A rec-ognition. Based on an updated genomic survey across the Vat enzyme family, we identified key conserved residues critical for VatA activity that {{are not part of}} the O-acetylation catalytic apparatus. Exploiting such constraints of the Vat active site may lead to the development of streptogramin A compounds that evade inactivation by Vat enzymes while retaining binding to their ribo-somal target. Due to resistance, the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Entero-coccus spp., is increasingly difficult (1).

40|$|Enterococcus faecalis {{isolates}} {{are resistant}} to clindamycin (CLI) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), and this {{is thought to be}} a species characteristic. Disruption of a gene (abc- 23, now designated lsa, for “lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance”) of E. faecalis was associated with a ≥ 40 -fold decrease in MICs of Q-D (to 0. 75 μg/ml), CLI (to 0. 12 to 0. 5 μg/ml), <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> (DAL) (to 4 to 8 μg/ml) for the wild-type E. faecalis parental strain (Q-D MIC, 32 μg/ml; CLI MIC, 32 to 48 μg/ml; DAL MIC, 512 μg/ml). Complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the MICs of CLI, Q-D, and DAL to wild-type levels. Under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of E. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. Among 19 erm(B) -lacking Enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47 %) were highly susceptible to CLI (MIC, 0. 06 to 0. 25 μg/ml) and had DAL MICs of 4 to 16 μg/ml; for the remaining erm(B) -lacking E. faecium strains, the CLI and DAL MICs were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 μg/ml, respectively. In contrast, none of 32 erm(B) -lacking E. faecalis strains were susceptible (CLI MIC range, 16 to 32 μg/ml; DAL MIC range, ≥ 32 μg/ml). When lsa was introduced into an E. faecium strain initially susceptible to CLI, the MICs of CLI and DAL increased ≥ 60 -fold and that of Q-D increased 6 -fold (to 3 to 6 μg/ml). Introduction of lsa into two DAL-resistant (MICs, > 128 μg/ml), Q-D-susceptible (MICs, 0. 5 and 1. 5 μg/ml) E. faecium strains (CLI MICs, 12 and > 256 μg/ml) resulted in an increase in the Q-D MICs from 3 - to 10 -fold (to 8 and > 32 μg/ml), respectively. Although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64 %) of the predicted Lsa protein to ABC proteins such as Vga(A), Vga(B), and Msr(A) of Staphylococcus aureus and YjcA of Lactococcus lactis and the presence of Walker A and B ATP-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. In conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of E. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to CLI and Q-D...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{bacterial}} ribosome is {{a primary}} target of several classes of antibiotics. Investigation {{of the structure of}} the ribosomal subunits in complex with different antibiotics can reveal the mode of inhibition of ribosomal protein synthesis. Analysis of the interactions between antibiotics and the ribosome permits investigation of the specific effect of modifications leading to antimicrobial resistances. Streptogramins are unique among the ribosome-targeting antibiotics because they consist of two components, streptogramins A and B, which act synergistically. Each compound alone exhibits a weak bacteriostatic activity, whereas the combination can act bactericidal. The streptogramins A display a prolonged activity that even persists after removal of the drug. However, the mode of activity of the streptogramins has not yet been fully elucidated, despite a plethora of biochemical and structural data. Results The investigation of the crystal structure of the 50 S ribosomal subunit from Deinococcus radiodurans in complex with the clinically relevant streptogramins <b>quinupristin</b> <b>and</b> <b>dalfopristin</b> reveals their unique inhibitory mechanism. Quinupristin, a streptogramin B compound, binds in the ribosomal exit tunnel in a similar manner and position as the macrolides, suggesting a similar inhibitory mechanism, namely blockage of the ribosomal tunnel. Dalfopristin, the corresponding streptogramin A compound, binds close to quinupristin directly within the peptidyl transferase centre affecting both A- and P-site occupation by tRNA molecules. Conclusions The crystal structure indicates that the synergistic effect derives from direct interaction between both compounds and shared contacts with a single nucleotide, A 2062. Upon binding of the streptogramins, the peptidyl transferase centre undergoes a significant conformational transition, which leads to a stable, non-productive orientation of the universally conserved U 2585. Mutations of this rRNA base are known to yield dominant lethal phenotypes. It seems, therefore, plausible to conclude that the conformational change within the peptidyl transferase centre is mainly responsible for the bactericidal activity of the streptogramins and the post-antibiotic inhibition of protein synthesis...|$|E

Materials and methods: Multiply-resistant E. faecium were isolated from three female patients aged 9 months, 2 and 15 years during a 10 day time span. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by microbroth dilution. Clonal relatedness among the isolates was investigated via SmaI-macrorestriction analysis by PFGE, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and plasmid profiling. Presence of virulence and resistance determinants was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Selected resistance genes were localized by Southern hybridizations. Results: A single E. faecium isolate per patient was investigated. All exhibited resistances to quinupristin/ dalfopristin, vancomycin/teicoplanin, streptomycin (high-level), penicillin/ampicillin, erythromycin, oxy-tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and fusidic acid.

Vancomycin, {{one of the most}} effective antibiotics against MRSA, is often combined used with rifampicin, gentamicin, <b>dalfopristin,</b> <b>and</b> β-lactams to slow the development of resistance and enhance the antibacterial activity.

The FICI of NZ 2114 combined with ampicillin, and vancomycin to S. aureus ATCC 43300 was 0.125, showing additivity effect (Zhang et al. 2014). However, the indifference effects (1.25  ≤ FICI ≤  3) were observed for all combinations between H 1, H 2, H 3 and four traditional antibiotics to S. aureus ATCC 43300 (Table  4), which might result from the changed antimicrobial property and mechanism and its details should be studied in our next research.|$|R

Materials and Methods: Between March 2006 and August 2007, 200 enterococcal isolates from urine, blood, stool and wound were recovered in 2 teaching hospitals of Tehran province. Susceptibility of all isolates was tested against vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid antibiotics by disk diffusion and agar dilution method.

40|$|The semisynthetic {{streptogramin}} antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin (trade name Synercid, Aventis Pharma) is {{a mixture}} of the A-type streptogramin <b>dalfopristin</b> <b>and</b> the B-type streptogramin quinupristin, a capped hexapeptide macrolactone. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was developed to combat multidrug resistant pathogens, but suffers from its own problems with drug resistance. Virginiamycin B lyase (Vgb) inactivates the quinupristin component of Synercid by lactone ring opening. Remarkably, the enzyme promotes this reaction by intramolecular β-elimination without the involvement of a water molecule. Recently, structures of S. aureus Vgb in the presence and absence of substrate were reported and used together with detailed mutagenesis data to suggest a catalytic mechanism. Here, we report an independent determination of the S. cohnii Vgb crystal structure and a biochemical characterization of the enzyme. As expected, the S. cohnii and S. aureus Vgb structures and active sites are very similar. Moreover, both enzymes catalyze quinupristin lactone ring opening with similar rate constants, albeit perhaps with different dependencies on divalent metal ions. Replacement of the conserved active site residues His 228, Glu 268, or His 270 with alanine reduces or abolishes S. cohnii Vgb activity. Residue Lys 285 in S. cohnii Vgb is spatially equivalent to the S. aureus Vgb active site residue Glu 284. A glutamate but not an alanine residue can substitute for the lysine without significant loss of activity...|$|R
