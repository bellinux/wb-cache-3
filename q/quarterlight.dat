2500|$|The Mark III Mini was {{launched}} in 1969, which was {{an updated version of}} Mark II with a modified bodyshell. The most visible changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. The boot lid lost the original hinged number plate and its recess shape and a large rear colour-coded lamp was fitted in its place, along with larger rear side windows. Sliding windows were replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening <b>quarterlight</b> windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones. as a cost-saving measure. Production at the Cowley plant was ended, and the simple name [...] "Mini" [...] completely replaced the separate Austin and Morris brands.|$|E
5000|$|Although its profile {{was very}} {{different}} from that of previous Jaguars, the side window surrounds and opening rear [...] "no draught ventilator" [...] (<b>quarterlight)</b> windows are reminiscent of Jaguar Mark IV saloons.|$|E

5000|$|The Verde has an {{aluminium}} structure, {{which is}} related {{to that of the}} smaller Pointer. The flat-sided, boxy shape is also {{similar to that of the}} Pointer, except for the front end, which has a [...] "barrel-curvature" [...] windscreen plus <b>quarterlights</b> with an arched top.On early vehicles (primarily the Scania N113s and DAF SB220s), the side windows have rounded corners and the <b>quarterlights</b> are deeper than the windscreen. Later built vehicles have square-cornered windows, an enlarged cab side window with an angled corner like that on the Pointer, and <b>quarterlights</b> which finish level with the windscreen. Minor alterations were also made to the front dash panel.|$|R
50|$|Its {{prominent}} feature was {{its large}} one-piece front windscreen, with large triangular <b>quarterlights</b> {{giving the impression}} that it wrapped around {{the sides of the}} body.|$|R
50|$|In 1993 the PR112 was {{launched}} as an updated and {{revised version of}} the PR100 with a new front end designed by Safra, losing the distinctive windscreen and front <b>quarterlight</b> design. The last PR112 was delivered in 1999.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} model (internal designation Typ 8N) was launched as a Coupé in September 1998, {{followed by a}} Roadster in August 1999. It {{is based on the}} Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform as used for the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, the original Audi A3, the Škoda Octavia, and others. The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of rear <b>quarterlight</b> windows behind the doors. Factory production commenced October 1998.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{characteristic}} Midland Railway {{features were}} {{incorporated in the}} design of early LMS coaches which distinguished them from those of other lines. Most noticeable of these was the twin-window arrangement in each seating bay of the vestibule coaches. This took the form of two rectangular windows side by side (one fixed and one drop-light), rather than a single window or centre drop-light with two flanking <b>quarterlight</b> arrangement. There was generally a Stones pattern ventilator in the eaves panel above the fixed light of these window pairs.|$|E

The thickness of the armor varied between 6 to 15 mm and weighed a total of 1840 kg. The pilot's canopy used armored glass 100 mm thick for the main windshield and 65 mm for the <b>quarterlights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Interior {{fittings}} were reasonably comprehensive by {{the standards}} of the time, with a full width shelf under the dashboard and [...] "useful pivoting ventilator panels" [...] (hinged <b>quarterlights)</b> at the front edge of each of the front doors and a rear window blind included in the price. [...] Instrumentation included an oil pressure gauge, an ammeter and an electric clock. [...] Also available, albeit at extra cost, was a heater.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the life}} of the Golf MK2, {{there were a number of}} {{external}} style revisions. Notable changes to the looks of the Golf MK2 included the removal of <b>quarterlight</b> windows in the front doors, and the introduction of larger grille slats with the August 1987 facelift. The most notable was the introduction of so-called [...] "Big Bumpers", which were introduced in the European market with an August 1989 facelift. They were available in the US from August 1989 as well, as part of the [...] "Wolfsburg Edition" [...] package. They were not standardized until January 1990.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark III Mini had a {{modified}} bodyshell with enough alterations {{to see the}} factory code change from ADO15 to ADO20 (which it shared with the Clubman). The most obvious changes were larger doors with concealed hinges. Customer demand led to the sliding windows being replaced with winding windows—although some Australian-manufactured Mark I Minis had adopted this feature in 1965 (with opening <b>quarterlight</b> windows). The suspension reverted from Hydrolastic to rubber cones as a cost-saving measure. [...] (The 1275 GT and Clubman would retain the hydrolastic system until June 1971 when they, too, switched to the rubber cone suspension of the original Minis.) ...|$|E

5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was {{visually}} similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, {{and access to the}} luggage boot (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front <b>quarterlights,</b> and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening <b>quarterlights,</b> extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half shafts, steering box, and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{distinct}} {{designs of}} front end were fitted. The first had two-piece flat windscreens which {{met at a}} slight point in the centre, EL2000-style headlights with separate indicators above, and a shallow, plain bumper. The second (and more common) had a two-piece [...] "barrel" [...] curved windscreen with level top, a slatted grille matching {{the height of the}} headlights, indicators in the headlight surrounds, and a noticeably chunkier bumper. Both windscreen styles had <b>quarterlights.</b>|$|R
50|$|A new (slightly) curved-glass {{windscreen}} {{was introduced}} with hinged <b>quarterlights</b> and wind-up side windows. Exterior door handles were {{provided for the}} first time, with separate door locks. Though the car could now be secured, with a soft-top roof the added protection was limited. The rear suspension was modified from quarter-elliptic to semi-elliptic leaf springs, which gave a more comfortable ride for a near-negligible weight penalty {{as well as providing}} additional axle location, the upper links fitted to the quarter-elliptic models being deleted. Though scarcely sybaritic, these changes helped the Sprite and Midget compete with the recently released Triumph Spitfire. 25,905 Mark III Sprites were made.|$|R
5000|$|Built in the Australian British Motor Corporation factory at Zetland, New South Wales, using 80% local content, the Morris Mini K was {{advertised as}} the [...] "great leap forward". The Mini K ('K' {{standing}} for Kangaroo) had a 1098 cc engine {{and was the}} last round-nose model to be produced in Australia, originally priced at A$1780. The Mini K was offered in 2-door saloon [...] and 2-door van body styles. [...] It was distinctive in having wind-up windows and a swivelling <b>quarterlight</b> in Mk.I-style externally hinged doors. A small round sticker with a kangaroo logo {{was placed on the}} triangular panel between the door and the front body seam. The [...] "Kangaroo" [...] name was supposedly coined because it is claimed that a kangaroo can go all day without drinking which the advertisers used to emphasise the frugal fuel consumption and, possibly, larger fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin binnacles closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the <b>quarterlight</b> vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{different}} shapes of windscreen were fitted to Paladins. One was of gentle [...] "barrel shaped" [...] curvature, with deep <b>quarterlights</b> and an arched top. This was {{used throughout the}} production run, being fitted to both the earliest vehicles and to the last batches built. An upright [...] "wrap-around" [...] screen with an arched top was used on the majority of midi-sized Paladin bodies (on Dennis Dart and Volvo B6 chassis), whilst a double-curvature screen with an arched top was fitted to some Scania L113 and DAF SB220 full-sized vehicles.Some bodies built {{towards the end of}} production were given Plaxton body numbers, in which the Paladin was identified by the letter G.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Wadham Stringer {{became the}} next builder to body the Dart {{with a body}} called the Portsdown, but it was sold in small numbers and {{replaced}} by the UVG Urbanstar in 1995. In the same year, Wright bodied the Dart with the Handybus. In early 1991, Plaxton launched the Pointer (which was initially designated as Reeve Burgess Pointer as it was built at Reeve Burgess's plant, until later {{in the same year}} when it was transferred to Plaxton's Scarborough plant). Later in 1991, East Lancs bodied the Dart with its EL2000. In the latter half of 1991, Alexander launched the Dash. Another contender entering the market at the same time was the Northern Counties Paladin. Initially, it was built with a design of a barrel shaped windscreen with <b>quarterlights</b> (which were mainly sold to Warrington Borough Transport), later models had a deep double-curvature two-piece windscreen. It was phased out when Plaxton bought Northern Counties in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|The {{range was}} given a unique-to-NZ update early in 1971: the iron head [...] "deluxe" [...] estate (never badged as such) was almost {{unchanged}} apart from the side [...] "Hunter" [...] badges moving from the front doors to the front guards and revised seat and door trim patterns, and the door tops switched from black to the same colour as the seats. The alloy headed [...] "super" [...] saloon got these changes plus a redesigned 'by Chrysler' boot lid badge, spray-on black, instead of silver, tail panel — the texture of this changed from textured fake vinyl to a matte black over the year's run. Initially the cars were offered with tan, red, blue or black upholstery with the dash painted to match {{but after a few}} months, Todd's switched to a new type of vinyl with different colours and texture for their Avenger, Hunter and Valiant lines, the blue option was dropped and the dashboards reverted to black paint. By now the equivalent Super model in the UK had seen its specification reduced to the iron head engine, no bumper over-riders, less exterior bright metal detailing and fixed front <b>quarterlights</b> — so the New Zealand version was unique.|$|R
50|$|New Zealand {{distributor}} Todd Motors {{had assembled}} the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, {{it was a}} little more adventurous, launching a unique-to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci Hemi-6 engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci Hemi-6, floor-console automatic shifter, round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd's sole locally-built Charger model was also to '770' trim with the 265ci Hemi-6 six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to opening front <b>quarterlights</b> and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification.|$|R
5000|$|In South Africa, the {{facelift}} {{used the}} Port Elizabeth-built 1.3 L and 1.6 L Rocam engines, {{instead of the}} European Sigma 16-valve engines.This model {{formed the basis of}} the Ford Ikon (code name C195), which is a four-door saloon designed for India, where Ford was then producing cars in a joint venture with Mahindra. The Ikon was also introduced in other developing countries, such as Brazil (where it is known as the Fiesta Sedan), South Africa, Mexico (where it was called Fiesta Ikon) and China, where saloons are preferred to hatchbacks. They are extremely reliable, and became one of Ford's successes. There were also four utility variants, the simplest being the [...] "Fiesta Van" [...] which was a three-door hatchback with the rear quarter windows blanked over and the rear seat omitted (in other words, a sedan delivery). Another van with a boxy rear body and stretched wheelbase used the Courier nameplate and formed the basis of two coupe utility models, one with the short doors of the 5-door hatchback and small <b>quarterlights</b> in the style of larger extended cab pick-ups, made in South Africa as the Ford Bantam; and another with the 3-door's longer doors and no quarter windows, made in Brazil as the Ford Courier.|$|R
