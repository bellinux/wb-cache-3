5|$|Bomar, of Vanderbilt, is only shaded {{a little}} by two other ends, largely through the {{experienced}} gained by his rivals against stronger opposition. He weighs 200 pounds, is tremendously fast, and a hardy, defensive player. On attack {{he is able}} to pick the forward pass out of the air on the full run, and, running with a high-knee action <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> that of the redoubtable Ted Coy, if he cannot get by his man, runs him down and goes on over him, still on his feet.|$|E
5|$|IGN {{wrote that}} the game's story and environments {{remained}} {{in the background and}} were ultimately forgettable, {{or in the case of}} the former, a hindrance, especially when the scenes could not be skipped on later replays. By the same token, predecessors such as Lara Croft Go hid treasures in its background such that players would revisit its levels, but Deus Ex Go had little to interest players besides its primary mission. The game's sole challenge of completing the puzzle in the fewest moves, GameSpot explained, quickly became uninteresting. Gamezebo reviewer instead faulted the series and wrote that after three games, its formula felt repetitive. TouchArcade concluded that, unlike the other Go games, Deus Ex Go was less creative overall and did not subvert the themes of its parent series <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> the others.|$|E

25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and put on their behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, I am <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> a child.|$|E
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> it but it was terribly indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E

25|$|As a cricket writer, he {{generally}} concentrated on {{bringing out the}} character of the players that he was writing about, and he made liberal use of humour. In these characteristics, and in that his cricket memories went back as far as {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, he might be compared with Neville Cardus, though Thomson was writing from a Yorkshire rather than a Lancashire perspective. He once said that cricket had given him more unalloyed pleasure over a longer period than anything else, and that pleasure was evident in his writing. Thomson saw cricket not only as the most pleasurable of pastimes but also <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> the Poet Laureate might see it—an eternally vibrant display of colour, spirit, humour and conflict.|$|E
25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does. For instance, a curve with fractal dimension very near to 1, say 1.10, behaves <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> an ordinary line, but a curve with fractal dimension 1.9 winds convolutedly through space very nearly like a surface. Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space {{very much like}} an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume. This general relationship {{can be seen in}} the two images of fractal curves in Fig.2 and Fig. 3 – the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of 1.26.|$|E
500|$|The ukulele expert Steven Sproat {{considers}} that Formby [...] "was incredible... There hasn't {{really been a}} uke player since Formby—or even before Formby—who played <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> him". Much of Formby's virtuosity came from his right-hand technique, the split stroke, and he developed his own fast and complicated syncopated musical style with a very fast right-hand strum. Joe Cooper, writing in New Society, considered that [...] "Nobody has ever reproduced the casual devastating right hand syncopation, which so delicately synchronised with deft left hand chord fingering".|$|E

500|$|The {{alternative}} metal style's leading groups {{included the}} nu metal bands P.O.D., Thousand Foot Krutch, Disciple, and Pillar. Zao {{was a pioneer}} of metalcore, paving way for bands such as Underoath and Norma Jean. The California-based group Mortal is cited {{as one of the}} first Christian bands that represented the industrial metal style. Cross Rhythms wrote that when Mortal's second album Fathom hit the scene in 1993 [...] "there was nothing else <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> it" [...] and that it is [...] "truly a musical milestone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wannabe" [...] {{has also}} been {{credited}} with changing the mid-1990s pop music landscape, pioneering the teen pop boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Robert Copsey, editor at the UK’s Official Charts Company explained: “There was nothing else <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> Wannabe on the radio back in summer 1996. Rock and dance music had been dominating the airwaves and charts {{for quite some time}} by that point. The Spice Girls struck at just the right moment with Wannabe; a gutsy, enthusiastic and unashamed pop song we’d all been craving without even realising it.” ...|$|E
500|$|All {{the girls}} acting as {{participants}} in the beauty pageant, except Abigail Breslin, were veterans of real beauty pageants. They looked the same and performed the same acts as they had in their real-life pageants. To prepare for filming, the directors attended several pageants in Southern California and met with a coordinator {{to learn more about}} the pageant process. A mother of a contestant in the film claimed that the film overplayed practices that the contestants go through: [...] "Most pageants aren't <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> that, with shaving the girls' legs, spraying them with fake tans and putting on so much makeup." ...|$|E

500|$|The loss {{dropped the}} Mean Green to 1–8, {{and the team}} {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 2–10 record. Mean Green coach Todd Dodge expressed astonishment at a post-game press conference, saying [...] "I have never been a part of a game <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] The team finished the season averaging an FBS-worst 45.1 points allowed per game. After the final game of the season, Dodge fired defensive coordinator Ron Mendoza, who was replaced by Gary DeLoach. In the 2008 season the Mean Green would again finish {{at the bottom of the}} defensive rankings, allowing an average of 47.6 points per game.|$|E
500|$|National Book Award finalist Richard Yates told The New York Times in 1977 {{that reading}} Salinger's stories {{for the first}} time was a {{landmark}} experience, and that [...] "nothing <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> it has happened to me since". Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who {{knew exactly what he was}} doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune {{commented that}} [...] "Smiles don’t come easy for Madonna. [...] Instead, {{there are usually}} smirks, sneers, pouts, leers and thin-lipped, tough-as-nails {{displays}} of contempt for anyone who would dare mess with her. Madonna, she's one tough dominatrix, and she's got better developed biceps than just {{about any of the}} fans who filled the United Center on Sunday for the first of two concerts." [...] Adrian Thrills from Daily Mail commented [...] "Nobody does a big stadium show <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> Madonna. She might be pop's greatest female icon, but she does not rest on her laurels and this was a theatrical, two-hour blockbuster, featuring 16 dancers and a 12-piece band." ...|$|E

60|$|Her greeting, however, was {{frank and}} cordial; {{it was a}} real welcome.

500|$|In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several {{songs from}} Made in the Dark, {{with one of}} their [...] "all-time heroes", Robert Wyatt. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> people to be surprised. I try to do that in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} [...] "One More Chance" [...] {{is just one}} of the [...] "consumer enticements that just add to the allure." [...] Billboard critic Timothy White called it [...] "bittersweet serenade." [...] J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun called the song [...] "the album's {{greatest}} surprise". He explained, [...] "this David Foster song is quite demanding vocally, requiring a wider range and more power than anything else on the album. Yet Madonna more than lives up to the challenge, showing enough power and polish to make even Madonna-phobes admit she can sing. Louis Virtel from music website Idolator wrote, [...] "No other Madonna song sounds <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> it, and it holds up as a melancholic statement against grander compositions like 'You'll See' and 'I'll Remember'." ...|$|E
500|$|Writers Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett {{put it that}} [...] "On paper, at least, {{the premise}} seemed irresistible", yet view the {{blending}} of puppetry and live action as [...] "uneasy". Prior to his death in 2002, Unwin himself praised the off-beat nature of The Secret Service, defending the inclusion of elements such as Unwinese dialogue as [...] "an attempt to add {{a new dimension to}} the puppet field ... It was a bit bizarre, but then aren't many new ideas a little odd at first?" [...] On the subject of the cancellation, he commented that the series was possibly [...] "a little bit before its time". Contrary to Peel and La Rivière, John Walsh of The Guardian challenges the idea that the gobbledegook devalued the series, arguing that [...] "British audiences <b>quite</b> <b>like</b> not understanding things." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} magazine Films of the Golden Age (Fall 2015), Young revealed about the radio program: [...] "I never <b>quite</b> <b>liked</b> it because {{it had to have}} laughs.

[...] "To be quite honest, I <b>quite</b> <b>liked</b> it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really <b>quite</b> <b>liked</b> it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and things. In my late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|R
