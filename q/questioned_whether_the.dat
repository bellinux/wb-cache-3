5|$|Based {{on their}} {{similarity}} to the Altar of the City Patrons, art historians have attributed other paintings to Lochner, although a number have <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> diary entry was authentically made by Dürer. Documentary evidence linking the paintings and miniatures {{with the historical}} Lochner has also been challenged, most notably by the art historian Michael Wolfson in 1996. In either case, the extent of Lochner's direct hand, {{as opposed to those}} of workshop members or followers, is debated. Some panels formerly attributed to him are now thought to date from after 1451, the year of his death.|$|E

Some commentators felt that the programme's concept was ridiculous and doomed from the start, others felt that the series showed a contempt for music and the general public, and other critics <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> point {{of the project was}} to raise money for charity or for the four bloggers to promote themselves.

5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E

5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he <b>questioned</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
