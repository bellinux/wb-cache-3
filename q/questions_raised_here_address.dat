40|$|The Romans, {{after the}} {{creation}} of the province of Asia, rapidly revised the relationship between Efesus and its famous temple, Artemisiion. The focus of this article is on the role Augustu’s played in this city, after his victory over Antonius. We can gain valuable information on this matter from the decree drafted during Claudiu’s reign by the provincial governor, Fabius Persicus. This document contains a series of clauses that give us an insight not only on the relationship between the temple with the city, but also about the problems affecting this most glorious Efesian sanctuary and the efforts to resolve them. Although, for the most part, the mentioned clauses already confirm with the norms previously attributed by Augustus, the text allows for a more detailed consideration of the augustean policy towards them.

Numerical simulations also support this acceleration mechanism. However, the most fundamental <b>question</b> <b>raise</b> <b>here</b> is, does this mechanism contribute to the cosmic rays acceleration? To answer this, we report, in-situ evidence of flux-ropes formation, their magnetic re-connection and its manifestation as cosmic ray (GeV charged particle) acceleration in interplanetary counterpart of coronal mass ejection(ICME). Further, we propose that cosmic ray (high and/or ultra-high energy) acceleration by Fermi mechanism is valid not only through stochastic reflections of particles from the shock boundaries but also through the boundaries of contracting magnetic islands or/and their merging via magnetic re-connection. This has significant implications on cosmic ray origin and their acceleration process.

The book looks at the way in which power flows through media organisations influencing not only what journalists choose to present to their audiences but how they present it and then in turn what their audiences do with it.

She invites readers to consider how news is influenced by the culture from which it emerges, as well as the way it is paid for and how different countries have approached the problem of ensuring that democracy is served by its media, rather than being undermined by it.

It is currently accepted that a strict separation exists between plant and vertebrate viruses regarding their host range and pathogenicity, and plant viruses {{are believed to}} infect only plants. Accordingly, plant viruses are not considered to present potential pathogenicity to humans and other vertebrates. Notwithstanding these beliefs, there are many examples where phytoviruses circulate and propagate in insect vectors.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ecosystems}} in {{brackish water}} regions are already exposed to stress, especially {{those living in}} estuaries with their fluctuating environment. The <b>question</b> <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> is whether these ecosystems are generally more susceptible to additional stress such as pollution, or if their ability to adapt to environmental changes leads to increased tolerance to pollution. The Baltic, as being the largest brackish water area in the world, is discussed with respect to its eutrophication in relation to pollution discharge. A comparative analysis {{of the effects of}} pulp and paper mill effluents in the brackish water environment is made between a polluted area in the Bothnian Sea and an estuarine area under recovery on the Swedish west coast. The question of stress tolerance of ecosystems is extremely important when it comes to predicting environmental and ecological effects. It is suggested here that, in general, already stressed ecosystems are more tolerant to pollution than those existing in stable environments, and thus, the brackish water environment is less susceptible than similar marine environments. Discharge of polluted water brings about disorders in aquatic ecosystems. Severe pollution disrupts ecosystems and reduces them to poor levels of organisation...|$|R

In a rich linguistic arena, where four languages (standard Arabic, Algerian spoken language, Berber and French) interact {{as much as they}} compete, political and religious ideologies, by instrumentalizing standard Arabic, have had their share in directing policies and developing representations that serve political interests, often at the expense of a peaceful and fruitful coexistence within a diverse linguistic market. The <b>question</b> <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> is the following: how does standard Arabic serve political interests, despite the fact that its political status totally contradicts its real sociolinguistic one? With a colinguism being set as a rule for language policy, standard Arabic, religion and politics have come to form a triad whose purpose is to maintain conditions for a performative ideological discourse whose permanence needs the people’s consent and rallying belief in a community of believers. The main goal of such a state is to exclude {{the vast majority of the}} population from the field of political debate and reflexion, and discard oppositional intellectuals who do not use standard Arabic...|$|R

Copyright law determines the social {{framework}} in which music is marketed, artists are rewarded, and all the uses to which their work is put are licensed. And copyright claims and counter-claims are the source of recurring conflict. Who wrote what and when? Who owns these sounds? What are you allowed to do with them? Disputes about copying and theft are becoming ever noisier with digital technology and the new possibilities of sampling, downloading and large-scale piracy. This book has been written to explain the copyright system to non-legal specialists and to show why copyright issues are so fascinating and so important.

Sanctions clearly have political, economic, military and strategic consequences, but the <b>question</b> <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> is whether sanctions can also have moral justification. Illustrated by the example of international sanctions against Yugoslavia, the authors show how the process of escalating demands on a target country, inherent to the very process of sanctioning, can lead ultimately even to overt aggression. As a result of this logic of escalation, economic sanctions cannot be articulated properly in any law-like system. Economic sanctions have much more in common with war than legal punishment, and in fact represent a form of siege.
