5|$|A de luxe {{edition of}} Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux (Birds) (1771–1786) was {{produced}} by the Imprimerie royale in 10 folio and <b>quarto</b> volumes, with 1008 engraved and hand-coloured plates, executed under Buffon's personal supervision by Edme-Louis Daubenton, cousin and brother-in-law of Buffon's principal collaborator.|$|E
5|$|Another edition in <b>quarto</b> format {{was printed}} by the Imprimerie royale in 36 volumes (1774–1804). It {{consisted}} of 28 volumes par Buffon, and 8 volumes by Lacépède. The part containing anatomical articles by Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton was dropped. The supplements were merged into the relevant {{articles in the}} main volumes.|$|E
5|$|The second edition, {{published}} in 1730, {{was very similar}} to the first, with only minor revisions. Both editions were printed in blackletter type and in <b>quarto</b> book format; later editions were printed in roman type and in octavo.|$|E

50|$|The first stamps {{were issued}} on 1 February 1854 and were of four {{denominations}} the 5 <b>quartos,</b> the 10 <b>quartos,</b> the 1 real, and the 2 reales. These stamps depicted {{a profile of}} an effigy of Spanish Queen Isabela II.|$|R
50|$|It seems {{also that}} the Spanish postal {{authorities}} tolerated the splitting of large denomination postage stamp into two stamps of a lower value. A local philatelist, for instance, owns an envelope postmarked in Manila on July 6, 1857 and addressed to one S.D. Felino Gil of Guagua, Pampanga. The envelope bore on its upper left hand corner a 10 <b>quartos</b> stamp cut diagonally to pass as a 5 <b>quartos</b> stamp. The explanation of this oddity {{seems to be that}} {{due to the lack of}} a 10 <b>quartos</b> stamps the stamp teller cut the stamp in half so he could have two 5 <b>quartos</b> stamps to conform in all likelihood with the local postal rate at that time.|$|R
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First <b>Quarto</b> (Q1, 1603); the Second <b>Quarto</b> (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|All {{references}} to Hamlet, unless otherwise specified, {{are taken from}} the Arden Shakespeare Q2. Under their referencing system, 3.1.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55. References to the First <b>Quarto</b> and First Folio are marked Hamlet Q1 and Hamlet F1, respectively, and are taken from the Arden Shakespeare Hamlet: the texts of 1603 and 1623. Their referencing system for Q1 has no act breaks, so 7.115 means scene 7, line 115.|$|E
5|$|Euler {{was one of}} {{the most}} eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the {{greatest}} in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 <b>quarto</b> volumes, more than anybody in the field. He spent most of his adult life in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia.|$|E

5|$|Euler {{worked in}} almost all areas of mathematics, such as geometry, infinitesimal calculus, trigonometry, algebra, and number theory, as well as {{continuum}} physics, lunar theory and other areas of physics. He is a seminal figure {{in the history of}} mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 <b>quarto</b> volumes. Euler's name is associated with a large number of topics.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may have seen the Games. But the allusion is not present in the <b>quarto</b> edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{edition of the}} Histoire Naturelle by Buffon comprised 36 volumes in <b>quarto,</b> divided into the following series: Histoire de la Terre et de l'Homme, Quadrupèdes, Oiseaux, Minéraux, Suppléments. Buffon edited 35 volumes in his lifetime. Soon after his death, the fifth and final volume of l’Histoire des minéraux appeared in 1788 at the Imprimerie des Bâtiments du Roi. The seventh and final volume of Suppléments by Buffon was published posthumously in 1789 through Lacépède's hands. Lacépède continued {{the part of the}} Histoire Naturelle which dealt with animals. A few months before Buffon's death, en 1788, Lacépède published, as a continuation, the first volume of his Histoire des Reptiles, on egg-laying quadrupeds. The next year, he wrote a second volume on snakes, published during the French Revolution. Between 1798 and 1803, he brought out the volume Histoire des Poissons. Lacépède made use of the notes and collections left by Philibert Commerson (1727–1773). He wrote Histoire des Cétacés which was printed in 1804. At that point, the Histoire Naturelle, by Buffon and Lacépède, thus contained 44 <b>quarto</b> volumes forming the definitive edition.|$|E

The 1601 <b>quartos</b> were the only editions in the era of English Renaissance theatre; the plays would not be reprinted until the nineteenth century.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, {{editors of}} Shakespeare's plays have divided them into five acts. None {{of the early}} texts of Hamlet, however, were {{arranged}} this way, and the play's division into acts and scenes derives from a 1676 <b>quarto.</b> Modern editors generally follow this traditional division, but consider it unsatisfactory; for example, after Hamlet drags Polonius's body out of Gertrude's bedchamber, there is an act-break after which the action appears to continue uninterrupted.|$|E
5|$|Europa was a {{seaplane}} {{carrier of}} the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy). Originally laid {{down as the}} merchant ship Manila, she was renamed Salacia in 1898, and then sold to German and then Italian shipping companies in 1911 and 1913, respectively. She became <b>Quarto</b> in 1913, and in February 1915 she was purchased by the Italian fleet, renamed Europa, and converted into a seaplane carrier with a capacity of eight seaplanes. She served as a seaplane base in Valona during World War I and supported the Allied response during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in 1917. She was quickly sold for scrap in 1920 after the war ended.|$|E
5|$|For eight years, {{she worked}} in {{publishing}} at <b>Quarto</b> and Gordon Fraser. She spent two years teaching English as a foreign language in Turin, Italy and Bilbao, Spain. She returned to England in 1992 and {{spent the rest of}} that year in County Durham, in a house that looked out over the North Sea. There she began working on her first novel, Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell. In 1993, she was hired by Simon & Schuster in Cambridge to edit cookbooks, a job she kept for the next ten years.|$|E

5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls in the postwar period. The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient <b>Quarto,</b> which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
5|$|The codex is in <b>quarto,</b> and now {{consists}} of 773 vellum folios (630 in the Old Testament and 143 in the New Testament), bound in four volumes (279 + 238 + 118 + 144 folios). Three volumes contain the Septuagint, Greek {{version of the}} Old Testament, with {{the complete loss of}} only ten leaves. The fourth volume contains the New Testament with 31 NT leaves lost. In the fourth volume 1 and 2 Clement are also missing leaves, perhaps 3.|$|E
5|$|Sonnet 102 {{is one of}} the 154 sonnets {{written by}} English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It {{is one of the}} Fair Youth sonnets, in which Shakespeare writes of an unnamed youth with whom the poet is enamored. Sonnet 102 is among a series of {{seemingly}} connected sonnets, from Sonnet 100 to Sonnet 103, in which the poet speaks of a silence between his Muse and himself. The exact date of writing is unknown, and there is contention among scholars about when they were written. Paul Hammond among other scholars believes that sonnets 61-103 were written primarily during the early 1590s, and then being edited or added to later, during the early 1600s (decade). Regardless of date of writing, it was published later {{along with the rest of}} the sonnets of the 1609 <b>Quarto.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} laid {{down for the}} Spanish company Pinillos, Izquierdo & Cia as the merchant steamer Manila in 1895 in Scotland, at the Charles Connell and Company shipyard in Glasgow. Built as yard number 222, she was launched on 5 July and completed in August that year. In 1898, she was sold to Donaldson Bros of Glasgow, Scotland, and renamed Salacia. Retaining the name Salacia, she was sold to the Hamburg-based German shipping company M. Jebsen in 1912. She was sold to the Italian company Tito Campanella in Genoa in 1913 and renamed <b>Quarto</b> in 1914. On 6 February 1915, the Regia Marina purchased the vessel to convert her into a seaplane tender. She was renamed Europa and was commissioned into the fleet on 6 October, after Italy had entered World War I.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quarto</b> {{was built}} at the Regia Marina {{dockyard}} in Venice, with her keel being laid down on 14 November 1909. Her completed hull was launched on 19 August 1911, and after fitting-out work was finished in early 1913, she was commissioned into the fleet on 31 March 1913. Italy declared neutrality {{at the start of}} World War I in August 1914, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers; Italy's primary opponent in the Adriatic was the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
