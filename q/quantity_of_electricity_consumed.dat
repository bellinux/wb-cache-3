40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the changes}} in electricity demand in Australia’s National Electricity Market. Overview Power Down, Australia Institute Paper 14, analysed {{the changes in}} electricity demand in Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) between 2006 and 2013. Since 2010, electricity demand has been characterised by an entirely unprecedented steady fall in the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumed</b> each year. Power Down concluded {{that a number of}} different factors had contributed to this reduction in demand; the factors include, but are not confined to: 	national regulations mandating the increased energy efficiency of new appliances, equipment and buildings; 	a change in the behaviour of electricity consumers since 2010; 	the closure of a small number of large electricity consuming manufacturing facilities; and 	the growth in electricity supplied from rooftop photovoltaic installations. This paper both updates and extends that analysis, bringing in data from an additional year, 2014, and using additional data sources to separate consumption by residential consumers from consumption by business customers with small and medium demand levels, termed in this paper general business.  ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{electric}} markets have been significantly restructured throughout the world. This {{is a process}} of breaking up vertically integrated electricity utilities and introduction of commercial interfaces between the functions of generation, transition, dis-tribution and retailing of electrical energy. The motivation for restructuring is to harness a pressure to improve the economic efficiency <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> industry, to contribute to the en-vironmental protection and to provide a better service for energy consumers. However, the competition in electricity production and trading raises various problems concerning optimal market design, risk estimation, and strategy optimization for power producers and retailers. As a first approximation, the market for electricity is not fundamentally different from any other market. The price and the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> produced and <b>consumed</b> are de-termined by generators costs and by consumers willingness to pay.

40|$|IN {{restructured}} electricity markets, generating companies submit bids {{to supply}} electricity at prices {{based on their}} marginal costs, which are driven largely by fuel costs. In each regional wholesale power market, an independent system operator (ISO) manages electricity transmission and sets locational marginal prices (LMPs) to match supplies with demands at each location on the constrained grid. To understand the interaction between constraints on fuel supply and constraints on electricity transmission, we recently developed and tested a game theoretic model that combines both sets of constraints [1][2]. It includes (1) costs of extracting and transporting finite supplies of fuels across routes with limited capacity, (2) strategic decisions of generators at different locations across a congested electricity transmission network, (3) price-sensitive demands for electricity, and (4) matching <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> supply and demand across the network to maximize total social welfare subject to physical transmission constraints. Given the fuel and electricity network topology and capacities, fuel supplies and costs, transmission line reactances, and demand functions, the model produces LMPs and <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> generated and <b>consumed</b> at each location on the grid.

40|$|This {{research}} explores whether Environmental Management Accounting can {{be applied}} to assist an Australian cogeneration company in improving both its financial performance as well as its environmental performance. Cogeneration or &# 039;combined heat and power&# 039;, in this particular case, involves the simultaneous production <b>of</b> heat and <b>electricity</b> using a single fuel, that is, natural gas. The heat generated is then used to produce steam to meet the customers&# 039; requirements as well as boost the production <b>of</b> <b>electricity.</b> Therefore, cogeneration provides greater efficiencies compared to traditional electricity generation methods because it utilizes heat that would otherwise be wasted. In addition, greenhouse gases emissions can be reduced substantially. The approach taken in this research is to assess whether an improvement in the energy efficiency of the cogeneration plant can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions. An improvement in energy efficiency means that either: • less gas is consumed, thus leading to cost savings; or • more electricity is generated for the same <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> gas consumed, which leads to an increase in income and consequently profit. Therefore, an improvement in energy efficiency means an improvement in the financial performance. In addition, a reduction in the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> gas consumed or generating as much electricity as possible from a given <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> gas can lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions which means an improvement in the company&# 039;s environmental performance. A case study method, which involves an Australian cogeneration company, is adopted because this would provide valuable in-depth practical insight into the operations and mechanisms of a company that is involved in combined heat and power generation. A review of the literature and the evidence collected indicated that a cogeneration plant&# 039;s efficiency can be improved at least back to near the plant&# 039;s designed efficiency. And, further improvements may be achieved by utilizing the latest technology although this involves capital investment. It is also established that an improvement in plant efficiency can reduce greenhouse gases emissions. This research then concludes that Environmental Management Accounting can help the case study company improve its financial and environmental performances. An Environmental Management Accounting system can provide the physical information that is not available in the existing management accounting system. Physical information such as the physical <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> gas <b>consumed,</b> <b>electricity</b> and steam produced, and greenhouse gases emitted, can help the company in decision-making relating to improving plant efficiency as well as reducing greenhouse gases emissions...|$|R

Differing approaches and interpretations have fuelled a debate about the environmental merit of biofuels, and consequently about the level of policy support that can be justified. This paper estimates and compares emissions from plausible supply chains for lignocellulosic ethanol production, exemplified using data specific to the UK and Sweden. The common elements that give rise to the greatest greenhouse gas emissions are identified and the sensitivity of total emissions to variations in these elements is estimated. The implications of including consequential impacts including indirect land-use change, and the effects of selecting alternative allocation methods on the interpretation of results are discussed. Results We find that the most important factors affecting supply chain emissions are the emissions embodied in biomass production, the use of electricity in the conversion process and potentially consequential impacts: indirect land-use change and fertiliser replacement. The large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumed</b> during enzyme manufacture suggests that enzymatic conversion processes may give rise to greater greenhouse gas emissions than the dilute acid conversion process, even though the dilute acid process has a somewhat lower ethanol yield. Conclusion The lignocellulosic ethanol supply chains considered here all lead to greenhouse gas savings relative to gasoline An important caveat to this is that if lignocellulosic ethanol production uses feedstocks that lead to indirect land-use change, or other significant consequential impacts, the benefit may be greatly reduced. Co-locating ethanol, electricity generation and enzyme production in a single facility may improve performance, particularly if this allows the number of energy intensive steps in enzyme production to be reduced, or if other process synergies are available. If biofuels policy in the EU remains contingent on favourable environmental performance then the multi-scale nature of bioenergy supply chains presents a genuine challenge. Lignocellulosic ethanol holds promise for emission reductions, but maximising greenhouse gas savings will not only require efficient supply chain design but also {{a better understanding of the}} spatial and temporal factors which affect overall performance. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{residential}} demand for electricity, studied {{on the national}} level for many years, is here investigated on the regional level. A survey of the literature is first presented outlining past econometric work in the field of electrical energy demand. An econometric model is then presented using a 1970 cross-section of sixty-seven New England electric utilities and their service areas as the data base. The special nature of the market for electricity, characterized by decreasing block rate structures, requires that both a supply price equation and a demand equation be estimated. A suitable technique, two-stage least squares, is used to obtain consistent coefficients, and elasticities of demand are obtained. The {{residential demand}} for electricity is found to be significantly correlated with its average price, family income, family size, heating degree days, and the ownership [...] public or private [...] of the electric utility. Price and income are found {{to be the most important}} determinants of demand. The cross-elasticities of demand with respect to the average prices of natural gas and fuel oil are unexpectedly negative. This is thought to be due to poor data in the case of fuel oil and the unavailability of natural gas in much of the region. Another explanation may be the inability of the model to portray what might be a non-linear cross-elasticity function. The supply price is correlated with the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>consumed,</b> utility operation and maintenance costs, total number of customers, degree of urbanization, and the ownership of the utility. The structural supply and demand equations are also estimated using the ordinary least squares procedure. The coefficients derived in this manner are not significantly different from those obtained using the two-stage least squares technique, a rather surprising result considering the simultaneity of the demand and supply price equations. Three methods are investigated for obtaining the total elasticities of demand from the reduced-form of the demand equation. These elasticities, contrasting with the direct elasticities derived from the structural equations, are presented for comparative purposes. Policy implications of the results of the equation estimation are discussed as are suggestions for further research in this field. Prepared under the support of National Science Foundation...|$|E

40|$|The ‘hydrogen economy’ {{represents}} an energy {{system in which}} hydrogen and electricity are the dominant energy carriers for use in transportation applications. The ‘hydrogen economy’ minimizes the use of fossil fuels in order to lower {{the environmental impact of}} energy use associated with urban air pollution and climate change. An integrated energy system is required to deal with diverse and distributed energy generation technologies such a wind and solar which require energy storage to level energy availability and demand. A distributed ‘energy hub’ is considered a viable concept in envisioning the structure of an integrated energy system. An energy hub is a system which consists of energy input/output, conversion and storage technologies for multiple energy carriers, and would provide an interface between energy producers, consumers, and the transportation infrastructure. Considered in a decentralized network, these hubs would form the nodes of an integrated energy system or network. In this work, a model of a clean energy hub comprising of wind turbines, electrolyzers, hydrogen storage, a commercial building, and a fleet of plug-in fuel cell vehicles (PFCVs) was developed in MATLAB, with electricity and hydrogen used as the energy carriers. This model represents a hypothetical commercial facility which is powered by a renewable energy source and utilizes a zero-emissions fleet of light duty vehicles. The models developed herein capture the energy and cost interactions between the various energy components, and also calculate the CO 2 emissions avoided through the implementation of hydrogen economy principles. Wherever possible, similar models were used to inform the development of the clean energy hub model. The purpose of the modelling was to investigate the interactions between a single energy hub and novel components such as a plug-in fuel cell vehicle fleet (PFCV). The final model reports four key results: price <b>of</b> hub <b>electricity,</b> price <b>of</b> hub hydrogen, total annual costs and CO 2 emissions avoided. Three scenarios were analysed: minimizing price <b>of</b> hub <b>electricity,</b> minimizing total annual costs, and maximizing the CO 2 emissions avoided. Since the clean energy hub could feasibly represent both a facility located within an urban area as well as a remote facility, two separate analyses were also conducted: an on-grid analysis (if the energy hub is close to transmission lines), and an off-grid analysis (representing the remote scenarios). The connection of the energy hub to the broader electricity grid was the most significant factor affecting the results collected. Grid electricity was found to be generally cheaper than electricity produced by wind turbines, and scenarios for minimizing costs heavily favoured the use grid electricity. However, wind turbines were found to avoid CO 2 emissions over the use <b>of</b> grid <b>electricity,</b> and scenarios for maximizing emissions avoided heavily favoured wind turbine electricity. In one case, removing the grid connection resulted in the price <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from the energy hub increasing from $ 82 /MWh to $ 300 /MWh. The mean travel distance of the fleet was another important factor affecting the cost modelling of the energy hub. The hub’s performance was simulated over a range of mean travel distances (20 km to 100 km), and the results varied greatly within the range. This is because the mean travel distance directly affects the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> and hydrogen <b>consumed</b> by the fleet, a large consumer of energy within the hub. Other factors, such as the output of the wind turbines, or the consumption of the commercial building, are largely fixed. A key sensitivity was discovered within this range; the results were ‘better’ (lower costs and higher emissions avoided) when the mean travel distance exceeded the electric travel range of the fleet. This effect was more noticeable in the on-grid analysis. This sensitivity is due to the underutilization of the hydrogen systems within the hub at lower mean travel distances. It was found that the greater the mean travel distance, the greater the utilization of the electrolyzers and storage tanks lowering the associated per km capital cost of these components. At lower mean travel distances the utilization of the electrolyzers ranged from 25 % to 30 %, whereas at higher mean travel distances it ranged from 97 % to 99 %. At higher utilization factors the price of hydrogen is reduced, since the cost recovery is spread over a larger <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen...|$|R
