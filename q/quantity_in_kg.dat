The list should include name of ODS, type and location of equipment, <b>quantity</b> <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> and date.

The experiment used three frequencies of plowing, combined with the conditions: with and without coverage of the composting patio, with and without the use of commercial inoculant, resulting in 12 furrows, installed on the Experimental Center of Agricultural Engineering (NEEA), of the STATE UNIVERSITY OF WEST PARANÁ (UNIOESTE), Campus of Cascavel city - state of Paraná (PR), in Brazil. The waste and <b>quantities</b> used <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> were: corn cob (7. 5); hatchery residue (5); floater sludge (31); ash (1); wheat cleaning residue (120); wheat pre-cleaning residue (120); corn peel (7. 5); solid fraction of wash trucks used to transport chickens (2); solid fraction of pig manure (1) and coal (5), totaling 300 kg of natural matter. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of plowings, patio coverage and inoculation in losses of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe. The furrows plowed three times a week in the first month showed significant higher losses of N (p< 0. 05). The coverage of the composting patio influenced significantly the losses of N, K, Mg and Na (p< 0. 05). The produced compounds had a high agronomic value in relation to macro and micronutrients. It is recommended the use of patio coverage and plowing twice a week in the first month and once a week in the subsequent months for a compound with higher concentrations of nutrients...|$|R

Monitored indicators of dairy cows of Holstein cattle were the amount of milk in the first lactation <b>in</b> <b>kg,</b> functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk, functional longevity in days and the causes of elimination of dairy cows from the breed. From the results of monitored herd {{it can be concluded}} that prolongation of age at first calving will increase functional longevity in days statistically significantly. In contrast, there was not found statistically significant effect of age at first calving on functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk. Ascertained results of the monitored dairy herd did not confirm that increasing milk yields deteriorated reproductive indicators. The length of the service period was shortened statistically significantly with increasing the yield of milk <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> per one hundred days ((P 0, 05), with the yield for the first entire lactation (P 0, 001) and the order of lactation (P 0, 001). In the monitored herd the dairy cows that were eliminated due to postpartum paresis (2570. 70 days) reached the highest longevity and also reached the highest milk production for functional longevity <b>in</b> <b>kg</b> of milk (49, 919. 95 kg) ...|$|R
