40|$|For some casting {{low-alloy}} steels, traditional <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> {{heat treatments}} {{can improve the}} strength; however, sometimes the ductility is not satisfied. Therefore, some kind of effective heat treatment method seems necessary; one which could improve the ductility, but not seriously affect the strength. In this paper, the effect of inter-critical quenching (IQ) on the mechanical properties of casting low-alloy steel was studied. IQ was added between <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> heat treatment; <b>and</b> the microstructure and mechanical properties were compared to the same steel with the traditional <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> treatments. The experimental {{results show that the}} microstructure comprises small-size ferrite and martensite when the IQ is adopted; and that different temperatures can control the ferrite quantity and distribution, and, as a result, influence the mechanical properties. In the case of IQ, the tensile strength decreases just a little, but the ductility increases a lot; and the strength-ductility product (its value is the arithmetic product of elongation and tensile strength) increases by between 6 % and 10 %, which means the IQ heat treatment can improve comprehensive mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} simulation method, {{which includes}} microstructure, temperature and stress analysis applicable to both <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> processes, is developed and implemented using the commercial FEM package ABAQUS. This simulation encompasses phase transformations {{and their effects}} on the temperature distribution and stress/strain evolution, including the dependency of material properties on temperature and microstructure, transformation strains, latent heats and transformation plasticity. Three different multi-phase constitutive models, namely the average property model, the Voigt model and the Reuss model, have been implemented. The average property model {{is based on the}} linear mixture of material properties of different phase, while the Voigt model assumes the same strain field in all phases and the Reuss model assumes the iso-stress field. The simulation model has been applied to <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> of modified 4320 steel. Experiments of <b>tempering</b> <b>and</b> <b>quenching</b> on carburized circular plates of the same steel have been performed. The calculated distortion and residual stress profiles are in good agreement with corresponding measurements made in experiments and thus verifies the correctness of the model.

5000|$|Heavy chrome plating, {{known as}} “hard chrome” from {{hexavalent}} baths, {{is the more}} common form used on commercial griddles.

Consequently, a <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> alloy steel such as A514 is frequently used for commercial cooking applications. That type of steel has three times the yield strength of common structural steel such as A36 which might otherwise be used for griddles.|$|E

50|$|Flame {{hardening}} {{is often}} used to harden only a portion of an object, by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area, and then quenching the steel.

50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is quenched, hardening only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the lower hardness. The knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially quenched, flame hardening creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, small [...] "hand cannon" [...] {{first began to}} be used, in the Hussite Wars, in {{combination}} with Wagenburg tactics, allowing infantry to defeat armored knights on the battlefield. At the same time crossbows were made more powerful to pierce armor, {{and the development of}} the Swiss Pike square formation also created substantial problems for heavy cavalry. Rather than dooming the use of body armor, the threat of small firearms intensified the use and further refinement of plate armor. There was a 150-year period in which better and more metallurgically advanced steel armor was being used, precisely because of the danger posed by the gun. Hence, guns and cavalry in plate armor were [...] "threat and remedy" [...] together on the battlefield for almost 400 years. By the 15th century Italian armor plates were almost always made of steel. In Southern Germany armorers began to harden their steel armor only in the late 15th century.

5000|$|Diffusion {{hardening}} {{can be done}} in {{many different}} ways to achieve different hardnesses and different surface finishes on metal parts. Some of the different diffusion hardening operations include: Carburizing, Nitriding, Carbonitriding, Nitrocarburizing, Boriding, Titanium-carbon diffusion, and Toyota diffusion. While diffusion hardening is performed mainly on steel parts and carbon is mainly the element used for diffusion, diffusion hardening can also be performed with other diffusion elements and with other metals. In nitriding, nitrogen is diffused into the surface of steel, but can also be used with metals such as Aluminum, Chromium, Molybdenum, and Vanadium. [...] Besides metals and diffusion elements used, diffusion hardening processes differ in the temperature required for diffusion, the phase of the diffusion element, and additional treatments such as quenching and tempering. These different factors greatly affect surface finish and dimensional accuracy of a part. A <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> part does not have the same dimensional accuracy as a part that has not undergone such a process. Also, they can affect the efficiency of the overall process. In carburizing, the carbon can be in any of the solid, liquid, or gas phases. Although using carbon in the solid phase is usually the safest and easiest of these to work with, the process is difficult to control and the heating is inefficient. All these things must come into consideration when choosing a diffusion hardening process.|$|E
