5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} led by an unusual two-quarterback system, as junior Sean Glennon shared time with {{freshman}} Tyrod Taylor. While Glennon {{proved to be a}} better pocket passer, Taylor's quickness enabled him to scramble out of trouble and gain positive yardage even when no open receivers were available for passes. Until the final game of the season, either Taylor or Glennon was hampered by injury and limited the two-quarterback system's effectiveness. Although the two-quarterback system proved effective against Virginia, there were still <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> well such an unusual setup would work in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began the}} 2001 season having gone 111 the {{previous}} season, {{ending with a}} 4120 victory in the 2001 Gator Bowl against Clemson. Fans' hopes for the new season were {{not as high as}} the previous year, however. Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft, and there were <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> well the team would cope with the loss of Vick and several other important players. Despite those fears, the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference.|$|E

5|$|The {{widespread}} use of Christian symbolism led to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to produce memorials suitable for non-Christians. Lutyens attempted {{to solve this problem}} for the IWGC through the design of the Stone of Remembrance, or War Stone. This was a large, simple stone, intended to resemble an altar and evoke the theme of sacrifice. In practice, many commentators felt it resembled a sarcophagus. Lutyens wanted it to avoid conventional Christian symbolism and based it on designs in Chinese Ming tombs. One of Lutyens' arguments in favour of his design was that explicit Christian symbolism excluded the Indian and Jewish communities and atheists. The IWGC designs for the Indian and Chinese war cemeteries in Europe deliberately did not use Christian imagery – although, as historian Xu Guoqi notes, the Chinese role in the Allied armies remains largely uncommemorated through memorials.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were abysmal, however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting in}} the church, Jackie sees Pete talking to Rose and thinks he is having an affair. Pete and Rose talk alone, and he comes to realise that she is his {{daughter}}. When Rose is unable to answer <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> good of a father he was, Pete realises he was meant {{to die in the}} accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman, and in a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, who consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground. Pete realises that they now have no other choice and that he must die in order to restore the timeline. He bids Rose and Jackie an emotional farewell, races out of the church and throws himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him; it has continued to appear near the church. The timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with her father, and she holds his hand until he dies. Rose and the Doctor walk hand-in-hand back to the restored TARDIS.|$|E

25|$|Criticisms of {{marriage}} are arguments against the practical or moral {{value of the}} institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony.

25|$|James Gee defines {{identity}} as: “Being {{recognized as}} a certain ‘kind of person,’ in a given context…” (p.99). Gee talks of identity differences based on social and cultural views of identity and identifies four of these views, each of which are influenced by different forms of power, though they all {{have an effect on}} one another. Gee describes them as “four ways to formulate <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> identity is functioning for a specific person (child or adult) in a given context or across a set of contexts” (p.101).|$|E
25|$|Sauropods {{that have}} been {{discovered}} include Diplodocus (most famously, the first nearly complete specimen of D. carnegii, which is now exhibited at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Camarasaurus (the most commonly found sauropod), Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus, Brontosaurus, Barosaurus, the uncommon Haplocanthosaurus and Supersaurus. The very diversity of the sauropods has raised some <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they could all co-exist. While their body shapes are very similar (long neck, long tail, huge elephant-like body), they are assumed to have had very different feeding strategies, in order for all to have existed {{in the same time}} frame and similar environment.|$|E

25|$|In September 1854 Darwin had {{the last}} of his {{barnacle}} monographs ready for publication, and he turned his attention fully to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> species originated. He freely discussed his intention to write a book on the subject, and planned avenues of research with other scientists. He went over his previous notes and writings on the topic, and drew up proposals for investigations and research into the implications of his theory. One topic was explaining geographical distribution of organisms; he got information from international correspondence, and experimented on the viability of methods of dispersal. He widened his investigations into variability in nature, and experimented on plant hybridisation and cross-fertilisation.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from the cacophony of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E
25|$|Brown's {{tenure as}} chief {{came to an}} end when he became {{involved}} with the Barker-Karpis gang, who had come to St. Paul at the invitation of Gleckman's rival Jack Peifer. The gang committed series of robberies. When a neighbor recognized the gang from pictures in True Detective magazine, Brown delayed responding to the tip, and he or one of his associates tipped them off. They quickly cleared out. Wrongly believing that Ma Barker's lover Arthur Dunlop had informed on them, they shot him and dumped his naked body. The Dunlop murder sealed Brown's fate as chief. The publicity led to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the gang had got away. He was dismissed as chief by the new mayor, who was elected on an anti-corruption ticket.
