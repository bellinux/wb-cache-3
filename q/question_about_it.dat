500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War almost stranded Fauré in Germany, where he had gone for his annual composing retreat. He managed to get from Germany into Switzerland, and thence to Paris. He remained in France {{for the duration of}} the war. When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with Saint-Saëns. Fauré did not recognise nationalism in music, seeing in his art [...] "a language belonging to a country so far above all others that it is dragged down when it has to express feelings or individual traits that belong to any particular nation." [...] Nonetheless, he was aware that his own music was respected rather than loved in Germany. In January 1905, visiting Frankfurt and Cologne for concerts of his music, he had written, [...] "The criticisms of my music have been that it's a bit cold and too well brought up! There's no <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> French and German are two different things." ...|$|E

500|$|Philip Nel {{places the}} book's title {{character}} {{in the tradition of}} con artists in American art, including the title characters from Meredith Willson's The Music Man and L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Nel also contends that Geisel identified with the Cat, pointing to a self portrait of Geisel in which he appears as the Cat, which was published alongside a profile about him in The Saturday Evening Post on July 6, 1957. Michael K. Frith, who worked as Geisel's editor, concurs, arguing that [...] "The Cat in the Hat and Ted Geisel were inseparable and the same. I think there's no <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life, who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him." [...] Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children. The Cat calls it [...] "fun that is funny", which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary, serious fun that parents subject their children to. In an article titled [...] "Was the Cat in the Hat Black?", Philip Nel draws connections between the Cat and stereotyped depictions of African-Americans, including minstrel shows, Geisel's own minstrel-inspired cartoons from early in his career, {{and the use of the}} term [...] "cat" [...] to refer to jazz musicians. According to Nel, [...] "Even as [...] wrote books designed to challenge prejudice, he never fully shed the cultural assumptions he grew up with, and was likely unaware of the ways in which his visual imagination replicated the racial ideologies he consciously sought to reject." ...|$|E
500|$|In the postseason, Maryland {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to [...] "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." [...] Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, [...] "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." [...] Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14yards and then ran 11yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, [...] "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." [...] He ran for 174yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.|$|E

You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that.

2500|$|Despite the {{increasing}} international profile the boycott was garnering {{in the world}} press, the contest went ahead in Nigeria after being rescheduled to avoid taking place during Ramadan, with many prominent nations sending delegates. Osmel Sousa of Venezuela, one of the world's most influential national directors, famously said [...] "there is no <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> (the participation of Miss Venezuela in the contest)." [...] The trouble did not end there, however. A ThisDay (Lagos, Nigeria) newspaper editorial suggesting that Muhammad would probably have chosen one of his wives from among the contestants had he been alive to see it, resulted in inter-religious riots that started on 22 November in which over 200 {{people were killed in}} the city of Kaduna, along with many houses of worship being burned by religious zealots. Because of these riots, the 2002 pageant was moved to London, following widely circulated reports that the representatives of Canada and Korea had withdrawn from the contest and returned to their respective countries out of safety concerns. A fatwa urging the beheading of the woman who wrote the offending words, Isioma Daniel, was issued in Nigeria, but was declared null and void by the relevant Saudi Arabian authorities. Upon the pageant's return to England, many of the boycotting contestants chose to attend, including Miss Norway, Kathrine Sørland, who was ironically tipped {{in the last few days}} as the number one favourite for the crown she had previously boycotted.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first and}} best known book, Being and Time (1927), though unfinished, {{is one of}} the central {{philosophical}} works of the 20th century. In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from [...] "ontic" [...] questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> namely, Human being, which he called Dasein ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of Being-in-the-world, in opposition to Rationalist thinkers like René Descartes who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities. For Heidegger thinking is thinking about things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central quality of our being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open [...] "possibility-for-being." [...] He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are [...] "always already" [...] concerned with, and to our Being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.|$|E
