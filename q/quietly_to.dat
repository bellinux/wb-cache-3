5|$|The Sugar Bowl eruptive {{period was}} short and {{markedly}} different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions. During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex Hamer. Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E

25|$|On 15 March 1900 Lord Roberts {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} {{in terms of}} which an amnesty would be granted to all burghers, except leaders, who took an oath of neutrality and returned <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> their homes. It is estimated that between 12,000 and 14,000 burghers took this oath between March and June 1900.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{no longer}} has a solid foundation, however. Master Jojonah is a {{high-ranking}} member of the Church and a former teacher of Avelyn Desbris. He, along with others, begins to see the rot in their beloved institution and work <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> bring about the truth of Avelyn. This work eventually leads {{to the death of}} the master as Elbryan and his companions free Bradwarden.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin's {{younger son}} A. Windham Baldwin, writing in 1955, argued {{that his father}} Stanley planned a {{rearmament}} programme as early as 1934, but had to do so <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> avoid antagonising the public whose pacifism was revealed by the Peace Ballot of 1934–35 and endorsed by both the Labour and the Liberal oppositions. His thorough presentation of the case for rearmament in 1935, the son argues, defeated pacifism and secured a victory that allowed rearmament to move ahead.|$|E

25|$|Davitt died in Elpis Hospital, Dublin on 30 May 1906, aged 60, from blood poisoning. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland {{attended}} the funeral, a public {{indication of the}} dramatic political journey this former Fenian prisoner had taken. The plan had been {{not to have a}} public funeral, and hence Davitt's body was brought <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> the Carmelite Friary in Clarendon Street, Dublin. However, the next day over 20,000 people filed past his coffin. His remains were then taken by train to Foxford, County Mayo, and buried in the grounds of Straide Abbey at Straide (near Foxford), near where he was born.|$|E
25|$|The World's Columbian Exposition, {{also known}} as the Chicago World's Fair, was held in 1893. It hosted several world congresses, each dealing with a {{specialized}} topic, such as religion, medicine and science. At almost the last moment, the U.S. Congress decided that the Exposition should also recognize the role of women. After it was over, one of the organizers of the Exposition's congress of women revealed that Anthony had played a pivotal but hidden role in that last-minute decision. Fearing that a public campaign would rouse opposition, Anthony had worked <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> organize support for this project among women of the political elite. Anthony increased the pressure by covertly initiating a petition that was signed by wives and daughters of Supreme Court judges, senators, cabinet members and other dignitaries.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup was an expression of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and civilian leaders. The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an interim regime. Lodge replied affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|E

25|$|General George Washington (1732–99) {{proved an}} {{excellent}} organizer and administrator, who worked successfully with Congress {{and the state}} governors, selecting and mentoring his senior officers, supporting and training his troops, and maintaining an idealistic Republican Army. His biggest challenge was logistics, since neither Congress nor the states had the funding to provide adequately for the equipment, munitions, clothing, paychecks, or even the food supply of the soldiers. As a battlefield tactician Washington was often outmaneuvered by his British counterparts. As a strategist, however, he had {{a better idea of}} how to win the war than they did. The British sent four invasion armies. Washington's strategy forced the first army out of Boston in 1776, and was responsible for the surrender of the second and third armies at Saratoga (1777) and Yorktown (1781). He limited the British control to New York and a few places while keeping Patriot control of the great majority of the population. The Loyalists, on whom the British had relied too heavily, comprised about 20% of the population but were never well organized. As the war ended, Washington watched proudly as the final British army quietly sailed out of New York City in November 1783, taking the Loyalist leadership with them. Washington astonished the world when, instead of seizing power, he retired <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> his farm in Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Keynes's {{followers}} {{assert that}} his predictions of disaster were borne {{out when the}} German economy suffered the hyperinflation of 1923, and again {{by the collapse of}} the Weimar Republic and the outbreak of the Second World War. However the historian Ruth Henig claims that [...] "most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out".|$|E
500|$|Everard Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were {{executed}} on Thursday 30 January 1606. [...] Dragged by horse to Old St Paul's Cathedral, Robert {{was the second}} to be executed, praying <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> himself before he was hanged, drawn and quartered. [...] The following morning, the remaining four were dragged to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had planned to destroy. [...] Thomas {{was the first to}} mount the scaffold. [...] It was customary to grant the condemned a speech, but Thomas, [...] "a very pale and dead colour", said it was [...] "no time to discourse: he was come to die". [...] He absolved the Jesuits of any involvement in the plot, asked for Catholics to pray for him, and declared his adherence to the Roman religion. [...] He was hanged for only a few seconds, and then taken to the block for the remainder of his grim sentence. [...] Their half-brother John was executed at Red Hill near Worcester, on 7 April.|$|E

500|$|While all her contemporaries in Chile {{recognised}} her heroism, and {{the common}} soldiers she served with looked up to her as the [...] "nun of charity," [...] some men said Morales {{had gone too far}} for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should [...] "return <b>quietly</b> <b>to</b> her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine." [...] She did not follow this advice and remained in the army {{until the end of the}} war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were right to say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantinières were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.|$|E

In reference to his decision to run, Bercow said: [...] "I wanted it because I felt that there was a task to be undertaken and that's about strengthening backbench involvement and opportunity in parliament, and helping parliament get off its knees and recognise that it isn't just there as a rubber-stamping operation for the government of the day, and as necessary and appropriate to contradict and expose the government of the day." ...|$|E
