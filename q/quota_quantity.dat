40|$|The {{development}} {{of renewable energy}} sources is of prime interest to many countries seeking to pursue greenhouse gas emission reduction obligations. The increased use of renewables offers the possibility of not only contributing to emission reduction, {{but at the same}} time improving energy supply diversity and security, and developing employment and business in related supply industries. Two main mechanisms are in common use, one a <b>quota</b> (<b>quantity)</b> instrument often associated with tradable certificates, and the other a prescribed pricing mechanism. This paper considers the renewable energy development strategies of three countries (the UK, Australia, and New Zealand) all using a variant of the quota/certificate approach as the central instrument in their programs. The regulatory frameworks defining the application of the certificate systems differ notably, and the likely differing outcomes suggest that these regulatory settings may be at least as important as the selection of the basic policy instrument, in determining the overall success of programs o...|$|E

Other issues such as export subsidies, tariff-rate <b>quota</b> <b>quantities,</b> and developing-country relationships are also important, especially while tariffs are coming down. Internal support rules have much less potential to liberalize trade.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study is to analyze welfare effects of Japan’s rice import quota focusing on the simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) of the rice importation minimum access (MA) policy. Based on the utility function specified in this study, the constructed model is adopted to measure consumption patterns through estimating elasticity of substitution between imported rice and Japan’s domestic rice, and consumers’ preference parameters for different kinds of rice. The results showed that Japanese households prefer domestic rice to the imported rice. Besides, three scenarios of adjusting rice quota volumes were carried out to examine the changes in consumer prices of imported rice and Japanese consumers’ welfares. The results revealed that tariff equivalents of the SBS import quota almost doubled the scale of the mark-up, and the intervention by the Ministry of Agriculture of Japan did cause non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). Finally, if the SBS rice <b>quota</b> <b>quantity</b> was fixed at or larger than 180 thousand tons every fiscal year, the consumer prices of imported rice in Japan’s market would decrease to be less than the prices of Japan’s domestic rice, and therefore the imported rice would have more price advantages in this scenario...|$|E
40|$|There is now {{a plethora}} of {{renewable}} energy policy instruments to support the adoption of renewable energy technology and the generation of renewable electricity. Different ways to characterize such policies have included whether these policies are Price driven or <b>Quota</b> (<b>Quantity)</b> driven, generation based or capacity driven, etc. All such incentive-based policies (vs. Command and control policies) attempt to correct market failure of under supply of renewable energy. This paper uses a technology adoption approach to study the feed-in tariff policy for the photovoltaic (PV) technology. We developed a general economic model to study the adoption incentive for smaller system under a feed-in tariff regime. The model incorporates both the learning effect of system cost and a negative network externality effect inherent in the feed-in tariff policy. The latter is due to that nonadopters would need to contribute to payment for adopters' electricity generation. Using numerical methods, we demonstrated that the feed-in tariff model {{has the potential to}} exhibit bandwagon or accelerated adoption effects. Cost learning is key to contributing to this but network effects would serve to dampen it. Our model seems to able to explain the rapid growth pattern in PV systems installation capacity and generation in Germany during the growth period of 1999 - 2003. We explore some policy implications of the model and suggest future research directions. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{current status}} of of Azerbaijan export {{diversification}} and foreign trade policy in independent years (up from 1991). The main focuse is on the tariffs and non-tariff measures of the Republic of Azerbaijan. We analyze foreign trade policy instruments of Azerbaijan {{one by one and}} compeare them with similar mechanisms of other countries. Our results show that that the foreign trade policy is very favorable for increasing foreign trade volume, and diversification of non-oil export in Azerbaijan. We find that Azerbaijan’s the maximum import tariffs level is 15 %, and simple average is 9. 4 %. At the same time, until now Azerbaijani Government does not use most non-tariff barriers, including import <b>quantity</b> <b>quotas,</b> export subsidy, damping, anti-dumping etc...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe China-Raw Materials dispute {{recently}} arbitrated by the WTO opposed China as defendant to the US, the EU and Mexico as the claimants on {{the somewhat}} unusual issue of export restrictions on natural resources. For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials, {{of which the}} country is a major producer, create shortages in foreign markets increasing the prices of these goods. China defends export limitations by presenting them as a natural resource conserving policy. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the dispute {{with the help of}} a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets. The theoretical results focus on the effects of imposing an export <b>quota</b> on <b>quantities,</b> prices and price distortion. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the conflict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the parties for each product concerned in the case. The model and the empirical results challenge the ideas that an export quota always favors conservation of natural resource, that a higher foreign price necessarily follows this policy and that it inherently increases price distortion and therefore discrimination...|$|R
40|$|JEL No. H 23,Q 3 This paper investigates how {{concern for}} the {{environment}} translates into predictable patterns of consumer behavior. Two types of behavior are considered. First, individuals who care about environmental quality may voluntarily restrain their consumption of goods and services that generate a negative externality. Second, individuals may choose to pay a price premium for goods and services that are more environmentally benign. A theoretical model identifies a symmetry between such voluntary restraint and a voluntary price premium that mirrors the symmetry between environmental policies based on either <b>quantities</b> (<b>quotas)</b> or prices (taxes). We test predictions of the model in an empirical study of household electricity consumption with introduction of a price-premium, green-electricity program. We find evidence of voluntary restraint and its relation to a voluntary price premium. The empirical results are consisten...|$|R

As {{opposed to}} earlier studies, this {{analysis}} on the effect on fish prices of changing quantities supplied from EU fish stocks is European-wide, taking international markets integration into account. The average own-price flexibilities for fresh captured fish are - 1. 1. Assuming exogenous supply, this magnitude implies that price flexibilities estimated for single European countries in earlier studies underestimate price changes at the European level caused by quantity changes. Results indicate that changing quantities can potentially increase revenues from individual species with large own-price flexibilities, provided that the stocks supply a significant share of the total EU supply. That {{is found to be}} the case for sole and anchovies, but not for cod and hake. Thus, for example, for sole the short run falls in fishermen incomes following <b>quota</b> and thereby <b>quantity</b> reductions are partly compensated by rising prices. But for anchovies it only happens when quotas are reduced for several stocks simultaneously. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|R
40|$|The food crisis, {{considered}} a New Tsunami, is threatening food security in many countries, especially food net importing ones. Public subsidies to consumption {{are one of}} the policies considered by “victim ” countries in order to protect their population welfare. Egypt, as one of these countries, is characterized by a major food subsidy system that started after WW II and experienced a series of reforms. In this paper, we use a Mixed Demand approach to analyze the consumption structure of Egyptian households. Our model specification allows us to take into consideration the specification of the Egyptian subsidies system, with some food items having predetermined <b>quantity</b> <b>quotas</b> (sugar and oil) while others (bread and flour) have predetermined (subsidized) prices. Price, income and quota elasticities are estimated from an Egyptian family expenditure survey and welfare change measures are derived for several income quantiles. Policy simulations show the negative impact of the elimination of the actual system especially in the context of soaring food prices. ...|$|R
40|$|The China - Raw Materials dispute {{recently}} arbitrated by the WTO opposed China as defendant to the US and the EU as claimants, on {{the somewhat}} unusual issue of export restrictions. For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials {{of which the}} country is a major producer create shortages in foreign markets. This scarcity does not prevail in the Chinese market and the price in the foreign markets increases, providing a cost advantage to the Chinese industries using these raw materials. China defends export limitations using Article XX of the GATT 1994 on possible exceptions to the prohibition of quantitative restrictions to conserve natural resources. This paper oers a theoretical analysis of the dispute {{with the help of}} a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets using Fischer and Laxminarayan (2004) 's framework. The theoretical results focus on the eects of imposing an export <b>quota</b> on <b>quantities,</b> prices and ecacy, and are used to comment on the claims of the parties and on the ndings of the Panel and Appellate Body. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the con ict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the claimants as well as of China { for each product concerned in the case, dened at the HS 6 level. The empirical results show that among the products concerned in the dispute, two groups can be dierentiated depending on China's export position. When China is a major or rst exporter, there is no evident sign of the distortionary eect of an exportquota. When China is a weak exporter, but a strong producer and consumer, thereis evidence coherent with the model according to which China is imposing a quotaexport restriction that is inecient...|$|R
40|$|The EU banana {{market has}} been of {{enormous}} interest for researchers for a long time, especially after the import policy unification brought by the Common Market Organization for Bananas (CMOB) in 1993. Empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} CMOB and its subsequent modifications have been highly distorting. However, the quantifications made of those distortions by different authors vary a lot, not only in magnitude but also in direction. The reason is that for each evaluation, a different system of demand equations has been estimated. However, besides the different models used, there is one common denominator to all models. They do not incorporate the general restrictions (homogeneity, symmetry and adding up) necessary to make the demand estimations consistent with economic theory. In this paper we estimate the almost ideal demand system (AIDS) to calculate more reliable elasticities to facilitate future welfare analysis of the EU banana market. The inverse almost ideal demand system (IAIDS) was also estimated under the alternative assumption that import prices adjust to quantities instead to quantities adjusting to price variations as it has usually assumed. However, the results are not reported because due to the upcoming import policy and its subsequent <b>quota</b> elimination, <b>quantities</b> will not longer be predetermined. Preliminary results show that demand elasticities are different depending on the region of origin of the imported bananas. Latin American bananas are substitutes of bananas from preferred suppliers and complements of others while imports from the ACP are substitutes of all regions. EU bananas behave similar to Latin American {{in the sense that they}} are substitutes of all by other suppliers. Preliminary welfare analysis of the proposed policy shows that both Latin American producers and EU consumers of Latin American bananas will lost from the quota elimination and increase in the tariff level.

40|$|PresentationITQ systems {{generate}} ITQ prices. For {{any given}} ITQ-managed species there are typically two prices. One {{is for the}} annual (or seasonal) quota, the other is for the longer lasting ITQ-share. In well-functioning ITQ markets, these prices reveal important information about the fishery. In the single species framework, prices of annual quotas measure the current profitability of fishing and prices for ITQ-shares reflect the expected future profitability of fishing under the ITQ system. Trading arbitrage leads to a determinate functional relationship between the prices of annual <b>quantity</b> <b>quotas</b> and that of TAC-shares. In the multi-species framework, if the ability to select the species composition of the harvest is less than perfect, the information content of the ITQ-prices is much less straight-forward. For instance the price of annual quotas for a given species may, under not uncommon circumstances, far exceed its landings price or, alternatively, be approximately zero. This paper explores these issues. It derives explicit expressions ITQ prices under various circumstances including the multi-species context with imperfect selectivity, discarding possibilities and ITQ-noncompliance. To illustrate the issues, empirical data on ITQ prices in Iceland are presented...|$|R
40|$|We study optimal climate {{policy for}} a policy bloc of {{countries}} facing a market where emissions offsets {{can be purchased}} from a non-policy fringe of countries (such as for the CDM). Policy-bloc firms benefit from free <b>quota</b> allocations whose <b>quantity</b> is updated according to firms' past emissions, or their outputs. We show that the resulting abatement and its allocation between policy bloc and fringe are both inefficient. When firms buy offsets directly from the fringe and all quotas are traded at a single price, the policy bloc chooses to either not constrain the offset market, or ban offsets completely. The former (latter) case occurs when free allocation of quotas is not (very) generous, and the offset market is large (small). It is preferable for policy-bloc countries' governments to instead buy offsets directly from the fringe at a quota price below marginal damage cost of emissions, while the policy-bloc quota price will be above this cost. With maximization of global welfare and a unified quota price, this price is higher, and offsets constrained in fewer cases, but the solution still inefficient. Full efficiency then requires a higher quota price in the policy bloc than in the fringe...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{efficiency}} {{has to do}} {{with how}} much wealth a given resource base can generate. Equity {{has to do with}} how that wealth is to be distributed in society. Economic efficiency gets far more attention, in part because equity considerations involve value judgements that vary from person to person. The authors examine both the efficiency and the equity of different methods of pricing irrigation water. After describing water pricing practices in a number of countries, they evaluate their efficiency and equity. In general they find that water use is most efficient when pricing affects the demand for water. The volumetric, output, input, tiered, and two-part tariff schemes all satisfy this condition and can be efficient although whether efficiency is short-run or long-run, first- or second-best, varies. Pricing schemes that do not directly influence water input [...] per-unit areas fees for example [...] lead to inefficient allocation. But they are usually easier to implement and administer and require less information. The extent to which water pricing methods can effect income redistribution is limited, the authors conclude. Disparities in farm income are mainly the result of factors such as farm size and location and soil quality, but not water (or other input) prices. Pricing schemes that do not involve <b>quantity</b> <b>quotas</b> cannot be used in policies aimed at affecting income inequality. The results somewhat support the view that water prices should not be used to effect income redistribution because water prices are a poor vehicle for reducing income inequality. But pricing schemes that involve water quota rules can reduce income inequality. The authors demonstrate this with a two-rate tiered pricing scheme combined with equal quotas of the cheaper water.

40|$|Many {{ethnically diverse}} {{countries}} have policies that encourage integration across ethnic groups. This dissertation investigates the impact and welfare {{implications of a}} residential desegregation policy in Singapore, the ethnic housing quotas. I employ both reduced form and structural form methods. In Chapter 1, I use regression discontinuity analysis to estimate {{the impact of the}} <b>quota</b> on prices, <b>quantity</b> and quality of units sold. Because an individual's decision on where to locate affects ethnic distributions in aggregate, these externalities suggest that any decentralized equilibrium may not be optimal. To find the first best, just using housing prices is not sufficient because prices do not internalize the externalities. We need to know the shapes of household's preferences. In chapter 2, I use a structural demand estimation framework to estimate taste for living with own ethnic group neighbors. Finally, using these preference estimates, I simulate the first best equilibrium and compare it to the existing equilibrium with quotas. I find that all quotas have significant negative impact on the proportion of units sold at the quota cutoffs. Malay-constrained units are 5 % cheaper perhaps because the units sold are also of lower quality. The impact on the price and quality of Chinese- and Indian-constrained units are opposite. Chinese-constrained units are 7 % more expensive even though the units sold are of significantly worse quality. Indian-constrained units are 2 % cheaper even though the units sold are of a higher quality. (cont.) Using the structural estimation framework in Chapter 2, I find that all groups have strong preferences to live with at least some other members of their ethnic group. However, the shapes of preferences differ significantly across groups. The majority (the Chinese) exhibit preferences that are inverted U-shaped so that after a neighborhood reaches 43 % Chinese, they would rather add a new neighbor from the other group. I find similar evidence for the Indians but not for the Malays. My simulations show that the first best has fewer Chinese- and Indian-segregated neighborhoods but more Malay-segregated neighborhoods compared to the existing equilibrium with the quotas. Comparing data from 3 segregated towns before the quota, I find that after 10 years since the introduction of the quota, the decentralized equilibrium had moved the Malay and Indian proportions significantly closer to first best. by Maisy Wong.
