40|$|The Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS) {{designed}} by Bellare and Rogaway is a signature scheme provably secure against chosen message {{attacks in the}} random oracle model, whose security can be tightly related {{to the security of}} RSA. We derive a new security proof for PSS in which a much shorter random salt is used to achieve the same security level, namely we show that log 2 <b>q</b> <b>sig</b> bits su#ce, where <b>q</b> <b>sig</b> is the number of signature queries made by the attacker. When PSS is used with message recovery, a better bandwidth is obtained because longer messages can now be recovered. In this paper, we also introduce a new technique for proving that the security proof of a signature scheme is optimal. In particular, we show that the size of the random salt that we have obtained for PSS is optimal: if less than log 2 <b>q</b> <b>sig</b> bits are used, then PSS is still provably secure but it cannot have a tight security proof...|$|E
40|$|New {{results are}} {{announced}} linking {{properties of the}} symbol module and characteristic variety of a differential complex with test estimates near the characteristic variety of the type considered by Hörmander (½-estimate). The first result is the invariance of the test estimates under pseudo-differential change of coordinates, and {{this leads to the}} introduction of a normal form for the complex in the neighborhood of a Cohen-MacCauley point of the symbol module. If the characteristic variety V is a manifold near the Cohen-MacCauley point (x 0,ζ 0) with parametrizing functions p 1, [...] .,pq, where q is the codimension of the characteristic variety in the complexified contangent bundle, the matrix [Formula: see text] of Poisson brackets defines invariantly a Hermitian form Q on the normal space to V at (x 0,ζ 0) when the dpζ(x 0,ζ 0) are used as basis, and the test estimates are satisfied at the ith stage of the complex if <b>sig.</b> <b>Q</b> (signature of Q) is ≥ n - i + 1 (n the dimension of the base manifold) or rank <b>Q</b> - <b>sig.</b> <b>Q</b> ≥ i + 1. Finally, conditions are given in order that, on a manifold with smooth boundary, the associated boundary complexes satisfy the ½-estimate...|$|R
