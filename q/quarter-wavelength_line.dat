40|$|Abstract- Due to {{conformal}} capability, {{research on}} transmission lines has received much attention lately. Many {{studies have been}} reported in the last decade in which transmission lines have been analyzed extensively using various techniques. It is well known that transmission lines are used for transmission of information, but in this case the main aim is to deliver information from generator to receiver with low attenuation. To achieve this, the load should be matched to the characteristic impedance of the line, meaning that the wave coefficient should be near 1 (one). One of the most important methods for line matching is through <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>line</b> (quarter-wave transformer). Analysis of transmission lines using numerical methods is difficult because of any possible error that can occur. Therefore, the best solution in this case would be the use of any software package which is designed for analysis of transmission lines.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Embedded passives in {{multi-layer}} {{media have}} gained importance for offering an attractive {{solution to the}} implementation of off-chip passive components in RF and mixed signal circuits, especially for wireless applications. Among the passive devices, power dividers and combiners are extensively used for a host of applications including balanced mixers, phase shifters, and feed networks in antenna arrays. The Wilkinson power divider is one of most popular types of power dividers, having ideal transmission characteristics at the center frequency and enabling simple realization in planar transmission line technology. For RF and mixed-signal applications, however, the conventional Wilkinson power divider has a prohibitively large component footprint due to its <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>line</b> components. To realize practical Wilkinson power dividers for RF applications, more compact designs with smaller footprint size are developed in this thesis. A more compact layout is obtained by folding the quarter-wavelength sections in the general multi-level, multi-conductor environment.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a new topology of coupled line bandpass filter for wideband applications. The concept deals with an even number of identical <b>quarter-wavelength</b> coupled <b>lines</b> that are interconnected to form two parallel paths of series-connected coupled lines. Such way, a bandpass response of order | + 1 is resulted, where n is the number of identical coupled lines used. The existence transmission zero at both sides of the passband constitutes the main advantage of this filter topology, where very good selectivity can be ensured, while wide bandwidth can be achieved. The global synthesis of the proposed topology is presented for the case of second order response. The design synthesis was developed to control the electrical characteristics of the resonator such as bandwidth and also to fix the position of the transmission zeros frequencies. Besides, the fractional bandwidth on the in-band matching level can be controlled by varying the value of characteristic impedances of the coupled lines. For implementation of the second-order filter, the uses of symmetrical and asymmetrical coupled lines are studied in order to obtain better performance. In practice, asymmetrical coupled lines are more flexible in obtaining higher wave coupling, for better in-band matching level.

40|$|Modern satellite, {{wireless}} communications, and {{radar systems}} often demand wideband performance for multi-channel and multi-function operations. Among these applications, phased array antennas {{play an important}} role. This dissertation covers two wideband phased array antennas, one produces linear polarization and one produces circular polarization. The main {{difference between these two}} phased array antennas is the antenna array. For the linearly polarized array, a wideband microstrip line to slotline transition is used to feed a Vivaldi antenna. For the circularly polarized array, a wideband microstrip line to parallel stripline transition is used to feed a spiral antenna. From 3 to 12 GHz, the linearly polarized beam is steered over ? 15 ?. Since the electromagnetic spectrum is limited and has to be shared, interference is getting serious as more and more wireless applications emerge. Filters are key components to prevent harmonic interference. The harmonic signals can be suppressed by cascading additional lowpass filters or bandstop filters. A bandstop filter combining shunt open stubs and a spurline is proposed for a compact size and a deeper rejection. Two lowpass filters with interdigital capacitors and slotted ground structures are also studied. Harmonic suppression can also be achieved with the modification of bandpass filters. Three conventional bandpass filters with spurious passbands are investigated. The first one is a dual-mode patch bandpass filter. The second passband of the proposed filter is at 2. 88 fo, where fo is the fundametal frequency. The second filter is an open-loop bandpass filter.

Both the frequency and polarization reconﬁgurable designs were optimized, fabricated, and characterized through measurement. Our frequency reconﬁgurable E-shaped patch antenna design is able to support an overall bandwidth of 50 % by incorporating MEMS switches. The CP reconﬁgurable version design provided CP bandwidths of 17 % and 20 % for an element and array concept, respectively. Lastly, a rejection reconﬁgurable array element is developed. The design uses a reconﬁgurable frequency rejection slot within a wideband monopole antenna, and some simulation and experimental measurement studies are undertaken. By integrating another reconﬁgurable ﬁlter, a higher-order ﬁlter capability is achieved, leading to stronger rejection levels from strong blockers...|$|R
