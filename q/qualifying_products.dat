For example, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA was implemented on January 1, 1994) is a trade agreement among the USA, Canada and Mexico that liberalizes restrictions on trade among the three countries.

The economic growth in Mexico can in some part be attributed to raw cotton and other fibres being imported and subsequent local Mexican manufacturing taking place. This situation impacts favourably on the Mexican employment situation particularly in urban areas where significant garment manufacture is undertaken for both local consumption as well as subsequent export.|$|E

Product differentiation, driven by higher quality and consumer expectations, {{is one of the most}} powerful competitive strategies that EU farmers may adopt to face this challenge.

40|$|The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) {{authorized}} about $ 300 {{million in}} consumer rebate incentives for purchases of products rated under the 'ENERGY STAR' Program. ENERGY STAR, a voluntary labeling program established in 1992, provides consumers with energy efficiency data {{for a range}} of products so that they can make informed purchase judgments. The overall goal of the program is to encourage consumers to choose energy efficient products, advancing the nationwide goal of reducing energy consumption. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) managed the ENERGY STAR Program on a stand-alone basis until 1996 when it joined forces with the Department of Energy (Department). A Memorandum of Cooperation expanded the ENERGY STAR product categories, giving the Department responsibility for overseeing eight product categories such as windows, dishwashers, clothes washers, and refrigerators, while EPA retained responsibility for electronic product categories and heating, ventilating, and cooling equipment. Each agency is responsible for setting product efficiency specifications for those items under its control and for ensuring the proper use of the ENERGY STAR label in the marketplace. In August 2007, the EPA Office of Inspector General issued an audit report identifying significant control weaknesses in EPA's management of ENERGY STAR. The Department, concerned by the findings at EPA and eager to improve its own program, developed an approach to verify adherence to product specifications, ensure proper use of the ENERGY STAR label in the marketplace, and improve the establishment of product specifications. As evidenced by the commitment of $ 300 million in Recovery Act funds, the ENERGY STAR Program {{plays an important role in}} the U. S. efforts to reduce energy consumption. We initiated this audit to determine whether the Department had implemented the actions it announced in 2007 to strengthen the Program. The Department had not implemented planned improvements in the ENERGY STAR Program. Our audit revealed that officials had not: (1) Developed a formal quality assurance program to help ensure that product specifications were adhered to; (2) Effectively monitored the use of the ENERGY STAR label to ensure that only <b>qualifying</b> <b>products</b> were labeled as compliant; and (3) Formalized procedures for establishing and revising product specifications and for documenting decisions regarding those specifications. In our judgment, the delay in the Department's planned improvements in its management of the ENERGY STAR Program could reduce consumer confidence in the integrity of the ENERGY STAR label. Such loss of credibility could reduce energy savings, increase consumer risk, and diminish the value of the recent infusion of $ 300 million for ENERGY STAR rebates under the Recovery Act...|$|E
