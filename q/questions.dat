If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the <b>questions</b> they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities.

In this paper, we propose an integrated Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Machine Learning (ML) approach for <b>question</b> classification in English-Chinese cross-language <b>question</b> answering. To enhance <b>question</b> informer prediction, we use a hybrid method that integrates GA and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to optimize feature subset selection in a CRF-based <b>question</b> informer prediction model. The proposed approach extends cross-language <b>question</b> classification by using the GA-CRF <b>question</b> informer feature with Support Vector Machines (SVM).

With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 <b>questions</b> worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 <b>questions</b> worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 <b>questions,</b> each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 <b>questions,</b> each worth 80 or 40 points respectively.
