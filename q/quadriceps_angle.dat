50|$|Women {{have been}} known to suffer ACL {{injuries}} more frequently than men; current research gives some explanations for this. The joint through which the anterior cruciate ligament passes, along with the actual size of the anterior cruciate ligament, is significantly smaller in women than in men. This makes it more susceptible to damage. Along with these aspects, women tend to not activate their hamstring muscles as much as their male counterparts during certain cutting movements causing less stability in the knee joint. In addition, the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle,</b> or Q-angle, between the anterior superior iliac spine and patellar ligament may contribute to the predisposition of ACL tears. There is some evidence that suggests since women are known to have larger Q-angles than their male counterparts, they might be more susceptible to ACL tears.|$|E
40|$|The {{direction}} of {{the force of the}} quadriceps muscle group is expressed by the value of the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle,</b> between the long axis of the muscle rectus femoris and the patellar ligament. This value is often modified in dogs with patellar luxation, a common orthopaedic disease of the stifle joint in both small and large dogs. The aims of the present study were to give a reference value for the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> in healthy small and medium-large breed dogs. The medical records of healthy dogs and their pelvic limb radiographs (2014 - 2016) were reviewed. The radiographs were then divided into two groups: Group A (small dogs 15 kg). The <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> of each pelvic limb was assessed using a digital software program in order to compare values between the two groups. The radiographs of 160 dogs, 80 per group were studied along with the assessment of the 320 pelvic limbs. The median <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> values obtained were in contrast with the literature: in Group A, it was 18. 3 ° and, in Group B, it was 8. 7 °; moreover, the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> value for Group A was statistically higher than for Group B (p< 0. 0001). No significant difference was present between males and females, or between right and left hindlimbs. In Group B, the Labrador Retriever breed influenced the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (p = 0. 0005). The outcome of this survey provides an objective parameter, or additional information, to explain the different quadriceps mechanisms of small and medium-large dogs. In future studies the QA range values assessed in the two size groups may be useful in defining the magnitude of the malalignment of the extensor mechanism in both healthy dogs and ones with patellar luxation...|$|E
40|$|This {{prospective}} study used radiographic techniques {{to evaluate the}} inclination, Norberg, quadriceps and femoral varus angles, and the patellar position in dogs with developmental medial patellar luxation. The study also compared these measurements pre- and post-operatively to determine how they were affected by surgical procedures. Eighteen dogs with unilateral or bilateral luxation were used, and 4 groups were established according to luxation grade.

Significant differences for the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> were observed between Grades 1 and 3, and between Grades 2 and 3. The Norberg and femoral varus angles and the patellar position showed no changes between pre- and postoperative groups. However, measurements of the preoperative <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> and postoperative inclination angle may be useful for evaluating dogs with grade- 3 luxation.

40|$|Purpose: Measurement error when {{determining}} {{the size of}} an angle is always an issue for clinicians. Computer assistance may help to decrease that error. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the amount of error when measuring Q-angles using a goniometer and the IMAGEJ program, a public domain program developed at the U. S. National Institutes of Health. Methods: Two investigators participated in data collection; one who is a licensed physical therapist who has over 25 years of clinical practice in orthopedic physical therapy and a second who is familiar and experienced with analyzing data using the National Institute of Health (NIH) IMAGEJ computer program. <b>Quadriceps</b> <b>angles</b> measured bilaterally for 30 subjects between the ages of 21 and 50 years were recorded. Interrater and intrarater reliability with standard error of the measurements were calculated. Results: The ICC (2, 1) for measuring Q-angle with a goniometer was. 96 (SEM = 1. 02 °), while the ICC (2, 1) for measuring Q-angle with the IMAGEJ program was. 98 (SEM = 1. 05 °). The ICC (3, 2) between measures obtained with a goniometer versus the IMAGEJ program was. 89 (SEM = 2. 06 °). Conclusions: There is a high association between measures of Q-angle obtained with a goniometer compared to those obtained with computer-assistance using the IMAGEJ program. There may be a bias on the part of raters when measuring higher values of Q-angle. Further investigations should be conducted to examine the feasibility of increased use of IMAGEJ in measuring angles...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rice farming {{activities}} involve prolonged {{manual work}} and human-machine interaction. Prolonged farming risk-exposure {{may result in}} lower limb malalignment. This malalignment may {{increase the risk of}} lower extremity injury and physical disabilities. However, the prevalence and factors associated with lower extremity malalignment have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of lower extremity malalignment among rice farmers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 249 rice farmers. Lower extremity alignment assessment included: pelvic tilt angle, limb length equality, femoral torsion, <b>quadriceps</b> (Q) <b>angle,</b> tibiofemoral angle, genu recurvatum, rearfoot angle, and medial longitudinal arch angle. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participant characteristics and prevalence of lower extremity malalignment. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was foot pronation (36. 14 %), followed by the abnormal Q angle (34. 94 %), tibiofemoral angle (31. 73 %), pelvic tilt angle (30. 52 %), femoral antetorsion (28. 11 %), limb length inequality (22. 49 %), tibial torsion (21. 29 %), and genu recurvatum (11. 24 %). In females, the risk factors were abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and genu recurvatum. Being overweight was a risk factor for abnormal pelvic tilt angle, Q angle, and tibiofemoral angle. Age was a risk factor for limb length inequality. Years of farming were a major risk factor for abnormal Q angle, tibiofemoral angle, and foot malalignment. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was reported in this study. Female sex, being overweight, and years of farming were major risk factors for lower extremity malalignment. Lower extremity screening should assist in the identification of foot and knee malalignment in rice farmers. This may then lead to early prevention of musculoskeletal disorders arising from such malalignment. Usa Karukunchit, Rungthip Puntumetakul, Manida Swangnetr, Rose Boucau...|$|R

40|$|Aim: This methodological study {{investigated}} the number of brief maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVC) needed to show evidence of fibre activation, as indicated by changes in the phosphocreatine to creatine (PCr/ Cr) ratio. Methods: Subjects performed series of four, seven and/or 10 MVC (1 s on, 1 s off) of the m. <b>quadriceps</b> (60 °-flexion <b>angle).</b> Biopsy samples of the m. vastus lateralis were taken at rest and immediately post-exercise. Single muscle fibres were dissected from the freeze-dried samples and classified as types I, IIA or IIAX, using mATPase stainings. Fragments of characterized fibres were analysed for PCr and Cr content. Analyses of variance were performed to investigate changes in PCr/Cr per fibre group over time, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test (P < 0. 01). The fifth percentile of resting values of each fibre group was determined. Results: Mean PCr/Cr ratio after four, seven and 10 MVCs were significantly lower for all fibre groups (P < 0. 01). The mean decreases were 44, 64 and 76 %, respectively. However, only after seven and 10 contractions PCr/Cr ratios of all, but three type I and two type IIAX fibres, individual fibres were below the fifth percentile. Conclusion: In very short duration exercise, involving seven brief maximal voluntary contractions, changes in the PCr/Cr ratio indicated activation of different characterized muscle fibre fragments. The results suggest that this approach may be useful for investigating the pattern of fibre type activation in exercise of very short duration...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} lower-extremity injury among high school cross-country runners and to identify risk factors for injury, the authors prospectively monitored a cohort of 421 runners competing on 23 cross-country teams in 12 Seattle, Washington, high schools during the 1996 cross-country season. Collected were daily injury and athletic exposure (AE) reports, a baseline questionnaire on prior running and injury experience, anthropometric measurements, and coaches ’ training logs. The overall incidence rate of injury was 17. 0 / 1, 000 AEs. Girls had a significantly higher overall injury rate (19. 6 / 1, 000 AEs) than boys did (15. 0 / 1, 000 AEs) (incidence rate ratio 1. 3, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 0, 1. 6). Compared with boys, girls had significantly higher rates of injuries resulting in 15 days of disability. For the overall sample and for girls, Cox regression revealed that a <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> of 20 and an injury during summer running prior to the season {{were the most important}} predictors of injury. For boys, a <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> of 15 and a history of multiple running injuries were most associated with injury.

40|$|Female {{participation}} in athletic activities continues to rise. Mirroring this rise in activity {{is an increase}} in injuries to these participants. Patellofemoral dysfunction is a common, chronic, debilitating disorder among this group. Despite its common occurrence, patellofemoral pain is often misdiagnosed and not properly addressed during rehabilitation. Excess <b>quadriceps</b> (Q) <b>angle</b> and foot pronation have long been suspected to be predisposing factors for patellofemoral pain in females. Other static postural deviations such as knee recurvatum and anterior pelvic tilt have been shown to affect the biomechanics of the lower extremity, altering such variables as Q angle, foot pronation and rotatory status of the tibia. This leads one to question the contribution of static posture to patellofemoral pain pathology. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the postural variables of Q angle, foot pronation, recurvatum, and anterior pelvic tilt in an attempt to clarify our understanding of patellofemoral pain in females. A total of 49 subjects were used for this study. Twenty-eight females (36 symptomatic knees) with diagnoses or signs and symptoms directly relating to patellofemoral dysfunction were assigned to the patient group. This was further divided into subset groups: unilateral and bilateral dysfunction. Twenty-one additional asymptomatic females (62 asymptomatic knees) were used as a control. Subject groups were evaluated for Q angle, foot pronation, knee recurvatum, and anterior pelvic tilt. A Student 2 ̆ 7 s t-test was employed to analyze the variable significance with respect to patient versus control groups. A Pearson R was used to analyze correlation between variable and patient group. The data analyses failed to show any statistically significant findings to suggest a relationship or correlation between each of the individual variables and patellofemoral pain. It was theorized by the researcher that failure of these hypotheses was due to multiple possible scenarios. Perhaps the most important issue was difficulty measuring the biomechanical variables as evidenced by reproducibility with prior data. These individual factors may also overlap to the degree that one individual factor is not a significant enough causative factor; however, with contribution of other factors, patellofemoral pain is provoked. It has also been theorized that further studies including intrinsic factors of trochlear congruence, patellofemoral contact pressures, and dynamic measures (such as valgus moment, quadriceps timing, and activation) need to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Knee joint {{motion and}} {{quadriceps}} activity {{play a crucial}} role in all lower limb tasks, especially those which are highly dynamic and weight-bearing. Due to anatomical differences between men and women such as height, leg length, and hip width, alignment and mechanics of the lower limb are different between males and females. An anatomical variable which is associated with alignment in the lower limb is the <b>quadriceps</b> muscle <b>angle</b> (q-angle). The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a relationship between q-angle, activity of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and the kinetics and kinematics of the knee during stairclimbing. An investigation on the reliability of q-angle measurements was also made prior to the primary study. Methods: To test the interclass reliability of q-angle measurements, three individuals measured the q-angle on 20 subjects. The primary researcher measured the same twenty individuals on three separate days to determine intra-rater reliability. The primary study involved 10 male and 10 female subjects completing 20 stair-climbing trials (10 ascent, 10 descent). Kinematic and kinetic data were collected on the lower limbs as well as electromyography (EMG) on two quadriceps muscles and one hamstring muscle. Knee joint peak and occurrence of peak moments, average EMG amplitude and peak and occurrence of peak EMG were analyzed by gender and high and low q-angle. A two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the statistical significance of each measured variable (alpha = 0. 05). Results & Discussion: The inter-rater reliability for q-angle was low (0. 27 - 0. 78) but the intrarater reliability showed q-angle measurements to be very reliable (0. 80 - 0. 95). For study 2, it was found that females had increased vastus lateralis and vastus medialis peak EMG and average EMG amplitudes for stair ascent and descent compared to males. Furthermore, for descent only, females demonstrated having delayed occurrence of peak EMG for vastus lateralis and biceps femoris, and exhibited an increased peak knee extension moment and a decreased peak knee adduction moment compared to males. For q-angle, there was a significant difference found for biceps femoris occurrence of peak EMG during descent, with the high q-angle group having delayed occurrence of peak. For ascent, the high q-angle group had significantly increased average vastus lateralis EMG and an earlier occurrence of knee abduction moment. Q-angles were found to be higher for women compared to men. Conclusion: This study confirms that gender differences do exist in knee moment and thigh EMG parameters with stair ascent and stair descent. With the high incidence of significant findings for the quadriceps muscle, further investigation is warranted to determine if a relationship does exist between q-angle and knee joint function. It would also be recommended that hip mechanics be included in future studies due to the difference seen in adduction moments at the knee...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose The <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q-angle) is {{currently}} the only measurement of patellofemoral mechanics available in the clinical situation which does not necessitate the use of sophisticated radiographic equipment. It is generally assumed that for a given subject position and measurement procedure, the Q-angle is an absolute value rather than one which may vary with time.

40|$|Patellar {{instability}} {{most frequently}} presents during adolescence. Congenital and infantile dislocation of the patella {{is a distinct}} entity from adolescent instability and measurable abnormalities may be present at birth. In the normal patellofemoral joint an increase in <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> and patellar height are matched {{by an increase in}} trochlear depth as the joint matures. Adolescent instability may herald a lifelong condition leading to chronic disability and arthritis. Restoring normal anatomy by trochleoplasty, tibial tubercle transfer or medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction in the young adult prevents further instability. Although these techniques are proven in the young adult, they may cause growth arrest and deformity where the physis is open. A vigorous non-operative strategy may permit delay of surgery until growth is complete. Where non-operative treatment has failed a modified MPFL reconstruction may be performed to maintain stability until physeal closure permits anatomical reconstruction. If significant growth remains an extraosseous reconstruction of the MPFL may impart the lowest risk to the physis. If minor growth remains image intensifier guided placement of femoral intraosseous fixation may impart a small, but acceptable, risk to the physis. This paper presents and discusses the literature relating to adolescent instability and provides a framework for management of these patients.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to: a) investigate the relationship of selected anthropometric, strength, and kinematic variables to the incidence of patellofemoral stress syndrome in high school female athletes; and b) develop a predictive equation to screen individuals who may be predisposed to patellofemoral stress syndrome. Twenty-nine subjects were analyzed across nine dependent variables: two anthropometric measures, one strength measure, and six kinematic measures. Heavy subjects and those with a larger static <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q-angle) {{were more likely to have}} patellofemoral stress syndrome. Leg strength did not seem to be a factor. Also, a variable of gait, the time from foot contact to the time when the minimum dynamic Q-angle occurred, was significantly slower in the subjects with patellofemoral stress syndrome. Furthermore, a predictive equation, which we created using discriminant analysis, was 89 % accurate in predicting which subjects would or would not have patellofemoral stress syndrome. The equation uses an individual's weight, pelvic width, and static Q-angle. We conclude that, through proper screening, individuals susceptible to patellofemoral stress syndrome may be identified prior to their becoming symptomatic, and that, through identifying causal variables, corrective procedures may be introduced in order to prevent patellofemoral stress syndrome from hindering an individual's physical activity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Knees {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a complex}} degenerative disease with intra-articular changes affecting the amplitude of the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q). To measure this variable, {{it is necessary to}} use reliable protocols aiming at methodological reproducibility. The objective was to evaluate the intra-examiner and inter-examiner reliability of clinical and radiographic measures of the Q angle and to investigate the relationship between the degree of OA and the magnitude of this angle in the elderly. Materials and methods 23 volunteers had the Q angle measured by two evaluators at 48 -h interval. Clinical measurements were collected by using the universal goniometer in the same position adopted in the radiographic examination. Results The intra-examiner reliability was good (0. 722 to 0. 763) for radiographic measurements and low (0. 518 to 0. 574) for clinical assessment, while inter-examiner reliability was moderate (0. 634) for radiographic measurements and low (0. 499) to the clinics. The correlation analysis between the radiographic values with the OA classification showed no correlation between them (p = 0. 824 and r = - 0. 024). Conclusion Clinically, it is suggested that the radiographic examination is preferable to evaluate the Q angle of elderly women with knee osteoarthritis. Moreover, the magnitude of this angle did not correlate with the degree of impairment of OA in this population...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE - Tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove {{distance}} (TT-TG) has {{been regarded as}} {{a useful tool for}} establishing therapeutic choices for patellar instability. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} TT-TG negatively correlated with the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle,</b> suggesting that if used individually, neither provide a valid measure of instability. This study aimed to compare TT-TG distance between both knees in patients with unilateral instability to assess whether this measurement is a decisive element in the management decisions for patellar instability. METHODS - Sixty-two patients (18 male and 44 female), reporting to a specialist patella clinic for recurrent unilateral patellar instability, were included in the study. Patients underwent bilateral long leg computed tomography scan to determine TT-TG distance in both knees. Tibial TT-TG in symptomatic and asymptomatic knees in the same individual was compared statistically. RESULTS - Mean TT-TG distance in the symptomatic knee was 16. 9 (± 4. 9) mm, compared to 15. 6 (± 5. 6) mm in the asymptomatic knee. Tibial TT-TG was not significantly different between stable and unstable knees (n. s.). CONCLUSIONS - The lack of difference in TT-TG distance between stable and unstable knees suggests that TT-TG distance alone may not be a decisive element in establishing therapeutic choices for patellar instability. It should, therefore, be interpreted with caution during clinical evaluations. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} is a descriptive term applied {{to patients with}} nonspecific anterior knee pain, and {{is the most common}} knee problem. The pain in most patellofemoral disorders is generalized to the anterior part of the knee. One important concept in patellofemoral joint function is the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q-angle). Theoretically, a higher Q-angle increases the lateral pull of the quadriceps femoris muscle on the patella and potentiates patellofemoral disorders. This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between the anterior knee pain and Q-angle. Methods: This prospective study was performed on two groups; the case group consisted of 100 outpatients (44 men, and 56 women) aged between 15 and 35 years, with anterior knee pain. The control group consisted of 100 outpatients (50 men, and 50 women) with the same age distribution, who presented with different problems in the upper extremities and no knee problems. The Q-angle of each knee was measured in all participants, using a universal goniometer. Results: The mean Q-angle for men, women, and all participants in the case group was 15. 2, 20. 1, and 18. 0 degrees, respectively. In the normal control group the angles were 12. 1, 16. 7, and 14. 9 degrees, respectively. All these differences were statistically significant (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: These results substantiate the fact that patients with anterior knee pain have larger Q-angles than healthy individuals...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q-angle) {{represents}} the angle between the vector of {{action of the}} quadriceps and the patellar tendon. An increased Q-angle {{has been associated with}} an increased risk of patellar instability, although there is disagreement on its reliability and validity as it is affected by the position of the limb and contraction of the quadriceps. Tibial tuberosity–trochlear groove distance (TT–TG) is ascertained by axial CT scanning, with an increased value associated with patellar instability. This study aimed to determine whether the Q-angle correlates with the TT–TG distance in patients with patellar instability. Methods Q-angles were measured in 34 knees that had previously undergone CT scanning for assessment of patellar instability. Measurements were made with the patient supine, the knee extended and the lower limbs in neutral rotation with the quadriceps relaxed and contracted. TT–TG distance was measured on CT scanning in an identical position. Results Of the 34 knees measured, 24 had symptoms of patellar instability, and 10 were normal. A significant negative correlation between relaxed Q-angle and TT–TG in all knees was demonstrated (p = 0. 028). In symptomatic knees, contracted Q-angle also demonstrated a significant negative correlation with TT–TG (p = 0. 037). Conclusions If TT–TG distance is regarded as the gold standard measurement, Q-angle is not a reliable indicator of patellar instability. There is a clear need to develop methods to more fully characterise the knee and factors contributing to patellar instability. Level of evidence II...|$|E

Methods: To test the study hypothesis, a medical examination and survey of the living environment of collegiate soccer players was conducted and correlated with the existence of fifth metatarsal stress fractures. The survey and measurements were con-ducted in 273 male athletes from the same college soccer team between 2005 and 2013. A medical examination comprising assessment of stature, body weight, body mass index, foot–arch height ratio, toe-grip strength, <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle,</b> leg-heel angle, functional reach test, single-leg standing time with eyes closed, straight-leg raise angle, finger-floor distance, heel-buttock dis-tance, ankle joint range of motion, and a general joint laxity test were performed once a year, along with a questionnaire survey.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionPelvic width {{has been}} {{believed}} to affect patellar tracking by influencing the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q-angle). Anatomically, the upper {{arm of the}} Q-angle does not closely match {{the orientation of the}} quadriceps femoris. The pelvis is often considered wider and the Q-angle larger in female than in male individuals. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the accuracy of such an assumption by using a radiologic comparison, which might be more objective. Materials and methodsOne hundred consecutive adult patients (50 men and 50 women) aged 18 – 30 years with unilateral injury to the lower extremity were studied. Full-length standing X-rays of these patients was used to analyze the relationship between the pelvis and the uninjured lower extremity and compare it between the sexes. The pelvic width was defined as the distance between the centers of the bilateral femoral heads. ResultsThe pelvic width did not differ statistically between male and female (P= 0. 74). The femur length and sum of the lengths of the femur and tibia differed between the sexes (both P< 0. 001). Normalization of the pelvic width to the femur length or sum of the lengths of the femur and tibia resulted in a significant difference between male and female (P< 0. 001). The angle formed by the femoral and tibial mechanical axes correlated strongly with the angle formed by the femoral anatomic and tibial mechanical axes (Pearson correlation coefficient= 0. 89). DiscussionPelvic width does not differ with respect to gender. The pelvis may appear relatively wider in women due to the difference in body height. However, this difference may not increase Q-angle. Patellar mal-tracking may stem from other, more critical predisposing factors. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Anatomic study...|$|E

RESULTS: Toe-grip strength was significantly weaker in the injury group compared with the noninjury group, suggesting that weak toe-grip is associated with fifth metatarsal stress fracture (P <. 05). In addition, fifth metatarsal stress fractures were more common in the nondominant leg (P <. 05). Between-group comparisons of the other items showed no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: The association between weak toe-grip strength and fifth metatarsal fracture suggests that weak toe-grip may lead to an increase in the load applied onto the lateral side of the foot, resulting in stress fracture. The finding of stress fracture being more common in the nondominant leg needs further study. 博士（医学）・甲第 660 号・平成 28 年 11 月 24 日© The Author(s) 2015 : This open-access article is published and distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution - NonCommercial - No Derivatives License ([URL] licenses/by-nc-nd/ 3. 0 /), which permits the noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction of the article in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

40|$|Using a {{treadmill}} to monitor locomotion is extremely convenient for {{sport and exercise}} research (Nigg et al., 1995). A problem exists if kinematic, kinetic, and metabolic or other variables, for example, are not uniform between treadmill and overground locomotion. As Nigg et al. (1995) suggested discussion about the degree of similarity between overground and treadmill running is inconsistent throughout the literature. For example, Schache et al. (2001), {{in their study of}} the three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbopelvic- hip complex, found subtle but significant differences in the sagittal plane movement of the hip joint. However, Williams (1985) concluded that the only significant differences in kinematics present between overground and treadmill running were at speeds greater than 5 m. s- 1. Variability is inherent within and between all biological systems (Newell and Corcos, 1993). Given the huge number of degrees of freedom in the body, with its 102 joints, 103 muscles, 103 cell types and 104 neurones and neural connections (Kelso, 1995), it would seem that some degree of variability should be expected in all movements. Furthermore, as opposed to the traditional view that variability is error, variability is now seen as functional in many disciplines (Newell and Corcos, 1993; Hamill et al., 1999). Hamill et al. (1999) reported two separate experiments: one compared the effect of the <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> on coordination variability, whilst the other examined the relationship between coordination variability and patellofemoral pain. Variability in the coordination between body segments was seen in all groups, in both experiments. The former experiment was conducted overground and the later was conducted on {{a treadmill}}. Through visual inspection of the data (comparing the 'healthy' individuals in each study) there is evidence of decreased coordination variability during treadmill running. There is also evidence in the literature of differences in the amount of variability in angular kinematics between the two forms of locomotion. For example, Dingwell et al. (2001) compared sagittal plane ankle, knee and hip angles collected during overgound and treadmill walking. The results demonstrated significantly lower variability in the treadmill condition. Additionally, Nelson et al. (1972) reported reduced variability in the horizontal and vertical velocities of the centre of mass during treadmill as opposed to overground running. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess any differences in the variability of lower extremity coordination between overground and treadmill running. It was hypothesised that there would be significantly lower variability in lower extremity coordination in the treadmill condition than the overground condition...|$|E
40|$|Tears of the MPFL {{are often}} {{considered}} the essential lesion of recurrent lateral patella dislocation. Cadaveric sectioning {{studies have demonstrated}} that the MPFL provides 50 % to 60 % of the soft tissue restraint to lateral translation, and the medial patello-meniscal ligament contributes 24 %. Pathological conditions such as patella alta, trochlear dysplasia and an increased <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> from various torsional deformities of both the femur and the tibia can be associated with recurrent patello-femoral dislocation. All these conditions need to be corrected to restore the physiological biomechanics of the patello-femoral joint. Lateral retinacular release, proximal realignment and distal realignment are the most common procedures performed for this purpose. In recurrent patellar dislocation without any predisposing factor, all these non-anatomical surgical procedures have been used. They alter the pre-morbid patellar mechanics, and several studies reported inconsistent outcomes, recurrent dislocations, patello-femoral pain and arthritis in up to 40 % of patients. Several reconstruction procedures of the MPFL with semitendinosus, gracilis, quadriceps tendon, adductor magnus, iliotibial band and synthetic grafts have been described. Semitendinosus tendon autografts are the most commonly used reconstruction construct. The different techniques require the fixation of the graft to the patella through bone tunnels loop, anchors, endobutton or sutured to the periosteal and fibrous tissue overlying the patella. The medial fixation to the femur is performed through bone tunnel and interference screw, endobutton, washer or through an osteoperiosteal tunnel under the adductor magnus. Most of the pre-mentioned techniques have shown acceptable medium-term results in the mean of subjective symptomatic improvement and low rate of recurrence in 85 % to 93 % of the involved cases. At present, there is no clear consensus as to the best method to reconstruct the MPFL. Several questions need to be resolved and in particular: the right position of graft insertion on the patella; the best fixation methods; at which degree of knee flexion the graft must be tensionated and fixed to avoid overtightening and then increased loads on the patellofemoral joint, which in the long term may result in degenerative joint disease; the right position of graft insertion on the femur since several {{studies have shown that the}} femoral attachment of the MPFL is not clearly identifiable. Biomechanical data show significant increases in medial patellofemoral contact pressures when MPFL grafts is misplaced as little as 5 mm. Incorrect graft placement accompanied by a short graft increases medial patellofemoral contact pressures by over 50 %. In the future, a well controlled and standardised comparison of different surgical techniques is indicated, to assess whether a specific graft or technique is superior to the others...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: A avaliação {{postural}} bem como a mensuração da amplitude articular são instrumentos fundamentais para o diagnóstico, planejamento e acompanhamento da evolução e dos resultados de um tratamento fisioterapêutico. Elas podem ser realizadas tanto pela goniometria - método mais utilizado na clínica fisioterapêutica - como, com o avanço tecnológico, pela fotogrametria. OBJETIVOS: Verificar a confiabilidade paralela da fotogrametria computadorizada, utilizando dois softwares, o Corel Draw e o SAPo, em relação à goniometria para quatro ângulos nos membros inferiores. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODOS:Foram estudados 26 voluntários de ambos os sexos, assintomáticos, com idade entre 18 e 45 anos, sem anisomelia de membros inferiores maior que 1 cm. Foram mensurados os ângulos tíbio-társico (TT), de flexo/extensão do joelho (flex/ext), ângulo Q (Q) e ângulo do retropé, inicialmente, com um goniômetro manual e, posteriormente, pela fotogrametria digital por meio dos softwares Corel Draw v. 12 e SAPo v. 0. 63. RESULTADOS: Os ângulos TT (p= 0, 9991), do retropé (p= 0, 2159) e de flexo/extensão do joelho (p= 0, 4027) não foram estatisticamente diferentes entre os 3 métodos de avaliação. Já o ângulo Q foi significativamente diferente entre a goniometria e os dois softwares usados na fotogrametria (p= 0, 0067), embora os valores obtidos pelos mesmos não tenham diferido entre si (p= 0, 9920), demonstrando que os resultados da fotogrametria não foram influenciados pelos softwares utilizados. CONCLUSÃO: Para os ângulos avaliados em sujeitos jovens assintomáticos, a fotogrametria computadorizada é confiável paralelamente à goniometria, exceto para o ângulo Q. Portanto, na clínica fisioterapêutica, deve-se ter cautela no uso de medidas de ângulo Q provenientes de diferentes métodos de avaliação postural. BACKGROUND: Postural {{assessment and}} joint range-of-motion measurements are fundamental in diagnosing, planning and following up the evolution and results from physical therapy treatment. These {{can be done}} with the aid of goniometry the most common method in physical therapy practice - and also, through technological advances, by means of photogrammetry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the parallel reliability of computerized photogrammetry, using two software tools (Corel Draw and SAPo), in relation to goniometry, in four angles of the lower limbs. METHOD: Twenty-six asymptomatic volunteers of both sexes, aged between 18 and 45 years, were studied. None of them had leg length discrepancy greater than 1 cm. The tibiotarsal angle (TT), knee flexion/extension angle (F/E), <b>quadriceps</b> <b>angle</b> (Q) and subtalar angle (S) were measured. The measurement was done first with a manual goniometer and then with digital photogrammetry by means of the Corel Draw v. 12 and SAPo v. 0. 63 software. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the three evaluation methods for the TT (p= 0. 9991), S (p= 0. 2159) and F/E (p= 0. 4027) angles. However, for the Q angle {{there was a significant difference}} between goniometry and the software used in photogrammetry (p= 0. 0067), although there was no significant difference between two software tools (p= 0. 9920). This showed that the photogrammetry results were not influenced by the software used. CONCLUSION: In these healthy young subjects, computerized photogrammetry showed good parallel reliability in comparison with goniometry, for all the angles evaluated except for the Q angle. Therefore, in physical therapy practice, caution is needed in using Q angle measurements coming from different postural assessment methods...|$|E
