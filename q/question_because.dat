5|$|Branham's {{father was}} an alcoholic, and William Branham often talked about how his {{upbringing}} was difficult and impoverished. As a child, he would often wear a coat, held closed by safety pins, without a shirt underneath.

5|$|Photometric {{observations}} of Vesta {{were made at}} the Harvard College Observatory in 1880–1882 and at the Observatoire de Toulouse in 1909. These and other observations allowed the rotation rate of Vesta {{to be determined by}} the 1950s. However, the early estimates of the rotation rate came into <b>question</b> <b>because</b> the light curve included variations in both shape and albedo.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in <b>question,</b> <b>because</b> while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to <b>question,</b> <b>because</b> multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.|$|E
5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed without <b>question.</b> <b>Because</b> post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E

25|$|The state's {{principal}} {{argument was}} that the plaintiffs raised no substantial federal <b>question</b> <b>because</b> Gobitis settled the constitutional questions raised by the flag-salute expulsions. The state's brief quoted extensively from Justice Frankfurter's Gobitis opinion.

The American Legion's amicus curiae brief filed {{in support of the}} state's appeal did little more than duplicate the West Virginia argument.|$|E

25|$|The {{topic of}} animal {{consciousness}} is beset {{with a number}} of difficulties. It poses the problem of other minds in an especially severe form because animals, lacking the ability to use human language, cannot tell us about their experiences. Also, it is difficult to reason objectively about the <b>question,</b> <b>because</b> a denial that an animal is conscious is often taken to imply that it does not feel, its life has no value, and that harming it is not morally wrong. The 17th-century French philosopher René Descartes, for example, has sometimes been blamed for mistreatment of animals because he argued that only humans are conscious.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} primary Upanishadic texts, Devas and Asuras discuss and act to seek knowledge, for {{different}} purposes. In one case, for example, {{they go to}} Prajāpati, their father, {{to understand what is}} Self (Atman, soul) and how to realize it. The first answer that Prajāpati gives is simplistic, which the Asuras accept and leave with, but the Devas led by Indra do not accept and <b>question</b> <b>because</b> Indra finds that he hasn't grasped its full significance and the given answer has inconsistencies. Edelmann states that this symbolism embedded in the Upanishads is a reminder that one must struggle with presented ideas, learning is a process, and Deva nature emerges with effort.|$|E
25|$|Protests held by Cham {{organizations}} were ignored in Albania by both major parties, both the Democratic and the Socialist party. This {{is seen by}} some analysts {{as an attempt to}} strengthen the negotiating power of the Albanian government by non-raising the Cham Issue, while it could legitimately claim that it was obliged to raise the Cham <b>question</b> <b>because</b> of such strong pressure from the Cham community. The major Cham march of 2006, also strengthened the position of the Albanian government because it provided additional arguments in the controversy over the graves of Greek soldiers on Albanian territory. The Albanian government used as a justification the fact that Greece did not allow Chams to pay homage at the graves of their forefathers, while they were asking to build several cemeteries for its soldiers killed in Albania during the Second World War.|$|E
50|$|Further, the {{relevance}} of geography to international politics is <b>questioned</b> <b>because</b> advances in technology alter the importance of geographical features, {{and in some cases}} make those features irrelevant.

25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important <b>question</b> <b>because</b> it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus's draconitic lunar motion {{cannot be}} solved by the lunar-four {{arguments}} that are sometimes proposed to explain his anomalistic motion. A solution that has produced the exact 5458/5923 ratio is rejected by most historians though it uses the only anciently attested method of determining such ratios, and it automatically delivers the ratio's four-digit numerator and denominator. Hipparchus initially used (Almagest 6.9) his 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a Babylonian eclipse of 720 B. C. E. to find the less accurate ratio 7160 synodic months = 7770 draconitic months, simplified by him to 716 = 777 through division by 10. (He similarly found from the 345-year cycle the ratio 4267 synodic months = 4573 anomalistic months and divided by 17 to obtain the standard ratio 251 synodic months = 269 anomalistic months.) If he sought a longer time base for this draconitic investigation he could use his same 141 B. C. E. eclipse with a moonrise 1245 B. C. E. eclipse from Babylon, an interval of 13645 synodic months = 148807 1/2 draconitic months ≈ 14623 1/2 anomalistic months. Dividing by 5/2 produces 5458 synodic months = 5923 precisely. The obvious main objection is that the early eclipse is unattested though that is not surprising in itself {{and there is no}} consensus on whether Babylonian observations were recorded this remotely. Though Hipparchus's tables formally went back only to 747 B. C. E., 600 years before his era, the tables were actually good back to before the eclipse in <b>question</b> <b>because</b> as only recently noted their use in reverse is no more difficult than forwards.|$|E
500|$|According to Craig, {{premises}} (2)–(5) {{are relatively}} uncontroversial among philosophers, but [...] "the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) {{does not guarantee}} its metaphysical possibility." [...] Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the [...] "possibility premise", begs the question. He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if one understands the nested modal operators, and that if one understands them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then one understands that [...] "possibly necessarily" [...] is in essence the same as [...] "necessarily". Thus the premise begs the <b>question</b> <b>because</b> the conclusion is embedded within it.|$|E
