5|$|Jerry {{has been}} a fantastic {{ambassador}} for the club following his arrival from Northampton some four years ago. He quickly established himself in the first team {{and became one of}} the fans' favourites with his consistent performances, cheery smile and friendly manner. Without <b>question</b> <b>he</b> has played a very important part in the club's success in achieving promotion and subsequently retaining our Coca-Cola League One status.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his government, Pierlot {{returned}} to his position as senator of the arrondissements of Arlon, Marche-en-Famenne, Bastogne, Neufchâteau and Virton until the elections of February 1946. In September 1945, Pierlot {{was appointed to the}} honorary role of Minister of State by Charles and, shortly after the 1946 election, was awarded the title of Count. Because he was considered an anti-Leopoldist during the crisis surrounding the Royal <b>Question,</b> <b>he</b> was ostracised by the pro-Leopoldist successor to the Catholic Party, the Christian Social Party (Parti social-chrétien or PSC-CVP).|$|E
5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached the merits of the <b>question,</b> <b>he</b> would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E

5|$|While still a cricketer, Fender {{wrote for}} several London {{newspapers}} and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio. Although remaining in England, he {{commented on the}} 1924–25 Ashes series for the Sunday Express and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into <b>question.</b> <b>He</b> later wrote regularly for the Evening News and The Star; to the irritation of other journalists, {{he became the first}} man to use a typewriter in the press box.|$|E
5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in <b>question,</b> <b>he</b> was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.|$|E
5|$|Hutton's tonsils {{were removed}} {{before the start}} of the 1947 season but his poor health continued, forcing him to miss some games at the start of the season. Nevertheless, his form {{remained}} good and he scored four centuries in early matches. Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, affected by the retirement of key players and the frequent loss of Hutton to representative cricket. In the Test matches Hutton did not initially score heavily. His highest innings after three Tests was only 24 runs, and critics called his place into <b>question.</b> <b>He</b> returned to form during the fourth Test, his first at Headingley, with a four-and-a-half-hour century on a difficult pitch for batting. Hutton scored 83 and 36 in the drawn final Test, and England won the series 3–0 with the other two games drawn. Hutton hit 344 runs in the Test series at an average of 44.00; in all first-class matches, he scored eleven centuries and totalled 2,585 runs at an average 64.62, although his achievements that season were overshadowed by those of Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, who both broke the previous record for most runs scored in a season.|$|E

25|$|Although Boas did {{not name}} the spies in <b>question,</b> <b>he</b> was {{referring}} to a group led by Sylvanus G. Morley, who was affiliated with Harvard University's Peabody Museum.

25|$|As Leader of the Opposition {{during the}} 8th Canadian Parliament, Tupper {{attempted}} {{to regain the}} loyalty of those Conservatives who had deserted the party over the Manitoba Schools <b>Question.</b> <b>He</b> played up loyalty to the British Empire. Tupper strongly supported Canadian participation in the Second Boer War, which broke out in 1899, and criticized Laurier for {{not doing enough to}} support Britain in the war.|$|E

25|$|Laplace had a wide {{knowledge}} of all sciences and dominated all discussions in the Académie. Laplace {{seems to have}} regarded analysis merely {{as a means of}} attacking physical problems, though the ability with which he invented the necessary analysis is almost phenomenal. As long as his results were true he took but little trouble to explain the steps by which he arrived at them; he never studied elegance or symmetry in his processes, and it was sufficient for him if he could by any means solve the particular <b>question</b> <b>he</b> was discussing.|$|E
