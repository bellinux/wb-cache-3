However, powerful languages allow the user to specify complex mining queries {{to reduce the amount of}} extracted information. Hence, a suitable rule set may be obtained by means of a progressive refinement of the initial query. To assist the user in the refinement process, we identify several types of containment relationships between mining queries that may lead the process. Since the repeated extraction of a large rule set is computationally expensive, we propose an algorithm to perform an incremental recomputation of the output rule set.

These consist of scheduling a tree of interdependent communicating operators while exploiting both inter-operator and intra-operator parallelism. We develop algorithms for the specific problem of scheduling a Pipelined Operator Tree in which all operators run in parallel using inter-operator parallelism. Weights associated with nodes and edges represent respectively the cost of operators and communication. Communication cost is incurred only if adjacent operators are assigned different processors. The optimization problem is to assign operators to processors so as to minimize the maximum processor load. We develop two approximation algorithms for this NP-hard problem.

As a non line of sight technology, RFID provides {{an effective way to}} record movements of objects within a networked RFID system formed by a set of distributed and collaborating parties. A trail of such recorded movements is the foundation for enabling traceability applications. While traceability is a critical aspect of majority of RFID applications, realizing traceability for these applications brings many fundamental research and development issues. In this paper, we assess the requirements for developing traceability applications that use networked RFID technology at their core. We propose a set of criteria for analyzing and comparing the current existing techniques including system architectures and data models. We also outline some research opportunities in the design and development of traceability applications.

Today, many modern applications call for novel forms of queries that aim to find objects satisfying both a spatial predicate, and a predicate on their associated texts.

Currently the best solution to such queries is based on the IR 2 -tree, which, as shown in this paper, has a few deficiencies that seriously impact its efficiency.
