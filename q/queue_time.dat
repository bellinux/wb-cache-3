The device, which is similar in size and shape to a watch, functions similarly to the Qbot. Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas. The Qsmart requires users to have a smartphone which they can use to join virtual queues in a similar method to the Qbot.

40|$|Queuing {{is common}} in urban public places. Automatically {{monitoring}} and predicting <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> can not only help individuals to reduce their wait time and alleviate anxiety but also help managers to allocate resources more efficiently and enhance their ability to address emergencies. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate and predict <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> in indoor environments based on WiFi positioning data. First, we use a series of parameters to identify the trajectories {{that can be used}} as representatives of <b>queuing</b> <b>time.</b> Next, we divide the day into equal time slices and estimate individuals’ average <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> during specific time slices. Finally, we build a nonstandard autoregressive (NAR) model trained using the previous day’s WiFi estimation results and actual <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> to predict the <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> in the upcoming time slice. A case study comparing two other time series analysis models shows that the NAR model has better precision. Random topological errors caused by the drift phenomenon of WiFi positioning technology (locations determined by a WiFi positioning system may drift accidently) and systematic topological errors caused by the positioning system are the main factors that affect the estimation precision. Therefore, we optimize the deployment strategy during the positioning system deployment phase and propose a drift ratio parameter pertaining to the trajectory screening phase to alleviate the impact of topological errors and improve estimates. The WiFi positioning data from an eight-day case study conducted at the T 3 -C entrance of Beijing Capital International Airport show that the mean absolute estimation error is 147 s, which is approximately 26. 92 % of the actual <b>queuing</b> <b>time.</b> For predictions using the NAR model, the proportion is approximately 27. 49 %. The theoretical predictions and the empirical case study indicate that the NAR model is an effective method to estimate and predict <b>queuing</b> <b>time</b> in indoor public areas...|$|R

Optimal road pricing is capable of eliminating <b>queueing</b> <b>time</b> completely, but has practical difficulties because it requires continuously changeable charges. Because of these difficulties, a step-toll scheme has been considered {{as an alternative to}} reduce <b>queueing</b> <b>time.</b> However, previous literatures do not contain an analysis of the multi-step toll and the amount of <b>queueing</b> <b>time</b> removal that can be achieved by varying amounts of step tolls. They may be important for policy makers who are considering the introduction of step pricing under some circumstances. This paper is proposed to solve these problems. We show that at most n/(n + 1) of the total <b>queueing</b> <b>time</b> can be eliminated with the optimal n-step toll. Suboptimal n-step tolls are also derived to achieve an under-n/(n + 1) quequeing removal (where n = 1, 2 and 3). ...|$|R

50|$|Virtual queuing impacts {{the call}} center metrics in many ways. <b>Queue</b> <b>time</b> is {{normally}} measured as Average Speed-to-Answer (ASA). When callers are offered {{the option to}} receive a First In, First Out callback, the callers’ acceptance rates are typically 45% to 55%. Therefore, {{about half of the}} calls that would normally queue for 5 to 10 minutes will now only accrue a speed-to-answer (ASA) of approximately 10 seconds. Likewise, these callbacks with a shorter ASA will score within the Service Level objective. Since callers cannot abandon while in a virtual queue, the overall number of abandoned calls will decrease. The impact on customer satisfaction is positive, but tends to be more difficult to measure objectively. Virtual queuing can result in better customer experiences and improved contact center operations. But there are several types of virtual queuing systems.|$|E

An effective tool for a quick identification of sensitivity of a specific operation to a <b>queue</b> <b>time</b> was developed at Micron Israel and it is applied on production material. The algorithm calculates the average absolute delta of responses between consecutive step QTs, where a minimal value is accepted in steps with a linear correlation between the QT and the response.

This algorithm was used on production material and indeed helped to detect a new QT dependency in specific process steps. The <b>Queue</b> <b>Time</b> Sensitivity Analysis (QTSA) algorithm is a novel methodology to detect correlation of QT in a single process step to a certain electrical EOL failure. It can be easily implemented in a fabrication site by the IT team.

40|$|Abstract. Production {{parallel}} {{systems are}} space-shared and hence em-ploy batch queues {{in which the}} jobs submitted to the systems are made to wait before execution. Thus, jobs submitted to parallel batch systems incur <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times</b> {{in addition to the}} execution times. Prediction of these <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times</b> is important to provide overall estimates to the users and can also help metaschedulers make scheduling decisions. Analyses of the job traces of supercomputers reveal that about 56 to 99 % of the jobs incur <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times</b> of less than an hour. Hence, identifying these quick starters or jobs with short <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times</b> is essential for overall improvement on <b>queue</b> waiting <b>time</b> predictions. Existing strategies provide high overestimates of upper bounds of <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times</b> rendering the bounds less useful for jobs with short <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times.</b> In this work, we have developed an integrated framework that uses the job characteristics, and states of the queue and processor occupancy to identify and predict quick starters, and use the existing strategies to predict jobs with long <b>queue</b> waiting <b>times.</b> Our experiments with different production supercomputer job traces show that our pre-diction strategies can lead to correct identification of up to 20 times more quick starters and provide tighter bounds for these jobs, and thus result in up to 64 % higher overall prediction accuracy than existing methods...|$|R
