For well-deformed systems a method is presented by which the intrinsic components of any boson number preserving operator can be calculated in second <b>quantized</b> <b>form</b> and to leading order in the boson number. In this way vibrational and rotational modes are identified and the corresponding excitation energies and moments of inertia are calculated to leading order in the boson number.

40|$|A subtle {{relation}} between Quantum Hall physics and {{the phenomenon of}} pairing is unveiled. By use of second quantization, we establish a connection between (i) a broad class of rotationally symmetric two-body interactions within the lowest Landau level and (ii) integrable hyperbolic Richardson-Gaudin type Hamiltonians that arise in (p_{x}+ip_{y}) superconductivity. Specifically, we show that general Haldane pseudopotentials (and their sums) can be expressed as a sum of repulsive non-commuting (p_{x}+ip_{y}) -type pairing Hamiltonians. For the Laughlin sequence, {{it is observed that}} this problem is frustration free and zero energy ground states lie in the common null space of all of these non-commuting Hamiltonians. This property allows for the use of a new truncated basis of pairing configurations in which to express Laughlin states at general filling factors. We prove separability of arbitrary Haldane pseudopotentials, providing explicit expressions for their second <b>quantized</b> <b>forms,</b> and further show by explicit construction how to exploit the topological equivalence between different geometries (disk, cylinder, and sphere) sharing the same topological genus number, in the second quantized formalism, through similarity transformations. As an application of the second quantized approach, we establish a "squeezing principle" that applies to the zero modes of a general class of Hamiltonians, which includes but is not limited to Haldane pseudopotentials. We also show how one may establish (bounds on) "incompressible filling factors" for those Hamiltonians. By invoking properties of symmetric polynomials, we provide explicit second quantized quasi-hole generators; the generators that we find directly relate to bosonic chiral edge modes and further make aspects of dimensional reduction in the Quantum Hall systems precise.

Based on exact diagonalization studies and variational wave functions, we predict that such a state is likely to occur when a system of two-component bosons in two dimensions, interacting via a species independent contact interaction, is exposed to a synthetic magnetic field of strength that corresponds to a filling factor of unity. The fermions forming the SU(2) singlet Fermi sea are bound states of bosons and <b>quantized</b> vortices, <b>formed</b> {{as a result of the}} repulsive interaction between bosons in the lowest Landau level...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{an important}} question discussed by the quantum turbulence community during the last decade: do <b>quantized</b> vortices <b>form,</b> in zero-temperature superfluids, coherent structures similar to vortex tubes in ordinary, viscous turbulence? So far the evidence provided by numerical simulations is that bundles of quantized vortices appear in finite-temperature superfluids, but from the interaction with existing coherent structures in the turbulent (viscous) normal fluid, rather than due to the intrinsic superfuid dynamics. In this report we show that, in very intense quantum turbulence (whose simulation {{was made possible by}} a tree algorithm), the vortex tangle contains small coherent vortical structures (bundles of quantized vortices) which arise from the Biot-Savart dynamics alone, and which are similar to the coherent structures observed in classical viscous turbulence.
