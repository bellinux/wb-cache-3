5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} <b>quadriga,</b> the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
5|$|The gate, {{built of}} large square blocks of {{polished}} white marble fitted together without cement, has {{the form of}} a triumphal arch with three arched gates, the middle one larger than the two others. The gate is flanked by large square towers, which form the 9th and 10th towers of the inner Theodosian wall. With the exception of the central portal, the gate remained open to everyday traffic. The structure was richly decorated with numerous statues, including a statue of Theodosius I on an elephant-drawn <b>quadriga</b> on top, echoing the Porta Triumphalis of Rome, which survived until it fell down in an earthquake in 740. Other sculptures were a large cross, which fell in an earthquake in 561 or 562; a Victory, which was cast down in the reign of Michael III; and a crowned Fortune of the City. In 965, Nikephoros II Phokas installed the captured bronze city gates of Mopsuestia in the place of the original ones.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable moments in the race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the <b>quadriga</b> while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E
5|$|Syme {{argued that}} {{it was a mistake to}} regard it as a {{historical}} work at all and that no clear propaganda purpose could be determined. He theorized that the History is primarily a literary product – an exercise in satire produced by a 'rogue scholiast' catering to (and making fun of or parodying) the antiquarian tendencies of the Theodosian age, in which Suetonius and Marius Maximus were fashionable reading and Ammianus Marcellinus was producing sober history in the manner of Tacitus. (The History implausibly makes the Emperor Tacitus (275–276) a descendant and connoisseur of the historian). In fact in a passage on the <b>Quadriga</b> tyrannorum — the 'four-horse chariot of usurpers' said to have aspired to the purple in the reign of Probus — the History itself accuses Marius Maximus of being a producer of 'mythical history': homo omnium verbosissimus, qui et mythistoricis se voluminibis implicavit ('the most long-winded of men, who furthermore wrapped himself up in volumes of historical fiction'). The term mythistoricis occurs nowhere else in Latin. Of considerable significance in this regard is the opening section of the life of Aurelian, in which 'Flavius Vopiscus' records a supposed conversation he had with the City Prefect of Rome during the festival of Hilaria in which the Prefect urges him to write as he chooses and invent what he does not know.|$|E
5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies {{up to the}} sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the sack of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper <b>quadriga</b> that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the spina, the central reservation, robbed of its splendor. Today, only the obelisks and the Serpent Column stand where for centuries the spectators gathered. In the West, the games had ended much sooner; {{by the end of}} the fourth century public entertainments in Italy had come to an end in all but a few towns. The last recorded chariot race in Rome itself took place in the Circus Maximus in 549 AD.|$|E

50|$|The first distinctively Roman silver coin {{appeared}} around 226 BC.

25|$|Other Latin {{words that}} {{distinguish}} chariots {{by the number}} of animals yoked as a team are <b>quadriga,</b> a four-horse chariot used for racing and associated with the Roman triumph; triga, or three-horse chariot, probably driven for ceremonies more often than racing (see Trigarium); and seiugis or seiuga, the six-horse chariot, more rarely raced and requiring a high degree of skill from the driver. The biga and <b>quadriga</b> are the most common types.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the vehicle has been {{estimated}} at 25–30kg, with a maximum manned weight of 100kg. The biga is typically built with a single draught pole for a double yoke, while two poles are used for a <b>quadriga.</b> The chariot for a two-horse racing team is not thought to differ otherwise from that drawn by a four-horse team, and so the horses of a biga pulled 50kg each, while those of the <b>quadriga</b> pulled 25kg each.|$|E
25|$|Inscriptions {{referring}} to the bigarius as young suggest that a racing driver had to gain experience with a two-horse team before graduating to a <b>quadriga.</b>|$|E

50|$|The fable was {{composed}} in Latin by Laurentius Abstemius and {{appeared in his}} Hecatomythium (1490) under the title Musca et <b>Quadrigae.</b> It {{was added to the}} Perry Index as Fable 724.

25|$|The date {{at which}} chariot races were {{introduced}} at the Olympian Games is recorded by later sources as 680 BC, when <b>quadrigae</b> competed. Races on horseback were added in 648. At Athens, two-horse chariot races {{were a part}} of athletic competitions from the 560s onward, but were still {{not a part of the}} Olympian Games. Bigae drawn by mules competed in the 70th Olympiad (500 BC), but they were no longer part of the games after the 84th Olympiad (444 BC). Not until 408 BC did bigae races begin to be featured at Olympia.|$|R
50|$|The emperor {{expressed}} an interest in seeing a model of the building, and a plaster scale model (2 cm per meter) was constructed by Louis Villeminot between April 1862 and April 1863 at a cost of more than 8,000 francs. After previewing it, the emperor requested several changes to the design of the building, the most important of which was the suppression of a balustraded terrace with corner groups {{at the top of the}} facade and its replacement with a massive attic story fronted by a continuous frieze surmounted by imperial <b>quadrigae</b> over the end bays.|$|R
25|$|Two-horse chariots are {{a common}} icon on Roman coins; see bigatus, a type of denarius so called because it {{depicted}} a biga. In the iconography of religion and cosmology, the biga represents the moon, as the <b>quadriga</b> does the sun.|$|E
25|$|This {{last and}} most other Roman coins were {{produced}} in small numbers until {{the introduction of the}} didrachm we refer to as the quadrigatus. The quadrigatus, produced in large quantity starting around 235 BC, was named after the reverse image of Victory driving a <b>quadriga</b> and was produced for about 2 decades, becoming more and more debased (to as little as 30% silver) during the second Punic war.|$|E
25|$|Of the cars, {{the most}} popular was the carrus, a {{standard}} chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A carrus with two horses was a biga; three horses, a triga; and four horses a <b>quadriga.</b> The tyres were of iron. When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage.|$|E
5000|$|Certain nouns in Latin were pluralia tantum, i.e. nouns {{that did}} not exist in the {{grammatical}} singular, for example litterae [...] "a letter", castra [...] "a camp", catēnae [...] "a set of chains", vestīmenta [...] "a set of clothes", hibernae [...] "winter quarters", nūptiae [...] "a wedding", <b>quadrīgae</b> [...] "a four-horse chariot" [...] etc. A special series of numeral adjectives was used for counting these, namely ūnī, bīnī, trīnī, quadrīnī, quīnī, sēnī, and so on. Thus Roman authors would write: ūnae litterae [...] "one letter", trīnae litterae [...] "three letters", quīna castra [...] "five camps" [...] etc.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>Quadrigae</b> Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus), {{the author}} {{includes}} Firmus, {{said to have}} been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by ostriches, he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|R
5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so {{that there could be}} even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (<b>quadrigae)</b> and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to show off his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|R

25|$|An ancient Roman car or chariot {{drawn by}} four horses abreast {{together}} with the horses drawing it was called a <b>Quadriga,</b> from the Latin quadriugi (of a team of four). The term sometimes meant instead the four horses without the chariot or the chariot alone. A three-horse chariot, or the three-horse team drawing it, was a triga, from triugi (of a team of three). A two-horse chariot, or the two-horse team drawing it, was a biga, from biugi.|$|E
5000|$|The emperor's <b>quadrigae</b> {{were never}} added, {{although}} {{they can be}} seen in the model. Instead Charles-Alphonse Guméry's gilded bronze sculptural groups Harmony and Poetry were installed in 1869. The linear frieze seen in the model was also redesigned with alternating low- and high-relief decorative medallions bearing the gilded letters from the imperial monogram ("N" [...] for Napoléon, [...] "E" [...] for Empereur). The custom-designed letters were not ready in time for the unveiling and were replaced with commercially available substitutes. After the fall of the empire in 1870, Garnier was relieved to be able to remove them from the medallions. Letters in Garnier's original design were finally installed during the restoration of the building in 2000.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} the Homeric times, we find the {{description}} of a man, who keeps four horses abreast at full gallop, and leaps from one to another, amidst a crowd of admiring spectators. Eustathius on Homer's Iliad, Lib. IV, assures us that riders might have up to six horses all abreast. In the games of the Roman circus, this sport was also very popular. The Roman desultor generally rode only two horses at the same time, sitting on them without a saddle, and vaulting upon either of them at his pleasure. He wore a hat or cap made of felt. The taste for these exercises was carried to so great an extent, that young men of the highest rank not only drove bigae and <b>quadrigae</b> in the circus, but exhibited these feats of horsemanship.|$|R
50|$|The baths {{occupy the}} high-ground on the {{northeast}} summit of the Viminal, {{the smallest of the}} Seven hills of Rome, just inside the Agger of the Servian Wall. They served as a bath for the people residing in the Viminal, Quirinal, and Esquiline quarters of the city. The <b>Quadrigae</b> Pisonis, a 2nd-century monument with various reliefs, some private homes, and a relief representing the temple of Quirinus once stood at the site but were demolished to build the baths. The water supply was provided by the Aqua Marcia, an aqueduct that had long served the city of Rome since the early 2nd century. To properly supply the baths, the supply of water to the city was increased under the order of Diocletian. The baths may have also been supplied by the Aqua Antoniniana, which was originally positioned to supply Caracalla's baths in the early 3rd century.|$|R
