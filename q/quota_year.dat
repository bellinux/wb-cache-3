Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. Both {{internal}} and external factors influence on the market orientation of actors in the chain. In {{the case of the}} Norwegian king crab fishery the regulation of the fishery, i. e. the start of the <b>quota</b> <b>year</b> in September, was regarded by the onshore processing industry to negatively affect their market orientation. Starting the fishing season in September, {{the same time as the}} crab fisheries in competing countries, tended to oversupply the international markets affecting the value creation. Starting the quota in January, when there is a high demand for live king crab and limited supply, seemed to present an alternative approach. As a result, the Norwegian government changed the <b>quota</b> <b>year</b> for king crab to start in January from 2016. Whilst some anticipate realisation of the intended benefits, increased king crab supplies at a time of greater demand, resulting in higher prices for live crab, others are more pessimistic. The concern is that fishermen will prioritise other seasonal fisheries (cod), which fully engage marketing channels in many parts of Norway at this time. Also, in this period the quality of the crab is not optimal which might influence price. By July 2016 the industry's reaction to this change will be evident. The paper present interim results of affected supply and value creation this winter. The paper discuss some of the challenges of market orientation and how exogenous factors, like different actors in the chain having different incentives affecting the overall market orientation and value creation within a particular chain...|$|E

40|$|Chantier qualité GAPiecewise Weibull {{proportional}} hazard {{models were}} used to investigate the effect of genetic and nongenetic factors on functional and true longevity traits of the Slovenian Brown cattle breed. Records of 37 908 Brown cows from 2401 Slovenian herds were used. As these herds were characterised by a relatively small average herd size starting from 6. 7 in 1999 and increasing to 8. 7 Brown cows per herd in 2008, milk yield classification was made within different herd size groups. The hazard rate was {{the lowest in the}} first part of each lactation and was increasing for later stages. Culling risk was lower for cows from herds increasing in size, for cows with higher milk production and for cows from a region with smaller herd sizes and tougher conditions for cattle breeding. The latter result is surprising and may be related to better attention to maintain the animals, despite their lower milk production. The introduction of the milk quota system and drought was found to have an important effect on culling policy between the last seasons of the years 2001 and 2003. Seasonal effects were not related to the milk <b>quota</b> <b>year</b> (from April to March), but to the effect of shortage in fodder during the winter time. The effect of age at first calving and the interaction between year and milk yield class were not found to be significant. Heritability for functional and for true longevity were similar at around 10 % each. Inclusion of a correction for class of milk yield to approximate functional longevity increased the herd-year random effect variance by 53 %, whereas the sire variance increased by only 14 %. The correlation coefficient between ranks of breeding values for functional and true longevity was high (0. 91), whereas genetic trends were not found to be significant. To assess their predictive ability, models were compared looking at the survival rate of 4212 second-crop daughters not included in the initial models. The average correlation between estimated breeding values and survival at different stages was 0. 39 for true longevity and 0. 43 for functional longevity. Results showed that ranking milk yield at population level is appropriate to correct for voluntary culling on low production in small herds...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the direct and}} indirect epidemiologic and economic effects of lactational treatment of new bovine subclinical intramammary infections (IMI) caused by contagious pathogens using an existing bioeconomic model. The dynamic and stochastic model simulated the dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Escherichia coli during lactation and the dry period in a 100 -cow dairy herd during 1 <b>quota</b> <b>year.</b> Input parameters on cure were obtained from recent Dutch field data. The costs of clinical IMI, subclinical IMI, and intervention were calculated into the combined total annual net costs of IMI per herd. The cost effectiveness of 4 scenarios with lactational intervention was determined; scenarios included no intervention, treatment after 1 mo of infection, treatment after 2 mo of infection, and treatment after 1 mo of infection and culling of uncured cows after 2 mo of infection. Model behavior was observed for variation in parameter input values. Compared with no lactational intervention, lactational intervention of new subclinical IMI resulted in fewer clinical flare ups, less transmission within the herd, and much lower combined total annual net costs of IMI in dairy herds. Antimicrobial treatment of IMI after 1 mo of infection and culling of uncured cows after 2 mo of infection resulted in the lowest costs, whereas treatment after 2 mo of infection {{was associated with the}} highest costs between the scenarios with intervention. Changing the probability of cure resulted in a nonlinear change in the cumulative incidence of IMI cases and associated costs. Lactational treatment was able to prevent IMI epidemics in dairy herds at high transmission rates of Strep. uberis, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli. Lactational treatment did not limit the spread of Staph. aureus at high transmission rates, although the associated costs were lower compared with no intervention. To improve udder health in a dairy herd, lactational treatment of contagious subclinical IMI must therefore be preceded by management measures that lower the transmission rate. Lactational treatment of environmental subclinical IMI seemed less cost effective. Detection of subclinical IMI needs improvement to be able to most effectively treat subclinical IMI caused by contagious pathogens during lactation.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY I I This year, {{world events}} -including {{the war in}} Iraq, terrorism, and the {{continuing}} decline of financial markets for a third {{year in a row}} (unheard of since the Great Depression) -impacted businesses, nonprofit organizations, and charities worldwide, and the personal lives of us all. I In spite of these dramatic events, members, leaders, and staff rose to the occasion to ensure Quota International's success. Quick action was taken to avert a financial crisis once it became apparent that financial markets would decline for yet another year, eliminating certain activities, I suspending our grants programs, and reducing staff. And members showed their support and commitment for Quota by donating at very generous levels when Quota's need became apparent. I One thing is certain [...] . Quota spirit {{is alive and well in}} all comers of Quota's world. YOU participated in Quota and We Share Foundation programs, activities, services, and contests­including the We Share Foundation's first-ever Quota Cares Month public awareness initiative­I in record numbers. And because of the wonders of technology WE were able to share a record I number of your service successes on our Web sites and in our publications -the most ever. In the year 2000, we featured clubs in 27 articles in our printed publications. In 2002, only two short years later, that number jumped to 74 articles in our printed and Web publications PLUS 62 individual Web stories of amazing Volunteers of the Year you nominated. I Technology also permitted us to share Quota news throughout the year via our revised Quota Home Page launched in October. We were able to report news about Quota's calendar change, I proposed bylaws, board nominees, and other Quota business as decisions were made or news was announced. And throughout this <b>Quota</b> <b>year</b> we have been adding new sections, features, resources, and information to www. guota. org to empower every member and club worldwide. I Our most recent addition, thanks to our Friends of Quota, was a major section "For Clubs" which is the complete source for all Quota and We Share Foundation club programs, services, information, membership tools, administrative procedures and guidelines, and more. In these tenuous times, its comforting to know that a global network of people of different I nationalities, cultures, and backgrounds are united in their desire to work positively towards making our world a better place. I I 1 I I Part I of my report, the Executive Summary, contains highlights of 2002 - 2003 Quota International and We Share Foundation activities. And for those of you who appreciate a more I detailed accounting, please see Part II. On behalf of the staff of Quota International, please know it has been a pleasure serving you, your clubs, and your leaders this past year. I MOVING FORWARD WITH LEADERS AS LISTENERS Since 1995, Quota's award-winning Leaders as Listeners program has served as the guiding force in the organization's strategic decision making. The beauty ofthis program is that it I provides a mechanism for leaders to seek member feedback on important decisions facing the board ofthe directors and voting delegates. I Thanks to the Leaders as Listeners prob'Tam, a major decision was made this year to change the timing of Quota's calendar of annual meetings. Based on positive feedback received from members at Convention 2002, 2002 District Conferences, and leaders who attended 2002 I Governors Seminar, the board of directors voted to change Quota's calendar of meetings. Beginning in 2003, Governors Seminar will now be held in conjunction with the opening of convention and district conferences will be held March through June beginning in 2004 so that I club and district leadership terms coincide. (Districts are welcome to plan an additional, optional "mini" conference in September or October 2003). In addition, the board ofdirectors sent a proposal to the Bylaws Committee recommending a change in the frequency of conventions I effective in 2004. That proposal will be discussed and voted at Convention 2003. EXPANDING QUOTA COMMUNICATIONS I The launching ofQuota's newly revised Quota Home Page in October 2002 was a major event in the organization's recent history. Originally launched in 1998, the updated site contains new features including [...] . I • A marketplace where you can purchase jewelry, order publications, or find out how you can honor someone special. I • A comprehensive section for clubs which contains complete information on programs, services, resources, administrative procedures, and much more for clubs. • A special section just for club presidents which includes important messages, reminders, and announcements. I • Complete information on how you can organize a new club. • Quota's annual calendar -which is continually updated. I • The latest Quota news headlines. • An in-depth history of Quota International including a profile ofFounder Wanda Frey Joiner and the story of Quota's beginnings • Information on how people who care can join Quota. I • More in-depth information about convention including a site to print the current convention program, tour information, hotel and meeting registration forms, and more. I I am proud to report that this new site won the 2003 Communicator's Award of Distinction for exceeding the communication industry'S high standards for excellence. In addition to launching our new and improved Quota Web Site, we updated and improVed our We Share Foundation I Web Site (www. wesharefoundation. org), produced and published four issues of our We Share e­Zine and one issue ofour Quotarian magazine. And of course we have continued our series of e-communications -the Leadership e-Alert, the Quota e-Bulletin, and a new Quota e-News I Update which contains short announcements. 2 I I I I STRENGTHENING QUOTA'S MEMBERSHIP I As of December 31, 2002, Quota International's official membership was 6850 including the members from 4 newly organized clubs. While no new clubs have chartered yet in 2003, several organization efforts are underway. I • RECRUITMENT Members worldwide are committed to Quota recruitment: clubs are recruiting at a healthy 13. 6 % with 934 new members reported as joining in the 2002 calendar year. To encourage I continued recruitment success, Quota operates two annual recruitment challenges that every club can win. Also, we share recruitment successes reported by our clubs; we also welcome every new member and thank and recognize sponsors of every new recruit reported to the QI Office. I Once again this year, Quota sponsored a special membership rewards initiative; new member sponsors received redeemable certificates to apply toward a reduction in their own dues payment in December 2003, or a reduction in their 2003 convention registration when the member(s) they I sponsored during 2002 renewed their membership in January, 2003. This was supported by a generous group ofQuotarians, "Wanda's Team" who are funding this new initiative. I • RETENTION Retention remains one ofthe most important issues facing clubs worldwide. Historically, on average, clubs lose more than half ofthe new members they recruit by the member's fifth year. I Quota's future as an international organization is dependent on the success ofour current and future clubs. Through our Leaders as Listeners program, we learned that there are three important ingredients in every successful club: I • INGREDIENT 1 : Positive attitudes and an encouraging environment -where member needs are met, problems are solved in a positive way, negativity is not condoned, and members enjoy the time they are together. I • INGREDIENT 2 : Stimulating club service and fellowship activities -that can serve as a hook in recruiting new members, improve fundraising, raise the club's local visibility and I increase the satisfaction of existing members through the connection and joy that comes from working and celebrating together. I • INGREDIENT 3 : Ongoing recruitment and "making the ask" to individuals you like and who seek what your club has to offer. I With even one "ingredient" missing, a club is weakened and its long-term viability is in question. Quota International and the We Share Foundation offer resources that can help revitalize clubs, strengthen membership satisfaction, improve recruitment success, and raise your club's visibilityI in your community. These include Quota International's Club Success Guide, the We Share Foundation's Publicity I Pointers public relations kit, and the We Share Foundation's Quota Cares Month Planning Kit. These three tools can be printed from www. guota. org and are recommended for every club's membership toolbox! I I 3 I I CELEBRATING CLUB SUCCESS I Members care deeply about extending Quota's service reach throughout the world. To date, 68 % percent of Quota's clubs have reported their 2002 - 2003 service and fund-raising successes. I INTERNATIONAL SERVICE Together reporting clubs have raised over US$I. 4 million service dollars and spent US$I. 3 million service dollars this past year to improve the lives of people in need. Clubs spent: I US$ 379, 333 on Disadvantaged Women and Children projects US$ 395, 635 on Hearing and Speech projects I US$ 430, 921 on other Community Service US$ 87, 288 on World Service (including the We Share Foundation's Club-to­ClubWorld Service Program) I QUOTASK ISpecial congratulations go to the 78 clubs which reported running the Quota 5 K and raised $ 5, 000 or more service dollars in a single event/special program this year! Just think of the thousands of individual lives that were touched this year simply because Quotarians in 14 countries care. A listing of 5 K winners is located in Tab 5 in the Convention Notebook. I I INVESTING IN QUOTA'S SUCCESS Honoring the diversity within Quota and providing what is most important to major membership constituencies has been well received. This holds true with our voluntary donations programs ­I each of which offers unique benefits that appeal to different groups within Quota's membership. Members have embraced these programs with enthusiasm: US$ 161, 380 was raised this fiscal year alone. In 1996 the average gift per member was US$ 3. 50, this year the average gift of I US$ 23. 56, represents a 500 % increase in giving per member. The beauty of Quota's voluntary donations programs is that they are just that -voluntary. And I every gift helps Quota move forward -in our programs, our development and growth initiatives, and our service expansion. Quota's success mirrors that ofother non-profit organizations which are deriving a larger portion of their annual revenues from non-dues income. I WANDA FREY JOINER FOUNDER FUND/FOUNDER'S PROGRAM Members throughout the world invested in Quota's future by donating US$ 77, 083 to Quota's I Wanda Frey Joiner Development Fund. Special con!,rratulations go to the 18 Founder donors who honored Quota with their $ 1, 000 donation or were honored by other members, clubs, and districts with $ 1, 000 donations during the 2002 - 2003 <b>Quota</b> <b>year.</b> Of those 18 donors, 10 of I them have given multiple donations and 8 of them were brand new Founders. As of May 1, 2003, we have a total of 161 Quotarians, clubs, and districts that have been named WFJ Founders since this initiative began seven years ago and with 3 more who have given since May 1, 2003, I we now have a grand total of 164 donors. I 4 I I ~ I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I WE SHARE BENEFACTORS CIRCLE PROGRAM Launched in 1999, the We Share Benefactors Circle provided funding for We Share Foundation expansion activities including strategic assessment of Quota's international service programs, the development of the Foundation's award-winning Web site, and activities related to expanding Quota's international service visibility and impact. Of these 21 Benefactor donations, 8 of them have given multiple donations and 13 of them were brand new Benefactors. During this time period, US$ 23, 454 in donations were received. Because donations are supporting Quota International's charitable arm, they are tax deductible in the United States. As of May 1, 2003, we have a total of 48 Quotarians and clubs that have been named Benefactors since this initiative began four years ago and with 3 more who have given since May 1, 2003, we now have a grand total of 51 donors. CARING HEARTS CIRCLE The We Share Foundation Caring Hearts Circle invites people everywhere to join a caring circle ofhope that is changing lives. Membership helps the We Share Foundation operate service programs and special projects, award grants for local service initiatives, and offer technical support, education, information, publications, as well as maintenance of the We Share Foundation Web Site. This program raised $ 7225 before the end of Quota's fiscal year. [...] and more has come in since! FRIEND OF QUOTA PROGRAM In its fifth and most successful year, the Friend of Quota Program raised $ 34, 930 for Quota International's general fund 285 Quotarians participated in this year's program. Silver donors ($ 50) and above received special thank-you gifts that include a year's worth of club and leadership publications. A record number of Friends ofQuota gave at the $ 500 level and above this year to support a new web site especially "for clubs" unveiled in April. The Friends of Quota program has been especially popular with past district and international leaders who appreciate being kept up-to-date on the latest club and leadership news worldwide. QUOTA CARING CLUBS At Convention 2002, the We Share Foundation launched a new high donor program for clubs. In its first year, a total of $ 5058 was donated by 19 participating clubs during the 2002 - 2003 <b>Quota</b> <b>year.</b> Three levels of giving are available through this program: the Silver Level ($ 250 -$ 499), the Gold level ($ 500 -$ 999) and Platinum Level (gifts of$I,OOO or more).

However, speaking during the second reading of the bill (November 23, 1955), the Minister for Agriculture and Food Production gave as his opinion that "whatever effect margarine has upon the dairy industry at present, the tendency {{in the future will}} be for it to diminish [...] . ". It is {{the purpose of this article}} to review recent developments in the butter-margarine position and to attempt to assess the effect of competition from margarine on the Australian dairying- industry.

[...] When examining applications from potential samurai issuers, the Ministry of Finance considered {{the tendency of}} the Japanese capital account balance and the liquidity in the country’s economy. For the actual issuance of Samurai bonds, the Japanese Ministry of Finance set a <b>quota</b> per quarter <b>year,</b> and employed a queue system. [...] Borrowers, if they agreed upon the terms of underwriting, entered the quota by rotation {{from the top of}} the queue.

The micronation was founded on 21 April 1970 by Leonard Casley, who declared his farm to be an independent country under the name Hutt River Province. He attempted to secede from Australia over a dispute surrounding wheat production <b>quotas.</b> A few <b>years</b> later, Casley began styling himself Prince Leonard and granting family members royal titles, {{although he did not}} include the word [...] "principality" [...] in his country's official name until 2006.|$|R
40|$|Distribution of {{fisheries}} resources {{is based on}} the principle of relative stability, from which the total allowable catches (TACs) are divided into national <b>quotas</b> based each <b>year</b> on a fixed percentage per stock. This does not fit well with the interaction of economic dynamics of fishing fleets and the Community's legal framework (right of establishment, free movement of workers). This has led to the so-called "quota-hopping". The Member State can nevertheless require a ship under its flag to have a "real economic link". But this is too vague to afford fisheries-dependent regions an efficient tool to meet their demands. Quotas Relative stability Real economic link Fisheries-dependent regions...|$|R
50|$|In the 10 years {{following}} 1900, about 200,000 Italians immigrated annually. With {{the imposition of}} the 1924 <b>quota,</b> 4,000 per <b>year</b> were allowed. By contrast, the annual quota for Germany {{after the passage of}} the Act was over 57,000. Some 86% of the 155,000 permitted to enter under the Act were from Northern European countries, with Germany, Britain, and Ireland having the highest quotas. The new quotas for immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe were so restrictive that in 1924 there were more Italians, Czechs, Yugoslavs, Greeks, Lithuanians, Hungarians, Portuguese, Romanians, Spaniards, Jews, Chinese, and Japanese that left the United States than those who arrived as immigrants.|$|R

In 1886, the Order was divided into the two classes of Knights Commander (50 at any given time) and Companions (no <b>quota).</b> The following <b>year</b> the class of Knight Grand Commander (25 at any given time) was added; {{the composition of the}} other two classes remained the same. The statute also provided that it was [...] "competent for Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, at Her or their pleasure, to appoint any Princes of the Blood Royal, being descendants of His late Majesty King George the First, as Extra Knights Grand Commanders".|$|R

Data were collected for <b>quota</b> samples between <b>years</b> 1995 and 1997. Encouragingly, the results show increased awareness for women of all ages and an improvement in knowledge of the benefits of folic acid following the launch of the campaign. Also, some evidence of increased self-reported use of folic acid is noted. However, some areas of concern are highlighted, such as a lack of knowledge among all women of the correct time to take folic acid, lower levels of awareness of folic acid in younger women and a gap in awareness between the lower and higher socio-economic groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{capitalization}} of farm program {{benefits and}} the effects of policy on the rate of return to investments in farm assets have long been important to agricultural policy analysis. The issues often arise {{in the context of the}} influence of policy on prices of farmland and other physical assets, but also apply directly to policy-created assets such as farm program <b>quota.</b> Several <b>years</b> ago, D. Gale Johnson assessed the literature as follows, “Roughly speaking, the discount rate used to value future earnings from [farm-program created] quotas is approximately 25 percent. Thus individuals who have recently purchased a quota do receive a net return from owning the quota, but the net return can be reasonably said to be return to risk ” (p. 202). Johnson’s assessment was based on studies across a number of countries and commodity programs. (See for example, Arcus, Barichello (1981), Seagraves, Sumner and Alston, Warley, among others in the early literature.) In this article we exploit particular characteristics of the California dairy quota program and an unusually rich data set to study the capitalization of program benefits and risks associated with farm policy. The design of the California dairy quota program helps make flow returns to quota ownership and the capitalized value of the policy benefits more transparent compared t...|$|R
