500|$|I have {{investigated}} [...] to its very foundation. I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy Mike, and I find beyond <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> may say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not like to think of his being hanged." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} the Attorney General, Sir Douglas Hogg {{said that}} [...] "I {{have considered the}} <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have given an opinion that that is so [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward {{appeared}} on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck. When {{asked if he}} would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, [...] "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same <b>question.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> made a joke , and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?" [...] Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Gullick," [...] said poor Maitland, ruefully, [...] "I {{came here}} for a chat with our friends--a little social relaxation--on {{economic}} <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> seem to have frightened them all away." ...|$|R
2500|$|About this time, Robeson's {{belief that}} trade {{unionism}} {{was crucial to}} civil rights became a mainstay of his political beliefs as he became proponent of the union activist Revels Cayton. Robeson was later called before the Tenney Committee where he responded to questions about his affiliation with the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) by testifying {{that he was not}} a member of the CPUSA. Nevertheless, two organizations with which Robeson was intimately involved, the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) and the CAA, were placed on the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO). Subsequently, he was summoned before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, and when questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating: [...] "Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am going to join them, if necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I wrote my first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Well, the Minister {{has settled}} {{two or three}} {{difficult}} <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> suppose can settle this one. I shall do nothing but by the orders of my chief.” He was very fond of alluding to his chief.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot {{introduce}} a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will {{do my best to}} answer them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{never forgive}} {{you if you}} {{say a word to}} anyone. It is only Mac's odd way of asking <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ought not to answer them. You will talk about such things <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't stop you, but I don't like it," [...] said Rose, much annoyed.|$|R

6000|$|... "One more <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have done," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Do {{you see any}} {{particular}} objection to practicing a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could answer}} this inquiry {{with a better}} heart than I {{had been able to}} find for the other <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said I was quite willing.|$|E
30|$|It {{was really}} interesting, cause I was reading through their {{conclusion}} <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> – {{there was a}} question pertaining to, like how the angle of light affects your solar oven and how was reflection used. And not everyone could really explain it on paper.|$|R
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? And {{where do}} you live?" [...] It {{was my turn to}} ask <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> popped them out as if from a Little by Little.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is in his}} highest {{interests}} that you ask no indiscreet <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> give no indiscreet replies," [...] he answered, sharply. So he brought the interview to an end, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found myself back in my lodgings with nothing save this bag of gold to show that this singular interview had indeed taken place.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] Jeanne answered, [...] "only {{you asked}} me a <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> felt an irresistible desire to answer you truthfully. It would have come sooner or later." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One more <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have done. Have you on some {{occasions}} {{heard the}} sound of horses' hoofs in your yard at about the time that your son came in?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sociologist David Riesman and {{political}} scientist Richard Neustadt offered strong, if qualified, praise. Riesman {{found in the}} work an [...] "impressive grasp of a great many theoretical and historical bits and pieces" [...] and Neustadt said Strauss and Howe [...] "are asking damned important <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> honor them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not; I {{told him}} that if he did {{anything}} so foolish I should certainly never call him in. Now let me hear about it, Sydney, for he was in rather too much pain to be <b>questioned,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> only heard that you had shown courage and presence of mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A trifle melodramatic, I admit," [...] Tallente assented. [...] "So {{were the}} {{circumstances}} of his--disappearance. I {{can assure you that}} I have had the police inspector of fiction asking me curious <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am convinced that down in Devonshire I am still an object of suspicion to the local gossips." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{would have}} you believe nothing, James,' {{returned}} the other. 'Be as just to me as you would to any other man below you. You ask a <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> answer it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Of course {{many people}} were {{at work in the}} yam grounds, several of which I saw; but I found {{considerable}} parties at the different villages, and had, on the whole, satisfactory conversations with them.

6000|$|... "I {{will hear}} {{what he has to}} say first, Mrs. Whitney. Reuben has {{generally}} a good deal to say for his side of a <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must hear his reasons before I can argue against them.|$|E
6000|$|... "We talked two hours. I {{told him}} {{everything}} <b>I</b> knew; <b>and</b> {{then he began}} to ask <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told him the rest. All I asked of him was to give me a chance. If I couldn't make a hit with the little lady, I'd clear out, and not bother any more. At last he says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm jolly certain I don't mean it to be," [...] she {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "I ask no <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hate scenes.

6000|$|... "It is {{sometimes}} unwise to ask <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have not inquired too closely," [...] and Haldane laid {{his hand on}} my shoulder.
