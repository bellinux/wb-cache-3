40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the presence of}} hyperons in dense hadronic matter on the quantum nucleation of quark matter is examined at low temperatures relevant to neutron star cores. We calculate the equation of state and the composition of matter before and after deconfinement by using a relativistic mean-field theory and an MIT bag model, respectively; the case in which hyperons are present in the hadronic system is considered, together with the case of the system without hyperons. We find that strangeness contained in hyperons acts to reduce a density jump at deconfinement as well as a lepton fraction in the hadronic phase. As a result of these reductions, a <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> <b>droplet</b> being in a virtual or real state has its effective mass lightened and its electric charge diminished into nearly zero. The Coulomb screening of leptons on the droplet charge, which has significance to the droplet growth after nucleation in the absence of hyperons, is thus shown to be of little consequence. If the effective droplet mass is small enough to become comparable to the height of the potential barrier, the effect of relativity brings about an exponential increase in the rate of droplet formation via quantum tunneling, whereas the role played by energy dissipation in decelerating the droplet formation, dominant for matter without hyperons, becomes of less importance. For matter with and without hyperons, we estimate the overpressure needed to form the first droplet in the star during the compression due to stellar spin-down or mass accretion from a companion star. The temperature at which a crossover from the quantum nucleation to the Arrhenius-type thermal nucleation takes place is shown to be large compared with the temperature of matter in the core.

40|$|We analyse the {{nucleation}} of <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> <b>droplets</b> under protoneutron star conditions. We adopt a two-phase {{framework in}} which the hadronic phase is described through a non-linear Walecka model and the just deconfined matter by the MIT bag model including color superconductivity. Surface tension and curvature energy are calculated self-consistently within the MRE formalism. We impose flavour conservation during the transition, {{which means that the}} just deconfined quark droplet is transiently out of equilibrium with respect to weak interactions. Our results show that trapped neutrinos slightly increase the critical density for deconfinement and that color superconductivity significantly decreases such density at low temperatures. We also show that the nucleation rate is negligible for droplets larger than 100 - 200 fm and is huge for smaller droplets provided that the temperature is low enough. We compare our results with previous calculations using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with color superconductivity and the MIT bag model without color superconductivity. We conclude that the deconfinement transition should be triggered instantaneously when a density slightly larger than the bulk transition density is reached at some layer of a protoneutron star. Since color superconductivity lowers the transition density at low temperatures, the transition is likely to occur after significant cooling in a massive enough protoneutron star.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of nuclear matter offers {{fascinating}} features for heavy ion physics and astrophysics when extended to strangeness and antimatter. We will discuss some regions of this phase diagram as strange matter at zero temperature, hypermatter at high densities and the antiworld at high densities and strangeness fraction. 1 Strange Matter and Hypermatter Relativistic heavy ion collisions provide a promising tool {{for studying the}} physics of strange quark and strange hadronic matter (see recent review [1]). Fig. 1 shows schematically the phase diagram of hot, dense and strange matter. Perhaps the only unambiguous way to detect the transient existence of a quark gluon plasma (QGP) might be the experimental observation of exotic remnants, like the formation of strange <b>quark</b> <b>matter</b> (SQM) <b>droplets.</b> First studies {{in the context of}} the MIT-bag model predicted that sufficiently heavy strangelets might be metastable or even absolutely stable. The reason for the possible stability of SQM is related to a third flavour degree of freedom, the strangeness.
