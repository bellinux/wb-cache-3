50|$|Most German tanks {{used during}} World War II used the MG 34 Panzerlauf for {{secondary}} armament. The MG 42 was ill-suited for internal/coaxial mounting {{due to the}} method of barrel change. The main difference of the MG 34 Panzerlauf and the regular MG 34 was the heavier, almost solid armored barrel shroud, almost completely lacking the ventilation holes of the basic MG 34. When mounted inside a tank, the MG 34 also lacked a butt-stock. A kit for <b>quick</b> <b>conversion</b> to ground use was carried inside the tank containing a butt-stock and a combined bi-pod and front sight assembly.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} several effective methods of deriving the critical feeding conditions for {{the case of a}} semi-batch catalytic reactor used for the acetoacetylation of pyrrole with diketene in homogeneous liquid phase. The reaction is known to be of high risk due to the very exothermic (polymerisation) side-reactions involving reactive diketene. In order to perform the sensitivity analysis, both the Morbidelli-Varma sensitivity criterion and div-methods were used, the latter of which are based on the system’s Jacobian and Green’s function matrix analysis. The combined application of such criteria allows the optimal and safe setting of the reactor’s nominal operating conditions. Extended sensitivity analysis reveals possible QFS (<b>quick</b> onset, fair <b>conversion</b> and smooth temperature profile) regions, under severe operating conditions characterized by fast enough main reaction that prevents the co-reactant accumulation, and leads to a quasi-insensitive semi-batch reactor behaviour...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{generalised}} parametric sensitivity criterion {{has been}} applied to isoperbolic - constant jacket temperature- semi-batch reactors (SBRs). The results show that the criterion discerns between non-ignition and thermal runaway regions. However, the optimal parametric regions for operating semibatch processes, called QFS (<b>Quick</b> onset, Fair <b>conversion</b> and Smooth temperature profile) cannot be distinguished from the runway regions, since both belong to the ignition behaviour. For this reason, a new intrinsic generalised criterion for characterising QFS regions, based on the earliest ignition time of the process, has been developed. The combination of both criteria allows theoretical results to be compared with those existing in literature. Finally, a catalysed esterification reaction is used to compare the simulated and experimental results carried out in a 2 L bench-scale laboratory reactor and in a 100 L pilot plant reactor. These criteria are believed to be of great utility for the termal stability analysis of isoperibolic SBRs. Furthermore, they can be easily extended to cope with the control system in case of isothermal SBRs. JRC. (ISIS) -Institute For Systems, Informatics And Safet...|$|R
40|$|Background : There is need to {{investigate}} the use of liposomal amphotericin B in cryptococcal meningitis in India. Aims : To compare the efficacy, safety, duration of treatment and cost of two doses of liposomal amphotericin B (Amp B) (Fungisome TM) in cryptococcal meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Settings and Design : Prospective, randomized, multicenter study in tertiary care hospitals across India. Materials and Methods : Adult patients with culture-proven cryptococcal meningitis with HIV/AIDS were randomized to receive either 1 (Group A) or 3 mg/kg/day of Fungisome (Group B). Clinical efficacy and tolerability, laboratory evaluations and mycological response were assessed daily, twice weekly and weekly respectively. The patients were assessed at four and eight-week follow-up. Statistics : We calculated average and standard deviation for the various parameters. Results : The time to show clinical response was 13. 66 days (1 mg) and 9. 55 days (3 mg). In Group B (n= 6 complete response), 50 &#x 0025; patients responded within one week by microbial conversion, 83 &#x 0025; in two weeks and 100 &#x 0025; in three weeks. Patients with 1 mg dose (n= 4 complete response), none showed microbial conversion within one week, 75 &#x 0025; responded in two weeks, whereas one patient took four weeks. The average duration of treatment was 36. 5 &# 177; 14. 4 and 26. 5 &# 177; 5. 89 (S. D.) days in 1 and 3 mg/kg/day respectively.
