25|$|Up to 1920 {{a variety}} of <b>qualification</b> <b>systems</b> were used. From 1921 to 1962 (except 1926) local {{qualifying}} was used. All those who entered played 18 holes on one of two courses and then played 18 holes on the other course the following day. Qualifying took place immediately before the Championship itself. In 1963 a system of exemptions for the leading players was introduced with local qualifying continuing for the remaining players.

25|$|As {{required}} by state law, {{local governments are}} implementing teacher <b>qualification</b> <b>systems</b> and promoting in-service training for large numbers of school principals, so as to further improve school management standards. Currently, in schools of higher learning, professors and assistant professors account for 9.5 percent and 30 percent respectively. Young and middle-aged teachers predominate; teachers under age 45 account for 79 percent of total faculty, and under age 35 for 46 percent. Teachers in higher education constitute a vital contingent in scientific research, knowledge innovation and sci-tech. Of all academicians in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 40.7 percent (280) are in the higher education sector; for the Chinese Academy of Engineering the corresponding figure is 35.3 percent (234).|$|E

2500|$|Since 1993, and {{following}} the cessation of the Eastern European OIRT network and the merger with the EBU, {{there have been more}} entries than there is time to reasonably include in a single TV show. Several relegation or <b>qualification</b> <b>systems</b> have been tried {{to limit the number of}} countries participating in the contest at one time. Thus the 1993 Contest introduced two new features: first, a pre-selection competition was held in Ljubljana in which seven new countries fought for three places in the international competition. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia took part in Kvalifikacija za Millstreet; and the three former Yugoslav republics, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia, qualified for a place in the international final. Also to be introduced that year was [...] "relegation": the lowest-placed countries in the 1993 score table were not invited in 1994, to allow the countries which failed the 1993 pre-selection into the 1994 Contest. The 1994 Contest included—for the first time—Estonia, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Russia.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to review the role of {{government}} in the current trends of vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> for building life learning society in Japan and to provide useful suggestions for the future directions to develop vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> in Korea. The vocational education and training system of Japan has been operated on the basis of ministry of education(Munbuso) and ministry of labor(Nodouso) is reponsible for human resource development. But there has not been any partnerships between them to operate vocational education and training. Recently, Japan has been tried to actualize lifelong learning society at large. So ministry of education and ministry labor have supported and developed it's own vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> toward the lifelong learning society. In relation to that, they begin to take little partnerships and form a loose alliance. This is reason why lifelong learning society needs strong links between general and vocational education, vocational education and vocational training learning and work. Nevertheless, Japan's dual vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> is limited for actualizing lifelong learning society. Korea's vocational education and training <b>system</b> and vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> are similar with those of Japan. So, it is necessary for us to understand the implications of the current trends of vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> in Japan to build and develop vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> toward lifelong learning society...|$|R

Second, it is cleared that, only specialized training colleges admitted as training schools for vocational qualifications have developed in their own way. In conclusion, specialized training colleges should be classified according to the vocational qualification, and vocational <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> should have a definite idea in the future...|$|R
