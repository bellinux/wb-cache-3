5|$|Second class' {{passengers}} were leisure tourists, academics, {{members of the}} clergy and middle class English and American families. The ship's musicians travelled in second class accommodations; they were not counted {{as members of the}} crew but were employed by an agency under contract to the White Star Line. The average ticket price for an adult second class passenger was £13, the equivalent of £ today. and for many of these passengers, their travel experience on the Titanic was akin to travelling first class on smaller liners. Second class passengers had their own library and the men had access to a private smoking room. Second class children could read the children's books provided in the library or play deck <b>quoits</b> and shuffleboard on the second class promenade. Twelve-year-old Ruth Becker passed the time by pushing her two-year-old brother Richard around the enclosed promenade in a stroller provided by the White Star Line.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} notable early Bronze Age or Neolithic sites lie {{alongside}} or immediately off this road, including Zennor <b>Quoit,</b> Sperris <b>Quoit,</b> Chûn <b>Quoit</b> and Lanyon <b>Quoit.</b> The road is tight and twisting, and challenging to drivers. In early 2009, after heavy rain and flooding near Zennor, {{the road was}} closed at Chykembro Culvert because of flood damage to its foundations.|$|R
50|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Chûn <b>Quoit</b> {{there are many other}} megalithic and archaeological sites as Lanyon <b>Quoit,</b> Mulfra <b>Quoit,</b> Mên-an-Tol and Mên Scryfa. The rocky outline of Carn Kenidjack marks the position of midwinter sunset away to the south-west.|$|R

25|$|The TCA ground has {{primarily}} {{been used}} throughout its 127-year history for cricket and Australian football. However, many other sports have been played there. When the ground first opened in 1882, {{there was also}} two tennis courts, which were later moved to the Domain Tennis Centre. There was also a skittles alley, and the wooden building {{on the eastern side}} of the ground built in 1911 which still exists was the TCA bowls club. Cycling events have been held there, and in the 1890s winter afternoons were given over to baseball matches, and <b>quoits</b> was often played there in that period.|$|E
5000|$|... 300 m to {{the east}} is Sperris <b>Quoit,</b> {{although}} this is in a considerably less fine state than the Zennor <b>Quoit.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sperris <b>Quoit</b> is {{a ruined}} megalithic burial chamber or dolmen, {{and one of}} a type of tomb unique to West Penwith, located on a moor around 365 metres {{northeast}} of Zennor <b>Quoit,</b> being roughly halfway between Zennor and Amalveor, Cornwall. It is the northernmost <b>quoit</b> in the Penwith peninsula and a Scheduled Monument.|$|R

25|$|The {{local area}} with its open views, rural lanes, commons and woodland, criss-crossed by {{footpaths}} and bridleways consequently are {{very popular with}} cyclists, walkers and horse-riders. The churches of Hawridge and Cholesbury jointly hold a Summer Fête on August Bank Holiday, alternatively on Hawridge and Cholesbury Commons. The Kimblewick Hunt (previously known as Vale of Aylesbury with Garth & South Berks Hunt) traditionally hold a meet on Boxing Day (26 December) which draws a large crowd from the local district. <b>Quoits</b> was played on the Commons up until the 1920s and the Full Moon pub had a Bowling Alley until the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Despite having {{less than}} 50 houses within the {{boundaries}} of the main settlement, Lealholm has a selection of amenities, including a village shop, post office, petrol station and farm goods store. It also has the Forge Art Gallery (formerly a pottery), an Infant and Primary School, a cricket and football pitch, and three churches. The historic Shepherds Hall housing a tea rooms and riverside tea gardens. A village green, where the local team play <b>quoits,</b> sits alongside the river.

Nash's natural skills {{in any sport}} he tried led former first-class cricketer Johnnie Moyes to call Nash [...] "one of the finest all-round athletes of the century".|$|E
5000|$|Mulfra <b>Quoit</b> {{is similar}} to Chûn <b>Quoit</b> five {{kilometers}} away. The <b>quoit</b> has three 1.7m-high support stones, arranged in a U-shape 3.0m long and 1.7m wide, and open on one side. The capstone, which has slipped down, measures 3.2m by 3.0m, and is almost square; it has a weight of 5 tonnes. Since some of the stones that formed the chamber are missing, {{it is difficult to}} get an idea of its original form, but it is possible that four pillars supported the capstone slab as with Chûn <b>Quoit.</b> On the other hand, the capstone has a central bulge on its underside, which would give the stone a stable position on the existing three pillars. Mulfra <b>Quoit</b> was apparently covered by a mound, the remnants of which are still present ...|$|R
50|$|West Lanyon <b>Quoit</b> {{is located}} {{northwest}} of Penzance near the road between Madron and Morvah. It stands 300 metres {{to the southwest}} of the road. 700 metres to the east stands the much more famous Lanyon <b>Quoit.</b>|$|R
50|$|To the north, {{there was}} once a cup-marked stone called the <b>Quoit</b> Stone. This can no longer be clearly seen, and now a stone to the south of the {{monument}} has become known as the <b>Quoit</b> Stone.|$|R
500|$|He {{was popular}} with team-mates and opponents alike, with a {{weakness}} for practical jokes. On board a ship travelling to England, Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as <b>quoits.</b> Accepting Trumble's advice, they were made to contort themselves {{into a number of}} ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team-mates and other onlookers [...] To prolong the joke, in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated.|$|E
500|$|The circle was {{recorded}} by Aubrey in the 17th century, {{and then by}} William Stukeley in the 18th century. Aubrey recorded the presence of nine megaliths at the site, as did Stukeley's 1723 drawing of it. In the nineteenth century the site was visited by the antiquarian Charles Warne, who wrote about it in his 1872 book Ancient Dorset. He claimed that he could discern {{the existence of a}} tenth stone, although on visiting the site in 1936, the Piggotts noted that they could find no evidence of this. Gale later stated that this claim [...] "has never been substantiated". Warne had consulted Aubrey's manuscript, but confused Aubrey's illustration of the Devil's <b>Quoits</b> at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, for a monument that he believed had once been located near to the Nine Stones.|$|E
2500|$|With this {{marriage}} he gained a lifelong companionship. [...] Mr. and Mrs. Bloede had five children: Marie, Carl S, Ilse, Victor Gustav Bloede II, and Vida. Bloede {{had a strong}} personality, alert, progressive and insightful. He believed in physical and mental exercise for a sound body and mind, he recommended to others which methods he himself had used and gained such success. In his free time he took interest in fishing, rowing and walking, he also enjoyed playing <b>quoits</b> and other games {{with family and friends}} and found a wealth of enjoyment in his mental exercises.|$|E

2500|$|For Bryan Ward-Perkins {{the answer}} {{is found in the}} success of the Anglo-Saxon culture and {{highlights}} the micro-diversity and larger cohesion that produced a dynamic force in comparison to the Brittonic culture From beads and <b>quoits</b> to clothes and houses, there is something unique happening in the early Anglo-Saxon period. The material culture evidence shows that people adopted and adapted styles based on set roles and styles. John Hines, commenting on the diversity of nearly a thousand glass beads and many different clothes clasps from Lakenheath, states that these reveal a [...] "society where people relied on others to fulfill a role" [...] and [...] "what they had around them was making a statement", not one about the individual, but about [...] "identity between small groups not within small groups".|$|E
2500|$|Both the Greek and the Roman {{forms of}} the Anemoi appear in Riordan's second series. Boreas is a central {{character}} in The Lost Hero, and his children Khione, Calais, and Zetes continue to have important roles throughout the series. He resides in Montreal, and is described as [...] "sturdily built...with dark purple wings" [...] when in his Greek form, and as [...] "taller and thinner" [...] when Roman. [...] "Notus/Auster appears in The House of Hades as a counselor of sorts to the protagonists. His Roman form is described as laid-back, disinterested in mortal affairs, and stormy; while his Greek form is quick to anger, more in-touch with the human world, and wears a wreath of barley. Favonius/Zephyros also appears in that novel, described as a deeply tanned man with wings the colors of a sunset and holding a basket of unripe fruit. He takes two of the protagonists to meet his master, Cupid, whom he serves as punishment for accidentally killing a man he and Apollo loved during a game of <b>quoits.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Considering {{the early}} cemeteries of Kent, most {{relevant}} finds come from furnished graves with distinctive {{links to the}} Continent. However, there are some unique items, these include pots and urns and especially brooches, {{an important element of}} female dress that functioned as a fastener, rather like a modern safety pin. The style of brooches (called <b>Quoits),</b> is unique to southern England in the fifth century AD, with the greatest concentration of such items occurring in Kent. Seiichi Suzuki defines the style through an analysis of its design organisation, and, by comparing it with near-contemporary styles in Britain and on the continent, identifying those features which make it unique. He suggests that the quoit brooch style was made and remade as {{part of the process of}} construction of new group identities during the political uncertainties of the time, and sets the development of the style in the context of the socio-cultural dynamics of an emergent post-Roman society. The brooch shows that culture was not just transposed from the continent, but from an early phase a new [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] culture was being developed.|$|E

2500|$|The quoit brooch {{is a type}} of brooch found {{from the}} 5th century and later during the Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} of Britain that has given its name to the Quoit Brooch Style to embrace all types of Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the decorative style typical of the finest brooches. [...] The brooches take their modern name from the rings thrown in the game of <b>quoits,</b> and have the form of a broad ring, or circle with an empty centre, usually in bronze or silver (sometimes inlaid with silver or gold respectively), and often highly decorated. The forms are in a very low relief, so contrasting with other early Anglo-Saxon styles, with detail added by shallow engraving or punching within the main shapes. Dots or dashes are often used to represent fur on the animal forms, as well as lines emphasizing parts of the body. [...] They are fixed with a single, straight hinged pin like those of other Anglo-Saxon ring or Celtic brooches and are further defined by the presence of a slot and pin-stops on the ring.|$|E
2500|$|Ravensworth {{contains}} a Church of England primary school which had 68 pupils in 2010, a village hall, a Methodist chapel {{and a public}} house, described as [...] "cosy". A Church of England church situated at Kirby Hill, a large garden centre, a large farm shop, a 5-acre caravan park and a further three public houses are all within an approximately one mile radius, although only The Bay Horse Inn is situated in the village proper. The [...] "broad [...] pleasant" [...] village green is substantial, at 17 acres, {{and most of the}} one hundred or so dwellings in the village are situated around it. The green hosts the stone base of a 15th-century cross or obelisk. There is a village <b>quoits</b> club that operates during the summer. The area falls within the television reception area of ITV Tyne Tees. Newspaper coverage is provided by the Darlington-based Northern Echo, which has a North Yorkshire edition, and The Teesdale Mercury based in Barnard Castle. Water is supplied by Yorkshire Water. The water is the area is classified as hard, owing to the large amount of limestone in the area, and derives from a spring/borehole source.
