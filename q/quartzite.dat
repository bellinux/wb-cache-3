5|$|The central {{mass of the}} Raft River Mountains {{consists}} of Precambrian metamorphic rocks with Elba <b>quartzite</b> and interlayered schist on the southern slopes and Cambrian <b>quartzite</b> outcrops on {{the western part of}} the range. Below the Sublett Mountains the Phosphoria Formation, a basal phosphorite overlain by a thick sequence of chert and cherty sandstone, reaches its greatest thickness. Soils in the northern part of the forest are generally deep and highly fertile in lowlands but shallow and less so on steep slopes. In the Minidoka Ranger District, soils are generally productive, derived from volcanic and sedimentary material, shallow on steep slopes, and deep in the lowlands.|$|E
5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is barely visible today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large <b>quartzite</b> false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E
40|$|Banded {{ferruginous}} <b>quartzites</b> form {{a conspicuous}} feature {{of many of}} the outcrops of Dharwar schists in Mysore. Because of their much greater hardness than the associated chloritic and hornblendic schists, these <b>quartzites</b> have withstood the action of weathering agencies better, and form prominent hill ranges in the schist belts. One such important range is the Bababudan hills in the Kadur district, comprising some of the highest peaks in the Mysore State, several of which are over 6, 000 feet above sea-level. The Bababudan hills are mainly composed of thick beds of haematite and magnetite <b>quartzites</b> which are separated by bands of chloritic and talcose schists. The high angles of dip and the intensely folded nature of these <b>quartzites</b> are evidences of the great disturbances to which these rocks have been subjected. The complicated tectonics of this area have not yet been satisfactorily elucidated, as geological work on these hills is heavily handicapped by the dense jungles infested with wild animals, and the thick soil cap which obscures the disposition and relationship of the rocks. The ferruginous <b>quartzites</b> overlie an epidiorite flow of spilitic affinities. A few dykes of epidiorite, some of which are tourmaline-bearing, have invaded the <b>quartzites...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fold-fault {{structures}} {{within a}} major transpressional shear {{zone of the}} SW Iberian Massif were investigated by combining geological mapping, cross-section analysis and microtectonic studies. A significant example of contractional deformation is displayed in the Portalegre-Esperanc¸a Shear Zone (PESZ) where a heterogeneous Ordovician stratigraphic sequence, showing a strong competence contrast between <b>quartzites,</b> slates and quartzo-feldspathic rocks favoured strain localization and fault nucleation that controlled fold formation. The presence of pelitic layers within the thick-bedded <b>quartzites</b> had probably provided weakness zones that were more favourable for the strain localization than the previous foliation present in the <b>quartzites.</b> The <b>quartzites</b> and the quartzo-feldspathic rocks (granites and volcaniclastic rocks) accommodated heterogeneous high strain developing different degrees of mylonitization. The <b>quartzites</b> with protomylonitic textures are dominant and represent coarse-grained siliciclastic sediments that suffered metamorphism and partial dynamic recrystallization. Ultramylonites occur within discrete high-strain shear zones. It is probable that the strain localization in the PESZ involved both the effect of having layers of different competence and layers or stratigraphic contacts with rocks that experienced grain size reduction dominated by cataclasis and dislocation creep. Folds within <b>quartzites</b> with sub-horizontal to gently plunging hinges vary from closed to open in thick-bedded <b>quartzites</b> and from tight to closed in thin-bedded <b>quartzites.</b> Observed changes in structural style of deformed <b>quartzites,</b> slates and quartzo-feldspathic rocks are interpreted to result from the constraints imposed by the mechanical properties of the different lithologies. As the folds tightened during shortening, the alternating zones of contrasting competence favoured the disruption of the bedding. The deformation history in the PESZ was dominated by thrusting and strike-slip faulting along incompetent layers that locally developed staircase geometry and transected the lower Ordovician stratigraphic sequence. The kinematic model proposed for the PESZ {{is consistent with the}} models of transpressional shear zones stretched along strike with the development of coeval strike-slip and low angle oblique-slip faults associated to active buckle folds with axes parallel to the principal extension directio...|$|R

40|$|Samples of Fe-Mn metasediments (hematite <b>quartzites,</b> mica-bearing <b>quartzites</b> and garnet-bearing {{amphibole}} schists) {{from the}} lower sub-unit of Kythnos island, part of Attic-Cycladic complex of Alpine age, have been collected and analysed for 45 elements, including rare earth elements. The hematite <b>quartzites</b> and mica-bearing hematite <b>quartzites</b> occur as intercalations in {{the upper part of}} a metavolcanic sequence or in the lower part of an overlying metasedimentary sequence of the northern part of Kythnos island. They show trace elements concentration and rare earth element (REE) patterns similar to those of hydrothermal deposits. The garnet-bearing amphibole schists occur in the sedimentary sequence of the southeastern part of the island. They have lower Fe/Mn ratios and higher trace element and REE contents in comparison with the hematite-quartzites and mica-bearing hematite <b>quartzites.</b> According to these geochemical characteristics, the protolith of Fe-Mn metasediments may have been formed under oceanic hydrothermal activity. In this process, circulating heated seawater reacted with basic volcanic rocks to form metal bearing hydrothermal solutions enriched in Fe, Mn and trace elements. These hydrothermal solutions were discharged on the ocean floor, through shear and/or fracture zones in an environment of decreasing temperature. The decreasing negative Eu anomalies {{from the lower}} (hematite <b>quartzites)</b> to the upper part (garnet-bearing amphibole schists) of the sequence possibly indicate a change in the condition (T, fO(2)) of the deposition as well as an increase of the detrital-hydrogenous components in relation to the hydrothermal fluids...|$|R

5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and {{quarrying}} was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux <b>quartzite,</b> Milbank granite, sand, gravel, limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces a very limited amount of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The Neolithic stone {{implements}} of celts were found. Axes found {{were made}} of <b>quartzite,</b> basalt and granite. The finds included nine types of microliths. Waste flakes found in the area indicate prevalence {{of the process of}} manufacture in a well established microlithic industry in the area that included chert, chalcedony, agate and jasper, derived from the dry river bed of the Son river. The final products in the collection are stone discs in long, cylindrical and triangular shapes.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series.

30|$|The Togo {{formation}} has <b>quartzites</b> as {{the main}} rock types, followed by phyllites and schists. These rock types unconformably overlie Dahomeyan gneisses. The bulk of these rocks are found in Katapor, in the north {{eastern part of the}} study area where mainly cataclastic <b>quartzites</b> interbedded with phyllites are present (Saunders 1969). The rocks consist of arenaceous, pebbly sediments which have been indurated, folded and faulted with high grades of metamorphism in places. The rocks themselves are impervious but contain opening along joint, bedding and cleavage planes. Where these openings are extensive, good supplies of groundwater are developed from boreholes. Where <b>quartzites</b> are in contact with argillaceous rocks of the valleys, springs are usually found such as the springs that occur in the Akwapim Range (Kesse 1985).|$|R

5|$|The lower {{altitude}} {{site where}} D.regia is found is characterised by permanently damp soils consisting mostly of a gravel bench formed from a creek bed. The plants grow in a peaty <b>quartzite</b> sand, {{often with a}} gravel cover.

Associated vegetation included species of Leucadendron and members of the families Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, and Restionaceae. The habitat of D.regia depends on periodic fire sweeping through and keeping the larger plants from choking out D.regia. Frost occurs infrequently in the valley.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I was {{the first}} king who {{definitely}} {{was buried in the}} Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow <b>quartzite</b> sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may have been moved by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E
5|$|An {{ironstone}} {{mine was}} opened {{to work on}} a rock outcrop in 1853. The mine was to supply flux for the Port Adelaide copper smelting works, but it apparently closed within a year. It was reopened in 1861 and operated until 1862. The Tea Tree Gully Silver Mining Company began work in the area in 1888, constructing a tramway, blacksmith shop and a new road. With no economic finds, the company closed in July 1889. The quarry, in Water Gully adjacent to the nursery's ruins, has been mined for blue dolomite, some of which was used for the nursery's buildings. Quarries elsewhere in Water Gully were opened in the 1880s and intermittently supplied <b>quartzite</b> road metal for the District Council of Tea Tree Gully. A crushing plant was erected {{on the north side of}} the gully in 1912 to create this road material.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-eight quartz c-axis fabrics from {{individual}} pebbles {{from a single}} outcrop of deformed conglomerate have been measured. These pebbles vary in composition and have undergone different amounts of strain. Contrary to expectations based on published results of computer simulated deformation by intracrystalline slip of pure <b>quartzites,</b> {{it is observed that}} fabrics are not stronger in the more highly deformed pebbles. Instead, the fabric strength is related to the quartz content of the pebbles. Pure <b>quartzites</b> show the strongest fabrics. As the percentage of non-quartz minerals increases up to 25 % the strength of the fabrics rapidly decreases, though the influence of composition becomes less marked when impurities exceed 25 %. These observations can be explained if the deformation of the impure <b>quartzites</b> included a contribution from a non-intracrystalline mechanism such as grain boundary sliding...|$|R

5|$|Dolomite, {{sandstone}} and <b>quartzite</b> rock {{have been}} extensively mined in the park. Though traces of silver, copper and gold are present, {{there have been}} no economic finds. The park is scattered with many quarries; the largest within the park is an open-cut in the northwest corner. It was in operation until 1982 supplying stone for buildings, including Adelaide's war memorial and St Peter's Cathedral. Tea Tree Gully Freestone from some quarries has been used for the facades and ornamental dressing of many of Adelaide’s Victorian public buildings. Adelaide Town Hall, the General Post Office and Supreme Court Buildings in Adelaide were all built entirely of this stone. The quarries supplied dressing stock for ornamentation on buildings, including St Peter's Cathedral, St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Flinders Street Baptist Church and the University of Adelaide's Mitchell Building.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green <b>quartzite,</b> red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the Engineering and Water Supply Department chose an {{area at the}} top of the park, {{adjacent}} to Lower North East Road, to build a water treatment works. Based partly on seismic refraction traverses, a ridge underlain by dolomite and <b>quartzite</b> was deemed to be stable enough for construction. The site was also selected because of its hydraulic advantages; all other sites would have required the construction of a major pumping station. The exact placement of the site was made so that it could not be seen from the metropolitan area. It has a design flow of 313megalitres (ML) per day with a maximum capacity of 344ML. The plant was commissioned in 1980 and uses filtration and sedimentation techniques to clean water from the Mannum to Adelaide pipeline. It was the second plant in Adelaide, after the opening of the Hope Valley plant in 1977. Most of the water is piped directly from the River Murray, but some is sourced from Millbrook Reservoir.|$|E
