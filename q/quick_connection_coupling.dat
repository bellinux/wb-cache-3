2500|$|The same {{project of}} the 1960s also decided to merge lines 13 and 14 to create a <b>quick</b> <b>connection</b> between Saint-Lazare and Montparnasse as [...] a new north-south line.

The new Line13 was inaugurated on 9November 1976.|$|R
50|$|The westernmost {{portion of}} SR 63 between SR 4 and I-75 is a four-lane divided highway. It is signed as Hamilton - Lebanon Road.
