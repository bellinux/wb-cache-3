40|$|The {{discovery}} of antimalarial properties of derivatives of 8 -aminoquinolines which combine high activity against the tissue {{stages of the}} malaria parasite with satisfactory tolerance by man {{can be said to}} have marked the final stage in the search for a radical cure of vivax malaria. Since its synthesis in the USSR in 1952, quinocide—an 8 -aminoquinoline drug—has been subjected by Soviet workers to intensive research, an outline of which is presented in this paper. The results of their investigations, which ranged from laboratory and clinical studies of tolerance to the drug, through small-scale trials of its parasiticidal activity, to large-scale studies on the effectiveness of its mass administration are very encouraging. Both for anti-relapse treatment and for pre-epidemic prophylaxis, a short (10 - or 14 -day) course of <b>quinocide</b> proved as effective as a lengthy course of acriquine with plasmocide. Side-effects were infrequent, and most of those that occurred were transient and did not necessitate the suspension of treatment. It is suggested that the mass administration of <b>quinocide</b> would, in certain cases, be a useful adjunct to insecticidal measures in the clearance of malaria foci...|$|E
40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful {{diseases}} on the globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), several million people die every year from malaria, and most of them are children. Hundreds of millions of fresh cases of ma-laria are registered by the WHO every year, and more than one-third of the earth’s population lives in malaria-endemic areas. Primaquine is an important antimalarial drug because it has gametocytocidal properties and prevents relapse in most cases. However, primaquine is a highly toxic substance, especially to the Negroid race (in Africa, Australia and North, Latin and South America) and some others. Negroid male children are most vulnerable to the toxic effects of primaquine. The toxicity of primaquine can be enhanced in mixtures with other antimalarial drugs. In the present study, unprocessed primaquine and primaquine tablets highly contaminated with <b>quinocide</b> (I. Brondz, Historical Overview of Chromatography and Related Techniques in Analysis of Antimalarial Drug Primaquine (Editor I. Brondz), Nova Sci-ence Publishers, Inc. (2011) ISSN 978 - 1 - 61761 - 944 - 1) are discussed versus monoenantiomeric primaquine as a drug. The contamination of primaquine with <b>quinocide</b> enhances the toxicity of primaquine by additive or synergistic action. The use of contaminated primaquine can be harmful. Development of a useful antimalarial vaccine can take a decade or longer. This paper describes the possibility of preparing antimalarial generic monoenantiomeric primaquine, free o...|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} induced tertian malaria {{has been studied}} in {{patients}} in psychoneurological hospitals in Moscow over a long period. Various strains of P. vivax were used to infect patients; the sporozoites were transmitted by Anopheles maculipennis atroparvus bred under laboratory conditions. There are marked differences between the dates of onset of relapses, reckoned from the primary manifestations of the disease, in patients developing malaria after long and short incubation periods. P. vivax strains which have a short incubation period are characterized by producing in patients a series of relapses following a long latent period; strains with a long incubation period are characterized by the occurrence of relapses during the first 3 months {{after the end of}} the primary series of attacks. However, some P. vivax strains give rise to both types of relapse, depending on the incubation period. In any event, the duration of the disease does not, as a rule, exceed 2 years, including the incubation period. The number of mosquitos (and hence the number of sporozoites) used to infect a patient does not have any noticeable effect on the number and frequency of relapses. In short-incubation tertian malaria, the use of <b>quinocide</b> during the period of treatment of the primary manifestations greatly reduced the number of relapses; in long-incubation tertian malaria similarly treated with <b>quinocide,</b> no relapses occurred...|$|E
