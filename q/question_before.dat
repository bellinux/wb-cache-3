5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast doubt {{in the minds of many}} legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E

25|$|President Richard Nixon {{had claimed}} {{executive}} authority {{to force the}} Times to suspend publication of classified information in its possession. The <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need {{of the executive branch}} of government to maintain the secrecy of information. The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of The New York Times to print the materials.|$|E

25|$|As in Sale, {{the game}} was split into four rounds. Contestants begin with a score of $20. When Edward Phillips asks a question, the first {{contestant}} to buzz in {{had the chance to}} answer the question; if correct, he or she gained $5; if wrong, he or she lost $5. Phillips revealed the answer immediately if the contestant answered incorrectly; no other contestants were given the opportunity to answer. Contestants needed not wait until Phillips had finished asking the <b>question</b> <b>before</b> buzzing in.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} British {{version of}} the show debuted on 4 September 1998, and aired on ITV with Chris Tarrant as its host until 11 February 2014. International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide. The show's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time (similar to some radio quizzes), and {{the emphasis is on}} suspense rather than speed. In most versions there are no time limits to answer the questions, and contestants are given the <b>question</b> <b>before</b> they must decide whether to attempt an answer.|$|E
25|$|Round 5 {{features}} quick-fire toss-up questions, each worth +/-20 points. Visual {{questions are}} worth +/-30 points.

If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required to answer the <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the game is considered over. If there is a tie in the knockout round (e.g. the final), the presenter may ask one last tie-breaker question to determine the winner.|$|E

25|$|In {{another case}} in which the {{defendant}} was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own voir dire of the expert in <b>question</b> <b>before</b> he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability to answer a <b>question</b> <b>before</b> trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual {{is more likely to}} judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E
25|$|Few {{nations have}} {{addressed}} the use of lockouts during whipsaw strikes, however. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled on {{the legality of the}} practice. The <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the Court was whether a lockout during a whipsaw strike was an unfair labor practice (ULP) under the National Labor Relations Act and its various amendments. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP. The high court further extended this ruling in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could engage in a partial lockout of its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (not just those who supported the union).|$|E

25|$|Gordon Wood argues Madison's {{frustrating}} {{experience in}} the Virginia legislature years earlier most shaped his constitutional views. Wood notes that the governmental structure in both the Virginia Plan and the final constitution were not innovative, since they were copied from the British government, {{had been used in}} the states since 1776, and numerous authors had already argued for their adoption at the national level. The controversial elements in the Virginia Plan were removed, and the rest was commonly accepted as necessary for a functional government (state or national) for decades, hence Madison's contribution was considered more qualitative. Wood argues that, like most national politicians of the late 1780s, Madison believed that the problem was less with the Articles of Confederation than with the nature of the state legislatures. He believed the solution was to restrain the excesses of the states. This required more than an alteration in the Articles of Confederation; it required a change in the character of the national compact. The ultimate <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the convention, Wood notes, was not how to design a government but whether the states should remain sovereign, whether sovereignty should be transferred to the national government, or whether the constitution should settle somewhere in between.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the summer}} of 1776, when the war was still in its early stages, British General William Howe {{embarked}} on a campaign to gain control of the city and its militarily important harbor.

American General George Washington recognized the inevitability of the capture of New York City, and withdrew the bulk of his army about [...] north to Harlem Heights.

500|$|Justice George Sutherland {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. [...] He noted that the indictment was drawn under Revised Statute § 2145, which provides for federal jurisdiction of crimes committed in [...] "Indian Country". [...] This section was no longer applicable to general crimes in Oklahoma after statehood. [...] Crimes committed by or against Indians could still be prosecuted under § 2145 if the crime occurred in Indian Country. [...] The <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the court was whether allotted land, with a restriction on sale by the Indian it was allotted to, was still Indian Country. [...] Since the government controlled whether the land could be sold or otherwise alienated, it was no different from land held in trust and was therefore still Indian Country. [...] The judgment of the district court was in error and was reversed.|$|E
500|$|As Hardwicke {{had decided}} to {{interpret}} the Statute of Anne as for the public good, the main question of the case became which [...] "any such book or books" [...] the act referred to and protected. The defendants argued that his abridgement must be considered separate from the original work published by Gyles. The defendant's lawyers furthered pushed the court to try the case as if the abridgement had been recorded in the Stationers' Register, an action {{that would have given}} Wilcox and Nutt the right to publish their book, and the lawsuit brought against a second, unique book. Therefore, the only <b>question</b> <b>before</b> the court was whether the second book differentiated sufficiently from the first. Further, the attorneys for the defendants argued that the book was not a direct transcription, but that several chapters had been omitted, while other, original sections had been added to the Wilcox and Nutt publication. They further pointed {{to the fact that the}} Gyles' publication consisted of 275 sheets, whereas the abridgement contained only 35 sheets.|$|E
