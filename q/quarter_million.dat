York County, would later be created by Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1792, which would at its largest size, comprise all of what is now Halton Region, Toronto, Peel Region, York Region and parts of Durham Region. The Town of York (present day Toronto) would later be attacked by American forces in the War of 1812 in what is now known as the Battle of York, in 1813.|$|E
25|$|Most Indians {{depend on}} on-site {{sanitation}} facilities which means mainly pit latrines in rural areas. In rural areas, {{the government has}} been promoting community-led sanitation approaches such as the Total Sanitation Campaign, with some success. In urban areas, a good practice example is the Slum Sanitation Program in Mumbai that has provided access to sanitation for a <b>quarter</b> <b>million</b> slum dwellers. Sewerage, where available, is often in a bad state. In Delhi the sewerage network has lacked maintenance over the years and overflow of raw sewage in open drains is common, due to blockage, settlements and inadequate pumping capacities. The capacity of the 17 existing wastewater treatment plants in Delhi is adequate to cater a daily production of waste water of less than 50% of the drinking water produced. Of the 2.5billion people in the world that defecate openly, some 665million live in India, making it the country with the highest number of people who defecate in the open. This has serious public health implications.|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} agricultural production, the kolkhozes (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. Kolkhoz leaders used this {{as an excuse to}} expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, and nearly 12,000people were sent to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective, and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin. He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process. The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 [...] "bandits" [...] and capturing a <b>quarter</b> <b>million</b> more between 1944 and 1946. About 600,000Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.|$|E

In that same period, Sestak raised only $758,000, about a <b>quarter</b> <b>million</b> dollars lower than the previous quarter, making his total allocation about $4.7 million. Sestak continued working hard to overcome his name recognition problem, seldom turning down interview requests and asking his staff to work six 12-hour days a week. As a result, Sestak saw a large amount of turnover in his staff, going through nearly half a dozen press secretaries and several chiefs of staff. Sestak called on Specter participate in six debates, one for each media market in Pennsylvania, but Specter only agreed to participate in one because that was the amount of debates he participated in as a Republican. On December 7, Sestak was endorsed by Congressman Barney Frank, who said that he was impressed by Sestak's leadership on economic and military issues, as well as his positions against the military's [...] "don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy and the Defense of Marriage Act. The endorsement was important to Sestak {{because it was the first}} time a prominent member of Congress broke with the Democratic establishment to back him over Specter. Frank also said of Specter's switching parties, [...] "I have to say I don't think it did our profession any good for someone to announce that he switched parties purely so he could survive." ...|$|E
