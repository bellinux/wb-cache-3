5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|R

25|$|C-27A 90-0170 was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> at AMARC in October 2008 and {{delivered}} to Eglin AFB, Florida, {{for use by}} the Air Force Research Laboratory to test the feasibility of mounting of 30mm and 40mm guns. In May 2009, the program was put on hold because U.S. Army funding for 40 C-27s in an Army–Air Force cooperative purchase was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the fiscal 2010 budget. U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command elected to standardize their fleet with the C-130 to meet its gunship needs.|$|R
30|$|Use of {{surfactants}} {{for cleaning}} of wastes {{is a relatively}} fast process, which {{has the potential to}} treat large volumes. After mixing the sludge with solvents and surface-active agents, and then applying thermal and mechanical actions, sludge is converted to an emulsion, which causes viscosity reduction by reduction of interfacial tension. So sludge <b>removing</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> tanks or other refinery apparatus becomes possible (Zubaidy and Abouelnasr 2010; Klier et al. 1998; Campbell 2002).|$|R

50|$|On August 1, 2008 Union Pacific Railroad {{announced}} that it would be retiring 21 of the SD90MAC locomotives. According to sources http://www.american-rails.com/sd90mac.html common parts will be used to maintain the railroad's 710-engined SD90MAC fleet. The 265H prime mover will be cut up or exported. The only part that is non-reusable will be the frame. These units, in the 8900 series will be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> in Denver, and be sent to East St. Louis, Ill., in small batches to be dismantled.|$|R
50|$|The Mainline Steam Heritage Trust {{purchased}} four DJ's in 1990-91. DJ's 3044 and 3580 (DJ's 1204 and 1254) {{were purchased}} as spare parts donors and were stored at MLST's Parnell depot, while DJ's 3292 and 3303 (DJ's 1228 and 1229) were purchased by Richard Head and Ian Welch respectively {{with the intention}} of having them returned to working order. With no intended use for the two Parnell locomotives, DJ 3580 was scrapped in the 1990s; DJ 3044 was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> in May 2011 and was sold to the Taieri Gorge Railway after it was dismantled for spare parts.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, a {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Flight Systems Inc. (later Honeywell) to modify 194 surplus Convair F-106 Delta Dart aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona to the QF-106A target drone configuration. This program {{came to be known}} as Pacer Six, and the first flight of a converted drone took place in July 1987. Following the completion of an initial batch of ten QF-106s in 1990, most of the work was transferred to the USAF itself. Much of the conversion work was done before the aircraft were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> at AMARC, with further work being carried out at East St Louis, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The ARES {{has since}} drawn {{a lot of}} {{attention}} from the U.S. Navy and Air Force, but it remains a private project. After an appearance in the movie Aces: Iron Eagle III as an Me 263 fighter, the aircraft has become a research test bed available to any one wishing to pay to test new technologies with it. The aircraft was put into storage in December 2000 at the Mojave Spaceport. After Scaled Composites became a Northrop Grumman subsidiary, ARES was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> and reactivated in early 2008, taking to the skies again on March 7, 2008.|$|R
30|$|Eventually, {{the sludge}} must be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. Known methods of sludge removal involve oil {{recovery}} methods and disposal methods (Franco et al. 1996). Thermo-chemical methods, solvent extraction, froth flotation, pyrolysis, surfactant, ultrasonic irradiation, electro-kinetic methods, microwave irradiation, freeze/thaw, and centrifugation {{are known as}} oil recovery methods. Cleaning methods such as manual cleaning, robotic methods, biodegradation, oxidation, stabilization/solidification and incineration are known disposal methods (Hu et al. 2013; Miyasaki 1997; Taiwo and Otolorin 2009; Jun et al. 2002; Ramaswamy et al. 2007; Strenkert and Carls 1969; Bock et al. 1990; Jing et al. 2012; Zhanga et al. 2013; Polycell products limited.

40|$|Radioactive {{waste is}} {{confined}} in 48 underground storage tanks at the Savannah River Site. The waste {{will eventually be}} processed and transferred to other site facilities for stabilization. Based on waste removal and processing schedules, many of the tanks, including those with flaws and/or defects, {{will be required to}} be in service for another 15 to 20 years. Until the waste is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage,</b> transferred, and processed, the materials and structures of the tanks must maintain a confinement function by providing a leak-tight barrier to the environment and by maintaining acceptable structural stability during design basis event which include loading from both normal service and abnormal conditions...|$|R
25|$|In a cool, dry place, oils {{have greater}} stability, but may thicken, {{although}} they will soon return to liquid form {{if they are}} left at room temperature. To minimize the degrading effects of heat and light, oils should be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> cold <b>storage</b> {{just long enough for}} use.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Forest Service {{developed}} the Modular Airborne FireFighting System for the C-130 in the 1970s, which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an airtanker for fighting wildfires. In the late 1980s, 22 retired USAF C-130As were <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base {{and transferred to}} the U.S. Forest Service, which then illegally transferred them to six private companies to be converted into air tankers. After one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight {{as a result of}} fatigue stress cracking, the entire fleet of C-130A air tankers was permanently grounded in 2004. C-130s were used to spread chemical dispersants onto the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf Coast in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Triana was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> its {{original}} launch opportunity on STS-107 (the ill-fated Columbia mission in 2003). The $100 million satellite remained in storage {{for the duration}} of the Bush administration. In November 2008 the satellite was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage</b> and began recertification for a possible launch on board a Delta II or a Falcon 9. Al Gore used part of his book Our Choice (2009) as an attempt to revive debate on the DSCOVR payload. The book mentions legislative efforts by Senators Barbara Mikulski and Bill Nelson to get the satellite launched. NASA renamed the satellite Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), in an attempt to regain support for the project. In February 2011, the Obama administration attempted to secure funding to re-purpose the DSCOVR spacecraft as a solar observatory to replace the aging Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft.|$|R

They were asked to review the Elitch Theatre's [...] "Anne Hathaway" [...] grand drape and consult on its restoration. The drape was <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>storage,</b> and unrolled by CWB representatives and theatre volunteers who discovered improper storage. The drape was illegible, and the paint dissolved into dust as the curtain was unrolled. The curtain was displayed on the backstage theatre floor for lecture attendees to view.
