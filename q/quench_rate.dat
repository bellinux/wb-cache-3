50|$|The {{mechanism}} exploits {{the critical}} slowing {{down in the}} neighbourhood of the critical point, this is, the divergence of the relaxation time of the system.As the system approaches the critical point from the high symmetry phase, its dynamics becomes increasingly slow, and eventually ceases to be adiabatic. Under a linear quench of the control parameter, this happens at the freeze-out time scale, when the relaxation time matches the time left for the system to reach the critical point. KZM predicts the typical size of the domains in the broken symmetry phase to be fixed by {{the value of the}} equilibrium correlation length at freeze-out time. The inverse of this length scale can be used as an estimate of the density of topological defects, and it obeys a power law in the <b>quench</b> <b>rate.</b> This prediction is universal, and the power exponent is given in terms of the critical exponents of the transition.|$|E

Two common commercial aluminium foundry alloys, A 356 and A 354, are investigated. Samples were produced by employing gradient solidification technology which generates uniformly and directionally solidified specimens with different microstructural coarsenesses. Generally, heat treatment is widely applied {{to strengthen the}} Al-Si-Cu-Mg cast alloys through precipitation hardening. Measurements of electrical conductivity have been conducted in order to indicate the sequences of precipitation formations. To optimise the precipitation hardening effect, {{it is essential to}} understand the quench sensitivity. It can be concluded that the <b>quench</b> <b>rate</b> significantly influences the mechanical properties; the tensile strength and strength coefficient are enhanced with an increase in <b>quench</b> <b>rate.</b> The ductility instead increases with a reduced <b>quench</b> <b>rate,</b> which might be due to the more ductile α-Al matrix with corresponding coarsening and reduced level of hardening precipitates...|$|E

While a Cu amount below 0. 01 wt% does not affect precipitation hardening, an addition of 0. 1 wt% Cu increases hardness due {{to the formation of}} a fine microstructure having a high number density of short precipitates.

A quantitative analysis of microstructures was carried out by transmission electron microscopy, focusing on grain boundary precipitates to correlate bending properties with microstructure. Crack initiation occurs by voiding at large micron-size intermetallic AlFeSi particles in shear bands, as previously proposed in the literature. Rapid quenching promotes the formation along grain boundaries of spherical Mg 2 Si precipitates to the detriment of elongated Si precipitates that dominate after slow cooling. These Si grain boundary precipitates affect micro-voiding processes that drive crack propagation, which explains the observed dependence of the extent of cracking on <b>quench</b> <b>rate.</b> The grain boundary precipitate density has on the other hand no effect on crack initiation or propagation...|$|E
