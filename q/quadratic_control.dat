40|$|Impedance {{control is}} a {{compliance}} control strategy capable of accommodating both unconstrained and constrained motions. The performance of impedance controllers depends heavily upon environment dynamics and the choice of target impedance. To maintain performance {{for a wide range}} of environments, target impedance needs to be adjusted adaptively. In this paper, a geometric view on impedance control is developed for stiff environments, resulting in a “static-optimized ” controller that minimizes a combined generalized position and force trajectory error metric. To incorporate the dynamic nature of the manipulator-environment system, a new cost function is considered. A classic <b>quadratic</b> optimal <b>control</b> strategy is employed to design a novel adaptive compliance controller with control parameters adjusted based upon environment stiffness and damping. In steady state, the proposed controller ultimately implements the static-optimized impedance controller. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed optimal controller offers smoother transient response and a better trade-off between position and force regulation.
