5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

25|$|As {{with other}} {{educational}} research (and {{the social sciences}} in general), mathematics education research depends on both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies.</b> Quantitative research includes studies that use inferential statistics to answer specific questions, such as whether a certain teaching method gives significantly better results than the status quo. The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects. They depend on large samples to obtain statistically significant results.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the patient}} perspective, one 1997 {{study found that}} 77% of {{individuals}} with CFS reported negative experiences with health care providers. In a more recent metaanalysis of <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies,</b> a major theme identified in patient discourses was that they felt severely ill, yet blamed and dismissed. Another recent study of themes in patient newsgroup postings noted key themes relating to denial of social recognition of suffering and feelings of being accused of [...] "simply faking it". Another theme that emerged strongly was that achieving diagnosis and acknowledgement requires tremendous amounts of [...] "hard work" [...] by patients.|$|E

2500|$|In the Western world, {{much of the}} {{bereavement}} {{literature of}} the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences {{as a form of}} denial, in the tradition of Freud's interpretation in Mourning and Melancholia of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'. In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) [...] has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects of these experiences, especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways While most of these experiences tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others, to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.|$|E
2500|$|Two <b>qualitative</b> <b>studies</b> have {{investigated}} the motives and experiences of Canadian patients traveling abroad to get the [...] "liberation procedure". One of the studies identified three factors contributing to patients going abroad seeking treatment: a loss {{of faith in the}} Canadian health system when it did not provide access to CCSVI treatment in Canada, hope in the new treatment as a solution for their worsening health, and trust in the MS community and the organizations, clinics and doctors facilitating or providing the desired operation. Conversely, the other study concluded that sense of community and cooperation (from family, MS groups and the general population) was a key motivating factor. Other motivating factors included media reports, perception of approval from their health providers, the apparent low risk of the operation, or accessibility of the hospital that offered the procedure directly or through a medical tourism company. On the other hand, hesitating factors included the cost and effort required for the operation, the mistrust of foreign health systems, the underlying rationale for the operation, or advice against the procedure from trusted health providers.|$|E
