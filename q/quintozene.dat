50|$|Cases of {{dermatitis}} {{caused by}} pesticide exposures, tabulated by the Division of Dermatology, Saku Central Hospital, Japan, from 1975 to 2000 are described. Dermatitis cases gradually decreased from 1975 to 2000, presumably accelerated by the phase-out of dermatitis-causing pesticides, including difolatan fungicide and salithion, an organophosphorous insecticide. Cases of chronic and solar dermatitides gradually decreased, {{which may be}} explained by reductions in the use of allergenic or photosensitive sulfur agents and organophosphates. However, the ratios of chemical burns from irritant pesticides—calcium polysulfide, dazomet, methyl bromide, chlorpicrin, paraqat/diquat, organophosphorus, <b>quintozene,</b> and glyphosate—rose in those years. Chemical burns from calcium polysulfide were responsible for most of the severe cases.|$|E

Globally banned pesticides, so-called historic-use pesticides (HUPs), are still commonly {{observed in the}} environment. In this work, air and surface seawater samples taken from the Bohai and Yellow Seas in May 2012 were analyzed for CUPs including trifluralin, <b>quintozene,</b> chlorothalonil, dicofol, chlorpyrifos, and dacthal, as well as HUPs (hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), and endosulfan).

HUPs {{in the air and}} seawater samples were in comparable levels as those of CUPs with high concentrations. alpha-Endosulfan, dicofol, and chlorothalonil showed strong net deposition likely resulting from their intensive use in recent years, while CUPs with low consumption amount (<b>quintozene</b> and dacthal) were close to equilibrium at most samplings sites. Another CUP with high usage amout (i. e., chlorpyrifos) underwent volatilization possibly due to its longer half-life in seawater than that in air. alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH were close to equilibrium in the Bohai Sea, but mainly underwent net deposition in the Yellow Sea. The net deposition of alpha-HCH could be attributed to polluted air pulses from the East China identified by air mass back trajectories. beta-HCH showed net volatilization in the Bohai Sea, which was driven by its relative enrichment in seawater.

40|$|The basal {{parts of}} {{maturing}} glasshouse lettuce can be attacked by several soil fungi, which cause bottom rot. Until recently <b>quintozene</b> was generally applied against this disease complex. The {{study of the}} causal fungi - especially Rhizoctonia solani - and their control was undertaken {{in view of the}} need for <b>quintozene</b> replacing fungicides. A survey revealed that Botrytis cinerea was the most frequently observed pathogen, especially in winter crops. The incidence of Sclerotinia minor, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Pythium spp. and Rhizoctonia solani was much lower. These fungi were more prevalent in autumn and late spring crops than in winter crops. Many of the attacked heads were infected by more than one pathogen. On an average disease severity caused by R. solani was the highest and by Pythium spp. the lowest. Trials showed that on untreated areas the average loss of lettuce heads of export quality class caused by bottom rot was 17 per cent, whereas on plots treated with appropriate fungicides this loss was 5 per cent. For the detection of R. solani in the soil a relatively simple and fast paper disk bait method was improved and standardized. In addition a time saving quantitative technique was developed by plating out sieved soil clumps on a selective medium. The paper disk method proved that the horizontal dispersion of R. solani propagules in the soil of lettuce glasshouses is not random, but clustered. This pattern could be characterized by the negative binomial distribution. Propagules were found throughout the whole ploughlayer but the inoculum density decreased remarkly as the depth of sampling increased. The average inoculum density on 62 holdings was low: 0. 6 propagule of R. solani per 100 g of soil. The individual glasshouse values were related to the period of sampling, soil disinfestation and the use of <b>quintozene.</b> During winter crops the inoculum density remained low, in spring time the values were higher, especially {{at the end of the}} cropping period. An attack of R. solani in most lettuce crops can be characterized as a "simple interest disease" sensu Vanderplank. This implies that the reduction of the initial inoculum in the soil is the most important factor in the control strategy. On a log-log scale there appeared to exist a linear relationship between the initial inoculum density of R. solani determined with the paper disk method and the infections of lettuce heads. This indicates that this method of detection has a disease forecasting value. A tentative threshold value of initial inoculum density of 0. 2 - 0. 5 propagules per 100 g of soil was established, if the value is less than this no economic loss need be expected. Most of the R. solani isolates from lettuce leaves that were examined showed that the minimum temperature required for infection was at least 9 °C. The incubation period at this temperature was from 11 - 15 days, whereas at 20 °C less then 3 days. The linear extension of the lesions on infected leaves was at 20 °C about 8 mm per 24 hour. These data confirm the observations that on lettuce,,cropped during winter months with a low temperature regime, the attack is minimal, and that in late spring crops with periods of high temperature the attack can progress very quickly. Isolates were obtained with specific low temperature requirements from a glasshouse with a winter crop which had been severely attacked. Rhizoctonia solani in lettuce appeared to be hygrophylic, but free water is not necessary for the initiating of the infection process. All seventeen glasshouse crops tested, in a host range experiment, were attacked by R. solani. In isolates obtained from diseased heads, three out of four known European anastomis groups of R. solani occurred. The other, anastomis group 3 ("potato group") was only found once among isolates from soil. The dicarboximides, iprodione and vinclozolin, have proved in field and in vitro experiments, to be good replacements for <b>quintozene</b> to control attacks of B. cinerea, R. solani and Sclerotinia spp. The infection by Pythium spp. appears to increase when <b>quintozene</b> and dicarboximides are used. Further research is necessary in order to establish whether the chemical control of Pythium spp. will be required economically. Soil disinfestation with methyl bromide caused a large reduction of the inoculum density of R. solaniFinally it has been discussed that the control of bottom rot should be optimized by integration of the culture of the more tolerant "upright" cultivars, the management of appropriate cultural measures and a reduced dose of fungicides...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{functional}} characterization of AtrBp, an ABC transporter from Aspergillus nidulans. AtrBp is a multidrug transporter and has affinity to substrates belonging to all major classes of agricultural fungicides and some natural toxic compounds. The substrate profile of AtrBp {{was determined by}} assessing the sensitivity of deletion and overexpression mutants of atrB to several toxicants. All mutants showed normal growth as compared to control isolates. atrB mutants displayed increased sensitivity to anilinopyrimidine, benzimidazole, phenylpyrrole, phenylpyridylamine, strobirulin and some azole fungicides. Increased sensitivity to the natural toxic compounds camptothecin (alkaloid), the phytoalexin resveratrol (stilbene) and the mutagen 4 -nitroquinoline oxide was also found. Overexpression mutants were less sensitive {{to a wide range}} of chemicals. In addition to the compounds mentioned above, decreased sensitivity to a broader range of azoles, dicarboximides, <b>quintozene,</b> acriflavine and rhodamine 6 G was observed. Decreased sensitivity in overexpression mutants negatively correlated with levels of atrB expression. Interestingly, the overexpression mutants displayed increased sensitivity to dithiocarbamate fungicides, chlorothalonil and the iron-activated antibiotic phleomycin. Accumulation of the azole fungicide [14 C]fenarimol by the overexpression mutants was lower as compared to the parental isolate, demonstrating that AtrBp acts by preventing intracellular accumulation of the toxicant. Various metabolic inhibitors increased accumulation levels of [14 C]fenarimol in the overexpression mutants to wild-type levels, indicating that reduced accumulation of the fungicide in these mutants is due to increased energy-dependent efflux as a result of higher pump capacity of AtrBp...|$|E

The present paper is concerned with the air pollution of pesticides. In order to know the outline of the characters of the pesticides being in use and of the regions polluted by them nowadays, the basic experiment about the volatility of pecticides and the field inspection at several points in Gunma Prefecture were carried out. The field samples collected were as follows : <b>quintozene</b> （PCNB） to cabbage farm in Tsumagoi Village, chloropicrin to konnyaku farm in Komochi Village, dichlorvos （DDVP）and chlorothalonil （TPN） to cucumber in vinyl house in Maebashi City, fenitrothion （MEP）to pinewood in Takasaki City and quintozene（PCNB） etc. were automatically analyzed around a factory in Maebashi City. As a result of this investigation, it was found first that the pesticides were more volatile than expected, and second that the residual pesticides after using were so remarkable, that they were detected after a week in park or school ground. This fact seemed to be due to the vaporizing of the pesticides which were once adhered or adsorped on the leaves of the pesticides which were once adhered or adsorbed on the leaves of vegetables and soil. Therefore, the rural dwellers are in danger of being exposed always to pesticide vapore. This paper was summarized as the first attempt to limit the unreasonable use of poisonaour pesticides...|$|E

Key results from four main Arctic research stations, Alert (Canada), Pallas (Finland), Storhofdi (Iceland) and Zeppelin (Svalbard/Norway), where long-term monitoring have been carried out since the early 1990 s, are summarized. We have also included a discussion of main results from various Arctic satellite stations in Canada, Russia, US (Alaska) and Greenland which have been operational for shorter time periods. Using the Digital Filtration temporal trend development technique, it was found that while some POPs showed more or less consistent declines during the 1990 s, this reduction is less apparent in recent years at some sites. In contrast, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were still found to be increasing by 2005 at Alert with doubling times of 3. 5 years in the case of deca-BDE. Levels and patterns of most POPs in Arctic air are also showing spatial variability, which is typically explained by differences in proximity to suspected key source regions and long-range atmospheric transport potentials. Furthermore, increase in worldwide usage of certain pesticides, e. g. chlorothalonil and <b>quintozene,</b> which are contaminated with hexachlorobenzene (HCB), may result in an increase in Arctic air concentration of HCB. The results combined also indicate that both temporal and spatial patterns of POPs in Arctic air may be affected by various processes driven by climate change, such as reduced ice cover, increasing seawater temperatures and an increase in biomass burning in boreal regions as exemplified by the data from the Zeppelin and Alert stations. Further research and continued air monitoring are needed to better understand these processes and its future impact on the Arctic environment...|$|E

Cross-resistance studies with other SBIs showed that these triadimefon-resistant strains exhibited positive cross-resistance (Rf 2 – 10) to the other C- 14 demethylase inhibitors (DMIs), {{but not to the}} morpholine fungicides fenpropimorph or tridemorph. Study of fitness of DMI-resistant strains showed that these mutation(s) were pleiotropic, with significant adverse effects on characteristics determining phytopathogenic fitness such as rate of mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination and pathogenicity on cucumber seedlings. The results indicate that some SBI-fungicides are suitable for use in resistance management programmes against grey mould...|$|E
40|$|The Arctic {{has been}} {{contaminated}} by legacy organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and currently used pesticides (CUPs) through atmospheric transport and oceanic currents. Here we report the time trends and air−water exchange of OCPs and CUPs from research expeditions conducted between 1993 and 2013. Compounds determined in both {{air and water}} were trans- and cis-chlordanes (TC, CC), trans- and cis-nonachlors (TN, CN), heptachlor exo-epoxide (HEPX), dieldrin (DIEL), chlorobornanes (ΣCHBs and toxaphene), dacthal (DAC), endosulfans and metabolite endosulfan sulfate (ENDO-I, ENDO-II, and ENDO SUL), chlorothalonil (CHT), chlorpyrifos (CPF), and trifluralin (TFN). Pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB and <b>quintozene)</b> and its soil metabolite pentachlorothianisole (PCTA) were also found in air. Concentrations of most OCPs declined in surface water, whereas some CUPs increased (ENDO-I, CHT, and TFN) or showed no significant change (CPF and DAC), and most compounds declined in air. Chlordane compound fractions TC/(TC + CC) and TC/(TC + CC + TN) decreased in water and air, while CC/(TC + CC + TN) increased. TN/(TC + CC + TN) also increased in air and slightly, but not significantly, in water. These changes suggest selective removal of more labile TC and/or a shift in chlordane sources. Water−air fugacity ratios indicated net volatilization (FR > 1. 0) or near equilibrium (FR {{not significantly different from}} 1. 0) for most OCPs but net deposition (FR < 1. 0) for ΣCHBs. Net deposition was shown for ENDO-I on all expeditions, while the net exchange direction of other CUPs varied. Understanding the processes and current state of air−surface exchange helps to interpret environmental exposure and evaluate the effectiveness of international protocols and provides insights for the environmental fate of new and emerging chemicals.
