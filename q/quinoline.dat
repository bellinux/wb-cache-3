5|$|Several unique {{chemicals}} {{are produced by}} Mycena haematopus. The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and <b>quinoline,</b> both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities. Additional alkaloid compounds in M.haematopus include the red pigments mycenarubins D, E and F. Prior {{to the discovery of}} these compounds, pyrroloquinoline alkaloids were considered to be rare in terrestrial sources.|$|E

A Yb 3 + catalyst resulted in higher yields of <b>quinolines</b> than Fe 3 +. Polarizing optical microscopy (POM) revealed {{that none of}} the <b>quinolines</b> were liquid crystals, even the more anisotropic. UV-Vis measurements of one of the <b>quinolines</b> in polar solvent show two absorption bands at 280 and 350 nm related to &# 960;,&# 960;* and n,&# 960;* transitions. No changes were observed to lower-energy absorption band (&# 949; < 104 mol L- 1 cm- 1) related to n,&# 960;* transition. A laser flash photolysis study for one of the <b>quinolines</b> relates a main transient band at 450 nm with a lifetime of 2. 6 &# 181;s in ethanol, which is completely quenched in the presence of oxygen. This transient band was assigned to triplet-triplet absorption of one of the <b>quinolines,</b> which is semi-oxidised in the presence of phenol. Radiative rate constants have been determined along singlet and triplet excited state energies (3. 39 and 3. 10 eV, respectively).

25|$|Isoquinoline is a heterocyclic {{aromatic}} organic compound.

25|$|Though {{crude oil}} is {{predominantly}} composed of various hydrocarbons, certain nitrogen heterocylic compounds, such as pyridine, picoline, and <b>quinoline</b> are reported as contaminants associated with crude oil, {{as well as}} facilities processing oil shale or coal, and have also been found at legacy wood treatment sites.

25|$|The {{chemical}} structure of pyridine was determined decades after its discovery. Wilhelm Körner (1869) and James Dewar (1871) suggested that, in analogy between <b>quinoline</b> and naphthalene, {{the structure of}} pyridine is derived from benzene by substituting one C–H unit with a nitrogen atom. The suggestion by Körner and Dewar was later confirmed in an experiment where pyridine was reduced to piperidine with sodium in ethanol. In 1876, William Ramsay combined acetylene and hydrogen cyanide into pyridine in a red-hot iron-tube furnace. This was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound.|$|E
40|$|Efficient ruthenium-, rhodium-, palladium-, copper- and iridium-catalysed methodologies {{have been}} {{recently}} {{developed for the}} synthesis of <b>quinolines</b> by the reaction of 2 -aminobenzyl alcohols with carbonyl compounds (aldehydes and ketones) or the related alcohols. The reaction is assumed to proceed via a sequence involving initial metal-catalysed oxidation of 2 -aminobenzyl alcohols to the related 2 -aminobenzaldehydes, followed by cross aldol reaction with a carbonyl compound under basic conditions to afford α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. These aldehydes or ketones can be also generated in situ via dehydrogenation of the related primary and secondary alcohols. In the final step cyclodehydration of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound intermediates gives <b>quinolines.</b> Good yields of <b>quinolines</b> were also obtained by reacting 2 -nitrobenzyl alcohols and secondary alcohols {{in the presence of}} a ruthenium catalyst.

The foresaid compounds are required for the synthesis of thieno <b>quinolines.</b> Microwave synthesis was adopted owing to its user-friendly nature. The antimutagenic activity of the compounds has been assessed by Ames Salmonella Microsome Assay.

In March 1946, the drug was officially named Chloroquine. Chloroquine is an inhibitor of hemozoin production through biocrystallization.
