5|$|After the earthquake, several {{websites}} speculated {{about whether}} hydraulic fracturing (fracking) {{for natural gas}} production could have caused or contributed to the <b>quake.</b> There were not any fracking operations in Virginia {{at the time of}} the <b>quake.</b> The nearest fracking was occurring in the Marcellus shale in West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Staff at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C., {{reported}} {{that some of}} the animals in the park appeared to show behavior suggesting that they anticipated the earthquake from seconds to minutes before it was felt in the area. The earthquake was felt at the great ape exhibits during afternoon feeding time. About three to ten seconds before the <b>quake,</b> many of the apes abandoned their food and {{climbed to the top of}} a tree-like structure in the exhibit. The red ruffed lemurs sounded an alarm call about 15 minutes before the <b>quake,</b> and the flock of 64 flamingos rushed about and grouped themselves together just before the <b>quake.</b> During the <b>quake,</b> some animals vocalized, some ran or dove for cover, and some stood up and stared at the walls of their enclosures. Some of the animals remained agitated for the rest of the day, while others calmed quickly. The Zoo's giant pandas did not appear to respond to the <b>quake.</b>|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the <b>Quake</b> Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a <b>quake</b> to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Quaking</b> is an {{autosomal}} recessive hypo/dysmyelinating mutant mouse {{which has a}} 1 -Mbp deletion on chromosome 17. The mutation exhibits pleiotrophy and does not include genes encoding characterized myelin proteins. The levels of the 67 -kD isoform of the myelin-associated glycoprotein (S-MAG) relative {{to those of the}} 72 -kD isoform (L-MAG) are increased in the <b>quaking</b> CNS, but not in other dysmyelinating mutants. Abnormal expression of MAG isoforms in <b>quaking</b> may result from altered transcription of the MAG gene or from abnormal sorting, transport, or targeting of L-MAG or S-MAG. To test these hypotheses, we have determined the distribution of L-MAG and S-MAG in cervical spinal cord of 7 -, 14 -, 21 -, 28 -, and 35 -d-old <b>quaking</b> mice. In 7 -d-old <b>quaking</b> and contro...|$|R

In 7 -d-old <b>quaking</b> and control spinal cord, L- and S-MAG was detectable in periaxonal regions of myelinated fibers and in the perinuclear cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. Between 7 and 35 d, L-MAG was removed from the periaxonal membrane of <b>quaking</b> but not control mice. Compared to control mice, a significant increase in MAG labeling of endosomes occurred within oligodendrocyte cytoplasm of 35 -d-old <b>quaking</b> mice. S- MAG remained in periaxonal membranes of both <b>quaking</b> and control mice. Analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of L-MAG identifies amino acid motifs at tyrosine 35 and tyrosine 65 which meet the criteria for "tyrosine internalization signals" that direct transmembrane glycoproteins into the endocytic pathway. These results establish that L-MAG is selectively removed from the periaxonal membrane of CNS- myelinated fibers by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The loss of L-MAG from <b>quaking</b> periaxonal membranes results from increased endocytosis of L-MAG and possibly a decrease in L-MAG production...|$|R
5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the outside world. The <b>quake</b> was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle.

40|$|Silo <b>quaking</b> {{refers to}} a {{phenomenon}} where material in a silo does not move smoothly, but rather in short sharp bursts known as <b>quakes.</b> The period between <b>quakes</b> can range from several minutes to tens of milliseconds, depending on the situation. The problem often presents in otherwise perfectly functioning silos with no other flow issues (flow from the outlet remains continuous). Sometimes the phenomenon {{can be viewed as}} a curious and benign oddity; however this is generally not the case. In an increasing number of systems, the associated dynamics generate significant structural loads that are of real concern. This study makes use of a scale model silo, which was mounted on load cells, to investigate the silo <b>quaking</b> mechanism for different material discharge rates. To compare with the experimental investigation, Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) was also used to investigate the <b>quaking</b> mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|According to the USGS {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of roughly 30,000 waste fluid disposal wells for oil and gas operations in the United States have induced earthquakes that are large enough to be of concern to the public. [...] Although the magnitudes of these <b>quakes</b> has been small, the USGS says that there is no guarantee that larger <b>quakes</b> will not occur. In addition, the frequency of the <b>quakes</b> has been increasing. In 2009, there were 50 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 in the area spanning Alabama and Montana, and there were 87 <b>quakes</b> in 2010. In 2011 there were 134 earthquakes in the same area, a sixfold increase over 20th century levels.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, id Software {{released}} the much anticipated <b>Quake.</b> Like Doom, <b>Quake</b> was influential and genre-defining, featuring fast-paced, gory gameplay, but used 3D polygons instead of sprites. It was centered on online gaming and featured multiple match types still found in first-person shooter games today. It was the first FPS game to have a following of player clans (although the concept had existed previously in MechWarrior 2 (Netmech) with its Battletech lore as well as amongst MUD players), and would inspire popular LAN parties such as QuakeCon. The game's popularity and use of 3D polygonal graphics also helped to expand the growing market for video card hardware; and the additional support and encouragement for game modifications attracted players who wanted to tinker with the game and create their own modules. According to creator John Romero, Quakes 3D world was inspired by the 3D fighting game Virtua Fighter. <b>Quake</b> was also intended to expand the genre with Virtua Fighter influenced melee brawling, but this was eventually dropped from the final game.|$|E
