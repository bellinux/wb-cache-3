This thesis investigates a coupling mechanism to implement a <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator using indirect injection method. The coupling network in this QVCO couples the two LC cores with their super-harmonic and it recycles its bias current back into the LC tank such that the power consumed by the coupling network is insignificant.

40|$|With the {{emergence}} of multi-standard and cognitive radios, the need for reconfigurable RF circuits increased. Such circuits require wide-band <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillators (QVCOs) to provide the local oscillator (LO) signal for up and down conversion. Wide-band QVCOs performance has lagged behind their narrowband VCO counterparts and numerous circuit techniques have been introduced to bridge the gap. This dissertation presents techniques {{that have been used}} to implement wide-band reconfigurable QVCOs with focus on dual-resonance based circuits. System and circuit analysis are performed to understand the tuning-range, phase noise, and power tradeoffs and to consider quadrature phase errors. An 8. 8 - 15. 0 GHz actively coupled QVCO and a 13. 8 - 20 GHz passively coupled QVCO are presented. Both oscillators employ dual-resonance to achieve extended tuning ranges. Impulse sensitivity functions were used to study the impact of different passive and active device noises on the overall phase noise performance of the dual-resonance oscillator and the actively and passively coupled quadrature oscillators. The quadrature phase error due to the different architecture parameters were investigated for the actively and passively coupled quadrature oscillators. The advantages of using switched capacitor tuning as a major part of passive tuning are identified, and the advantage of employing switches with large bandwidths, such as those associated with phase change materials, is mathematically quantified. Furthermore, a novel method for accurate off chip phase error measurement using discrete components and phase shifters that does not require calibration is introduced...|$|R

The stress on lowering the voltage supply, the power consumption, {{the cost and}} increasing level of integration are the driving forces behind today's RF microelectronics research. The goal of this thesis is to show the possibility of standard CMOS technology replacing the traditional technologies in RFIC applications, specifically {{in the design and}} implementation of frequency synthesizers for 5 GHz WLAN applications. The frequency synthesizer is a key building block of WLAN transceivers. To generate multiple frequencies with the resolution required by 5 GHz WLAN standards, a fractional-N frequency synthesizer architecture was successfully implemented in 1. 8 V 0. 18 mum CMOS technology. To be able to cover the lower and upper 5 GHz bands of both HiperLan and 802. 11 a standards, a wide tuning range <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator (VCO), providing a 4 -phase output and operating from 5 GHz to 6 GHz, was used in the phase lock loop (PLL) design. The 5 GHz WLAN standards are targeted since they are the most promising, they have few interferers and large data throughputs. This thesis presents one of the few frequency synthesizers having a large bandwidth of operation and a small resolution reported to-date for this type of application.

The overall performance is displayed by all-pMOS VCO in terms of supply voltage and tuning range. The performance comparison of all-pMOS LC-VCO using various capacitive loads is discussed. All-pMOS LC-VCO with MOS capacitor switched capacitor array (SCA) followed by divider using CML latch without fixed tail current source is used for generation of high linearity quadrature signals.

However, all the performances of varactor QVCO?s are significantly closer with all-pMOS LC VCO compared with other VCO topologies like all-nMOS LC-VCO and complementary cross coupled LC-VCO, due to low dc impedance path between the varactor to ground terminal.

40|$|The {{oscillator}} circuit {{is one of}} the {{key components}} of the communication systems. It is necessary for an oscillator to provide the proper oscillations in order to confirm the stable operation of a communication circuit. There are many different analysis methods of analyzing the start-up and frequency stability of a system, but mostly it fails to analyze properly due to the parasitics involved. Somehow if any of them manages to compute the analysis it would be very complex, difficult and time consuming. The time varying root locus (TVRL) approach can be utilized to analyze the start-up and frequency behavior of different oscillator designs. It is a theoretical based technique that can provide further insights into a circuit designer for oscillator operation. To analyze the start-up behavior, a semi-symbolic TVRL approach can be used with the help of the numerical QZ (Generalized Schur Decomposition) algorithm. By finding the time varying roots of polynomials, TVRL can help to estimate the undesired operating points. A symbolic TVRL analysis is capable of computing the system roots during an oscillation with the help of Muller algorithm. Different numerical and the CAD (Computer Aided Design) tool are involved to implement this theoretical approach. Cadence 45 nm CMOS General Process Design Kit (GPDK) helps to design the required schematic and SpectreRF simulator computes the time varying periodic solutions. Maple script can form an admittance matrix which is later used in MATALB to compute the final TVRL trajectories of dominant poles. The corresponding results are then analyzed to detect the failure mechanism which is responsible for relaxation oscillations. In this thesis, an active inductor <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator and five stage ring oscillator circuits are proposed to analyze thoroughly with the help of TVRL approach. The above mentioned techniques along with some extra computations have been implemented to verify whether the proposed circuits can overcome the relaxation oscillations and can produce the proper sinusoidal waveforms or there is a need to devise some modifications...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{introduce}} a <b>quadrature</b> VCO (<b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> oscillator) which applies superharmonic coupling. The presented quadrature VCO is suitable to be used, both with 2 × subharmonic mixers, as well as 4 ×subharmonic mixers. It {{would be impossible to}} avoid the presence of harmonics in CMOS VCO circuits. These harmonics are in general, undesirable signals which tend to accompany the desired fundamental signal. There are common-mode nodes (similar to those in the two source nodes in a cross-coupled VCO) in deferential VCO at which higher-order harmonics are present while the fundamental is absent in essence. We can make use of these second-order harmonics which are present at the common-mode nodes of two VCO in order to implement a quadrature connection between the fundamental outputs. The technique through which this is done is called superharmonic coupling. This CMOS quadrature VCO which applies active superharmonic coupling puts an excellent performance in show, with an output power – 0. 942 dBm for fundamental and – 9. 751 dBm for subharmonic, phase noise – 107. 2 dBc/Hz for fundamental and – 114. 8 dBc/Hz at a 1 MHz offset.

Ultra Wideband (UWB) is a promising technology that covers a bandwidth from 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz, which features distinctive advantages, such as high data rate over short and medium range, low interference or co-existence with other wireless technologies and robustness towards multipath fading and possible usage in personal area network (PAN) and body area network (BAN), targeting especially health care monitoring applications. Impulse radio UWB or ir-UWB, {{is one of the}} UWB technologies, which applies transmission of short duration (pico-nano second) and carrier less pulses. Several receiver architectures [1, 2 & 3] based on the principle of correlation has been proposed, with Quadrature Downconversion Auto-Correlation Receiver (QDAcR) [3] being one of them. This thesis work builds up further on the generalized QDAcR model of [3], starting with an advanced time domain analysis of principle of Downconversion in QDAcR and exploring the dependency of QDAcR on downconverter related stochastic perturbations such as phase noise, jitter and amplitude perturbations. The use of Stationary Stochastic Process Theory, Fokker-Planck Equation and Floquet’s Theory resulted in a simplified equation, incorporating the effect of stochastic perturbations; this equation of prominence, further can be extrapolated to perturbation analysis of Zero (low) – IF receivers. A complete system modeling of QDAcR downconverter resulted in vital specifications for the QDAcR downconverter being the requirement of a 5. 6 GHz <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator (QVCO) with a minimum phase noise of - 90 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset and with a maximum permissible phase error of 4 degrees.

The Bottom Series QVCO, Parallel Coupled QVCO and Push-Pull –Polyphase QVCOs were compared for their respective advantages and disadvantages, which resulted in the selection of the Parallel Coupled QVCO, because of less power consumption and robust design.
