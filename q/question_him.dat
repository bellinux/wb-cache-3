5|$|In Istanbul Brand {{was told}} that Moshe Sharett was unable to obtain a visa for Turkey. The Jewish Agency asked Brand to meet him instead in Aleppo on the Syrian-Turkish border. He was reluctant; the area was under British control and he was afraid {{they would want to}} <b>question</b> <b>him,</b> but the Agency told him it would be safe and he left by train with two of its delegates.|$|E
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is questioned about Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or <b>question)</b> <b>him.</b> The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Samuel Aboah (Willie Amakye), an African {{immigrant}} who is seeking citizenship, attacks {{a young black}} man while he is waiting for a bus, kidnapping him. Investigating Kittel's disappearance, Mulder predicts that another seed will be found. They have Marcus Duff (Carl Lumbly), a social worker who is helping Aboah apply for citizenship, cross-reference the names from the flight with those applying for permanent residency or a work visa. This leads them to Aboah, who runs when they try to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> and is discovered after squeezing himself into a drainage pipe. Aboah appears to have no symptoms of disease when he is analyzed at a local medical center, but Scully plans to examine him more.|$|E
5|$|Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{reluctant}} {{to follow up on}} the case of murdered drug addict Jenny Goode, who was run over by a car. The case has been cold for three months, but he is made to feel guilty by his partner Bolander (Ned Beatty) into reexamining it. Munch makes no progress after speaking with the family and reexamining notes. Based on witness accounts of a man with long blond hair and a black car, Munch spends all night looking through suspect photos until he finds a man with a black car with front end damage and long black hair, but blond eyebrows. Munch and Bolander <b>question</b> <b>him,</b> believing the suspect (Joe Hansard) to have dyed his hair to change his appearance after killing the woman. He quickly confesses to having hit her accidentally while driving drunk.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become {{a prime example of}} successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not <b>question</b> <b>him.</b> This began to change in the 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{money that}} Callum won from the casino is missing, and Samantha finds it with Jenny {{and her husband}} Dean (Tom Pelphrey), after they stole it. Jenny and Dean are brought into questioning; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they <b>question</b> <b>him</b> about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his {{arthritis}} and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due to the mark on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E

25|$|In November 1982, Michael Bear Carson {{was picked}} up by police in Los Angeles after being seen hitchhiking by an acquaintance.

25|$|Quill and {{the union}} {{leadership}} gave their opponents all the ammunition they needed by following {{the changes in the}} CPUSA's foreign policy, moving to a militant policy after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in 1939, then coming out against strikes after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Quill shrugged off most of this criticism from outside, haranguing the Dies Committee when it attempted to <b>question</b> <b>him,</b> and disposed of his internal critics by bringing union charges against more than a hundred opponents.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October the inquest {{heard that}} Menezes was {{initially}} not {{considered as a}} suspect, and that the police wanted unarmed officers to halt and <b>question</b> <b>him</b> in case he had information about the failed terrorist attack of 21 July 2005. Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans and a four-man squad were tasked with stopping Menezes for intelligence purposes as he travelled to Stockwell station on a bus. Dingemans told the inquest that his car was behind the bus when he was stood down at 09:55, and said he thought this was because Menezes was then considered a suspect.|$|E

25|$|FBI Agent William F. Roemer {{wrote that}} he would go to DeStefano's house to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> about mob {{business}} and on a few occasions, DeStefano would walk down the stairs in his pajamas, exposing himself. Often DeStefano's wife would serve the agents coffee and the agents would comment that the coffee had a unique taste to it. Sam would claim the coffee was made from special Italian coffee beans that his wife brewed. Months later Roemer found out that DeStefano had been urinating in the coffee before it was served to the agents. Roemer wrote he could never drink coffee again in his life.|$|E
25|$|The {{first and}} only episode, The Taxidermist, follows Madison as she visits Leland White, a taxidermist, to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> about the Origami Killer. Finding his house empty, Madison breaks in and discovers an upstairs area {{containing}} several female corpses, stuffed and posed in various positions (including a freshly killed cadaver in a bathroom), which Leland created {{in order to satisfy}} his agalmatophilia fetish. After collecting information, Madison hears Leland's car return. From here the player's actions can lead to several different endings – she can surprise Leland and kill him, be killed herself and added to his collection, escape, or contact the police and wait for them to arrest Leland. Regardless of what happens, it becomes clear that he has no connection to the Origami murders.|$|E
25|$|Three {{days prior}} to Collins' July 30 arrest, in direct breach of a Washtenaw County Prosecutor order, two young Ann Arbor detectives {{had arrived at the}} Emmet Street {{apartment}} Collins shared with his roommate to <b>question</b> <b>him</b> as to the circumstantial evidence then-obtained against him. Collins had protested his innocence on this occasion, and insisted the eyewitnesses' identifications of him had been erroneous, although he refused to return to the police station to take a polygraph test. No search warrant had been sought prior to Collins being questioned on this date, and his apartment would only be searched on July 30—two days after Arnold Davis had observed Collins hurriedly remove a box of women's clothing and jewelry from his apartment.|$|E
