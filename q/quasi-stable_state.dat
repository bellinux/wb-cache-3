50|$|Starting {{with the}} 1980s BEC {{has become a}} subject of current {{interest}} in high-energy physics and at present meetings entirely dedicated to this subject take place. One reason for this interest {{is the fact that}} BEC are up to now the only method for the determination of sizes and lifetimes of sources of elementary particles. This is of particular interest for the ongoing search of quark matter in the laboratory: To reach this phase of matter a critical energy density is necessary. To measure this energy density one must determine the volume of the fireball in which this matter is supposed to have been generated and this means the determination {{of the size of the}} source; that can be achieved by the method of intensity interferometry. Furthermore, a phase of matter means a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state,</b> i.e. a state which lives longer than the duration of the collision that gave rise to this state. This means that we have to measure the lifetime of the new system, which can again be obtained by BEC only.|$|E
50|$|One {{proposed}} {{mechanism of}} a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time recurrent neural networks (CTRNNs). By {{focusing on the}} output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron Central pattern generator (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking. This CPG contains three motor neurons to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate torque in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either off or on most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.|$|E
40|$|International audienceMetastability is a {{property}} of systems composed of many interacting parts wherein the parts exhibit simultaneously {{a tendency to}} function autonomously (local segregation) and a tendency to cooperate (global integration). We study anisotropically coupled map lattices and discover that for specific values of the coupling control parameters the entire system transits to a metastable regime. We show that this regime manifests a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> in which the system can flexibly switch to another such state. We briefly discuss the relevance of our findings for information processing, functional integration, metastability in the brain, and phase transitions in complex systems...|$|E

Using a two-dimensional coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation model and a variational method, we theoretically derived the vortex soliton solution. Under an appropriate parametric setting, the derived vortex soliton radius was found to oscillate periodically.

Prior to growth phase onset, the interplanetary magnetic field is predominantly northward. In this case, both the transverse currents in the magnetotail and the ring current are weak, and the geomagnetic field is nearly dipolar {{not only in the}} inner magnetosphere, but also at considerable distances from the Earth.|$|R

The {{effect of the}} velocity and relative humidity of wet air and {{the temperature of the}} cold surface on frost forming process is discussed in length. The calculation results indicate that interfacial and inner sublimation jointly contribute to frost forming process. Higher velocity, higher relative humidity and lower the cold surface temperature correspond faster frosting. There is a critical point on the increment of frost density, after which deeper frosting dose not necessarily lead to acceleration of heat transfer deterioration therein. ...|$|E

It is found that lysozyme unfolds in a two-stage process with the initial formation a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> in which significant rearrangement of the secondary structure takes place.

40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} about a fully self-consistent N-body simulation of a sample of four massive globular clusters in close interaction within the central region of a galaxy. The N-body representation (with N= 1. 5 × 106 particles in total) of both the clusters and the galaxy allows to include in a natural and self-consistent way dynamical friction and tidal interactions. The results confirm the decay and merging of globulars as a viable scenario for the formation/accretion of compact nuclear clusters. Specifically: i) the frictional orbital decay is ˜ 2 times faster than that predicted by the generalized Chandrasekhar formula; ii) the progenitor clusters merge in less than 20 galactic core-crossing time (t_b); iii) the NC configuration keeps a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> at least within ˜ 70 t_b...|$|E

In statistical physics, phase transition refers to the existence of multiple equilibrium distributions in a graphical model of infinite size. In a finite, pre-limit graphical model, a phase transition typically manifests itself {{in the form of a}} unique equilibrium distribution that has multi-modal nature.

40|$|Helium atoms, {{introduced}} into materials by helium plasma or {{generated by the}} (n, α) nuclear reaction, have a strong tendency to accumulate at trapping sites such as vacancy clusters and dislocations. In this paper, the effects of dislocations, single vacancies and vacancy clusters on the retention and desorption of helium atoms in nickel were studied. Low energy (0. 1 – 0. 15 keV) helium atoms were implanted in nickel with vacancies or dislocations without causing any displacement damage. He atoms, interstitial-type dislocation loops, and vacancy clusters were also introduced with irradiation damage by 5. 0 keV helium ions. Helium thermal desorption peaks from dislocations, helium-vacancy clusters and helium bubbles were obtained by thermal desorption spectroscopy at 940 K, {{in the range from}} 900 to 1370 K, and at 1500 K, respectively. In addition, a thermally <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> was found for helium-vacancy clusters...|$|E

The time {{evolution of the}} cooperation level is highly complex containing spikes and steps between quasi-stable levels. A statistical characterization of the <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>states</b> and {{a study of the}} mechanisms behind the steps are given. We argue that the crucial structural ingredients causing the observed behavior is an inhomogeneous degree distribution and that the connections within vertices of highest degree are rather sparse.

40|$|Soliton explosions {{are among}} the most exotic {{dissipative}} phenomena studied in mode-locked lasers. In this regime, a dissipative soliton circulating in the laser cavity experiences an abrupt structural collapse, but within a few roundtrips returns to its original <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state.</b> In this work we report on the first observation of such events in a fiber laser. Specifically, we identify clear explosion signatures in measurements of shot-to-shot spectra of an Yb-doped mode-locked fiber laser that is operating in a transition regime between stable and noise-like emission. The comparatively long, all-normal-dispersion cavity used in our experiments also permits direct time-domain measurements, and we show that the explosions manifest themselves as abrupt temporal shifts in the output pulse train. Our experimental results are in good agreement with realistic numerical simulations based on an iterative cavity map. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, submitte...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the solar wind-magnetosphere {{interaction}} using a 3 -D electromagnetic particle code. The results for an unmagnetized solar wind plasma streaming past a dipole magnetic field show {{the formation of a}} magnetopause and a magnetotail, the penetration of energetic particles into cusps and radiation belt and dawn-dusk asymmetries. The effects of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) have been investigated in a similar way as done by MHD simulations. The simulation results with a southward IMF show the shrunk magnetosphere with great particle entry into the cusps and nightside magnetosphere. This is a signature of a magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause. After a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> is established with an unmagnetized solar wind we switched on a solar wind with an northward IMF. In this case the significant changes take place in the magnetotail. The waving motion was seen in the magnetotail and its length was shortened. This phenomena are consistent with the reconnections which occur at the high latitude magnetopause. In our simulations kinetic effects will determine the self-consistent anomalous resistivity in the magnetopause that causes reconnections...|$|E
40|$|We {{carry out}} {{two-dimensional}} global particle-in-cell simulations {{of the interaction}} between the solar wind and a dipole field to study the formation of the bow shock and magnetosphere. A self-reforming bow shock ahead of a dipole field is presented by using relatively high temporal-spatial resolutions. We find that (1) the bow shock and the magnetosphere are formed and reach a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> after several ion cyclotron periods, and (2) under the Bz southward solar wind condition the bow shock undergoes a self-reformation for low e̱ṯa̱i and high MA. Simultaneously, a magnetic reconnection in the magnetotail is found. For high e̱ṯa̱i and low MA, the shock becomes quasi-stationary, and the magnetotail reconnection disappears. In addition, (3) the magnetopause deflects the magnetosheath plasmas. The sheath particles injected at the quasi-perpendicular region of the bow shock can be convected to downstream of an oblique shock region. A fraction of these sheath particles can leak out from the magnetosheath at the wings of the bow shock. Hence, the downstream situation is more complicated than that for a planar shock produced in local simulations. Comment: in ApJS, 201...|$|E

40|$|We study {{dynamics}} of flat directions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model taking account of its constituent fields. It is {{found that there}} exist new instabilities due to the D-term potential {{and the nature of}} these instabilities depends on the eccentricity of the orbit. For a roughly circular orbit, it is similar to narrow-band resonance described by the Mathieu equation. For an elliptic orbit, the instabilities exhibit tachyonic nature. In the narrow-band regime, we show that the existence of the instabilities is crucial to the formation of $Q$-balls. The $Q$-ball formation proceeds through <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> called ``$I$-ball''. The transition from $I$-balls to $Q$-balls is made efficient by the $D$-term instability and during this process some fraction of the charge of the $Q$-ball is emitted. This discovery may revive the scenario which relates the baryon number and dark matter density of the universe. Furthermore, the tachyonic $D$-term instability causes the drastic decay of the flat direction moving in an orbit with relatively large eccentricity. Thus the evolution of flat directions is completely altered by the appearance of this instability. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{evolution of}} initially Gaussian eddies is studied in a reduced-gravity shallow-water model using both linear and nonlinear quasigeostrophic theory {{in an attempt}} to understand westward-propagating mesoscale eddies observed and tracked by satellite altimetry. By examining both isolated eddies and a large basin seeded with eddies with statistical characteristics consistent with those of observed eddies, it is shown that long-term eddy coherence and the zonal wavenumber–frequency power spectral density are best matched by the nonlinear model. Individual characteristics of the eddies including amplitude decay, horizontal length scale decay, and zonal and meridional propagation speed of a previously unrecognized <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> are examined. The results show that the meridional deflections from purely westward flow (poleward for cyclones and equatorward for anticyclones) are consistent with satellite observations. Examination of the fluid transport properties of the eddies shows that an inner core of the eddy, defined by the zero relative vorticity contour, contains only fluid from the eddy origin, whereas a surrounding outer ring contains a mixture of ambient fluid from throughout the eddy’s lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Particle {{detector}} models {{allow to}} give an operational definition to the particle content of a given quantum state of a field theory. The commonly adopted Unruh-DeWitt type of detector is known to undergo temporary transitions to excited states even when at rest and in the Minkowski vacuum. We argue that real detectors do not feature this property, as the configuration "detector in its ground state + vacuum of the field" is generally a stable bound state of the underlying fundamental theory (e. g. the ground state-hydrogen atom in a suitable QED with electrons and protons) in the non-accelerated case. As a concrete example, we study a local relativistic field theory where a stable particle can capture a light quantum and form a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state.</b> As expected, to such a stable particle correspond energy eigenstates of the full theory, as is shown explicitly by using a dressed particle formalism at first order in perturbation theory. We derive an effective model of detector (at rest) where the stable particle and the quasi-stable configurations correspond to the two internal levels, "ground" and "excited", of the detector.

40|$|A mystery {{about the}} origins of life is which {{molecular}} structures $-$ and what spontaneous processes $-$ drove the autocatalytic transition from simple chemistry to biology? Using the HP lattice model of polymer sequence spaces leads to the prediction that random sequences of hydrophobic ($H$) and polar ($P$) monomers can collapse into relatively compact structures, exposing hydrophobic surfaces, acting as primitive versions of today's protein catalysts, elongating other such HP polymers, as ribosomes would now do. Such foldamer-catalysts form an autocatalytic set, growing short chains into longer chains that have particular sequences. The system has capacity for the multimodality: ability to settle at multiple distinct <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>states</b> characterized by different groups of dominating polymers.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a flame and vortices {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} front-tracking method. Extending previous studies on the role of hydrodynamic (Darrieus-Landau) instability in the wrinkling of flame surface at the incipient stage, we have further investigated the flame dynamics in the course of long-time evolution when interactions between the flame front, the instability, and the vortical flow result in highly convoluted flame configurations. It is shown that, with the inherent mechanisms of merging and dividing of flame cells at multiple scales that are generated by the hydrodynamic instability, propagation of flame wrinkles can evolve to a <b>quasi-stable</b> <b>state</b> characterized by a solitary wave or cha-otic motion associated with corrugated front. If the vortical flow is sufficiently strong, however, the flame geometry is contorted by the vortices while the effect of hydrodynamic instability degenerates.
