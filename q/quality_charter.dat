5000|$|The Success and Opportunity through <b>Quality</b> <b>Charter</b> Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress) was {{introduced}} into the United States House of Representatives on April 1, 2014 and passed in the House on May 7, 2014. The Center for Education Reform was critical of the bill, cautioning that [...] "it {{is nothing more than}} a natural progression of the federal government becoming too involved in charter school policy. The organization argued that [...] "the federal government is taking too much of a direct role in defining 'quality' and 'high performance' charter schools," [...] taking away power from the states to make their own decisions about what charter schools qualify for grants. They argued that this takes away the autonomy and innovation that define charter schools, discounts parental choices about schools, and, due to the formulaic nature of these evaluations, discourages charter management organizations from taking over failing schools (since the failing school will hurt their scores).|$|E
5000|$|Jacobs was {{appointed}} in 1996 to the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. She was reappointed to this position in 2000 and served until 2008. Jacobs is credited {{as one of}} the prime architects for reform of Louisiana's Public Schools throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade), including developing and implementing the number one ranked school accountability system in the country and implementing major steps to improve teacher quality. According to the 2009 Education Watch Report released by the Education Trust, Louisiana is the only state in which the gap between African American and white students has narrowed significantly in both 4th grade reading and 8th grade math. As part of Louisiana's school accountability system, Ms Jacobs was instrumental in creating the Recovery School District (RSD) in 2003. The RSD is administered by the Department of Education and is designed to take over academically failing schools. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, Orleans Parish Schools were the worst performing in the state. 63% of the Parish's schools were failing. [...] After Hurricane Katrina, Jacobs worked with Governor Blanco and State Superintendent Cecil Picard to place most of the Orleans public schools into the Recovery School District and to recruit high <b>quality</b> <b>charter</b> operators, like the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP), to come to New Orleans and be part of the rebuilding. Today, New Orleans has the largest percentage of public school students in charter schools in the nation (78%). Student performance has improved significantly in all measures: performance on state tests, reduction in the drop out rate and percentage of seniors qualifying for Louisiana's merit based scholarship program.|$|E

40|$|Charter {{schools have}} become a very popular {{instrument}} for reforming public schools, because they expand choices, facilitate local innovation, and provide incentives for the regular public schools while remaining under public control. Despite their conceptual appeal, evaluating their performance has been hindered by the selective nature of their student populations. This paper investigates the <b>quality</b> of <b>charter</b> schools in Texas in terms of mathematics and reading achievement and finds that, after an initial start-up period, average school <b>quality</b> in the <b>charter</b> sector is {{not significantly different from}} that in regular public schools. Perhaps most important, the parental decision to exit a charter school is much more sensitive to education quality than the decision to exit a regular public school, consistent with the notion that the introduction of charter schools substantially reduces the transactions costs of switching schools. Low income charter school families are, however, less sensitive to school quality than higher income families. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{circular}} dated 9 December 2008 {{issued by}} the Ministry of Ecology and concerning {{the creation of an}} evaluation <b>quality</b> <b>charter</b> had two objectives. On the one hand, it recommended an analysis of the risks associated with each studied impact through a multi-criteria study. The text formulated an evaluation of the projects and their variants. It was based on a comparison between their social impacts (employment, vulnerable groups, accessibility, social mix, etc.), environmental impacts (climate, pollution, noise, etc.) and economic impacts (on households and companies, cost, competitiveness, etc.). However, for the time being there is no standard method able to evaluate all these impacts. Nor does the circular specify how to evaluate the risks.|$|E

Ranging from the simple popularisation of medical facts to institutional sites, including sites for associations of patients and professionals, sites freely available or requiring a free or paid-for access code, medical Net is growing fast. Ranking these information sources is difficult because most of these sites present several of the above characteristics. For example, many of the sites originally intended for healthcare professionals are easily viewed by the public, where scientific articles can be readily found but which cannot be exploited by the layperson. In order to reduce the problems linked to the quality of information found on the internet, the Health ON the Net (HON) Foundation established a <b>quality</b> <b>charter,</b> the Hon Code, for health sites.

In September 2006 the IQA was finally awarded a Royal Charter and commenced operating as the <b>Chartered</b> <b>Quality</b> Institute on 1 January 2007.

50|$|Charter schools {{showed a}} {{significantly}} greater variation in quality between states and within states. For example, Arizona charter school students had a 29-day disadvantage in math compared to public school students but charter school students in D.C. had a 105-day advantage over their peers in public schools. While the obvious solution to the widely varying <b>quality</b> of <b>charter</b> schools would be to close those that perform {{below the level of}} public schools, this is hard to accomplish in practice as even a poor school has its supporters.|$|R

In combination, they could do even more to improve the odds for our nation's most vulnerable youngsters. But current policy and practice in many states limit the ability of charter schools to offer state-funded pre-K programs. Even though most states {{use a variety of}} providers to offer pre-K [...] including public schools, Head Start programs, community-based child care centers, and for-profit and faith-based preschools [...] charter schools are often not among them. In this report, the National Alliance teamed up with the Thomas B.

3000|$|The European Union, {{from its}} {{creation}} as the, {{has had a}} strong tradition of market intervention. In the arena of transport it has previously used directives, which have force of law in all member states, to define air passenger rights in the Passengers Charter for Air Travel: “establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers {{in the event of}} denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights” [17]. In the area of rail freight, the EU began a process towards mandatory quality standards, such as the UIC -Freight Department [37]) authored: “Guide: Quality of rail freight transport”. Also, the European Commission proposal for a regulation of compensation, in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services, eventually led, in 2003, to the industry-led UIC/CER/CIT Freight <b>Quality</b> <b>Charter</b> [9]. Notably, in the latter case, the leading rail client organisation, the International Union of combined Road-Rail transport companies (UIRR), began as supportive of market intervention, but moved to a more liberal position as time progressed. Similarly, the European Commission, transitioning from an interventionist stance, in the 2001 White Paper on Transport [16], to the more laissez-faire approach of the 2006 mid term review [15], looked to researchers to answer the question: “To what extent are specialised, international standards useful for the quality performance of freight logistics in Europe?” [...]...|$|E
