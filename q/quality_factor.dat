Underdamped systems combine {{oscillation}} at a specific frequency with a decay of the amplitude of the signal. Underdamped systems with a low <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> (a little above Q =nbsp&) may oscillate only once or a few times before dying out. As the <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> increases, the relative amount of damping decreases. A high-quality bell rings with a single pure tone {{for a very long time}} after being struck. A purely oscillatory system, such as a bell that rings forever, has an infinite <b>quality</b> <b>factor.</b> More generally, the output of a second-order low-pass filter with a very high <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> responds to a step input by quickly rising above, oscillating around, and eventually converging to a steady-state value.|$|E

25|$|A {{system with}} low <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> (Q<nbsp&) {{is said to}} be overdamped. Such a system doesn't {{oscillate}} at all, but when displaced from its equilibrium steady-state output it returns to it by exponential decay, approaching the steady state value asymptotically. It has an impulse response that is the sum of two decaying exponential functions with different rates of decay. As the <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> decreases the slower decay mode becomes stronger relative to the faster mode and dominates the system's response resulting in a slower system. A second-order low-pass filter with a very low <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> has a nearly first-order step response; the system's output responds to a step input by slowly rising toward an asymptote.|$|E

40|$|Our {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek an {{understanding}} of which service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> that affects customers in their decision making progress regarding purchasing financial services such as pension products. We also seek to evaluate the different service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> by compare their relative strength against each other. The study aim to investigate if there are any connections between customer behavior variables such as gender, age and income in comparison to these service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> related to pension products. The findings aim to help a small financial institute such as our case company Plain Capital to understand how their customers experience service quality regarding pension products. In order to find empirical results we conducted a qualitative research as well a quantitative research. The qualitative research employed both a focus group interview with pension savers and an interview with our case company Plain Capital. We were able to identify the service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> for pension’s products with help from the focus group interview. The quantitative research employed a visited survey, which measure connections between customer behavior variables such as gender, age and income in comparison to these service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> related to pension products. The qualitative endings show that the service quality experience regarding pension products is based on eight service <b>quality</b> <b>factors.</b> The eight service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> identified in this study are physical environment, Webb environment, phone environment, financial performance, pension advising, level of individualization, characteristics of financial advisors and level of feedback. The quantitative findings show that characteristics of financial advisors are the one with the highest average out of the eight service <b>quality</b> <b>factors,</b> followed by level of individualization and Webb environment. The hypotheses tests show that there are four significant connections between the eight service <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> and consumer behavior variables. This study identifies eight service factors that together represent the total service quality for pension products in Sweden. The financial institutions that offer pension products can, by improving these eight service <b>quality</b> <b>factors,</b> increase their customers perceived service quality. The finding of this study shows that small and local companies like our case company Plain Capital should focus on their characteristics of financial advisors to build a long term customer relations, increase their individualization in their offers depending of gender and level of income and finally increase their quality of their Webb environment in order to expand in new geographical locations...|$|R

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} mechanical resonators {{have attracted}} considerable interest {{because of their}} small mass, the high quality of their surface, and the pristine electronic states they host. However, their small dimensions result in fragile vibrational states {{that are difficult to}} measure. Here we observe <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> Q as high as 5 × 10 ^ 6 in ultra-clean nanotube resonators at a cryostat temperature of 30 mK, where we define Q as the ratio of the resonant frequency over the linewidth. Measuring such high <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> requires both employing an ultra-low noise method to detect minuscule vibrations rapidly, and carefully reducing the noise of the electrostatic environment. We observe that the measured <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> fluctuate because of fluctuations of the resonant frequency. The <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> we measure are record high; they are comparable to the highest Q reported in mechanical resonators of much larger size, a remarkable result considering that reducing the size of resonators is usually concomitant with decreasing <b>quality</b> <b>factors.</b> The combination of ultra-low size and very large Q offers new opportunities for ultra-sensitive detection schemes and quantum optomechanical experiments.

25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a safety margin against overshoot.|$|E
25|$|For this system, when Q> (i.e., {{when the}} system is underdamped), it has two complex {{conjugate}} poles that each have a real part of −α. That is, the attenuation parameter α represents the rate of exponential decay of the oscillations (that is, of the output after an impulse) into the system. A higher <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> implies a lower attenuation rate, and so high-Q systems oscillate for many cycles. For example, high-quality bells have an approximately pure sinusoidal tone {{for a long time}} after being struck by a hammer.|$|E
25|$|A nanophotonic {{resonator}} or nanocavity is {{an optical}} cavity {{which is on}} the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. Optical cavities are a major component of all lasers, they are responsible for providing amplification of a light source via positive feedback, a process known as amplified spontaneous emission or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower lasing threshold provided the <b>quality</b> <b>factor</b> of the resonator is high. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold.|$|E
40|$|Definitions of {{software}} quality {{have focused on}} software product <b>quality</b> <b>factors.</b> <b>Quality</b> that focuses on product quality is referred to by Kaoru Ishikawa as a narrow view of quality and he suggests that a broader more embracing and inclusive view is really necessary. The requirements of successful E-Commerce Web sites demonstrate this view. While the site might be considered as the product, Web site producers, owners and visitors also have a “quality” requirement. This broader view gives rises {{to the need to}} research and understand quality-of-development, quality-of-ownership, quality-of-engagement as well as quality-of-product. From the quality-of-product perspective, while many of the well established and understood software <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> of McCall and Boehm still apply in this new domain, they need to be reinterpreted and they are no longer a complete set.

The study rests on the following objectives: to identify <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> available in secondary schools that affect academic performance of students and to examine the role of <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> on academic performance of students in secondary schools in Tanga. Finally, the study was aimed to establish <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> strategies the schools need {{to put in place}} to realize good students’ academic performance in secondary schools. Data collection methods comprised interviews, focus group discussion and documentary review. The data collected were analysed thematically. The findings of the studyrevealed various <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> were available in secondary school, poor school infrastructures, shortage of curriculum materials and shortage of science teachers. Some of the reasons which account for this disparity are such as lack of fund, political influence, poverty, lack of strong school board to monitor implementation and lack of education and awareness to parents. The <b>quality</b> <b>factors</b> have the role to play in providing good education to children. However, most of the schools lacked important infrastructure such as library and laboratories which were not finished and many buildings were poorly built and uncompleted. Also,regardless of the teaching and learning to be poor caused by lack of necessary materials, quality in school could be improved through these strategies; building infrastructure, school inspection, self-assessment, teaching and learning materials, teachers ratio, parents’ participation as well as the in service training.
