5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a single seat.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry into}} the {{disaster}} opened on 2 January 1914 with Richard Redmayne, the Chief Inspector of Mines, as the commissioner; he was assisted by two assessors, Evan Williams, {{the chairman of the}} South Wales and Monmouthshire Coal Owners Association, and Robert Smillie, the president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. The inquiry ran for three days before being adjourned to allow for the coroner's inquest to run at Senghenydd. It reopened on 27 January and ran until 21 February. Over the 13 days it heard evidence, 21,837 <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> put to 50 witnesses. The coroner's inquest chaired by David Rees lasted for 5 days from 5 January 1914. A total of 9,000 <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> put to 50 witnesses, and the jury returned verdicts of accidental death.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing from}} Whitlam, Kerr called Fraser. According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him whether}} he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister. According to Kerr, Fraser was supposed to come to Yarralumla at 1.00pm.|$|E

50|$|The multiple-choice {{questions}} {{within each}} {{section of the}} CPA Exam are administered in three blocks, called testlets. Each testlet contains operational and pretest <b>questions.</b> Operational <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> scored, while pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> not scored. Instead, a candidate’s response to a pretest <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{used to evaluate the}} question’s statistical performance. A majority of the <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> operational questions; however, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> mixed into the exam and are not identified as pretest questions. From the candidate’s perspective, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> indistinguishable from operational questions. Pretest questions that meet certain statistical criteria are used as operational questions on future exams. This strategy for pretesting <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> common practice in high-stakes testing.|$|R

5|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the annual Scotland v England fixture in 1989, <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised as to whether Scottish football required a separate national stadium. Rangers proposed Ibrox as an alternative venue, while Murrayfield {{was about to be}} redeveloped without public funding. None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation, and the situation was so bad that <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice. <b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> raised at the time about the ability of the train and tunnel electronics to withstand the mix of snow, salt and ice which collect in the tunnels during periods of extreme cold.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the speech}} were {{published}} the next day by the radical Daily News (founded in 1846 by Charles Dickens), and <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised in the House of Commons, particularly by Sir Frederick Banbury, a Conservative MP and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending vivisection demonstrations. Bayliss demanded a public apology, and when by 12 May it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised about the {{fairness}} and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case {{turned it into a}} cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> {{addressed}} to the portfolio of the Minister receiving the question, and the questioner must ask the question as written. Once a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked, supplementary <b>questions</b> can <b>be</b> asked.|$|R
50|$|In New Zealand oral <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{asked at}} 2pm on each sitting day.

The opportunity to ask <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> equally shared amongst {{the members of the}} house, excluding ministers. Urgent <b>Questions,</b> while possible, <b>are</b> uncommon.|$|R
30|$|Will the new NQS really measure FDC {{quality or}} does it measure how the scheme ‘monitors’ quality in each {{residence}} by assuming all residences are the same? These two <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> quite different — the first <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a validity issue related to measuring quality and the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> an evaluation of how the NQS is operating in FDC schemes. Indeed, the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not really about a measuring quality.|$|R
5|$|For {{many years}} after his death, Scott's status as tragic hero was unchallenged, and few <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked {{about the causes of}} the {{disaster}} which overcame his polar party. In the final quarter of the 20th century the expedition came under closer scrutiny, and more critical views were expressed about its organization and management. The degree of Scott's personal culpability, and more recently, the culpability of certain expedition members, remain controversial.|$|E
5|$|In February 2008, a {{cease and desist}} {{was given}} to a writer at CC2K.us after they posted an advance script review for the film. The Latino Review also posted an advance review. At the time CC2K.us {{received}} their cease and desist order, <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised why Latino Review's largely positive script review was allowed to stay posted while CC2K was being forced by Fox Searchlight to remove their mainly negative coverage. Although Latino Review was later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.|$|E
5|$|In {{the primary}} ballot, voters agreed {{to divide the}} 35th ward into seven wards, {{accounting}} for the increased settlement in the city's Northeast section that made the ward extremely populous. The action brought {{the total number of}} wards to 58. The measure had support from both parties and passed overwhelmingly. In the general election, two loans <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> on the ballot: $16 million for general municipal improvements, and $10 million for water and sewer systems. Both measures passed.|$|E

50|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>are</b> {{of three}} types—Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one {{to which a}} member desires an oral answer in the House and which is {{distinguished}} by an asterisk mark. An unstarred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one which is not called for oral answer {{in the house and}} on which no supplementary <b>questions</b> can consequently <b>be</b> asked. An answer to such a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> given in writing. Minimum period of notice for starred/ unstarred <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 10 clear days. If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker, they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which {{the subject matter of the}} question pertains.|$|R
5|$|Once the Convention had {{finished}} amending {{the first draft}} from the Committee of Detail, {{a new set of}} unresolved <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> sent to several different committees for resolution. The Committee of Detail was considering several questions related to habeas corpus, freedom of the press, and an executive council to advise the president. Two committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the assumption of war debts.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years after the system opened.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several of these <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E

5|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>were</b> {{asked in}} the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most of these <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E
5|$|The foot-and-mouth scare of 2001 {{forced the}} zoo to close {{to protect the}} animals from {{possible}} infection.

50|$|Yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{formed in}} various ways in various languages. In English, a special word order (verb-subject-object) is used to form yes-no questions.

In Latin, yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{indicated}} {{by the addition of}} a special grammatical particle or an enclitic. In some languages, such as in Modern Greek, Portuguese, and the Jakaltek language, the only way to distinguish a yes-no question from a simple declarative statement <b>is</b> the rising <b>question</b> intonation used when saying the <b>question.</b> (Such <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> labelled declarative <b>questions</b> and <b>are</b> also available as an option in those languages that have other ways of asking yes-no questions.)
