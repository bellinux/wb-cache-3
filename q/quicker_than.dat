5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} comply with special UK legislation, there are full {{security}} checks similar to those at airports, scanning both bags and people's pockets. Security checks at Eurostar are comparable to those at a small airport and generally much <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> at London Heathrow.

5|$|The game {{introduces}} a fast travel system, allowing Batman to remotely summon his plane (the Batwing) to transport him {{to other areas}} of the game world <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> gliding or grappling could. Enemy tower installations prevent Batman from summoning the craft in some areas, and must be disabled to make the Batwing (not player-controlled) available. Some towers may be disabled only when the player has the necessary equipment.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{received}} a call-up {{to the full}} England squad and won his first cap on 27 March 1996 as a substitute in a friendly against Bulgaria. His first start at international level was against Croatia which was the England game following his substitute appearance. Fowler {{was part of the}} England squad for Euro 1996, making two appearances in the tournament. On 14 December 1996, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the race: {{the first was}} held on Friday morning and the second on Friday afternoon. Both sessions lasted 90minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. All three sessions were affected by rain, with only the second giving teams any chance to run dry-weather tyres. Adrian Sutil was quickest {{with a time of}} 1:32.842 in the first session, more than half a second <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> the next fastest drivers Rubens Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella. Timo Glock was the next quickest, almost fourseconds behind Sutil. Conditions were so poor that sixdrivers, including both McLarens, failed to set times. The session was stopped fourminutes early, though by that time no cars had entered the track for at least tenminutes. The track dried out in the second session; Räikkönen adapted best to the changed conditions with a lap of 1:23.861, significantly <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> his morning time. Kubica was the next fastest, with his BMW teammate Heidfeld in third. Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Massa rounded out the top six. Glock was fastest in the final session with a time of 1:35.464, followed by Sebastian Vettel, Rosberg, Jarno Trulli, Kazuki Nakajima and Heidfeld. Hamilton only completed eightlaps, and finished last with a time almost 11seconds behind Glock.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{distinction}} sometimes made {{is between}} <b>quick</b> (more <b>than</b> 50 {{and less than}} 80 flashes per minute), very <b>quick</b> (more <b>than</b> 80 and less than 160 flashes per minutes, abbreviated [...] "V.Q") and ultra <b>quick</b> (no less <b>than</b> 160 flashes per minute, abbreviate [...] "U.Q"). This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q. for interrupted ultra quick, or grouping, e.g. V.Q.(9) for a very quick group of nine flashes. Quick characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. V.Q.(6)+L.Fl. for a very quick group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} 1420, vessels from Bristol were {{regularly}} travelling to Iceland {{and it is}} speculated that sailors from Bristol had made landfall in the Americas before Christopher Columbus or John Cabot. After Cabot arrived in Bristol, he proposed a scheme to the king, Henry VII, in which he proposed to reach Asia by sailing west across the north Atlantic. He estimated {{that this would be}} shorter and <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> Columbus' southerly route. The merchants of Bristol, operating under the name of the Society of Merchant Venturers, agreed to support his scheme. They had sponsored probes into the north Atlantic from the early 1480s, looking for possible trading opportunities. In 1552 Edward VI granted a Royal Charter to the Merchant Venturers to manage the port.|$|E
5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E
5|$|Atala-Dunlop's Luigi Ganna {{abandoned}} the race during the fifth stage due to injuries {{suffered from a}} crash during the fourth stage before it was cancelled. Galetti won the fifth leg, but with the placings on the stage, Peugeot took the race lead from Atala-Dunlop. Rain marred {{the start of the}} sixth stage at 6:40 local time, as well as most of the stage itself. A group of sixteen riders formed {{at the front of the}} race and was later reduced to ten before passing through Lucca. Lauro Bordin of the Gerbi team attacked and went on to ride solo, reaching the checkpoint in Spezia fifteen minutes <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> Azzini, Cocchi, and Agostoni. Bordin reached the finish first, eighteen minutes ahead of the second-place finisher.|$|E

Logan then requested Sprot {{to keep out of}} Lady Home’s sight, lest she should ask questions, ‘for I had rather be eirdit <b>quick</b> <b>than</b> either my Lord or she knew anything of it.’ ...|$|R

50|$|Eeckhout {{does not}} merely copy the subjects; he also takes the shapes, the figures, the Jewish dress and the {{pictorial}} effects of his master. It {{is difficult to}} form an exact judgment of Eeckhout's qualities {{at the outset of}} his career. His earliest pieces are probably those in which he more faithfully reproduced Rembrandt's peculiarities. Exclusively his is a tinge of green in shadows marring the harmony of the work, a gaudiness of jarring tints, uniform surface and a touch more <b>quick</b> <b>than</b> subtle.|$|R
5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers were left to be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens {{for the first time in}} a qualifying that both drivers participated in. Joining them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} timed runs in Q2, Lewis Hamilton was seven-tenths {{of a second}} <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> {{teammate}} Rosberg, while the Ferrari cars split the pair to place provisional second and third. Nevertheless, both Mercedes drivers did not go out again. Sebastian Vettel set a second timed lap to improve his time, now {{a little more than}} a tenth behind Hamilton. Many drivers only set one timed lap towards the end of the session, with Pastor Maldonado, Felipe Nasr, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Daniil Kvyat unable to move on into Q3, while Ricciardo did not set a time, leaving him fifteenth for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Chanderpaul's debut came {{seven months}} after his first Test appearance, {{but he was not}} {{required}} to bat as the West Indies reached the target to beat India. He scored his maiden ODI century shortly after his first Test century, in May 1997 against India, scoring 109 runs. He reached his highest ODI score in 1999, making 150 runs during a West Indian record partnership of 226 with Carl Hooper, against South Africa. That innings, along with his score of 149 not out against India in 2007 are the only times he has finished a century innings with a strike rate of <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> a-run-a-ball in ODI cricket.|$|E

5|$|Louisville's {{second drive}} {{of the game}} was much <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> the Cardinals' first. After {{beginning}} at their own 20-yard line, it took the Cardinals just seven plays to travel 80yards and earn a touchdown. Louisville was helped throughout the drive by repeated Virginia Tech personal foul penalties. Tech players committed three separate 15-yard personal fouls during the drive, one of which came after Louisville's successful extra point kick when cornerback Jimmy Williams bumped a game official. Williams was ejected from the game for the contact and {{was removed from the}} field after watching the next series from the sidelines. The touchdown and extra point extended Louisville's first-quarter lead to 14–3.|$|E
5|$|Making his Summer Olympics debut, Yazaldes Nascimento {{qualified}} for the 2004 Athens Games as a wildcard, without competing in any notable sporting event. He competed on 21 August in Heat 1 against seven other athletes. He ran a time of 11.00 seconds, finishing last of the eight athletes competing. Singapore's Poh Seng Song placed ahead of him {{with a time of}} 10.75 seconds, in a heat led by Namibia's Frank Fredericks who posted a time of 10.12 seconds, 0.88 seconds <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> Nascimento's time. Out of 84 athletes, Nascimento ranked 67th and was 0.65 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the quarter-finals. Therefore, {{that was the end of}} his competition.|$|E
5|$|Nico Rosberg {{topped the}} {{timesheets}} on Friday, {{ahead of the}} two Red Bull cars of Daniil Kvyat and Daniel Ricciardo. The session started on a very wet track, but with no more rain falling, it dried out as the practice progressed, with drivers soon switching to intermediate tyres. Lewis Hamilton was fifth fastest, behind Carlos Sainz Jr.. Despite going off the track late in the session, Fernando Alonso was ninth fastest in the McLaren with the new power unit. A gearbox problem meant that Pastor Maldonado was unable {{to take to the}} track, while at Sauber, Raffaele Marciello replaced Felipe Nasr, ending the session three-tenths of a second <b>quicker</b> <b>than</b> teammate Marcus Ericsson.|$|E
