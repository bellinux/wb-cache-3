40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to compare}} and {{contrast}} the career experiences and development needs of British and Australian <b>quality</b> <b>managers.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The results of a postal survey of the careers of British <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> are compared with Australian <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> based on two surveys. Findings – The study finds that <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> in both countries brought wide functional experience to their roles. Their current jobs are major sources of intrinsic job satisfaction for both groups of managers but they utilise a very limited range of quality tools. Also British and Australian managers show little awareness {{in terms of their}} development needs for a broader background in quality. Practical implications – The findings suggest a worrying lack of innovatory zeal amongst <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> who appear to be more concerned with the maintenance of standards rather than taking a more dynamic approach. Thus it is argued that while <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> bring wide functional experience to their current roles, there are many who {{do not appear to be}} at the cutting edge of knowledge in their field. Neither do the British <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> in particular appear to be sufficiently aware of the need to address such shortfalls through professional development opportunities. Originality/value – The roles of those charged with carrying the flag of quality in the two countries have only previously received limited research coverage. This paper, based upon empirical research in Britain and Australia, identifies issues which require the attention of senior management to ensure future competitiveness for their organisations. <br /...|$|R

The <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> in both countries brought wide functional experience to their roles, with many coming in particular from production and operations and general management. In their current roles major sources of job satisfaction for managers in both countries were improving efficiency and problem solving, whereas aspects of employee relations {{was a source of}} least satisfaction. Both groups of <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> utilised a very limited range of quality tools, the most popular being brainstorming, control charts and Pareto analysis, with virtually no mention of more sophisticated tools like Six sigma, which is in stark contrast to American managers. Also British and Australian managers showed little awareness in terms of their development needs for a broader background in quality, which could disadvantage their companies in global markets. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This project's {{aim is to}} {{identify}} the training and management development needs of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers.</b> Training {{is regarded as a}} very significant factor in the improvement of quality in organisations, once commitment has been achieved. The project explored whether Quality training was objectively, systematically, and continuously performed in Australia, and i f so, by whom. Using a combination of questionnaire and case studies, the aim of the research was to examine whether the training needs of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> in Australia were being realised. The study included Australian quality practitioners and professional associations. Questions asked of <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers</b> included: what personal and professional management development training they have had in the past 5 years; what training programs have they provided for others in that period; what current programs are in progress, if any; how effective were their newly acquired skills; and what do they consider to be their needs and the needs of the organisation, for future development. Further, a number of quality management professional associations were contacted regarding their training and management development programs for <b>Quality</b> <b>Managers.</b> Questions of interest included: what do they offer; how do they determine the needs of their members; who provides these programs; how do they communicate these programs to their members; how do they communicate these programs to their members; how do they evaluate the success or otherwise of their programs; and by what process of evaluation do they determine future needs.

This paper also aims to analyze the problems encountered by <b>quality</b> <b>managers</b> when implementing QMS, in particular the ISO 9000 series standards, and tries to find answers to these problems, all in connection with the final product and its lifecycle. The product lifecycle is analyzed from three points of view, which the author considers are the most important for <b>quality</b> <b>managers,</b> i. e. serviceability, IT/IS and total costs. The final purpose and objective of the research is to develop a methodology, based on the results from the empirical study, which can form a base for future ISO 9000 standards improvement and thus when applied will help the <b>quality</b> <b>managers,</b> by reducing the delays of implementation and thus increasing the quality of the product, in a faster and more productive way, in order to fulfill the continuously changing requirements of the customers and of the marke...|$|R
