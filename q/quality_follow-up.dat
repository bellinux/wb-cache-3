50|$|With the {{treatment}} summary, experts hope that survivors {{will be better}} equipped to face the significant burden of maintaining <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> care long after their original treatment. This {{is especially important for}} the AYA population, in particular, because they are typically facing major social changes regarding their relationship status, employment or education status, their insurance coverage, and even their place of residence, etc. Typically, most of these factors are pretty constant for the adult population and if they experience any changes, it would occur in one or two aspects of their life. However, with the AYA population, the period of time until they are 40 is when they are going to, {{for the majority of the}} population, undergo the most change. This reality underscores the importance of a smooth transition from child-centered to adult-focused health care services through which they are consistently managed.|$|E

While loneliness {{may be difficult to}} intervene upon, there may be correlated factors, which, if alleviated, could mitigate the effects of {{loneliness and}} sleep quality on health in late life. Design A longitudinal, observational study whereby we gathered predictive variables at baseline and dependent variable (sleep) at follow-up. Method We investigated the relationship between loneliness at baseline and sleep <b>quality</b> at <b>follow-up</b> in a group of 447 older adults attending the clinic for research participation. Loneliness, stress and sleep quality were all measured using self-report validated psychometric tools. Results We found that loneliness, specifically emotional loneliness, predicted sleep <b>quality</b> at <b>follow-up,</b> controlling for demographic factors and for sleep quality at baseline. Upon applying mediation methods to the data, we then found that this relationship was mediated in part by perceived stress. Conclusion We conclude that the impact of emotional loneliness on sleep quality in older adults is partly because of the stress experienced as a result of feeling lonely. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Loneliness is associated with poor sleep quality. Perceived stress is also associated with poor sleep quality. Sleep quality is a significant issue among older adults. What does this study add?

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence for the {{efficacy}} of late effects surveillance in adult cancer survivors is lacking {{and there is little}} agreement among clinicians on appropriate follow-up care. METHODS: We report the views of both cancer experts and general practitioners (GPs) on long-term follow-up provision for cancer survivors, focussing on the 18 – 45 years age group. A total of 421 cancer experts (36 % haematologists, 33 % oncologists, 18 % surgeons, 10 % nurses, 2 % other) and 54 GPs responded to a structured online survey. Reasons for follow-up care (clinical or supportive); advantages and disadvantages of follow-up in primary care; current practice; and resources required for a <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> service were assessed. RESULTS: Clinicians valued clinical reasons for follow-up more highly than supportive reasons (Po 0. 001). Learning more about late effects and checking for cancer recurrence were rated as the most important reasons for follow-up by cancer experts and GPs. A total of 85 % of cancer specialists hold follow-up consultations alongside patients on active treatment. Cancer experts agreed that primary care follow-up would increase their availability for acute oncological care, but reduce information on late effects. The most important resource to provide a <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> service was specialist nursing support (91 %).

40|$|The now 19 {{universities}} in Ontario (Canada) have {{been blessed with}} a self-regulated program-oriented quality assurance process since 1982 (Leyton-Brown, 2004), which has been described and discussed in detail elsewhere (Filteau, 2003). In brief, the process requires that each graduate program present a common-content self-study every seven years to an Appraisals Committee (a committee of ‘peers’) of the Ontario Council on Graduate Studies. This committee then recommends (to OCGS), {{on the basis of}} external consultant site visit reports, and their own reading of the self-study, whether a program should continue, and, if necessary, what might be done to improve its <b>quality.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> reports are often required.

A Nuclear Fuel Element for Research Reactors usually consists of 18 to 22 of these plates, positioned in parallel, in an arrangement of 8 x 7 cm. Carrying out the inspection of the digitalized x-ray image, the neural network detects regions with different luminous densities corresponding to U-densities in the fuel plate.

30|$|We also seek {{to share}} the key {{challenges}} we faced during this implementation study. We used existing resources (with regard to available hardware, software, and IT support) to develop iPad and web-based interfaces for collecting PROMs data. In view of financial constraints, a commercial package for PROMs data collection (e.g. from an ICHOM-recommended technology provider) was not sought. This approach provided us with the flexibility of making changes to the data collection interfaces in response to patient and clinician feedback. However, once our IT support ceased, further development of our web-based PROMs collection portal was not possible and so we returned to paper-based data collection. The volume of missing data (non-returned paper questionnaires as well as initial missing item responses) was problematic, and necessitated a significant time commitment to follow up by telephone and/or mail. This {{is not only a}} resource issue, but could have potential implications for data <b>quality.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> of missing data and non-returned questionnaires was most difficult during periods of staff leave. However, the effort invested was worthwhile, as evidenced by the completeness of our baseline data. Missing data can be minimised through electronic data collection (using programming logic that does not allow an individual to proceed to subsequent items if missing responses exist; although there is still the possibility that patients will exit the data collection platform prematurely).|$|E
40|$|Objectives. An {{intensive}} format may be both {{useful and}} effective for {{the delivery of}} cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, the acceptability of an intensive treatment format {{from the perspective of}} service users is unknown. This study examines service user perspectives on the acceptability of an intensive versus a standard weekly treatment format. Design. The study comprises a detailed comparative qualitative analysis of the perspectives of service users who have completed either intensive or weekly CBT for OCD. Methods. Six treatment completers in each format (matched for age, gender, and symptom changeover the course of treatment) were asked to reflect on helpful and problematic aspects of their treatment format, and to consider the differences between treatment formats. The interviews were transcribed and analysed in detail using thematic analysis. Results. Individual differences were apparent in preference for treatment format. Weekly treatment completers were concerned that intensive treatment could be overwhelming or too brief for real change to take place. However, intensive treatment completers valued the high pressure and pace and felt that it improved motivation, engagement, and eventual outcome. Conclusion. An intensive treatment format for the delivery of CBT for OCD can be highly motivating and acceptable to service users who have chosen to undertake it. Good <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> and crisis support may be particularly important following intensive treatment...|$|E
40|$|Background: Little or no {{knowledge}} is available about which service is offered {{to patients with}} heart failure in primary care. Aims: To describe nurse-led follow-up of patients with heart failure in primary care in Sweden. Methods and results: A questionnaire was sent to all primary health care centres in Sweden and 6 10 of 939 centres returned the questionnaire. Special nurses had designated time for follow-up of heart failure patients at 18 % (n = 111) of the centres, compared to 93 % and 78 % for diabetes and obstructive lung disease. Centres with nurse-led follow-up of heart failure patients more frequently provided heart failure information (p< 0. 001), had more doctors interested in heart failure (p< 0. 001), more often had special care programmes (P< 0. 001) and had more co-operation with the hospitals around patients with heart failure (p< 0. 01), compared to centres without such follow-up (n = 499). Conclusion: In primary care in Sweden, nurse-led follow-up is uncommon for patients with heart failure, despite being common for patients with diabetes and obstructive pulmonary disease. To improve this situation in primary care, an increased number of specially trained nurses is needed, together with further research to ensure a high <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> in primary care.

A list of optimal features for each of the seven characteristics was compiled, based on the FOBT screening literature and our detailed examination of each programme. Results Each country made different implementation choices or trade-offs intended to conserve costs and/or manage limited and expensive resources. The overall outcome of these trade-offs was probable lower programme effectiveness as a result of compromises such as reduced screening frequency, restricted target age range, the use of less accurate tests, the deliberate setting of low programme positivity rates or increased inconvenience to participants from re-testing.

Currently, patients are followed up in hospital outpatient clinics with few opportunities to discuss physical, psychological or social needs. In previous studies we demonstrated that specialist nurses (breast and colorectal) {{can provide a}} <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> service by telephoning people at home instead of bringing patients back to busy hospital clinics. In this study we evaluate if this approach is effective for women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. AIMS: To demonstrate that gynaecology oncology specialist nurses have the skills and expertise to meet the information needs and concerns of women treated for endometrial cancer, with no physical or psychological detriment. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial comparing hospital (control) and telephone (intervention) follow-up for women treated for endometrial cancer. The trial is designed to assess non-inferiority in terms of effectiveness (for psychological morbidity, clinical outcomes and quality of life) but superiority in terms of patient satisfaction (with information and service) and efficiency. The intervention includes questions on physical, psychological and social aspects of care with a specific focus on signs of recurrence (bleeding, unusual discharge, unusual aches and pains).

40|$|Introduction: The WoW {{program is}} a two-year {{training}} program to expand employer-based health promotion and prevention. This methodology poster describes the mixed-method program evaluation design and analysis. Methods: Data collection instruments were designed to measure key program outputs and outcomes and pre/post-intervention comparisons. Enrollment surveys, satisfaction surveys, and wellness planning and evaluation tools and surveys were designed to capture organizational characteristics, training program quality, employer wellness program and policies, and employee health status and program interests at program initiation and 12 -month follow-up for four cohorts of participating organizations. The All Payer Claims Database {{will be used to}} examine changes in healthcare utilization and expenditures. Mid-course focus groups with the program team assessed opportunities to improve training efficiency and <b>quality.</b> <b>Follow-up</b> interviews with wellness champions assessed satisfaction, sustainability and future program needs. These qualitative data are examined by main themes to describe contextual factors related to program delivery. Results: The multi-layered evaluation approach was effective for evaluating this employer training program. The instruments gathered valuable data on employer and workforce characteristics and employee health concerns and program needs. Evaluation activities provided quality monitoring that contributed to satisfaction and effectiveness. Evaluating health impacts proved difficult due to insufficient follow up period. Evaluators had partial success with estimating possible health impacts using existing intervention research literature.

40|$|Abstract Background Elderly {{patients}} {{admitted to}} Geriatric Assessment Units (GAU) typically have complex health problems that require multi-professional care. Considering {{the scope of}} human and technological resources solicited during hospitalization, {{as well as the}} many risks and discomforts incurred by the patient, it is important to ensure the communication of pertinent information for <b>quality</b> <b>follow-up</b> care in the community setting. Conventional discharge summaries do not adequately incorporate the elements specific to an aging clientele. Objective To develop a discharge summary adapted to the frail elderly patient (D-SAFE) in order to communicate relevant information from hospital to community services. Methods The items {{to be included in the}} D-SAFE have been determined by means of a modified Delphi method through consultation with clinical experts from GAUs (11 physicians and 5 pharmacists) and the community (10 physicians and 5 pharmacists). The consensus analysis and the level of agreement among the experts were reached using a modified version of the RAND ® /University of California at Los Angeles appropriateness method. Results A consensus was reached after two rounds of consultation for all the items evaluated, where none was judged «inappropriate». Among the items proposed, four were judged to be « uncertain » and were eliminated from the final D-SAFE, which was divided into two sections: the medical discharge summary (22 main items) and the discharge prescription (14 main items). Conclusions The D-SAFE was developed as a more comprehensive tool specifically designed for GAU inpatients. Additional research to validate its acceptability and practical impact on the continuity of care is needed before it can be recommended for use on a broader scale. </p...|$|E

Recent randomised controlled trial (RCT) data have added to the literature on this subject and this meta-analysis aims to assess the state of the data to assist in guiding patient treatment decisions. A systematic literature search of Cochrane Library, Embase, OVID, and PubMed MEDLINE was performed. Randomised controlled trials of patients with LMCA disease undergoing PCI with drug eluting stents or CABG were included. Clinical outcomes and adverse events were assessed and analysed. Four suitable RCTs of adequate <b>quality</b> and <b>follow-up</b> were identified. The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 3 to 5 years of follow-up was significantly increased with PCI compared to CABG (23. 3 % vs 18. 2 %, OR 1. 37; 95 % CI: 1. 18 - 1. 58; p...|$|R
