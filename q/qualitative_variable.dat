The remuneration gap is captured through a hard data indicator (ratio of estimated female-to-male earned income) and a <b>qualitative</b> <b>variable</b> calculated through the World Economic Forum’s Executive Opinion Survey (wage equality for similar work). Finally, the gap between the advancement of women and men is captured through two hard data statistics (the ratio of women to men among legislators, senior officials and managers, and the ratio of women to men among technical and professional workers)." ...|$|E

50|$|In PCA, it {{is common}} {{that we want to}} {{introduce}} qualitative variables as supplementary elements. For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the <b>qualitative</b> <b>variable</b> species.For this, the following results are produced.|$|E
5000|$|In {{statistics}} and econometrics, particularly in regression analysis, a dummy variable (also {{known as an}} indicator variable, design variable, Boolean indicator, categorical variable, binary variable, or <b>qualitative</b> <b>variable)</b> is one that takes the value 0 or 1 to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that {{may be expected to}} shift the outcome. Dummy variables are used as devices to sort data into mutually exclusive categories (such as smoker/non-smoker, etc.).

50|$|To {{find out}} if the mean {{salaries}} of the teachers in the North and South are statistically {{different from that of the}} teachers in the West (the comparison category), we have to {{find out if}} the slope coefficients of the regression result are statistically significant. For this, we need to consider the p values. The estimated slope coefficient for the North is not statistically significant as its p value is 23 percent; however, that of the South is statistically significant at the 5% level as its p value is only around 3.5 percent. Thus the overall result is that the mean salaries of the teachers in the West and North are not statistically different from each other, but the mean salary of the teachers in the South is statistically lower than that in the West by around $3265.

40|$|One {{criticism}} of VAR forecasting is that macroeconomic variables {{tend not to}} behave as linear functions of their own past around business cycle turning points. This article investigates the methods and efficacy of forecasting with a VAR that expands the information set to include dynamic forecasts of a qualititative variable - business cycle turning points.

Background: There are {{few studies}} on the <b>qualitative</b> <b>variables</b> derived from the animal {{category}} verbal fluency test (VF), especially with data originating from low-income samples of community-based studies. Objective: To compare elderly with and without hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) regarding {{the total number of}} animals spoken, number of categories, groups and category switches on the VF test. Methods: We used the database of the FIBRA (Frailty in Brazilian Elderly) community-based study. The variables number of Categories, Groups and Category Switches were created for each participant. The total sample (n = 384) was divided into groups of elderly who reported having HTN, DM, both HTN and DM, or neither of these conditions. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} the groups with and without these chronic diseases for VF total score or for the <b>qualitative</b> <b>variables.</b> Conclusion: Among independent community-dwelling elderly, the <b>qualitative</b> <b>variables</b> derived from the VF animal category may not add information regarding the cognitive profile of elderly with chronic diseases.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new Qual VAR model for incorporating information from qualitative and/or discrete variables in vector autoregressions.

I apply the Qual VAR to forecasting the 2001 business recession out of sample and to analyzing the Romer and Romer (1989) narrative measure of monetary policy contractions as an endogenous variable in a VAR. Out of sample, the model predicts the timing of the 2001 recession quite well relative to the recession probabilities put forth at the time by professional forecasters.
