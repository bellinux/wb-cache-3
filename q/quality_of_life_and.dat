Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.|$|E
40|$|Administration <b>of</b> {{the same}} <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Enjoyment <b>and</b> Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) in major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD) and in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) before and after treatment allowed us to compare <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction in these two disorders and to compare outcome based on symptoms versus functioning. Q-LES-Q and symptom-specific Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) data from eight randomized, 8 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials with escitalopram were used. MDD (n= 1, 140) or GAD (n= 1, 045) patients report a substantial degree <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction impairment (baseline scores 64 % and 76 % of community norm, respectively). Treatment resulted in statistically and clinically significant improvement in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction. The improvement was greater in patients treated with escitalopram than with placebo. In MDD, the majority of remitters (MADRS<or= 12) reached 'normal' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction levels, whereas in GAD, 67 % of remitters (HAMA<or= 7) reached 'normal' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> enjoyment, <b>and</b> satisfaction. A strong correlation between the symptom-specific scales and the Q-LES-Q was observed. These analyses suggest that remission with scores of 6 on the MADRS and 5 on the HAMA correspond with a <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction found in community comparison patients (Q-LES-Q score of 58 +/- 10 %). Treatment with escitalopram results in a significant improvement <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction in patients with MDD or GAD. Both response and remission in patients with GAD and remission in patients with MDD are correlated with a 'normal' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> enjoyment <b>and</b> satisfaction. status: publishe...|$|R

There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a single agent, or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, an el would cause disturbances to the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: University faculty members, as {{the largest}} {{providers}} of educational services, must enjoy a good <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> {{in order to provide}} excellent educational services to their students. Thus, this paper aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and</b> interpersonal forgiveness. Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was conducted through a cross-sectional method. Accordingly, 76 faculty members of Qom University of Medical Sciences were selected in 2013 using the convenience sampling method. The data were collected using demographic information questionnaire, Walton’s <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> Working <b>Life</b> <b>and</b> Interpersonal Forgiveness Scale. Then, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficient and One-way ANOVA, which were run in SPSS (V. 16) Software.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Tripura can be characterised by {{high rate of}} poverty, low capital formation, {{inadequate}} infrastructure facilities, geographical isolation and communication bottlenecks, inadequate exploration and use of forest and mineral resources, slow industrialisation and high unemployment. More than 50% of the population depends on agriculture for sustaining their livelihood. However agriculture and allied activities to Gross State Domestic Production (GSDP) is only 23%, this is primarily because of low capital base in the sector. Despite the inherent limitation and constraints coupled with severe resources for investing in basic infrastructure, this has brought consistence progress in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> income of people cutting across all sections of society.

40|$|Background and Aim: The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} variable in connection with human resources. Therefore, it should be taken into consideration by managers if they aim to improve the capabilities and efficiency of their staff, which will, in turn, lead to improved productivity and economic growth. Productivity {{is an important factor in}} the success of hospital nurses too. The objective of this study was to determine the association between the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity <b>of</b> nurses. Knowledge of this relationship can help plan to improve the nurses' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and,</b> subsequently, improve their productivity and, ultimately, productivity of a hospital. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional correlation study conducted in 2011. The study population was nurses of the Shahid-Beheshti University of Medical Sciences hospitals in Tehran, Iran. Using the randomized stratified multistage sampling method, 380 nurses were selected as the study sample. Data on the nurses' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity were collected using two questionnaires and analyzed using SPSS- 17, the statistical tests being Chi- 2, ANOVA, T-test, and the Pearson correlation test. Results: The findings showed that nurses' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity were at the middle level, with a mean of 2. 47 and 3. 07, respectively.  A very small number (1. 55 %) of the nurses reported that their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> was at a high level, while the majority (82. 4 %) believed their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> to be at a moderate level. The Pearson correlation test showed a significant positive relationship between the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity <b>of</b> the nurses (r = 0. 66, p-value = 0. 001). Conclusion: Only a low proportion of the nurses report their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity to be at a high level. Therefore, bearing in mind that a statistically significant relationship exists between the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> working <b>life</b> <b>and</b> productivity, authorities should atempt to promote the nurses' <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> in order to increase their productivity...|$|R
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of the collapsing of the Eastern Bloc, on 10 November 1989 the Communist Party gave up its political monopoly, Zhivkov resigned, and Bulgaria embarked on a transition to a parliamentary democracy. The first free elections in June 1990 were won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the freshly renamed Communist Party). A new constitution that provided for a relatively weak elected president and for a prime minister accountable to the legislature was adopted in July 1991. The new system initially failed to improve living standards or create economic growth—the average <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> economic performance remained lower than under communism well into the early 2000s. A 1997 reform package restored economic growth, but living standards continued to suffer. After 2001 economic, political and geopolitical conditions improved greatly, and Bulgaria achieved high Human Development status. It became a member of NATO in 2004 and participated in the War in Afghanistan. After several years of reforms it joined the European Union in 2007 despite continued concerns about government corruption.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: Research {{efforts have}} been {{directed}} at understanding the relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> organisational commitment, but these studies have not elucidated the mediating role of perceived external prestige in this relationship. Research purpose: This research seeks to close a research gap by determining the role of perceived external prestige {{in the relationship between}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> organisational commitment amongst public sector employees in Ghana. Research approach, design and method: Theoretically guided hypotheses and models were formulated and tested with hierarchical multiple regression statistics using data from a sample of 137 employees from two public sector organisations in Ghana. Main findings: The results support the hypothesis that <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> is positively related to both perceived external prestige and organisational commitment. Also, perceived external prestige was found to predict organisational commitment and partially mediate the relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> organisational commitment. Practical/managerial implications: The findings imply that one sure way to enhance organisational commitment of employees is by improving their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> boosting their perceptions of external prestige of the organisation. These results will be of particular interest to policymakers, public organisations and stakeholders interested in increasing organisational commitment of their employees. Contribution/value-add: The findings extend previous research by establishing the mediating role of perceived external prestige in the relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> organisational commitment. If managers of organisations wish to improve organisational commitment, it is wise to institutionalise an organisational culture that promotes good <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work <b>life</b> <b>and</b> boost the external prestige of the organisation in the employees’ mind. </p...|$|R
