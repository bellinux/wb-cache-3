40|$|Current {{clinical}} guidelines for managing chronic myeloid leukemia include molecular monitoring of BCR-ABL 1 transcript <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR.</b> Despite the proven prognostic significance of molecular response, {{it is not}} widely appreciated that <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> potentially produces highly variable data, which may affect the validity of results, making comparability between different laboratories difficult.

Conversion to the international scale is achieved by the application of laboratory specific conversion factor that is obtained by using validated secondary reference calibrators. Moreover, with the aim to mitigate the interlaboratory imprecision of quantitative BCR-ABL 1 measurements and to facilitate local laboratory results interpretation and reporting, we decide to prepare laboratory guidelines that will further facilitate interlaboratory comparative studies and independent quality-assessment programs, which are of paramount importance for worldwide standardization of BCR-ABL 1 monitoring results, in particular for those most isolated laboratories, with not easy access to commercial kits or sample interchange program...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Optimised nanotopography with {{controlled}} disorder (NSQ 50) {{has been}} shown to stimulate osteogenesis and new bone formation in vitro. Following osteointegration the implant interface must undergo constant remodeling without inducing immune response. AIM: We aimed to assess the effect of nanotopography on bone remodelling using osteoclast and osteoblast cocultures. MATERIALS &# 38; METHODS: We developed a novel osteoblast/osteoclast coculture using solely human bone marrow derived mesenchymal and hematopeotic progenitor cells without extraneous supplementation. The coculture was been applied to NSQ 50 or flat control polycarbonate substrates and assessed using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> methods. RESULTS: These confirm the presence of mature osteoclasts, osteoblasts and bone formation in coculture.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} is a multi-step process, which proceeds from DNA through RNA to protein. The tight regulation {{of this process}} is essential for overall cellular integrity and physiological homeostasis. Regulation of the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels has emerged as a crucial event in the modulation of the expression of genetic information. The mechanisms by which this process occurs have been extensively studied and begin to be much better understood.

The pathological characteristics of normal, early-stage and late-stage osteoarthritic TMJ cartilage were verified by histological techniques. The gene expression profiles in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage were measured by Affymetrix RAE 230 A microarrays. Some of the gene transcripts were confirmed by <b>quantitative</b> real-time <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> analysis.

Interestingly, although the average fluorescence remained constant during cell-cycle progression, individual cells demonstrated a roughly twofold higher promoter activity {{at the end of the}} cell cycle. This cell cycle-dependent increased promoter activity can be partly explained by the doubled promoter copy number after DNA replication. Our results indicate that the transcriptional activity of promoters for cell division genes remains constant regardless of growth rate and cell-cycle state, suggesting that regulation of cell division in B. subtilis predominantly takes place at the post-translational level. ...|$|R

However, clinical trials with AAV vectors have shown that an immune response to AAV capsid protein can result in clearance of transduced cells. One source of capsid antigen is from the delivered vector virions, but expression of cap DNA impurities in AAV vector preparations might provide an alternative and persistent source of capsid antigen. Here we show that DNA without any AAV sequences can be packaged in AAV virions, and that both cap and rep DNA are packaged into AAV vectors produced by standard methods. Using a sensitive complementation assay, we also observed significant expression of capsid in cultured cells transduced with AAV vectors. In an attempt to solve this problem, we inserted a large intron into the cap gene to generate a capsid expression cassette (captron) that is too large for packaging into AAV virions.

The dysregulation of many AMPs in colonic IBD in comparison with control colons was widely restored by infliximab therapy, and only DEFB 1 expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in the colonic mucosa of IBD responders to infliximab. In ileal Crohn's disease (CD), expression of two neuropeptides with antimicrobial activity, PYY and CHGB, was significantly decreased before therapy compared to control ileums, and ileal PYY expression remained significantly decreased after therapy in CD responders.

Results. miR- 203 was significantly downregulated in GERD patients as compared to Ctrls (P< 0. 0001) with ROC curve of 0. 94 (95 % CI: 0. 90 – 0. 97). The sensitivity and the specificity of miR- 203 were 91. 7 % and 87. 3 %, respectively, in the GERD and Ctrls. These results suggest that miR- 203 may be a useful diagnostic marker for discriminating GERD from Ctrls. Conclusions. miR- 203 testing may assist in the diagnosis of patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{conventional}} clinicopathological, {{as well as}} the principal new emerging prognostic factors of breast cancer and proposes a tumor marker utility grading system for their use. In spite of the many advances in molecular biology toward better defining the biological aggressiveness of the primary malignancy, the conventional node-negative status, tumor size and grade are still the strongest predictors of relapse-free survival and/or overall survival. Microvessel count and bone-marrow micrometastases, among the more recently studied clinicopathological prognostic factors, and amplification and/or p 53 mutation and S-phase fraction among the biological ones must be considered investigational, although, with enough documentation recommending their usefulness. Estrogen and/or progesterone expression, c-erbB- 2 amplification and/or mutation are the prognostic factors currently included in the principal clinical guidelines. They also enable probable forecast of the response to endocrine treatment or chemotherapy. In particular, c-erbB- 2 is used to define the different risk categories of node-negative operated breast cancer patients. In recent years, microarray and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> technologies have enabled the study of multiple genetic alterations and computer algorithms have been developed for visual recognition of tumors that share so-called 'signatures'. So far, different gene-expression patterns with different prognoses have been identified but methodological problems remain to be solved prior to routine use...|$|E
40|$|The {{physiological}} role of RASSF 9, {{a member}} of the Ras-association domain family (RASSF), is currently unclear. Here, we report a mouse line in which an Epstein-Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP 1) transgene insertion has created a 7. 2 -kb chromosomal deletion, which abolished RASSF 9 gene expression. The RASSF 9 -null mice exhibited interesting phenotypes that resembled human ageing, including growth retardation, short lifespan, less subcutaneous adipose layer and alopecia. In the wild-type mice, RASSF 9 is predominantly expressed in the epidermal keratinocytes of skin, as determined by <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR,</b> immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization. In contrast, RASSF 9 -/- mice presented a dramatic change in epithelial organization of skin with increased proliferation and aberrant differentiation as detected by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays and immunofluorescence analyses. Furthermore, characteristic functions of RASSF 9 -/- versus wild type (WT) mouse primary keratinocytes showed significant proliferation linked to a reduction of p 21 Cip 1 expression under growth or early differentiation conditions. Additionally, in RASSF 9 -/- keratinocytes there was a drastic down-modulation of terminal differentiation markers, which could be rescued by infection with a recombinant adenovirus, Adv/HA-RASSF 9. Our results indicate a novel and significant role of RASSF 9 in epidermal homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Secondary metabolites, {{including}} toxins and melanins, {{have been}} implicated as virulence attributes in invasive aspergillosis. Although not definitively proved, this supposition {{is supported by}} the decreased virulence of an Aspergillus fumigatus strain, DeltalaeA, that is crippled in the production of numerous secondary metabolites. However, loss of a single LaeA-regulated toxin, gliotoxin, did not recapitulate the hypovirulent DeltalaeA pathotype, thus implicating other toxins whose production is governed by LaeA. Toward this end, a whole-genome comparison of the transcriptional profile of wild-type, DeltalaeA, and complemented control strains showed that genes in 13 of 22 secondary metabolite gene clusters, including several A. fumigatus-specific mycotoxin clusters, were expressed at significantly lower levels in the DeltalaeA mutant. LaeA influences the expression of at least 9. 5 % of the genome (943 of 9, 626 genes in A. fumigatus) but positively controls expression of 20 % to 40 % of major classes of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes such as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), polyketide synthases, and P 450 monooxygenases. Tight regulation of NRPS-encoding genes was highlighted by <b>quantitative</b> real-time <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> analysis. In addition, expression of a putative siderophore biosynthesis NRPS (NRPS 2 /sidE) was greatly reduced in the DeltalaeA mutant in comparison to controls under inducing iron-deficient conditions. Comparative genomic analysis showed that A. fumigatus secondary metabolite gene clusters constitute evolutionarily diverse regions that may be important for niche adaptation and virulence attributes. Our findings suggest that LaeA is a novel target for comprehensive modification of chemical diversity and pathogenicity...|$|R
40|$|In human glioma, <b>quantitative</b> {{real-time}} <b>reverse-transcription</b> <b>PCR</b> (qPCR) is a {{frequently used}} research tool. However, no systematic analysis of suitable reference genes for reliable {{gene expression analysis}} has been performed so far. In the current study, we tested 19 commonly used reference genes for their expression stability in human astrocytoma WHO Grade II, astrocytoma WHO Grade III, and glioblastoma (WHO Grade IV) both alone and compared with normal brain. First, equivalence tests for equal expression of candidate genes were applied, and those genes showing differential expression were ruled out from further analyses. Second, expression stability of the remaining candidate genes {{was determined by the}} NormFinder software. Generally, glioblastoma exhibited the highest expression levels and largest variability of candidate genes, whereas the opposite was true for normal brain. Even though Normfinder analyses revealed a large number of genes suitable for normalization in each of the tumor subgroups and across these groups, this number was drastically reduced after inclusion of normal brain into the analyses: Only GAPDH, IPO 8, RPL 13 A, SDHA, and TBP were expected not to be differentially expressed; NormFinder analysis indicated favorable stability values for all of these genes, with TBP and IPO 8 being the most stable ones. These 5 genes represent different physiological pathways and may be regarded as universal reference genes applicable for accurate normalization of gene expression in human astrocytomas of different grades (WHO Grades II–IV) alone and compared with normal brain, thereby enabling longitudinally designed studies (eg, in astrocytoma before and after malignant transformation) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} years the {{quantification}} of immune response under immunological challenges, e. g. parasitation, {{has been a major}} focus of research. In this context, the expression of immune response genes in teleost fish has been surveyed for scientific and commercial purposes. Despite {{the fact that it was}} shown in teleostei and other taxa that the gene for beta-actin is not the most stably expressed housekeeping gene (HKG), depending on the tissue and experimental treatment, the gene has been used as a reference gene in such studies. In the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, other HKG than the one for beta-actin have not been established so far. Results To establish a reliable method for the measurement of immune gene expression in Gasterosteus aculeatus, sequences from the now available genome database and an EST library of the same species were used to select oligonucleotide primers for HKG, in order to perform <b>quantitative</b> <b>reverse-transcription</b> (RT) <b>PCR.</b> The expression stability of ten candidate reference genes was evaluated in three different tissues, and in five parasite treatment groups, using the three algorithms BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder. Our results showed that in most of the tissues and treatments HKG that could not be used so far due to unknown sequences, proved to be more stably expressed than the one for beta-actin. Conclusion As they were the most stably expressed genes in all tissues examined, we suggest using the genes for the L 13 a ribosomal binding protein and ubiquitin as alternative or additional reference genes in expression analysis in Gasterosteus aculeatus. </p...|$|R
