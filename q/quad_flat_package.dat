5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as <b>Quad</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Packages</b> (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we develop}} {{analytical}} stress {{models for the}} evaluation of thermally induced bows in the following two types of plastic packages: thin elongated packages with large chips, known as thin small outline packages (TSOPs), and high lead count large square packages with relatively small chips, known as plastic <b>quad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (PQFPs). In the case of TSOP packages, we consider the package warpage caused by the thermal contraction mismatch of the constituent materials: silicon chip, metal leadframe, and molding compound. The temperature change is assumed to be the same throughout the package. In the case of PQFP packages, we evaluate the bow due to the temperature gradient (non-uniform distribution of temperature) in the through-thickness direction of the molded body The developed models enable one to evaluate the effect of the package geometry and materials properties on its bow, and more importantly, to design a plastic package with a sufficiently low residual warpage. 1...|$|R

40|$|Eutectic tin {{lead was}} {{the most widely used}} solder {{interconnect}} in the electronics industry before the adoption of lead-free legislation. But eutectic tin lead solder has a low melting point (183 o C) and was not suited for some high temperature applications, such as oil and gas exploration, automotive, and defense. Hence, for these applications, the electronics industry had to rely on specialized solders. In this study, ball grid arrays (BGAs), <b>quad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (QFPs), and surface mount resistors assembled with SAC 305 and Sn 3. 5 Ag solder pastes were subjected to thermal cycling from - 40 o C to 185 o C.

In this study <b>quad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (QFP) and 2512 chip resistors soldered with commercially available Sn 3. 5 Ag and SAC 305, and experimental SAC+Mn and SnAg+Cu Nano alloys on ENIG finished copper were subjected to three tests. Isothermal aging at 185 °C for up to 1000 hours and at 200 °C for up to 500 hours were performed to measure the interfacial intermetallic thickness, assess intermetallic compounds, and view the microstructure. A durability assessment was performed featuring thermal cycling ranges of - 40 to 185 °C and - 40 to 200 °C intermixed with 50 G vibration cycling to determine the most durable solder alloy. Failure analysis was performed to understand the durability results. Finally, shear testing was performed to determine a correlation between shear strength and durability.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} theoretical predictions {{and experimental}} observations of solder fatigue in different Sn- 63 Pb- 37 solder joints. Experimental characterisation of solder-behaviour is performed by both thermal cycling of Surface Mount (SM) solder joints and mechanical cycling of ring and plug specimen. Detailed {{studies of the}} microstructure in solders after temperature cycling as well as after mechanical cycling have shown {{the same type of}} microstructural degradation. This degradation can be described by overall coarsening, local coarsening, recrystallisation, crack initiation and propagation. The computational method to assess the cyclic damage of solder is based upon non-linear finite element calculation results. Comparison of calculation and test results have demonstrated better predictive capabilities when the Coffin-Manson criterion takes into account creep strain distribution within the joint and not only its maximum value. It is shown that Plastic Ball Grid Arrays (PBGA) achieve a high solder joint reliability and exhibit no reliability drawbacks when compared to Plastic <b>Quad</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Packages</b> (PQFP) with a similar pin count.

40|$|A {{solderable}} {{conductive adhesive}} (SCA) using low-melting-point alloy (LMPA) filler {{was developed to}} overcome the limitations of conventional electrically conductive adhesives (ECAs), which include their low electrical conductivity, increased contact resistance, and low joint strength. The SCA formed good metallurgical conduction path between the corresponding electrodes due to the rheology-coalescence-wetting behaviors of molten LMPA fillers in SCA. This study examined the reliability of SCA assembly through the thermal shock test (218 to 398 K, 1000 cycles) and the high temperature and high humidity test (358 K/ 85 %RH, 1000 h). The electrical resistance of the SCA assembly with metallurgical interconnections was much more stable than those with conventional ICAs. Before the reliability tests, a scallop-type Cu 6 Sn 5 (©-phase) intermetallic compound (IMC) layer was formed on the Sn-plated Cu lead/LMPA and LMPA/Cu metallization interface {{based on the results}} of interfacial microstructure observations of <b>quad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>packages</b> (QFPs) that were assembled with SCA. After the reliability tests, the thickness of IMC layer increased with time, and Cu 6 Sn 5 (©-phase) and Cu 3 Sn (-phase) were formed. In addition, the fracture surface exhibited a cleavage fracture mode with the fracture propagating along the CuSn IMC/SnBi interface.

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} use of Ball Grid Arrays (BGAs) and fine pitch and ultra fine pitch <b>Quad</b> <b>Flat</b> <b>Packages</b> (QFPs), there is a dramatic increase in demand for solder paste inspection after the stencil printing process. The important response variables of the printing process are deposited solder paste volume, area, height and position. To identify and remove defects at the earliest possible process step, a 3 -D solder paste inspection system should be used to monitor solder paste deposited on all pads on every board before component placement. An example is a fully automatic laser-based 3 -D triangulation solder paste inspection system that is currently used for inspection of 0. 635 mm (25 mil) pitch QFP components of automobile electronics products. As the pitch of QFP components decreases and the use of BGA components increases, the gauge repeatability & reproducibility (R&R) of the inspection system must be reevaluated. This work investigates whether the present system can be used for measuring 0. 4 mm and 0. 3 mm pitch QFPs and BGAs. An experiment was conducted featuring 2, 400 pads of 5 different pitch levels of QFPs and BGAs from 0. 3 mm (12 mil) to 0. 76 mm (30 mil). The analyses show that the system is capable of measuring solder deposits higher than 0. 025 mm (1 mil) with repeatability of 5 % for volume and area measurement, and with repeatability of 5 % for average height of the majority of pads and 18 % for all pads. In addition, there are requirements in board design necessary to ensure the reference points for measurements can be specified close enough to the pads...|$|R

These sensors are fabricated using conventional integrated circuit technology as part of the normal silicon processing process. Since they can also be used over a wide temperature range after calibration, the thermally induced stresses can be measured. In this thesis, the theoretical background of micro strain gauge stress sensors was reviewed. The design consideration of the stress sensors and the design parameters of two kinds of stress sensors were presented. The micro strain gauges were calibrated using a four-point bending fixture. The error associated with this calibration method was studied. The resistance of the micro strain gauge was found to vary linearly with the applied stress and the temperature. The piezoresistive coefficients were calculated and found to be in agreement with the reported values for silicon. The problems associated with the calibration process were also discussed.

This paper first addressed the thermal characterization of encapsulating material. Degree-of-cure (DOC or beta), coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE or a), glass transition temperature T-g, and shear modulus G' and G of the molded specimens were measured by various thermal analysis techniques. The glass transition temperature was shown to be a good and direct measure of the degree-of-cure. The CTEs (alpha (1) and alpha (2)), G' and G'' were found to be decreasing functions of degree-of-cure. Viscoelastic EMC material models with DOC (i. e., T-g) dependent were formulated. Package warpage predictions against different processing conditions were performed via finite element analyses. Out-of-plane displacement measurements were performed on plastic <b>quad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>package</b> (PQFP) to validate the numerical results.

An experimental study has been conducted into the effects of package related failures in plastic encapsulated semiconductors. As {{a result of an}} extensive literature survey particular emphasis was placed on thermal and moisture related failure mechanisms. A number of accelerated life testing techniques including Highly Accelerated Stress Testing (HAST) were used to induced parameter drift and catastrophic failures. Examples of both insertion and surface mount package types were studied. Observations were made on the parameter drift and catastrophic failure mechanisms of plastic encapsulated Bipolar Junction Transistors in dual in line packages. Gain degradation was observed to be the most sensitive parameter of those measured. It is proposed that this is a result of an increase in the extended surface depletion region area due to a degradation in the surface cleanliness. A theoretical analysis of the build up these traps is presented.
