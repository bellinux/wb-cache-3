By holding factors (2) and (3) constant it was possible to calculate the average local charge densities <b>QA,</b> <b>QC,</b> and QE which are necessary for {{formation of}} 10 -, 14 -, and 16. 8 -fk mixed-layer phases in potassium-treated and ethylene glycol (EG) saturated smectites. The values ofQA, QC, and QE were 1. 99, 1. 2, and 0. 56 esu/unit cell, respectively. Ammonium-treated smectites saturated with EG gave corresponding mean local charge densities of 2. 7, 1. 6, and 0. 72 esu/unit cell. Cal-culations were made under the limiting condition QA> QC> QE> 0. For K-smectites aturated with EG, Qtot = 1. 99 pA + 1. 2 pC + 0. 56 pE, where Qtot is the total charge (esu/unit cell), and pA, pC, and pE are probability coefficients for 10 -, 14 -, and 16. 8 - • phases in the in-terstratified structure. The above quation calculated with the aid of least squares and without he limiting condition yields Qtot = 2. 05 pA + 1. 29 pC + 0. 33 pE. There is a good agreement between values obtained for K-smectites and those for mica, vermiculite, and montmorillonite layer charges for which the above unit-structure distances are typical.

40|$|Introduction The Metabolomics Society Data Quality Task Group (DQTG) {{developed}} a questionnaire regarding quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) to provide baseline information about current <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> practices {{applied in the}} international metabolomics community. Objectives The DQTG has a long-term goal of promoting robust <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> in the metabolomics community through increased awareness via communication, outreach and education, and through the promotion of best working practices. An assessment of current <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> practices {{will serve as a}} foundation for future activities and development of appropriate guidelines. Method QA was defined as the set of procedures that are performed in advance of analysis of samples and that are used to improve data quality. QC was defined as the set of activities that a laboratory does during or immediately after analysis that are applied to demonstrate the quality of project data. A questionnaire was developed that included 70 questions covering demographic information, <b>QA</b> approaches and <b>QC</b> approaches and allowed all respondents to answer a subset or all of the questions. Result The DQTG questionnaire received 97 individual responses from 84 institutions in all fields of metabolomics covering NMR, LC-MS, GC-MS, and other analytical technologies. Conclusion There was a vast range of responses concerning the use of <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> approaches that indicated the limited availability of suitable training, lack of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to review and make decisions on quality, and limited use of standard reference materials (SRMs) as QC materials. The DQTG QA/QC questionnaire has for the first time demonstrated that <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> usage is not uniform across metabolomics laboratories.

40|$|M. Tech. There is varied X-ray {{equipment}} in the hospitals where radiology services are being provided {{by the government of}} Malawi. Well maintained and optimally functioning X-ray equipment is essential in providing diagnostic assistance to referring clinicians. Equipment needs to be carefully looked after by the users to avoid unnecessary breakdowns because installation and maintenance is very expensive. Imaging departments need to be well run and efficiently utilised in order to minimise radiation hazards and to be cost effective. One important element of taking care of equipment is to conduct Quality Assurance (QA) Programmes and Quality Control (<b>QC)</b> measures. <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> activities are essential if X-ray equipment is to operate optimally at all times. X-ray {{equipment in}} Malawi is not subjected to any <b>QA</b> or <b>QC</b> measures as stipulated by the World Health Organization (WHO) standards and this leads to frequent breakdown of equipment. This prompted the researcher to conduct a study to investigate the status of X-ray equipment <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> measures in Malawi. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the status of <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> measures in diagnostic X-ray departments in government hospitals of Malawi and establish a baseline from which recommendations could be made to facilitate the development of <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> programmes in Malawi. A quantitative design that included an exploratory and descriptive approach was used to collect data. All four central hospitals were selected using a census sampling method and ten district hospitals were selected using cluster sampling method across the country. Questionnaires were used to collect information on QA programmes for hospitals and X-ray departments.

While the former rootstock tends to promote more vigour in the scion, quince rootstocks propagate more easily, but graft incompatibility may be a problem. Diverse soil, environmental and management conditions have necessitated an extensive pear rootstock evaluation process. The adoption of higher density orchards, especially under fertigation and drip irrigation necessitated a re-evaluation of commercially available rootstocks (BP 3, BP 1, OH×F 97, BA 29, <b>QA</b> & <b>QC</b> 51) using the popular commercial blushed pear 'Forelle'. Data is presented over five seasons from trees planted at 4. 2 × 0. 5 × 0. 5 m and trained to a modified Tatura trellis. Rootstock had a significant effect on stem diameter, tree height and number of growth points. Stem diameter was the only parameter directly correlated with yield and there were no differences in cropping efficiency. Rootstock influenced fruit background colour but not size, blush, firmness or TSS during the first harvest and influenced fruit size, background colour and blush, but not fruit firmness or TSS during the second. The largest fruit size occurred on the more dwarfed trees, although harvested fruit number generally did not differ.

40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, the {{majority}} of Malaysia’s IT companies have been widely adopting a Quality Assurance (QA) approach {{as a basis for}} self-improvement and internal-assessment in IT project management. Quality Control (QC) is a comprehensive top-down observation approach used to fulfill requirements for quality outputs which focuses on the aspect of process outputs evaluation. However in the Malaysian context, QC and combination of <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> as a means of quality improvement approaches have not received significant attention. This research study aims to explore the possibility of integrating QC and QA+QC approaches through Six Sigma quality management standard to provide tangible and measureable business results by continuous process improvement to boost customer satisfactions. The research project adopted an exploratory case study approach on three Malaysian IT companies in the business area of IT Process, IT Service and IT Product. Semi-structured interviews, online surveys, self-administered questionnaires, job observations, document analysis and on-the-job-training are amongst the methodologies employed in these case studies. These collected data and viewpoints along with findings from an extensive literature review were used to benchmark quality improvement initiatives, best practices and to develop a Six Sigma framework for the context of the SMEs in the Malaysian IT industry. This research project contributed to both the theory and practice of implementing and integrating Six Sigma in IT products, services and processes. The newly developed framework has been proven capable of providing a general and fundamental start-up decision by demonstrating how a company with and without formal QIM can be integrated and implemented with Six Sigma practices to close the variation gap between <b>QA</b> and <b>QC.</b> This framework also takes into consideration those companies with an existing QIM for a new face-lift migration without having to drop their existing QIM. This can be achieved by integrating a new QIM which addresses most weaknesses of the current QIM while retaining most of the current business routine strengths. This framework explored how Six Sigma can be expanded and extended to include secondary external factors that are critical to successful QIM implementation. A vital segment emphasizes Six Sigma as a QA+QC approach in IT processes; and the ability to properly manage IT processes will result in overall performance improvement to IT Products and IT Services.

The same issues were also observed in our selected studies. Technological changes have an impact on radiographers’ practice in mammography, which must be considered in clinical practice and in education. Some issues regarding the standardization of dose reference levels (DRL) implementation and the challenges caused by the variability in image quality assessment were also emphasized (Table 4).

This implies no correlation between qa,i and qb,i and possible correlation between the off-diagonal elements qa,i and qb, j where i, j, which in practice is ques-tionable.

Quality assurance (QA) is defined as a systematic process to check whether a service/product under development is meeting specific requirements before the product or service is completed. The non-proliferation treaty (NPT) comprises a verification mechanism: nuclear safeguards. Safeguards aims at the verification of the non-diversion of fissile material from its intended and declared (peaceful) use. Therefore a reliable nuclear material accountancy system has to be established by the plant operator. This accountancy is subject to independent verification by the safeguards authorities. Measurement of samples (for their content in U or Pu and the respective isotopic composition) taken by inspectors remains the backbone of any verification system. Environmental sampling is a supplementary safeguards tool aiming at verifying the correctness and completeness of a state¿s declarations.

40|$|International audienceThe modellation of {{the growth}} of decagonal quasi {{crystals}} by Penrose structures is limited by the matching rules of the tiles or of an elementary cluster cell. The matching rules act only locally and lead to configurations which cannot be extended further with these rules. How can be shown with the substitution rules of the Penrose tiles, perfect matching rules have to operate in all scales of substitution. The quasi periodic succession which is presented here does exactly this. An elementary aperiodic cluster cell Q contains a mechanism which picks up 5 scale values of one neighboring cluster cell, evaluates it and determines 4, 5 or 6 neighbor cell positions with individual scale values each. This procedure is controlled by 5 constant length lconst which can be understood as a sliding ruler with two marks. The length lconst is derived as the optimized, averaged length of the self similar, one dimensional, aperiodic interval structures (<b>Qa,</b> Qb, <b>Qc,</b> Qd, Qe) from which Q is assembled. The paper presents an arithmetic algorithm on the base of this geometric model which allows to calculate the local structure successive out of each cluster cell without consideration of the global structure.

The successive algorithm on the base of a single cluster cell and its 5 scale values makes the existence of natural decagonal quasi crystals and the growth of pure synthetic decagonal quasi crystals more imaginable...|$|R

Data from this sampling and analysis effort {{will be used to}} verify data obtained from a survey of such surface impoundments and in the assessment of risks posed by the impounded wastes. Facility-specific sampling and analysis plans (SAPs) will be developed for each facility to be sampled. These SAPs will contain the site- and wastespecific requirements, including information regarding the waste types to be sampled, the sampling locations, the constituents of concern, method performance criteria, and the analytical methods. This QAPP provides a guide and overall approach for sample collection, sample analyses and report preparation and will be used {{in the development of the}} facilityspecific SAPs. A data quality objectives (DQOs) development document was also prepared prior t...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundRadiotherapy {{simulators}} play {{an important}} role in the preparation of radiation treatment. Their mechanical and geometrical parameters have to be identical with those of the treatment machines. Therefore, quality control protocols for the simulators should be comprehensive and the tolerance limits as high as those for treatment machines. AimEvaluation of the technical status of radiotherapy simulators involved in clinical trials. Materials/MethodsIn this paper, results of quality control tests conducted in 12 Polish radiotherapy centres are presented. The tests were carried out within the framework of Polish research project KBN No. 6 P 05 C 032 20. 12 radiotherapy simulators installed in Polish radiotherapy centres were thoroughly tested. In order to control technical conditions of the simulators, a set of 24 tests was elaborated. The tests were divided into six thematic groups. The detailed range of the parameters controlled and the accepted ranges of tolerance limits are given. The values of tolerance limits are based on data found in the available literature. ResultsThe control of 12 simulators revealed the violation of accepted tolerance limits for 13 out of 24 controlled parameters. The most frequent violations of accepted tolerance limits occurred in the case of geometrical parameters of light simulation and mechanical parameters of the couch, both very important for the accuracy of the simulation process. For 2 simulators almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the tolerance limits. ConclusionsThe control of radiotherapy simulators undertaken within the framework of the clinical trial revealed that in the majority of cases the simulators were in good technical condition. In 2 cases almost 30 % of controlled parameters were outside the tolerance limits. In such cases the manufacturers' service should be called urgently for necessary repairs and regulations. After repeated quality control tests a decision should be taken regarding the accepted range of operations which could be used in clinical practice. A <b>QA</b> and <b>QC</b> system for radiotherapy simulators should be introduced in each radiotherapy centre...|$|R
50|$|CoMET {{services}} {{applied to}} evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions {{take the form}} of quality-assurance (<b>QA)</b> or quality-control (<b>QC)</b> services. <b>QA</b> services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies {{the nature and extent of}} QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s building code. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The International Code Council (ICC) is the most prominent of these groups and its International Building Code (IBC) is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Process {{analytical}} technology guidance by the US Food & Drug Administration lately became the major driver of pharmaceutical process optimization. The {{majority of these}} processes are complex and consequently multivariate. Although new insights have improved knowledge of the phenomena taking place, it is not usually possible to develop deterministic modeling. Processes involving powder handling, such as multi-component pharmaceutical formulation blending, are common and the real-time monitoring of their physico-chemical attributes is challenging. In this work, we propose multivariate analysis of a V-blender mixing unit operation with an in-line near-infra red (NIR) measurement technique. The NIR measurement system {{used in this study}} consists of a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) -based spectrometer connected to an IP- 65 -encased optical measuring head (sampling probe) through a 1 -meter length umbilical wire cord. It deploys diffuse reflectance sampling technology, providing 40 -mm spot size with a spectral range of 1, 350 to 1, 800 nm. The methodology includes the following steps: (1) modification of a nominal 1 -ft (30 -L) V-blender unit to accommodate Axsun’s NIR spectroscopy system; (2) 3 experimental runs, each with a different mixing time, while monitoring powder homogeneity with NIR spectroscopy; (3) acquisition of 10 powder samples after each run from pre-determined locations in the V-blender, evaluated with current Quality Assurance (<b>QA)</b> /Quality Control (<b>QC)</b> lab methods, to determine reference mixing endpoints; and (4) NIR data analysis by SIMPA-P+ an...|$|R
