Abduction provides an improved method for constructing explanations.

Abduction also provides a form of knowledge level learning. Descriptions of case studies show {{how to set up}} abduction engines for tasks in particular domains.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{some results}} of research {{work in the}} field of artificial neural networks (ANN) applied to nuclear safety. It shows how a priori knowledge in the form of <b>qualitative</b> <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning</b> can provide a powerful basis for designing a set of ANN-based detection subsystems. In particular, it explains how each ANN is in charge of modelling a physical relationship between a set of state variables (thermal balance, mass balance, etc.) by trying to predict one particular variable from other ones; then, the residual signal, defined by the difference between the predicted value and the real one is used to decide whether abnormalities are present. As far as the decision logic is concerned, the paper describes how robustness can be improved by adequate filters on the residuals. The proposed approach is then validated on data coming from a fullscope simulator of one of the Belgian nuclear power units: the neural-based detection system is trained on ''normal'' scenarios and is able, after learning, to detect reliably and rapidly most of the incidental situations chosen as tests...|$|E

40|$|In {{scientific}} computing and in realistic graphic animation, simulation — that is, step-by-step {{calculation of}} the complete trajectory of a physical system — {{is one of the}} most common and important modes of calculation. In this article, we address the scope and limits of the use of simulation, with respect to AI tasks that involve high-level <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning.</b> We argue that, in many cases, simulation can play at most a limited role. Simulation is most effective when the task is prediction, when complete information is available, when a reasonably high quality theory is available, and when the range of scales involved, both temporal and spatial, is not extreme. When these conditions do not hold, simulation is less effective or entirely inappropriate. We discuss twelve features of <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning</b> problems that pose challenges for simulation-based reasoning. We briefly survey alternative techniques for <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning</b> that do not rely on simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} an {{in-depth}} study of <b>qualitative</b> <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning</b> about one particular scenario: using a box {{to carry a}} collection of objects {{from one place to}} another. Specifically we consider the plan, plan 1 “Load objects uCargo into box oBox one by one; carry oBox from location l 1 to location l 2 ”. We present qualitative constraints on the shape, starting position, and material properties of uCargo and oBox and on the characteristics of the motion that suffice to make it virtually certain that plan 1 can be successfully executed. We develop a theory, consisting mostly of first-order statements together with two default rules, that supports an inference of the form “If conditions XYZ hold, and the agent attempts to carry out plan 1 then presumably he will succeed”. Our theory is elaboration tolerant in the sense that carrying out the analogous inference for carrying objects in boxes with lids, in boxes with small holes, or on trays can reuse much of the same knowledge. The theory integrates reasoning about continuous time, Euclidean space, commonsense dynamics of solid objects, and semantics of partially specified plans...|$|E
40|$|Computers surpass {{humans in}} many respects, but remain {{notoriously}} poor at common sense reasoning, such as reasoning about every day physical objects. In computers this is generally carried {{out through the}} use of step-by-step physical simulation; a computer program is given an exact specification of a physical situation, and the computer calculates the precise trajectory of the system at a sequence of discrete time points. There is good reason, however, to think that human beings may use different techniques [...] and that the techniques of humans may offer significant advantages over simulation-based calculation. First, humans can make useful qualitative predictions given only partial specifications of the physical and geometrical properties of the situation. Second, humans can make useful qualitative predictions even if they have only a very imperfect knowledge of the physics of the objects or materials involved. Third, humans can predict the qualitative behavior of a complex situation without needing to calculate all the details of the behavior. Finally, humans can use the same physical knowledge {{for a wide variety of}} cognitive tasks, including not just prediction but also manipulation, planning design, vision, and text understanding. Our goal is to develop a theory that explains how reasoning with these characteristics can be carried out, both in humans and machines.

40|$|We report quadruple {{configuration}} interaction calculations {{within the}} extended Pariser-Parr-Pople Hamiltonian on the excited states of aggregates of polyenes, crystalline acenes, and covalently linked dimers of acene molecules. We determine the precise energy orderings {{and analyze the}} cluster wave functions in order {{to arrive at a}} comprehensive physical understanding of singlet fission in these diverse families of materials. Our computational approach allows us to retain {{a very large number of}} basis states and thereby obtain the correct relative energy orderings of one electron-one hole Frenkel and charge-transfer excitons versus intra- and intermolecular two electron-two hole triplet-triplet excited states. We show that from the energy orderings it is possible to understand the occurrence of singlet fission in polyene and acene crystals, as well as its near total absence in the covalently linked acene dimers. As in the acene crystals, singlet fission in the polyenes is a multichromophoric phenomenon, with the well-known 2 ^ 1 A_g^- playing no direct role. Intermolecular charge-transfer is essential for singlet fission in both acenes and polyenes, but because of subtle differences in the natures and orderings of the aggregate excited states, the mechanisms of singlet fission are slightly different in the two classes. We are thus able to give <b>qualitative</b> <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning</b> for the slower singlet fission in the polyenes, relative to that in crystalline pentacene. Our work also gives new insight into the complex exciton dynamics in tetracene crystals, which has been difficult to understand theoretically. Our large-scale many-body calculations provide us with the ability to understand the qualitative differences in the singlet fission yields and rates between different classes of π-conjugated materials.

One physical domain that it is ubiquitous both in everyday interactions and in many kinds of scientific applications, where reasoning from incomplete information is very common, is the interaction of containers and their contents. We have developed a preliminary knowledge base for qualitative reasoning about containers, expressed in a sorted first-order language of time, geometry, objects, histories, and events.

40|$|In domains such as <b>physical</b> <b>reasoning,</b> humans, unlike {{programs}} for scientific computation, can often arrive at useful predictions based on radically incomplete information. Consider {{the capacity to}} reason about containers ― boxes, bottles, cups, pails, bags, etc ― and the interactions of containers with their contents.
