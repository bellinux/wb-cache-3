5|$|Any {{triangle}} or <b>quadrilateral</b> (even non-convex) {{can be used}} as a prototile to form a monohedral tessellation, {{often in}} more than one way. Copies of an arbitrary <b>quadrilateral</b> can form a tessellation with translational symmetry and 2-fold rotational symmetry with centres at the midpoints of all sides. For an asymmetric <b>quadrilateral</b> this tiling belongs to wallpaper group p2. As fundamental domain we have the <b>quadrilateral.</b> Equivalently, we can construct a parallelogram subtended by a minimal set of translation vectors, starting from a rotational centre. We can divide this by one diagonal, and take one half (a triangle) as fundamental domain. Such a triangle has the same area as the <b>quadrilateral</b> and can be constructed from it by cutting and pasting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quadrilaterals</b> {{with two}} axes of symmetry, each through {{a pair of}} {{opposite}} sides, belong to the larger class of <b>quadrilaterals</b> {{with at least one}} axis of symmetry through a pair of opposite sides.

5|$|Tessellation can be {{extended}} to three dimensions. Certain polyhedra can be stacked in a regular crystal pattern to fill (or tile) three-dimensional space, including the cube (the only Platonic polyhedron to do so), the rhombic dodecahedron, the truncated octahedron, and triangular, <b>quadrilateral,</b> and hexagonal prisms, among others. Any polyhedron that fits this criterion {{is known as a}} plesiohedron, and may possess between 4 and 38 faces. Naturally occurring rhombic dodecahedra are found as crystals of andradite (a kind of garnet) and fluorite.|$|E

5|$|The new Revelin {{became the}} strongest {{of the city}} fortresses, {{safeguarding}} the eastern land approach to the city. Shaped {{in the form of}} an irregular <b>quadrilateral</b> with one of its sides descending towards the sea, it is protected by a deep ditch on the other. One bridge crosses the protective ditch and connects it to the Ploče Gate, while another bridge connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed so perfectly so that the devastating earthquake of 1667 did not damage Revelin. Divided into three large vaulted rooms in its interior, Revelin became the administrative center of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the <b>quadrilateral</b> maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|The Minčeta Tower {{was built}} by a local builder named Nicifor Ranjina and Italian {{engineers}} sent by Pope Pius II in 1463, {{at the height of}} the Turkish threat. Originally as a strong four-sided fort, it is the most prominent point in the defensive system towards the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the Menčetić family, who owned the ground upon which the tower was built. By its height and impressive volume, the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and its walls. In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier <b>quadrilateral</b> fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower using new warfare technique and joined it to the new system of low scarp walls. The full six-meter (20feet) thick walls of the new tower had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor Giorgio da Sebenico of Zadar continued the work on the Minčeta tower. He designed and built the high narrow round tower while the battlements are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464 and became the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.|$|E

Roughly 206 million years old and 3.7 ± 1 times as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded and cooled to a surface temperature of around 5,100K {{and is now a}} yellow bright giant star of spectral type G5II. It likely spent most of its existence as a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B7V. Bearing the proper name of Minkar and marking the raven's nostril is Epsilon Corvi, located some 318 ± 5 light-years from Earth. It is a red giant of spectral type K2III that is around 54 times the Sun's radius and 930 times its luminosity. Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main-sequence star of spectral type B5V. Lying to the south of the <b>quadrilateral</b> between Beta and Epsilon Corvi is the orange-hued 6 Corvi, an ageing giant star of spectral type K1III that is around 70 times as luminous as the Sun.

25|$|In Euclidean geometry, a {{tangential}} <b>quadrilateral</b> (sometimes just tangent <b>quadrilateral)</b> or circumscribed <b>quadrilateral</b> is a convex <b>quadrilateral</b> whose {{sides are}} all tangent {{to a single}} circle within the <b>quadrilateral.</b> This circle is called the incircle of the <b>quadrilateral</b> or its inscribed circle, its center is the incenter and its radius is called the inradius. Since these quadrilaterals can be drawn surrounding or circumscribing their incircles, they have also been called circumscribable quadrilaterals, circumscribing quadrilaterals, and circumscriptible quadrilaterals. Tangential quadrilaterals are a special case of tangential polygons.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} preservice elementary teachers' images for some special <b>quadrilaterals.</b> The case study was conducted with 6 preservice elementary teachers. The data were collected by clinical interviews to evaluate preservice teachers’ images for <b>quadrilaterals.</b> Hence, initially, the questionnaire consisting of two parts was given to preservice teachers. In the first part, preservice teachers were asked to draw 3 different squares, rectangles, trapezoids and parallegroms; they were asked to identify these <b>quadrilaterals</b> in the second part. Clinical interviews were conducted by preservice teachers about the questionnaire; thus, preservice teachers’ concept images and own definitions for some special <b>quadrilaterals</b> were defined. The data were analyzed by descriptive analysis. It was revealed that preservice teachers drew <b>quadrilaterals</b> incorrectly not to show notation, know the properties, and classify the relationship between them.

25|$|In 1996, Vaynshtejn was {{probably}} the first to prove another beautiful characterization of tangential quadrilaterals, that has later appeared in several magazines and websites. It states that when a convex <b>quadrilateral</b> is divided into four nonoverlapping triangles by its two diagonals, then the incenters of the four triangles are concyclic {{if and only if}} the <b>quadrilateral</b> is tangential. In fact, the incenters form an orthodiagonal cyclic <b>quadrilateral.</b> A related result is that the incircles can be exchanged for the excircles to the same triangles (tangent to the sides of the <b>quadrilateral</b> and the extensions of its diagonals). Thus a convex <b>quadrilateral</b> is tangential if and only if the excenters in these four excircles are the vertices of a cyclic <b>quadrilateral.</b>|$|E
