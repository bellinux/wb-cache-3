5|$|Han-era {{mechanical}} engineering comes {{largely from the}} choice observational writings of sometimes-disinterested Confucian scholars who generally considered scientific and engineering endeavors to be far beneath them. Professional artisan-engineers (jiang 匠) did not leave behind detailed records of their work. Han scholars, who often {{had little or no}} expertise in {{mechanical engineering}}, sometimes provided insufficient information on the various technologies they described. Nevertheless, some Han literary sources provide crucial information. For example, in 15 BC the philosopher and writer Yang Xiong described the invention of the belt drive for a <b>quilling</b> machine, which was of great importance to early textile manufacturing. The inventions of mechanical engineer and craftsman Ding Huan (丁緩) are mentioned in the Miscellaneous Notes on the Western Capital. Around 180 AD, Ding created a manually operated rotary fan used for air conditioning within palace buildings. Ding also used gimbals as pivotal supports for one of his incense burners and invented the world's first known zoetrope lamp.|$|E

The belt drive was not only used in textile technologies, it was also applied to hydraulic powered bellows dated from the 1st century AD.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is covered}} in {{multiple}} layers of modified hair called <b>quills,</b> with longer, thinner <b>quills</b> covering a layer of shorter, thicker ones. The <b>quills</b> are brown or black with alternating white and black bands. They are made of keratin and are relatively flexible. Each <b>quill</b> is connected to a muscle at its base, allowing the porcupine to raise its <b>quills</b> when it feels threatened. The longest <b>quills</b> are located on the neck and shoulder, where the <b>quills</b> form a [...] "skirt" [...] around the animal. These <b>quills</b> can grow up to 51 cm (20 in) long, with most measuring between 15-30 cm. Smaller (20 cm) and more rigid <b>quills</b> are packed densely {{on the back and}} rump. These smaller <b>quills</b> are used to stab at potential threats. The base of the tail contains shorter <b>quills</b> that appear white in color, with longer, hollow <b>quills</b> that the porcupine can rattle to produce a warning sound when threatened. Contrary to popular belief, Indian crested porcupines (like all porcupines) cannot shoot their <b>quills.</b>|$|R

The porcupines <b>quills</b> can grow up to 40 cm long, they naturally drop <b>quills</b> so they are easily collected by hand.

Clearly, boxes with broader <b>quills</b> from cuts near the <b>quill</b> base are cheaper. Conversely those with fine <b>quills</b> are much more desirable and thus valuable. There are two types of <b>quill,</b> the first with distinct dark and white bands and the other with plain blond colouration. The coloured <b>quills</b> were used to make chevron patterns, whilst the blond <b>quills</b> offered a cleaner look.|$|R

A year had now elapsed since her sad marriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of her then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple country girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft gray woollen gown, with white crape <b>quilling</b> against the pink skin of her face and neck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Underwood {{was much}} amused. He {{felt he had}} found a {{character}} in his newly-discovered cousin. She was Underwood all over in his eyes, used to the characteristic family features, although entirely devoid of that delicacy and refinement of form and complexion that was so remarkable in himself and in most of his children, who were all, except poor little Cherry, a good deal alike, and most of them handsome. There was a sort of clumsiness in the shape of every outline, and a coarseness in the colouring, that made her like a bad drawing of one of his own girls; the eyes were larger, the red of the cheeks was redder, the lips were thicker, the teeth were irregular; the figure, instead of being what the French call elance, was short, high-shouldered, and thick-set, and the head looked too large. She was over-dressed, too, with a smart hat and spangled feather, a womanly silk mantle and much-trimmed skirt, from which a heavy <b>quilling</b> had detached itself, and was trailing on the ground; her hands were ungloved, and showed red stumpy fingers, but her face had a bright open honest heartiness of expression, and a sort of resolute straightforwardness, that attracted and pleased him; and, moreover, there was something in the family likeness, grotesque as it was, that could not but arouse a fellow-feeling in his warm and open heart, which neither neglect nor misfortune had ever chilled.|$|E
60|$|The glass shows a {{tall and}} slender young woman of three-and-twenty years of age. She {{is not at}} all {{the sort of person who}} attracts {{attention}} in the street, seeing that she fails to exhibit the popular yellow hair and the popular painted cheeks. Her hair is black; dressed, in these later days (as it was dressed years since to please her father), in broad ripples drawn back from the forehead, and gathered into a simple knot behind (like the hair of the Venus de Medicis), so as to show the neck beneath. Her complexion is pale: except in moments of violent agitation there is no color to be seen in her face. Her eyes are of so dark a blue that they are generally mistaken for black. Her eyebrows are well enough in form, but they are too dark and too strongly marked. Her nose just inclines toward the aquiline bend, and is considered a little too large by persons difficult to please in the matter of noses. The mouth, her best feature, is very delicately shaped, and is capable of presenting great varieties of expression. As to the face in general, it is too narrow and too long at the lower part, too broad and too low in the higher regions of the eyes and the head. The whole picture, as reflected in the glass, represents a woman of some elegance, rather too pale, and rather too sedate and serious in her moments of silence and repose--in short, a person who fails to strike the ordinary observer at first sight, but who gains in general estimation on a second, and sometimes on a third view. As for her dress, it studiously conceals, instead of proclaiming, that she has been married that morning. She wears a gray cashmere tunic trimmed with gray silk, and having a skirt of the same material and color beneath it. On her head is a bonnet to match, relieved by a <b>quilling</b> of white muslin with one deep red rose, as a morsel of positive color, to complete the effect of the whole dress.|$|E
6000|$|The ladies perhaps feared a hoax of some sort, {{and would}} not ask to see the letter; and then Hoskins {{recognized}} his failure to play upon their curiosity with a laugh, and gave the letter to Mrs. Elmore. It was {{an invitation to a}} mask ball, of which all Venice had begun to speak. A great Russian lady, who had come to spend the winter in the Lagoons, and had taken a whole floor at one of the hotels, had sent out her cards, apparently to all the available people in the city, for the event which was to take place a fortnight later. In the mean time, a thrill of preparation was felt in various quarters, and the ordinary course of life was interrupted in a way that gave some idea of the old times, when Venice was the capital of pleasure, and everything yielded there to the great business of amusement. Mrs. Elmore had found it impossible to get a pair of fine shoes finished until after the ball; a dress which Lily had ordered could not be made; their laundress had given notice that for the present all fluting and <b>quilling</b> was out of the question; one already heard that the chief Venetian perruquier and his assistants were engaged for every moment of the forty-eight hours before the ball, and that whoever had him now must sit up with her hair dressed for two nights at least. Mrs. Elmore had a fanatical faith in these stories; and while agreeing with her husband, as a matter of principle, that mask balls were wrong, and that it was in bad taste for a foreigner to insult the sorrow of Venice by a festivity of the sort at such a time, she had secretly indulged longings which the sight of Hoskins's invitation rendered almost insupportable. Her longings were not for herself, but for Lily: if she could provide Lily with the experience of a masquerade in Venice, she could overpay all the kindnesses that the Mayhews had ever done her. It was an ambition neither ignoble nor ungenerous, and it was with a really heroic effort that she silenced it in passing the invitation to her husband, and simply saying to Hoskins, [...] "Of course you will go." ...|$|E
