[...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic.

He also praised Six Flags for the choice of theme, saying, [...] "the Superman theme is ideally suited for the flying concept and adds a nice touch". Alex Bove of Ultimate Rollercoaster also reviewed the ride favorably: [...] "From its comfortable restraints, silky ride and delightful pacing to its avian aesthetics, Superman: Ultimate Flight demonstrates B's unmatched attention to detail and their genuine desire to create enjoyable rides that surprise us over and over again". Jeremy Thompson of Roller Coaster Philosophy compared the ride unfavorably to , which also appears at all three parks: [...] "Batman is gritty and intense and based on quick variations in the layout, while Superman is graceful and slower paced, based on creating a singular flight sensation, and <b>quite</b> <b>honestly</b> it's all a tad boring".

50|$|It is {{not just}} the coalition's stance on key issues or mean-spirited {{political}} tactics that we should be concerned about. It is something even more fundamental: the denigration of political debate in Australia that is being driven by the opposition leader and his team. In America, this sort of shrill, fear-driven campaigning led to the tragic shooting of United States congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. How much further will the opposition leader go until his tactics lead to a similar disaster occurring in Australia? Already the political narrative, relentlessly pursued by the opposition leader and shadow Treasurer, has unleashed responses in some sections of the public that are <b>honestly</b> <b>quite</b> frightening. This can be largely attributed to the fact that coalition politicians are free to associate themselves with Tea Party style protests which place a premium on ignorance, and disregard informed decision or discussion of policy or leadership.|$|R

According to Stryper's Facebook page, Sweet said: [...] "I {{reached out}} to Clint {{and asked him if}} he would like to co-write a track or two for the new Stryper album.

6000|$|There {{has dropped}} upon {{the table as}} I write a modest {{periodical}} called THE NORTHERN BRITISH ISRAEL REVIEW, illustrated with portraits of various clergymen of the Church of England, and of ladies and gentlemen who belong to the little school of thought which this magazine represents; it is, I should judge, a sub-sect entirely within the Established Church of England, {{that is to say}} within the Anglican communion of the Trinitarian Christians. It contains among other papers a very entertaining summary by a gentleman entitled--I cite the unusual title-page of the periodical--"Landseer Mackenzie, Esq.," [...] of the views of Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Obadiah upon the Kaiser William. They are distinctly hostile views. Mr. Landseer Mackenzie discourses not only upon these anticipatory condemnations but also upon the relations of the weather to this war. He is convinced <b>quite</b> simply and <b>honestly</b> that God has been persistently rigging the weather against the Germans. He points out that the absence of mist on the North Sea was of great help to the British in the autumn of 1914, and declares that it was the wet state of the country that really held up the Germans in Flanders in the winter of 1914-15. He ignores the part played by the weather in delaying the relief of Kut-el-Amara, and he has not thought of the difficult question why the Deity, having once decided upon intervention, did not, instead of this comparatively trivial meteorological assistance, adopt the more effective course of, for example, exploding or spoiling the German stores of ammunition by some simple atomic miracle, or misdirecting their gunfire by a sudden local modification of the laws of refraction or gravitation.|$|R

2500|$|In 1981, {{the success}} of her {{performance}} in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Four in a Million led to many offers; one being the chance to move into television comedy.

She initially turned down the offer. [...] "My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all those sort of cliches just bore me rigid."

[...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not what I had in mind. Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games.
