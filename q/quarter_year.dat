In 2000, daytime viewership of the network peaked at 343,000, around the time the Nasdaq Composite crossed 5000. However, when the dot-com bubble began to burst later that year, CNBC's viewing figures declined in tandem. The network's ratings steadily fell quarter after <b>quarter,</b> <b>year</b> after year, until bottoming in Q1 2005, with an average viewership of 134,000 during the day. From the bottom, the network, along with the markets, rebounded significantly – average daytime viewership (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.) reached a 7-year high of 310,000 viewers {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Coinciding with the extreme market volatility of the ongoing global economic crisis, ratings hit an all-time high of 416,000 in Q3. Although the figures remain considerably less than those achieved by Fox News and CNN today, it has still had a 210% increase in viewership since the beginning of 2005. Despite the viewership slump at the turn of the decade, CNBC has remained extremely profitable: average annual revenues top $500 million while profits for the network exceeded $333 million in 2007, making CNBC a cash cow for NBC Universal and its parent company, Comcast. CNBC is the second most profitable of NBC Universal's thirteen cable channels in the United States, behind only the USA Network.|$|E

A total of 85 mango growing farmers were randomly selected for interviewing. The dominant mango orchard based patterns are: i) Wheat-Fallow-T. Aman (30 %); and ii) Mustard-Fallow-T. Amam (29 %). About 75 % farmers are transforming crop land into mango orchard because of water scarcity, high profitability, easy cultivation process, land suitability and favourable environment for mango cultivation. Mango farmers obtained on average 231 kg/ha yield in 1 st <b>quarter</b> (<b>year</b> 1 - 3) and then production increased sharply and reached 2, 190 kg/ha in 5 th <b>quarter</b> (<b>year</b> 13 - 15). The highest gross return of mango was found in the 5 th quarter. The estimated net present worth (NPW) of the project was Tk 99, 588 per hectare, which indicates that mango cultivation was profitable in Rajshahi area. The internal rate of return (IRR) was 28 %, which is higher than the opportunity cost of capital. However, increasing life span of mango orchard increases yield loss of both rice and non-rice crops. In 11 -year-old mango orchard, intercrop yield reduced drastically (65 %). More than 83 % farmers obtained increased income and about 67 % achieved better livelihoods due to mango cultivation. However, there is a possibility to decrease food grain, pulses, oil seed and vegetable production in the long run. Therefore, planned mango cultivation is needed along with ensured credit facilities through both institutional and non-institutional sources for mango cultivation, preservation and marketing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Against the {{background}} of a decreasing number of general practitioners (GPs) in rural regions in Germany, the AGnES-concept (AGnES = GP-supporting, community-based, e-health-assisted, systemic intervention) supports the delegation of regular GP-home visits to qualified practice assistants. The concept was implemented and evaluated in different model projects in Germany. To explore the economic effects of this concept, {{the development of the}} number of home visits in an ambulatory healthcare centre was analysed and compared with the number of home visits in the surrounding county. Methods Information about GP-home visits was derived from reimbursement data of the ambulatory healthcare centre and a statutory health insurance. Information about home visits conducted by AGnES-practice assistants was collected from the project documentation over a time period of 12 consecutive <b>quarter</b> <b>years,</b> four <b>quarter</b> <b>years</b> before the beginning of the project and 8 <b>quarter</b> <b>years</b> while the project was implemented, considering background temporal trends on the population level in the study region. Results Within the ambulatory healthcare centre, the home visits by the GPs significantly decreased, especially the number of medically urgent home visits. However, the overall rate of home visits (conducted by the GPs and the AGnES-practice assistants together) did not change significantly after implementation of the AGnES-concept. In the surrounding county, the home visit rates of the GPs were continuous; the temporal patterns were approximately equal for both usual and urgent home visits. Conclusion The results of the analyses show that the support by AGnES-practice assistants led to a decrease of GP-home visits rather than an induction of additional home visits by the AGnES-practice assistants. The most extended effect is related to the medically urgent home visits rather than to the usual home visits. </p...|$|R
