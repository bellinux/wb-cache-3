The most common method in organic orchard to eliminate weeds on the raw consists of tillage operations. However, some drawbacks of these mechanical methods have been demonstrated: (1) the energetic cost (non-renewable energy) is high, (2) this method is time-consuming, (3) tillage interferes {{with the development of}} superficial roots and can hurt the trunk, (4) the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil can be disturb and (5) erosion and runoff potentially increase. Cover crops are interesting alternatives to manage ground cover but the effect on the agronomic properties and the soil fertility of these methods should be assessed.

40|$|Choosing an alfalfa {{variety is}} arguably {{one of the}} most {{important}} decisions to make in an alfalfa operation. Variety selection impacts yield, forage <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> resistance and the life of a stand. The consequences of a poor decision last for years after establishment. Poor stand persistence can increase stand establishment costs (stands must be replanted more often) and reduce overall production revenue. While very important to most growers, the cost of seed should actually play a minor role when weighed against other more important considerations including yield, disease and insect resistance and other performance characteristics. A ‘savings ’ of $ 1 per pound of seed can lead to losses of hundreds of dollars from reduced yield over the life of the stand.

40|$|There {{is a large}} {{literature}} on the estimation of frontier production functions, much of it applied to low-income agriculture. However, much of this literature largely ignores nature's role in agricultural production. Because exogenous, natural production conditions (e. g., rainfall, soil <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> infestation, plant disease, weed growth) are rarely uniform or symmetrically distributed within a population or a sample thereof, this omission generally leads to downward bias in producers' estimated efficiency and to biased estimates of both {{the parameters of the}} production frontier and the correlates of true technical inefficiency. Using panel data from 464 traditional rice plots in Cote d'Ivoire, we show that controlling for stochastic, exogenous, natural production conditions in estimating the production frontier significantly increases smallholder rice farmers' estimated efficiency, whether estimated using parametric, stochastic or nonparametric, nonstochastic methods. The resulting frontier parameter estimates are also more consistent with theoretical predictions than are those of a frontier estimated without controlling for exogenous production conditions. Conventional estimates of technical efficiency may then mislead policymakers' perceptions of overall efficiency levels and of the sources of such inefficiency. Production Economics,...|$|E

This article emphasizes the value of bridging primary scientific research with undergraduate education through the presentation of an integrated experiential learning and primary research model called Farm-based Authentic Research Modules in Sustainability Sciences (FARMS). FARMS are collaboratively designed with agricultural stakeholders through a community needs assessment on pressing food system issues and opportunities with the objective for faculty and students to jointly identify evidence-based management solutions. We illustrate the implementation of FARMS in an undergraduate course in Ecological Agriculture at Dartmouth College, NH where students assessed various agroecological solutions for managing plant vitality, weeds, soil <b>quality,</b> <b>pests,</b> pollinators, and biodiversity at the Dartmouth Organic Farm. Student reflections indicate that the FARMS course component was beneficial for understanding agroecological theories and concepts while also motivating involvement in sustainability sciences despite the challenges of primary research.

40|$|The {{ability of}} agroecosystems to provide food {{ultimately}} {{depends on the}} regulating and supporting ecosystem services that underpin their functioning, such as the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, and pollinators. However, there are trade-offs between provisioning and regulating or supporting services, whose nature at the farm and plot scales is poorly understood. We analyzed data at the farm level for two agroecosystems with contrasting objectives in central Mexico: one aimed at staple crop production for self-subsistence and local markets, the other directed to a cash crop for export markets. Bivariate and multivariate trade-offs were analyzed for different crop management strategies (conventional, organic, traditional, crop rotation) and their underpinning socioeconomic drivers. There was a clear trade-off between crop yield and soil quality in self-subsistence systems. However, other expected trade-offs between yields and soil quality did not always occur, likely because of the overall good soils {{of the region and}} the low to medium input profile of most farms. Trade-offs were highly dependent on farm-specific agricultural practices; organic, traditional, and rotation management systems generally showed smaller trade-offs between yield and soil <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> control, and biodiversity than did conventional management systems. Perceived drivers reported by farmers included increasing prices for cash crops, rising costs of inputs, and extreme climatic events (e. g., drought, hail, frost). Farmers did not identify the regulation of soil quality, water quality, soil erosion, pests, or pollinators as important constraints. Although acceptable yields could be maintained irrespective of key regulating and supporting services according to these perceptions, current levels of soil erosion and nutrient runoff are likely to have important negative effects at the watershed scale. Sustainability in both agroecosystems could be increased substantially by promoting alternative practices aimed at maintaining biodiversity, soil quality, and soil retention...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} organic versus {{conventional}} growing practise on yield, <b>quality,</b> <b>pests</b> and diseases of three vegetable crops were examined. Cultivars of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. convar. Botrytis), bulb onions (Allium cepa L.) and carrots (Daucus carota) were grown organically and conventionally {{during the years}} 2000 - 2003. Differences in cultivar yield, quality and resistance towards pests were determined. However, none of the cultivars were observed to be superior in the conventional compared to the organic growing system. Yields of conventional cauliflower and onions were higher than when grown organically, whereas no differences in carrot yields were observed between the two systems. A larger percentage of the harvested conventional onions were discarded, reducing the difference in net yield between the two systems. Generally, the reasons for discarding varied between the two systems. In organic cauliflower damage by slugs and loose curds were {{the main reasons for}} discarding. Loose curds can be explained by nitrogen deficiency while the damage by slugs is ascribed to the warm and humid environment created under insect nets used in the organic growing system. In both systems, the most severe reason for discarding of onions was exterior watery scales. Rot and mold were more pronounced in the conventional system whereas thick-necked onions were more frequent in the organic system due to larger distance between the onions. Conventional carrots were significantly more damaged by carrot flies than organic carrots even though the flies were present in the organic system and pesticides were applied in the conventional system. In contrast, more deform carrots were seen in the organic system. Generally, less organically crops were discarded due to pests, which presumably {{can be explained by the}} resistance of organic crops towards pests due to the increased diversity of microbial biomass and presence of insect natural enemies. On the contrary, the lower yields in organically grown vegetables can mainly be explained by morphological defects probably created by changes in growing system design in order to facilitate weed management. ...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{use of the}} {{persistent}} and potent neonicotinoid and fipronil insecticides has raised concerns about risks to ecosystem functions provided by {{a wide range of}} species and environments affected by these insecticides. The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials, benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity, but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees) and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystem functions regulating soil and water <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> control, pollination, ecosystem resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes, invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators, consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and invertebrate populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling, were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and/or fipronil at environmentally relevant concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish {{do not appear to be}} as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall, we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem services that humans fundamentally depend on...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work were to investigate the suitability of selected varieties of vegetables and potatoes for organic production using organic or untreated seed on certified organic sites. Organic growing of vegetables and potatoes imposes restrictions on the treatments which growers can apply to crops to maximise yield and maintain quality. Hence choice of variety is more critical in organic situations than for conventional crops where problems can be solved {{at a later date}} by application of pesticides or fertilisers. Varieties are needed that can respond to the sometimes sub optimum conditions that are imposed by the restrictions of organic systems and identification of these are not always evident from trials under conventional conditions. In addition, variety choice may be restricted for organic growers as they are required to use organically produced seed of a variety where it is available. Derogation allows the use of untreated conventional seed where suitable varieties are not available organically. This project tested: 	 available organic seed as much of it has not been evaluated in any UK trials 	untreated seed of varieties in production for organic seed 	attempted to identify varieties of conventional seed that would be useful in organic systems so that organic seed can be produced. In this 3 year period trials were carried out on leeks, cabbage, celery, broccoli, lettuce, cauliflowers, carrots and potatoes. Varieties were assessed for yield, <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> and disease resistance and shelf life and storage where appropriate. Seed health was also checked to ascertain levels of seed borne disease. Results from these trials; Leeks Leeks were reasonably easy to grow organically. In our trials the main problems were weed control and leek rust infection although there is also the risk of thrip and White Tip infection. In some of the trials there was also an obvious nutrient shortage. A wide range of varieties is available differing in maturity, shank length disease resistance and winter-hardiness. In general the requirements of organic leek growers closely match those of conventional growers. Very few hybrids are available as organic seed. Cabbage 2001 to 2003 trials included a wide range of types. As for other brassica crops aphid infestation and speed of development were the most important factors in discriminating between varieties. In general smooth varieties were less affected than blistered varieties, early maturing varieties less affected than lates and red varieties less than green or white types. Celery Organic celery needs to be grown on water retaining soils and given adequate irrigation. just like the ICM crop. The biggest problem for the crop is Septoria, which can devastate plants very quickly. Starting with clean seed is essential but air-borne infection can come in from infected crops or debris. Giving plants better airflow from wider spacings or bed systems seems to delay infection. Slugs can also cause problems and data on both these problems was recorded and included in the published results. Broccoli Growing organic broccoli trials presented similar pest problems to other brassica crops in that cabbage root fly has to be avoided at establishment and aphid and caterpillar attacks later on. Fleece was used on all early trials but in later years it was not used to allow for easier weed control. Broccoli was fairly competitive with weeds and some recent trials were only hand weeded once. Fertility seems to be a problem and we did not achieve heavy crown weights. Lettuce A wide range of types of lettuce are important for organic growers and this series of trials included butterhead, crisphead, Batavian, Cos, Little Gem and leaf types. Vigour, flavour, disease, pest and tipburn resistance are all important characters for a successful organic variety. Fortunately there are more genetic pest and disease differences available in lettuce than for most other vegetable crops. In addition a large number of varieties are available as organic seed. Cauliflower Three maturity periods were sampled i. e. summer, late autumn and Spring Heading. Aphid and caterpillar damage were major problems and there was some evidence of varietal differences in susceptibility. When conventional trials with similar varieties were grown from the same planting dates the organic varieties were slower to mature. This may have been because nitrogen was more limited. Very few varieties of cauliflower are offered as organic seed and growers would struggle to find a good continuity program. Carrots The 2001 to 2003 trials concentrated on main crop varieties. A successful organic carrot variety needs most of the following: good early vigour to emerge quickly and compete with weeds, rapid bulking to compensate if late sowing is used to ovoid first generation carrot fly, large top for weed suppression and any pest or disease resistance available. Several mainly hybrid varieties performed very well in these trials. Potatoes Good seed quality is a fundamental in the production of a quality crop. Chitted seed will encourage rapid emergence and aid in better weed control and earlier bulking leading to bolder tuber samples. Variety selection should be made for rapid establishment, good ground cover, early bulking yield potential and a good resistance to pests and diseases, especially late blight. Sharpo Axona and Sharpo Mira had outstanding blight resistance. Shelf Life Shelf life depended on the health of produce tested. If healthy clean material was tested results were similar to those of conventional vegetables. If there was disease or pest damage {{at the beginning of a}} shelf life test then produce tended to deteriorate more quickly. Seed Health Seed borne disease levels were checked by the OSTS. In general brassicas were reasonably clean but some carrot and celery seed lots had high levels of Alternaria or Septoria infection. All trials were reported as NIAB One year results and also made available on the COSI web site: www. COSI. org In addition, data for over 400 varieties was summarised and published in the NIAB Organic Vegetable Handbook. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Beyond the intrinsic, {{aesthetic}} and spiritual values one may assign to nature, the reasons {{to manage it}} are multiple due to its central role in a wide panel of ecological functions crucial to human wellbeing and development. For instance, biological structures and ecological processes provide us food, raw materials, water and energy, protect us against erosion or floods, control water <b>quality,</b> <b>pest</b> impact, pollination, give us large enjoyable spaces for recreation, sport and leisure activities, etc. Despite contributing considerably to economic development, social welfare and health, natural resources have often been considered as inexhaustible and unlimited which has caused dramatic damages in economic, social and environmental issues. This is mainly {{explained by the fact}} that many ecosystem services (ES) are ‘public goods’ or ‘common goods’: they are often open access in character and non-rival in their consumption. Market and policy decisions often fail to capture most ES values with the exception of a few marketed provisioning ecosystem services ‘ES’ (e. g. food, timber). This systematic under-valuation of ecosystem services and failure to capture the values is one of the main causes underlying today’s biodiversity crisis 1. ES valuations can serve as methodological baseline for decision support tools aiming at more sustainability thus guiding and accelerating transition. To sustainably manage the supply and the demand of ES, the policy level needs to gain knowledge on where and which services are provided 2 – 4 and who are the stakeholders involved. ES maps provide an explicit link between the biophysical data of the ecosystem and expectations of main concerned stakeholders 2. There are an essential tool to help for more holistic and transparent decision processes. Additionally, ES valuations allow highlighting ES hotspots, bundles and trade-offs and priority areas for action 5. At last, ES valuations can serve as policy efficiency barometer by measuring ES before and after a specific measure. The importance of the ES in policy is reflected at several levels. At the European level, the Strategy 2020 for biodiversity (resulting from the United Nation convention on biological diversity) presents the objective to ‘preserve and enhance ecosystems and their services’. Under this objective, one of the actions requested to member states is to ‘map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services in their national territory by 2014 ’ 6. Recently, the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) was launched to guide the flow of scientific information related to biodiversity and ES to governments and practitioners 7. In this context, the Walloon government decided to work on the ‘development of the implementation of the ES concept into practice within the Public Service of Wallonia (SPW) ’ (Walloon governmental decision 24 / 04 / 2014). To put the ES concept into practice, a common platform, entitled ‘WalES’, is currently being designed. Objectives The objectives of the WalES platform are multifold: •	Developing a common interface between administrations and scientists and multiple actors to share up-to-date information, methods, tools, means, experiences, multiple data flows at multiple levels, etc. in order to organize a common information system on ecosystem services and develop a common methodological platform. •	Providing a planification tool through the assessment and mapping of ES to highlight ES hotspots, priority areas for action and discrepancies between ES demand and supply, all providing valuable information to optimize planification. •	Providing an impact assessment tool assessing ES before and after a project (e. g. infrastructure building) or a political measure (e. g. agri-environmental measures) in order to test their efficiencies and their impacts on sustainability. •	Communicating to the public the importance of ES and the dependency of humans, society and economy upon them, hence demonstrating the emergency to take actions. Procedure and outcomes of the WalES project Since the platform aims at serving policy making, its development consults actors in an iterative way and by different means. Through an accompanying committee, different actors from distinct background follow and guide the project from its premises to its finalization. Among them, policy makers, Directorate Generals from the Walloon Region, university scientists and Governmental research agencies are involved. Additionally, consultations with the civil society are planned. Such participatory approaches are known, especially in ES valuation science, to improve the procedural quality of the assessment and provide assessments better answering the needs and questions of the different parties. As first step, all Directorates General of SPW have been consulted in order to identify fields within the distinct missions of SPW for which the development of ES-based tools would be feasible and desirable. From there, the project structure, method and objectives have been established. In a second and on-going step, all structures, research projects and actors involved are being inventoried in order to get insight into what is being done, what is already accomplished and what remains to be done. Simultaneously, a common and shared information system detailing all data and data flows which could serve as indicator or proxy or models for ES measurements, collecting all experiences and methods on ES valuation available at the Walloon and more detailed scales and proposing standardized or recommended ES evaluation method are developed. This common and shared database will be made available on the net for dissemination of ES holistic approaches and should be updated on a participative way. Subsequently, ES assessments and maps of the Walloon regions is developed in order to fulfill the requirements of the Biodiversity Strategy 2020. A conceptual and methodological framework is designed and will be submitted to stakeholders. A Walloon ES classification with corresponding indicators is setup and a methodology for mapping and assessing ES at various scales is developed. However, the framework and information system are not only defined as a simple recurring reporting tool. The holistic approach should be put in practices on a large spectrum of activities on the fields of agriculture, forestry, water management, nature conservation, rural development plan, urban development, tourism activities, etc. and all field experiences should be shared to demonstrate how it works and what are the limits. The ability of ES approach as decision support tool by different stakeholders will be assessed. Concurrently, a website is established in order to accomplish the communication objectives of the project. Besides communicating the importance of ES assessments and conservation for sustainability, the website serves as interactive platform where the methodological framework, the Walloon ES classification and the database of all indicators and proxy available is made available to all stakeholders or researchers needing some baseline. It thus also serves as a facilitating tool for future research on ES providing theoretical and practical information to ensure their sound scientific background and their practical policy implementation. Conclusions: implications of the project in terms of sustainable development The link between ES and sustainable development has now been the center of political and scientific attention for a while 1, 8 – 10. Much research is being carried out developing frameworks, tools and models to assess and map ES 11 – 13. More recently, the importance of the ES concept as decision support tool for policy makers has been put forward. It is stated that ES assessments could guide policy decisions towards more sustainability by adding social and environmental criteria to the economic ones usually relied on 14. In that sense, ES assessments could accelerate the transition by providing sound information upon which sustainable policy decisions could be made. However, to date, despite being a hot topic, ES assessments serving policy decisions are sparse 15 and the challenge for real integration remains 16. The WalES project is thus a real opportunity for the Walloon government and science to bind together to contribute to filling in this gap while simultaneously comply with European baseline by providing the requested national ES assessments and mapping.

Key effects will be felt through changes in the timing of the crop calendar and hence the farming year in: <b>quality,</b> yield, <b>pest</b> and disease management and crop distribution. Farmers may adapt readily to changes in average climate since effects will be gradual, but adaptations to some extremes will require more forward planning. Possible adaptation options by farmers, e. g. changing crop cultivars, and the wider industry, e. g. developing new varieties, need to be considered. Given the range of permutations affecting the predictions of UK arable agriculture, the paper considers what more may be done to help the industry address problems and opportunities presented by climate change...|$|R

After 168 days of storage in oil treated boxes Sitotroga cerealella population was significantly lower in oil treated paddy than the control. The 1000 grain weight was higher in all three treatments (21. 1 - 22. 9 g) compared to the control (19. 8 g). Percentage grain damage was lower in C. citratus and C. nardus treated paddy than the control. The percentage seed germination was {{not significantly different from}} that of the control in oil treated paddy though, in C. citratus treatment the seed germination was reduced. The milling quality of paddy was not affected by the essential oil treatment however; the flavour and stickiness of cooked rice was enhanced when treated with C. zeylanicum and C. citratus oils.

Willd.; Anthocephalus cadamba Miq.; Paraserianthes falcataria (L.) Nielsen; and Swietenia macrophylla King. Smallholders in Indonesia have planted trees on private or community land for a long time. Various actors have encouraged this activity to improve local livelihoods, environmental sustainability and industrial wood supply. These efforts have been generally successful, but they are often undertaken without technical assistance. Since farmers often lack technical capacity and management know-how, {{the quality and quantity of}} products may not be optimal.
