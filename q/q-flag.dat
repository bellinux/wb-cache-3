The irreducible representations correspond to the spaces of local sections of certain line bundles over the <b>q-flag</b> manifold. 1 1. Introduction. Recently, following the canonical procedure for q = 1 [1], the left regular representation, its reduction to infinite family of (reducible and irreducible) representations and the q-difference intertwining operators were studied on the examples of Lorentz quantum algebra [2], of slq(2) and its contraction to eq(2) [3]. In this paper we investigate th...|$|E
