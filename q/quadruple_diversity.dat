50|$|Civilian {{troposcatter}} systems, {{such as the}} British Telecom (BT) North Sea oil communications network, required higher capacity ‘information’ channels {{than were}} available using HF (high frequency - 3 to 30 MHz) radio signals, before satellite technology was available. The BT systems, based at Scousburgh in the Shetland Islands, Mormond Hill in Aberdeenshire and Row Brow near Scarborough, were capable of transmitting and receiving 156 analogue (4 kHz bandwidth) channels of data and telephony to / from North Sea oil production platforms, using frequency-division multiplexing (FDMX) to combine the channels. Because {{of the nature of}} the turbulence in the troposphere, <b>quadruple</b> <b>diversity</b> propagation paths were used to ensure 99.98% reliability of the service, equating to about 3 minutes of downtime due to propagation drop out per month. The quadruple space and polarisation diversity systems needed two separate dish antennae (spaced several metres apart) and two differently polarised feed horns - one using vertical polarisation, the other using horizontal polarisation. This ensured that at least one signal path was open at any one time. The signals from the four different paths were recombined in the receiver where a phase corrector removed the phase differences of each signal. Phase differences were caused by the different path lengths of each signal from transmitter to receiver. Once phase corrected, the four signals could be combined additively.|$|E

40|$|Space-Time Block Coded (STBC) In-phase/Quadrature-phase (IQ) -interleaved Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) and Turbo TCM (TTCM) schemes are proposed, {{which are}} capable of <b>quadrupling</b> the {{achievable}} <b>diversity</b> order of the conventional symbol-interleaved TCM and TTCM schemes, when two transmit antennas are employed. The increased diversity order of the proposed schemes provides significant additional coding gains, when communicating over non-dispersive Rayleigh fading channels, which is achieved without compromising the coding gain attainable over Gaussian channels. Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) as well as Iteratively Decoded BICM (BICM-ID) are also incorporated into the proposed system and their performance is compared to that to TCM and TTCM...|$|R
