5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high <b>Q</b> <b>factor</b> (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The journal Medical Physics {{recently}} published two papers that determine beam quality conversion <b>factors,</b> k <b>Q,</b> for large sets of ion chambers. In the first paper McEwen Med. Phys. 37, 2179 - 2193 (2010), k Q was determined experimentally, {{while the second}} paper Muir and Rogers Med. Phys. 37, 5939 - 5950 (2010) provides k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. This work investigates a variety of additional consistency checks to verify {{the accuracy of the}} k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> determined in each publication and a comparison of the two data sets. Uncertainty introduced in calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> by possible variation of W/e with beam energy is investigated further. Methods: The validity of the experimental set of k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> relies on the accuracy of the NE 2571 reference chamber measurements to which k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> for all other ion chambers are correlated. The stability of NE 2571 absorbed dose to water calibration coefficients is determined and comparison to other experimental k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> is analyzed. Reliability of Monte Carlo calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> is assessed through comparison to other publications that provide Monte Carlo calculations of k Q as well as an analysis of the sleeve effect, the effect of cavity length and self-consistencies between graphite-walled Farmer-chambers. Comparison between the two data sets is given in terms of the percent difference between the k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> presented in both publications.

30|$|The {{control of}} light on the {{nanoscale}} has been investigated widely in nano-optics and nanophotonics. As a result, different types of photonic nanostructures have been proposed so far. For instance, the photonic crystal (PhC) nano-cavities with ultra-high quality (<b>Q)</b> <b>factors</b> [1] can confine light into a subwavelength region. Similar to the PhC cavities, high <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> are realized by micro-disk [2, 3], spherical [4], and troidal [5] cavities. Those cavities with high <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> usually consist of transparent dielectric materials. In contrast to those dielectric cavities, metallic cavities have low <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> but can reduce their entire cavity sizes. In particular, plasmonic subwavelength cavities are important for controlling light on an extremely small scale [6]. Although plasmonic cavities have low <b>Q</b> <b>factors,</b> they can squeeze light into a deep subwavelength region [7]. This extremely confined light is anticipated to be a key to merge photonics and electronics [8].|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} plane-parallel ion chambers in high-energy photon beams through measurements and Monte Carlo simulations. Methods: Ten plane-parallel ion chamber types {{were obtained from the}} major ion chamber manufacturers. Absorbed dose-to-water calibration coefficients are measured for these chambers and k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> are determined. In the process, the behaviors of the chambers are characterized through measurements of leakage currents, chamber settling in cobalt- 60, polarity and ion recombination behavior, and long-term stability. Monte Carlo calculations of the absorbed dose to the air in the ion chamber and absorbed dose to water are obtained to calculate k <b>Q</b> <b>factors.</b> Systematic uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> are investigated by varying material properties and chamber dimensions. Results: Chamber behavior was variable in MV photon beams, especially with regard to chamber leakage and ion recombination. The plane-parallel chambers did not perform as well as cylindrical chambers. Significant differences up to 1. 5 were observed in calibration coefficients after a period of eight months although k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> were consistent on average within 0. 17. Chamber-to-chamber variations in k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> for chambers of the same type were at the 0. 2 level. Systematic uncertainties in Monte Carlo calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> ranged between 0. 34 and 0. 50 depending on the chamber type. Average percent differences between measured and calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors</b> were - 0. 02, 0. 18, and - 0. 16 for 6, 10, and 25 MV beams, respectively. Conclusions: Excellent agreement is observed on average at the 0. 2 level between measured and Monte Carlo calculated k <b>Q</b> <b>factors.</b> Measurements indicate that the behavior of these chambers is not adequate for their use for reference dosimetry of high-energy photon beams without a more extensive QA program than currently used for cylindrical reference-class ion chambers. 9 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

25|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of crystal sets {{is that they}} are vulnerable to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is to say, they have low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low <b>Q</b> <b>factor)</b> compared to modern receivers.|$|E

Some modern bicycles have shell widths of 83 or 100mm and these are for specialised downhill mountain biking or snowbiking applications.

25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same <b>Q</b> <b>factor</b> than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|When {{either side}} of the {{transformer}} is a tuned circuit, the amount of mutual inductance between the two windings, together with the <b>Q</b> <b>factor</b> of the circuit, determine the shape of the frequency response curve. The tuned circuit together with the transformer load form an RLC circuit with a definite peak in the frequency response. When both sides of the transformer are tuned, it is described as double-tuned. The coupling of double-tuned circuits is described as loose-, critical-, or over-coupled depending on the value of k. When two tuned circuits are loosely coupled through mutual inductance, the bandwidth will be narrow. As the amount of mutual inductance increases, the bandwidth continues to grow. When the mutual inductance is increased beyond a critical point, the peak in the response curve begins to drop, and the center frequency will be attenuated more strongly than its direct sidebands. This is known as overcoupling.|$|E

The filesizes indicated below include the internal JPEG information headers and some metadata. For highest quality images (Q=100), about 8.25 bits per color pixel is required. On grayscale images, {{a minimum of}} 6.5 bits per pixel is enough (a comparable Q=100 quality color information requires about 25% more encoded bits). The highest quality image below (Q=100) is encoded at nine bits per color pixel, the medium quality image (Q=25) uses one bit per color pixel. For most applications, the quality factor should not go below 0.75 bit per pixel (Q=12.5), {{as demonstrated by the}} low quality image. The image at lowest quality uses only 0.13 bit per pixel, and displays very poor color. This is useful when the image will be displayed in a significantly scaled-down size.
