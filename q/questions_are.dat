5|$|Questions can {{be formed}} {{in several ways}} in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{constructed}} by adding a sentence-final question marker rá. Constituent questions (sometimes called Wh-questions or question word <b>questions)</b> <b>are</b> doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial question word and are marked with a sentence-final question marker hin.|$|E
5|$|The Sanskrit text of this Upanishad has six chapters. Sage Yajnavalkya answers {{questions}} in the first five, wherein the <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> posed by Brihaspati, Atri, students of Brahman-Atman, King Janaka and by Atri again. The last chapter lists the names of famous sages who were model sannyasis (renunciates).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> raised within the {{philosophy}} of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, even if they are young and healthy.|$|E

30|$|To do the comparison, {{we first}} {{implemented}} {{a method for}} machine-generating questions from a biology knowledge base. A second set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> formed by selecting questions retrieved from the web. The authors of most web <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> probably students and not biology experts. Our third set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> comprised of professional human-generated questions from textbooks and a biology study website ([URL] University biology students were recruited to act as judges. They rated the three sets of questions on four measures. Our primary <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether the machine-generated <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> worse than the human-generated ones. We were also interested in whether {{the two types of}} human-authored <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> of different quality.|$|R

5|$|First-millennium Indian scholars, such as Sureshvara (Suresvaracharya, c. 750 CE), {{have viewed}} this male-female {{dialogue}} as profound on both sides; Maitreyi refuses wealth, wishing {{to share her}} husband's spiritual knowledge, and in the four known versions of the Upanishadic story she challenges Yajnavalkya's theory of Atman. Yajnavalkya acknowledges her motivations, and that her <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> evidence she is a seeker of ultimate knowledge and a lover of the Atman.|$|E
5|$|After an {{operation}} in Istanbul ends in disaster, Bond is missing and {{presumed to be}} dead. In the aftermath, <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> raised over M's ability to run the Secret Service, and she becomes {{the subject of a}} government review over her handling of the situation. The Service itself is attacked, prompting Bond's return to London. His presence assists MI6's investigation in uncovering a lead, and Bond is sent to Shanghai and Macau in pursuit of a mercenary named Patrice. There, he establishes a connection to Raoul Silva, a former MI6 agent who was captured and tortured by Chinese agents. Blaming M for his imprisonment, he sets in motion a plan to ruin her reputation before murdering her. Bond saves M and attempts to lure Silva into a trap, and while he is successful in repelling Silva's assault, M is mortally wounded. Bond returns to active duty under the command of the new M, Gareth Mallory.|$|E
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> {{addressed}} to the portfolio of the Minister receiving the question, and the questioner must ask the question as written. Once a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked, supplementary <b>questions</b> can <b>be</b> asked.|$|R
50|$|In this game, {{two kids}} competed {{against each other}} in a memory game. A brief video {{documentary}} about the day's animal was shown to the contestants, and then three <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> posed about the video. The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth 50 points, the second was worth 100, and the third <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth 150 points. After this, a second video was shown with and three more <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked with doubled point values.|$|R

5|$|As {{is typical}} of an Indo-European language, English follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European {{languages}} though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favor of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections. English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. <b>Questions</b> <b>are</b> marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.|$|E
5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> often the most provocative ones.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
50|$|Three {{teenagers}} competed. Five or six {{pop music}} trivia <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> asked; {{some of them}} {{having to deal with}} visual clues (such as pictures or clips from music videos). Each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth $50. After the final <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked, the performer mentioned in the question would come out and perform a song.|$|R
50|$|There <b>are</b> two key <b>questions</b> to <b>be</b> {{asked when}} {{creating}} and operating an advisory board. The first <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{who is trying}} to achieve what from an advisory board. The second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> how the business of the board should be conducted. The following issues need to be addressed.|$|R
30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} is {{organized}} as follow. First, we describe how <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> generated from the biology knowledge base. Second, we describe how <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> collected via web search and how the irrelevant <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> filtered out. Lastly, we describe the comparison of {{these two types of}} questions to the professional human-generated questions.|$|R
5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification has become very rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify a question in 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to consider the case. Certified <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E
5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed <b>questions,</b> <b>are</b> able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E
50|$|In {{several of}} the republics, {{additional}} <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> added to the ballot. In Russia, an additional <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked on whether an elective post {{of the president of}} the Russian SFSR should be created. In Kirghizia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan the additional <b>question</b> <b>was</b> on the sovereignty of their republics as part of a new union.|$|R
50|$|The rhetorical <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{a device}} where a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> stated {{to make a}} point, without {{requiring}} any answer because {{it is intended to}} be obvious.|$|R
50|$|Each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> a toss up, and {{the value}} for each <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} by a randomizer. After the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> asked, whichever team member that buzzed in first was told {{the value of the}} question and prompted for an answer. Answering correctly awarded the points, but answering incorrectly gave the opponent a chance to steal.|$|R
5|$|When the General Assembly {{votes on}} {{important}} questions, {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration by the Security Council.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the question, they lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{move into}} an old house, {{wondering}} at its low cost. Their <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> answered when the walls begin to bleed and objects begin to fly through the air, and Lisa senses an evil presence in the house. There is also a portal to another dimension in the kitchen. Marge expresses the desire to leave, but Homer asks her to sleep on it, due {{to the cost of}} buying the house. That night, the house possesses Homer and the children, manipulating their minds and making them chase each other with axes and knives. Marge unlike the others however, is instead using her knife to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich and intervenes, breaking the trance. Afterwards, Lisa discovers the source of the haunting - a Native American burial ground hidden in the basement. After the Spirit of The House threatens them again, Marge loses her patience and confronts the house, demanding that it treat them with respect during their stay. The house thinks it over, and eventually opts to destroy itself rather than live with the Simpsons.|$|E
50|$|In {{the bonus}} round, the winning family were asked three more {{questions}} with four possible answers {{on the first}} question, five on the second, and six on the third. Each <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> worth $50 and if the first two <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> answered correctly, the last <b>question</b> <b>was</b> worth a bonus prize, otherwise it was played for an additional $50.|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, all {{contextual factors}} {{were divided into}} two groups, namely, {{categorical}} and numerical. According to the above procedure, a set of soft <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> extracted for numerical factors, and a number of hard <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> obtained for categorical contextual factors. Thereafter, all of the extracted hard and soft <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> grouped together and competed against each other during the soft clustering procedure.|$|R
