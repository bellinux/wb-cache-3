5|$|Due to a <b>quirk</b> in legislation, the West Berlin {{parts of}} the Stadtbahn belonged to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which made it (and {{therefore}} the GDR government) {{one of the largest}} landowners in West Berlin. Regular quarrels erupted between the DR, the GDR government, the West Berlin Senate and the Allied occupation powers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} <b>quirk</b> produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} filming crew, the {{post-production}} {{crew of the}} film included both Indian and overseas personnel. Prime Focus carried out the film's 3-D conversion, with London-based colorist Richard Fearon performing the color grading. Red Chillies VFX partnered {{with a number of}} visual effects studios around the world, and undertook the incorporation of the visual effects under the supervision of Jeffrey Kleiser. Nvidia provided the information technology–based software utilised for the effects, while Edwark <b>Quirk</b> supervised over the computer-generated imagery used in the film. Resul Pookutty was responsible for the film's sound design.|$|E

40|$|We ask if {{corporate}} executives have fixed effects (<b>quirks)</b> that explain perational decisions made in firms, independent of firm effects. We replicate the approach in Bertrand et al. (2003), solving the empirical challenge of distinguishing firm and executive effects by constructing a dataset of executives who {{move from one}} firm to another. We find that executives indeed exhibit fixed effects separate from firm effects. These <b>quirks</b> are large, {{although there is a}} wide dispersion of sizes among executives. The <b>quirks</b> also come in themes, such as a bias toward investing in human rather than physical capital. We also find that <b>quirks</b> mostly lead to inefficient outcomes for firms. Finally, we link <b>quirks</b> to observable characteristics of executives, such as their age or education. We conclude by arguing for an increased focus on individual effects in operations management research. ...|$|R
5|$|Isaacson {{stood as}} the Liberal {{candidate}} for Prahran in the November 1945 Victorian state election, but {{was defeated by}} Labor's Bill <b>Quirk.</b> His wartime commission was terminated on 21February 1946 and he transferred to the RAAF Reserve. He was state commandant of the Victorian Squadron of the Air Training Corps from 1950, and commandant of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron from 1961, before retiring in 1969 with the rank of wing commander. He also served as an honorary aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II from 1963 to 1965.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{constitutional}} <b>quirk,</b> Metcalfe's term {{was scheduled to}} begin eight days before the expiration of Desha's. Desha charged that Metcalfe was not allowing him to finish out his term and threatened not to vacate the governor's mansion until his term officially ended. Clark records as legend that, after drinking heavily at a local tavern, Metcalfe {{and some of his}} supporters formed a mob and went to the governor's mansion to evict him by force. Accounts in the local newspapers of the time instead record that the Deshas left the mansion peacefully without intervention by Metcalfe.|$|E
5|$|The Act, finally {{passed as}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, merged the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between {{the courts to}} remain. The Court of Common Pleas thus ceased to exist, except as the Common Pleas Division of the High Court. The existence of the same courts under one unified head was a <b>quirk</b> of constitutional law, which prevented the compulsory demotion or retirement of Chief Justices. By sheer chance, both the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales and Chief Baron of the Exchequer died in 1880, allowing for {{the abolition of the}} Common Pleas Division and Exchequer Division by Order in Council on 16 December 1880, with their functions merged into the King's Bench Division, with the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas becoming Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|The procellariids {{are present}} in all the world's oceans {{and most of the}} seas. They are absent from the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, but are present year round or {{seasonally}} in the rest. The seas north of New Zealand are the centre of procellariid biodiversity, with the most species. Among the four groups, the fulmarine petrels have a mostly polar distribution, with most species living around Antarctica and one, the northern fulmar ranging in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The prions are restricted to the Southern Ocean, and the gadfly petrels are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The shearwaters are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a biogeographical <b>quirk</b> are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.|$|E

The VHF bands were more desirable because they carried longer distances. Since there were only twelve VHF channels available, there were limitations as to how closely the stations could be spaced.|$|E
