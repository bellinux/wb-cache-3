25|$|The <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> is a {{modification}} of Dixon's factorization method.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} of those algorithms are the elliptic curve method and the <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{demonstration}} {{should also}} serve {{to show that the}} <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> is only appropriate when n is large. For a number as small as 15347, this algorithm is overkill. Trial division or Pollard rho could have found a factor with much less computation.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Quadratic</b> Number Field <b>Sieve</b> (QS) {{provides}} a fast {{and easy to}} implement method to factor a number. QS works by setting up a congruence of squares modulo n, which gives us a factor of n roughly 2 / 3 of the time. I set out to implement QS in parallel in MIT Cilk using the Gnu Multiple Precision Library. I succeeded in improving the performance of two functions in QS through parallelization. My results agreed with previously shown performance. Specifically, the data collection phase of QS is parallelized better than the data processing phase[3]. An efficient way of handling the data processing phase remains to be shown. ...|$|R
25|$|This {{approach}} (called MPQS, Multiple Polynomial <b>Quadratic</b> <b>Sieve)</b> is {{ideally suited}} for parallelization, since each processor {{involved in the}} factorization can be given n, the factor base {{and a collection of}} polynomials, and it will have no need to communicate with the central processor until it is finished with its polynomials.|$|E
25|$|The PARI/GP {{computer}} algebra {{package includes}} an {{implementation of the}} self-initialising multiple polynomial <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> implementing the large prime variant. It was adapted by Thomas Papanikolaou and Xavier Roblot from a sieve written for the LiDIA project. The self initialisation scheme {{is based on an}} idea from the thesis of Thomas Sosnowski.|$|E
25|$|The {{factorization}} of a {{value of}} y(x) that splits over the factor base, together with the value of x, {{is known as a}} relation. The <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> speeds up the process of finding relations by taking x close to the square root of n. This ensures that y(x) will be smaller, and thus have a greater chance of being smooth.|$|E
25|$|Let x mod y {{denote the}} {{remainder}} after dividing x by y. To factorize the integer n, Fermat's method entails {{a search for}} a single number a, n1/2, such that a2 mod n is a square. But these a are hard to find. The <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> consists of computing a2 mod n for several a, then finding a subset of these whose product is a square. This will yield a congruence of squares.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> {{attempts}} to find pairs of integers x and y(x) (where y(x) {{is a function of}} x) satisfying a much weaker condition than x2 ≡ y2 (mod n). It selects a set of primes called the factor base, and {{attempts to}} find x such that the least absolute remainder of y(x) = x2 mod n factorizes completely over the factor base. Such x values are said to be smooth with respect to the factor base.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> {{algorithm}} (QS) is {{an integer}} factorization algorithm and, in practice, the second fastest method known (after the general number field sieve). It {{is still the}} fastest for integers under 100 decimal digits or so, and is considerably simpler than the number field sieve. It is a general-purpose factorization algorithm, meaning that its running time depends solely {{on the size of}} the integer to be factored, and not on special structure or properties. It was invented by Carl Pomerance in 1981 as an improvement to Schroeppel's linear sieve.|$|E

2500|$|This example will {{demonstrate}} standard <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> without logarithm optimizations or prime powers. Let {{the number to}} be factored N = 15347, therefore {{the ceiling of the}} square root of N is 124. Since N is small, the basic polynomial is enough: y(x) = (x + 124)2 [...] 15347.|$|E
2500|$|Thus solving f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p) for x {{generates a}} whole {{sequence}} of numbers y for which y=f(x), {{all of which are}} divisible by p. This is finding a square root modulo a prime, for which there exist efficient algorithms, such as the ShanksTonelli algorithm. (This is where the <b>quadratic</b> <b>sieve</b> gets its name: y is a quadratic polynomial in x, and the sieving process works like the Sieve of Eratosthenes.) ...|$|E
