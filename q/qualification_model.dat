As a contribution to this end. a research project is currently being undertaken in South Africa where. as part of the project. work environments in other disciplines such as journalism. health care and engineering are being empirically investigated and compared with LIS services in terms of job functions and higher education qualification types required to fulfill these job functions. The intention is to see if perhaps there are any innovations, lessons or best practices that the LIS profession can draw from these disciplines in terms of staff structures in LIS services. job functions of incumbents. and qualification requirements defining these structures and functions.

Anthony “Tony” Zubrzycki, a design engineer at DSMA ATCON, while seconded to SPAR, originated the concept for the Canadarm End Effector, inspired by an elastic band around his fingers. Tony formally presented this concept to NASA officials. Frank Mee, head of the SPAR mechanical development laboratory, built the end effector prototype based on Tony’s concept and is credited by SPAR as the inventor of the Canadarm End Effector. The three-wire crossover design won over the claw-like mechanisms and others, such as the camera iris model, that were being considered.|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{industrial}} democracies experience increasing inequalities or {{at least}} a new trade-off between equality and growth: liberal welfare states opted for growth and accepted rising inequality, while conservative welfare states tried to hold back inequality, thereby accepting lower growth, and only the social democratic welfare states were partly able to overcome that trade-off. The rise in inequality is widely interpreted with regard to globalization and technological change. This paper contrasts this interpretation with an alternative based on the argumentation of Kuznets' inverted U-turn which is individually reformulated as the diffusion process of some qualification (which remains unspecified throughout this paper). These two alternative mechanisms which are identical with regard to inequality measured using the Gini coefficient or the standard deviation of logged incomes, can be differentiated through different trend expectations with regard to the skewness of income distributions: In the globalization model, increasing inequality is accompanied first by a fall and later-on by a rise in skewness, while the <b>qualification</b> diffusion <b>model</b> shows the opposite sequence: rising to a maximum and falling back later on. Due to their different position in the inequality-growth trade-off, liberal and social democratic welfare states are assumed to be ahead in this evolution, while conservative welfare states lagging behind. Based on the Luxembourg Income Study, skewness estimations of logged monetary income distributions form an unbalanced panel with 69 observations from 16 OECD countries. A fixed effects regression for the skewness time trend in conservative welfare states and the trend difference for the two other welfare state groups shows strong support for the <b>qualification</b> diffusion <b>model...</b>|$|R

40|$|CubeSats are {{becoming}} more mature and many capabilities previously associated with microsatellites and bigger platforms {{are coming to the}} CubeSat. Moreover, they {{are becoming}} available as commercial off the shelf systems with standardized interfaces. TNO Defence and Security of the Netherlands is in the final stage of development of a Cool Gas Micro Propulsion system and is working with nanosatellite specialist ISIS to make it available as a commercial off the shelf system. Applications of the system are orbit phasing and it can provide basic maneuvering capability. The system has several unique characteristics because the nitrogen propellant is not stored under pressure, but chemically bound in several small cool gas generators. It's on ground and on orbit storage life, also between maneuvers, can be up to 10 years, as the propellant storage in the gas generators has no leakage. The use of Cool gas Generators also allows a very flexible system: when a performance increase is needed, additional gas generators can be added without modifying the basic system, the so-called "plug-and-play" philosophy. The paper provides a system description of the development and testing of the <b>qualification</b> <b>model.</b> This <b>qualification</b> <b>model</b> is specifically aimed for a flight demonstration of the propulsion system on board of the Delfi-N 3 Xt satellite, planned in 2010.

The main objective of this optical mission is to continuously monitor the air quality over Europe in near-real time. The Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument operates in three wavelength bands: Ultraviolet (UV: 305 - 400 nm), Visible (VIS: 400 - 500 nm) and Near-infrared (NIR: 750 - 775 nm). Two dedicated CCD detector {{have been developed to}} be used in the Focal Plane Subsystems (FPS), one for the combined UV and VIS band, the other covering the NIR band. Being a {{high resolution}} spectrometer with challenging radiometric accuracy requirements, both on spectral and spatial dimensions, an effect such the Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) can represent a relevant contribution for the complete system accuracy. In this work we analyze the RTS effect on data acquired during the FPS testing campaign with <b>qualification</b> <b>models</b> for the Sentinel- 4 /UVN detectors. This test campaign has been performed in late 2016. The strategy for the impact assessment of RTS is to measure the effect at room temperature and then to extrapolate the results to the at instrument operational temperature. This way, very-long lasting data acquisitions could be avoided since the RTS frequency is much lower at cryogenic temperatures. A reliable technique for RTS effect detection has been developed in order to characterize the signal levels amplitude and occurrence frequencies (flipping rate). We demonstrate the residual impact of the RTS on the global In-Orbit Sentinel- 4 /UVN instrument performance and products accuracy...|$|R
