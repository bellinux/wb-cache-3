ABSTRACT Capital market viewed as one of effective medium {{to speed up the}} development of a country. It is possible because capital market is a vehicle that supports long term fund recruitment from the society to be distributed to the productive sectors. For investors the presence of capital market is additional alternative choice for investment. The objectives of investors invest their fund in the securities that is to get the level of maximal change in the specific risk or to get specific result in the minimal risk. The finance report is arranged in order to give the report of a company’s development periodically. Finance report information has specific goal that is to give information about economical recourse, obligation and financial capital share, give information about comprehensive income and give information about current money supply. The financial report is expected to give information which is interrelated with the level of profit, risks, profit flexibility, and the company’s operational ability. Investors invest their money with the expectation that they will get return from the investment besides to protect their investment so that the value is not decrease. The decision makers included the investors in investing their fund need some useful information to predict the return of their investment in the capital market. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the influence of fundamental factor and economic value added to the return of share. The data is collected from ICMD and the annual emitting financial report in the period of 2003 – 2007. The amounts of population in this study are 45 companies and the amounts of samples are 15 companies by the way of purposive sampling stage. The analyzing technique used in this study is multiple linier regressions to get the comprehensive description about the relation between one and other variables. The result of the study shows that there is an increasing of share return in the companies that is in the study with the assumption of the variable of return on asset, price earning ration, <b>quick</b> <b>asset</b> to inventory, debt to equity ratio, net profit margin, earning per share and economic value added are not changed. The variable of ROA and QAI do not have significant positive influence to the return of share in the companies listed in LQ 45, meanwhile PER, NPM, EPS and EVA have significant positive influence to the return of share while DER variable has significant negative influence to the return of share in the companies listed in LQ 45 in BEI.

40|$|In this article, Professors Stephanie Ben-Ishai and Stephen Lubben {{explore the}} recent surge in {{popularity}} of “quick-sales,” essentially the pre-reorganization plan sale of an insolvent debtor’s assets. In their examination of quick sales, the authors use the recent examples of Lehman Brothers and Chrysler {{to illustrate the}} popularity and relevance of the pre-plan sales. The authors {{then move on to}} a more detailed discussion of the quick sales process in both Canada and the United States, isolating the differences and similarities between both countries, and weighing {{the costs and benefits of}} each approach. Ultimately, the authors argue that questions of speed and certainty mark the biggest difference between the two jurisdictions, as the American approach offers greater flexibility, which is apt to facilitate <b>quicker</b> <b>asset</b> sales. However, Ben-Ishai and Lubben assert that the Canadian approach also provides significant benefits, particularly in the realm of employee protection and the ability of the monitor to act as an independent check on quick sales proceedings. Accordingly, the authors conclude that, while the American approach is advantageous in situations with exceptional time constraints, the Canadian approach under the Companies Creditors’ Arrangement Act (CCAA) is more beneficial for a typical corporate reorganization, insofar as the role of the monitor and other limitations of the CCAA will prevent overuse of the quick sales process...|$|R

30|$|Prior {{research}} on determinants of CSQ has argued and provided partial evidence that CEO CSQ might {{be influenced by}} organizational factors such as past performance, slack resources, and firm size ((McClelland et al. 2010; Hambrick et al. 1993); therefore, we include these variables as controls. Among firm characteristics, past performance was measured using the 1 -year return on assets (ROA). To correct for outliers occurring in the data, ROA was winsorized at the 1 % level. To check for robustness, we varied the performance measure in two ways. First, changes in performance might be more relevant in shaping the board’s perception of “good” or “bad” performance than the actual level of performance (Fredrickson et al. 1988). Thus, we replaced the simple ROA with its difference to the average ROA of the previous 4  years. Second, the return on equity (ROE) was used instead of ROA. When running the same model with these alternative measures, the results did not change significantly. Firm size was captured by total assets and corrected by adjusting the natural logarithm for a skewed distribution. Again, robustness was tested {{by the total number}} of employees. To measure slack resources, research has shown that distinguishing between short- and long-term slack is advantageous (Bourgeois 1981; Hambrick and D’Aveni 1988). We measured short-term slack using the <b>quick</b> <b>asset</b> ratio and long-term slack using the leverage ratio (total debt/equity, logged because of a strongly skewed distribution) multiplied by −[*] 1; that is, high debt–equity ratios are used as indicators of few free resources available. For our Sect. 4.2 where we compare the effects of CEO succession and CEO tenure, we also collected the data for CEO tenure, measured in years. Data were extracted from firms’ annual reports and, in the case of missing information, from press articles. The tenure variable showed strong right-tailed skewness, which we adjusted by adding the shift parameter +[*] 1 and taking the natural logarithm.|$|R

The goal {{of this paper is}} to assess the efficiency of Czech banks using cluster analysis on the basis of selected ratios and to conduct a comparison with bank efficiency in Poland, Austria, Greece, Portugal, France, and Slovakia. The collective ratios for the entire banking sector will be compared for the selected countries for the years 2010 – 2014. The cluster analysis demonstrates that the Czech banking sector is the most similar to the Slovakian sector.

However, in examining debtor’s turnover (in days), inventory turnover and operating cycle the company is able to sell out its inventories and collect debts quickly which may increase the company’s ability to raise funds when it is needed. Furthermore, in the long term financial stability, Woolworths is using a high level of debt which contributes two thirds of the company’s total assets.

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{models for}} {{forecasting}} bankruptcy {{have been developed}} over the years, {{one of the reasons}} for which is the important part it plays in decision-making. However, forecasting a company’s bankruptcy leaves a very short time for stakeholders to change the situation. It is in this context that this paper arises in order to develop a model for predicting financial distress, which is identified as a step prior to bankruptcy. The predictive model uses the logistic regression technique with panel data and a sample of Brazilian publicly-traded companies with shares listed on the São Paulo Stock, Commodities, and Futures Exchange between 2001 and 2014. As well as financial variables, the final model includes market expectations (macroeconomic) and sector variables. These variables are statistically tested and the hypothesis is confirmed that they improve the accuracy of the model. The research identified the existence of financial distress in 96 % of the companies that went bankrupt. In addition, the relationship between the phenomena of bankruptcy and financial distress is verified, using financial and macroeconomic explanatory variables. The results demonstrate that most (83 %) of the explanatory variables in the model for predicting bankruptcy are also present in the model for predicting the phenomenon of financial distress. The expected gross domestic product variables and the <b>quick</b> ratio, <b>asset</b> turnover, and net equity over total liabilities financial variables are statistically significant in predicting both phenomena. With this evidence, the study suggests the use of the concept of financial distress as a stage prior to bankruptcy and provides a model for predicting financial distress with 89 % accuracy when applied to publicly-traded companies in Brazil in the period examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on manias and bubbles {{is dominated by}} spectacular collapses {{and the question of}} whether they could have been foreseen. What is not widely known, though, is that there was at least one giant and wildly speculative investment episode that was successful in that it produced above-market profits for original investors. The British railway mania of the 1830 s involved real capital investment comparable, as a fraction of GDP, to about $ 2 trillion for the U. S. today. It faced withering skepticism and criticism, much of it very reasonable, as its supposedly rosy prospects were based on extrapolation from the brief experience of just a couple of successful early railways. Yet by the mid- 1840 s, it was seen as a success. The example of the railway mania of the 1830 s serves as a useful antidote to claims that bubbles are easy to detect or that all large and <b>quick</b> jumps in <b>asset</b> valuations are irrational. This episode also suggests the need to reexamine much of the work on business cycles and the diffusion of technologies. The standard literature in this area, starting from Juglar and continuing through Schumpeter to more recent authors, almost uniformly ignores large investment mania, whose nature does not fit the stereotypical pattern. ...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the twenty}} largest public company {{bankruptcy}} filings from 1980 to the present, seventeen {{have taken place}} since 2001, and ten of those seventeen were filed between March of 2007 and August of 2009. One such example is In re Chrysler LLC, in which Chrysler, on April 30, 2009, filed for protection under Title 11 of the United States Code. For the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2008, the Chrysler companies suffered a staggering $ 16. 8 billion loss. The failure of such large companies {{and the distribution of}} their enormous wealth of assets have and will continue to have major repercussions. The Bankruptcy Code provides these massive businesses with different options for filing bankruptcy, and these options have reverberating economic and societal effects well beyond any one company’s interests. It is thus essential to understand the options provided by the Bankruptcy Code and to ensure they provide for the most advantageous possible outcomes when America’s foundational businesses collapse. While Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code is the traditional guide for corporate reorganization and the payment of creditors over time, Chrysler—following the current corporate trend—chose to proceed pursuant to § 363. Section 363 (b) of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes a Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession, such as Chrysler, to “use, sell, or lease” estate property outside the ordinary course of business. Section 363 sales tend to be cheaper and more time efficient than reorganization alternatives. Accordingly, in the last twenty-five years, § 363 (b) asset sales have become standard practice in large corporate bankruptcies. “Proponents of the Chapter 11 liquidation method into which § 363 has evolved extol the speed, efficiency, and competition involved in the sales as indications of its superiority over a more traditional reorganization. ” This trend toward use of § 363 (b) is likely to grow as poor economic conditions continue to increase creditor control over reorganization and {{because of the lack of}} available financing to debtors, both of which tend to fuel § 363 (b) sales. Thus, the “side door” of § 363 (b) may soon “replace the main route of Chapter 11 reorganizations. ” Considering current declining economic conditions, the massive amounts of wealth at stake, and the modern prevalence of § 363 sales in large-scale corporate bankruptcy proceedings, it is prudent to ensure that § 363 (b) provides a competent and just medium to protect the diverse interests of all relevant parties and society as a whole. While § 363 sales, on paper, appear to be the ideal way to maximize value for secured creditors, preserve the going concerns of businesses, and keep workers on the job, there is a well-founded fear that <b>quick</b> <b>asset</b> sales run the risk of circumventing the Chapter 11 process. In re Chrysler LLC highlights the concerns of courts and academics that § 363 fails to adequately protect the interests of companies’ smaller debt and equity holders and ignores some of the fundamental bankruptcy principles and protections. Part II of this Note provides the basic framework of the Chrysler bankruptcy agreement for the purposes of analyzing § 363 and the business justification standard. Part III details the development of § 363 (b) and three of the primary dangers that exist with § 363 (b) asset sales under business justification analysis. Part III then uses the In re Chrysler LLC case to highlight the issues in practice. The first issue is § 363 (b) sales’ vulnerability to construction as “sub rosa” sales, which serve the same purpose of reorganizations but avoid Chapter 11 protection requirements. The second issue is § 363 (b) sales’ potential to allow powerful creditors too much influence and control, thereby subordinating and possibly defeating the protected interests of smaller creditors. The third issue is § 363 sales’exceedingly low return values for the assets sold off in spite of their intended purpose of maximizing decreasing values. Part IV addresses the current standard for approving § 363 (b) sales, the business justification rule, and how the rule wrongly facilitates the approval of dubious asset sales. Part V discusses academic theories for reform of the current business judgment standard as well as its implementation in other areas of the law. Lastly, Part VI synthesizes the differing approaches to the business justification standard and offers a refined framework for assessing § 363 asset sales...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{collapse}} {{of an investment}} mania usually reminds people that the phrase “This time is different ” is dangerous. Recollections of this mantra then typically either state outright or at least imply that “It is never different. ” However, {{there is at least}} one counterexample to this cautious view, a giant and wildly speculative investment episode that was profitable for investors. The British railway mania of the 1830 s involved real capital investment comparable, as a fraction of GDP, to about $ 2 trillion for the U. S. today. It faced withering skepticism and criticism, much of it very reasonable, as its supposedly rosy prospects were based on extrapolation from the brief experience of just a couple of successful early railways. Yet by the mid- 1840 s, it was seen as a great investment success. The example of the railway mania of the 1830 s serves as a useful antidote to claims that bubbles are easy to detect or that all large and <b>quick</b> jumps in <b>asset</b> valuations are irrational. This episode also suggests the need to reexamine much of the work on business cycles and diffusion of technologies. The standard literature in this area, starting from Juglar, and continuing through Schumpeter to more recent authors, almost uniformly ignores or misrepresents the large investment mania of the 1830 s, whose nature does not fit the stereotypical pattern. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{examining}} what ratios can determine financial performance of Mongolian companies which are divided into 6 major sectors to increase their competitiveness. This study analyzes the performance of companies in terms of profitability and its association with multiple determinants for 100 Mongolian joint stock companies (JSC) listed in Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE). Financial statements of those companies from MSE are evaluated by panel regression covering the period of 2012 - 2015. Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Return on Sales (ROS) are chosen as performance indicators, while growth in sales, growth in profit, growth in assets, earnings per share, gross profit margin, cost to revenue ratio, return on costs, short-term debt to assets ratio, current assets to total assets ratio, long-term debt to total <b>assets,</b> <b>quick</b> ratio, current ratio, and cash ratio are used as explanatory variables. The panel regression results show that ROA has more determinants than ROE and ROS, such as earnings per share, return on costs have positive impacts, while short-term debts to total assets ratio and cost to revenue ratio have negative impacts. Growth in sales, earnings per share and costs to revenue ratio influence positively the financial performance of an organization by ROS, while return on cost has {{a positive effect on}} the financial performance measured by return on sale...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to give to construction industry stakeholders some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) able to help them making the best decisions when acquiring, operating, maintaining and repairing a building. These KPIs are intended to be included inside a Building Condition Assessment procedure developed by the authors. Approach This work is mainly based on two types of KPIs: one, here called Technical index, to assess building degradation and maintenance, so to have a measure of how the asset is getting older; and another, here called Documents index, to measure {{the quality and quantity of}} available building documents and thus to know if the building fulfils its legal requirements. Findings The proposed KPIs give a picture of the asset current condition, a measure of how it is maintained, the list of its pathologies and also an indication of missing documents. Research limitations The KPIs developed are meant to help survey an asset with only visual inspections. In case one or more serious problem are detected, a specific analysis may be required, no matter the final value of the KPIs. Practical implications The knowledge about built assets given by these KPIs will help stakeholders in making the best decision when operating or deciding to buy an asset. Originality KPIs and Building Condition Assessment procedure are the outcome of an original research that had the purpose of developing instruments for a reliable but <b>quick</b> evaluation of <b>assets</b> condition, to be performed before acquiring them or making major decisions about their refurbishment...|$|R

40|$|Bank {{failures}} {{are widely}} feared {{for a number}} of reasons, including concern that depositors may suffer both losses in the value of their deposits (credit losses) and, possibly more importantly, restrictions in access to their deposits (liquidity losses). In the United States, this is not true for insured deposits, which are fully protected and made available to the depositor almost immediately. But both problems may occur for uninsured depositors. Thus, there is pressure on regulators to protect all depositors in bank failures. This is likely to increase both moral hazard risk-taking by banks and poor agency behavior by regulators with large ultimate costs to taxpayers. While ways of reducing the credit loss in bank failures have been widely examined, reducing liquidity losses has received far less attention. One way to mitigate this loss to uninsured depositors is to make the estimated recovery value of their deposits quickly available to them upon failure of the bank through an advance dividend or other payment by the FDIC secured by the bank’s <b>assets.</b> <b>Quick</b> depositor access was suggested as a superior solution to deposit insurance in alleviating adverse effects from bank failures during the debate on deposit insurance in the early 1900 s and was actually put into effect by both the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the New York State Banking Department shortly before the establishment of the FDIC. More recently, the FDIC has experimented with the concept. This paper analyzes {{the pros and cons of}} providing quick depositor access to deposits at failed banks and reviews the history of the concept. It concludes that such a policy would greatly enhance the FDIC’s ability to resolve large bank insolvencies without having to protect uninsured depositors through too-big-to-fail policies...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. There is an {{on-going}} debate amongst economists as {{to whether}} or not markets are efficient. The efficient market hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that investors are rational. The growing body of research in behavioural finance has challenged the rational investor theory, by showing that certain psychological biases affect the behaviour of investors in a manner which causes them to behave irrationally at certain times. The purpose of this paper is to gain further evidence of differential investment performance (which stems from some of these psychological biases) between genders in South Africa. A particular focus is on differences in risk aversion between genders. The data analysed suggests that men tend to hold riskier portfolios than women and tend to be more confident in their abilities than women are. A sample of 2, 380 individual investors from a South African asset manager was analysed over ten years (1 January 2003 – 31 December 2012) in order to draw conclusions on the trading behaviour, resultant returns and variances in returns earned by men and women. The results show that there is a statistically significantly negative correlation between trading frequency and investor return. Over the ten year period analysed, there was no statistically significant difference between men and women either in returns earned or the variance of those returns. Further, there was no statistically significant difference between genders in trade frequency. However, in certain age groups and in certain sub-periods of the data, statistically significant differences between genders in both returns and variance of returns is observed, as well as statistically significant differences between the genders of trade frequency. Men had statistically significantly higher variances of their portfolio returns for the period from 1 January 2003 to 28 April 2006 (the period ending before the financial 3 crisis of 2008 / 9). Given that there is no significant difference in the investment returns earned by men and women in the same period, it follows that women were better investors (on a risk-adjusted basis) in this period. This may be explained by the fact that women are more risk averse than men and tend to hold less risky portfolios. Men had statistically significantly higher returns for their portfolios for the period from 1 May 2006 to 31 August 2009 (the period ending after the financial crisis of 2008 / 9). Given that there is no significant difference between men and women in respect of the variances of returns over this period, it follows men were better investors (on a risk-adjusted basis) for the period ending after the financial crisis. This could be due to men, being less risk averse than women, re-allocating their portfolio to riskier <b>assets</b> <b>quicker</b> than women after the financial crisis, and being better exposed to the upside of the market recovery. When stratifying the population into age groups to determine whether there is any differential behaviour on this basis, men in the 30 – 39 year old cohort were found to have a statistically significantly higher trade frequency than women. No other significant differences between genders within age groups were measured...|$|R
