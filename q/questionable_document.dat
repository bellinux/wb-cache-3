25|$|In {{forensic}} science, questioned document examination (QDE) is {{the examination}} of documents potentially disputed {{in a court of}} law. Its primary purpose is to provide evidence about a suspicious or <b>questionable</b> <b>document</b> using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court.|$|E
5000|$|The New Almaden {{mine was}} taken in {{possession}} by Robert Walkinshaw of the New Almaden Mining Company in April 1847 {{by means of a}} forged grant document supposedly bearing the signature of the alcalde of Presidio San José, José Dolores Pacheco, who always signed documents [...] "Dolores Pacheco"—the <b>questionable</b> <b>document</b> was signed only [...] "Pacheco", and in a finer hand than his. Three of the Berreyesa sons battled with the squatters, trying to dislodge them from the mining works. Their mother, the widow María Zacarías Bernal de Berreyesa, fought for the land by filing suit in court against the New Almaden Mining Company. Castillero filed suit to prove his claim on the mine, and the United States worked to prove the mining land was public, not part of any grant, so that the government could seize the mine. The case dragged on for years as witnesses were called from Mexico. In July 1854, her ninth son, José de la Encarnación Ramón Antonio Berreyesa, was grabbed by a posse, tied with rope around the neck and questioned, but was set free. Several days later, her fifth son, Joseph Zenobia Nemesio Berreyesa, was guarding the New Almaden mine at night when he was seized by masked men and hanged. In 1856, men broke into the home of her seventh son, Francisco Antonio Berreyesa, and killed him. Aftering leaving for the relative safety of Ventura, José de la Encarnación Ramón Antonio Berreyesa was caught on February 5, 1857 by a band of vigilantes that had been told he consorted with the bandit Juan Flores. The vigilantes, a group called the El Monte Rangers who were frustrated at the recent escape of Flores, saw the rope scars around Berreyesa's neck and assumed he had somehow foiled a prior attempt at execution, so they hanged him until dead.|$|E
30|$|Even {{in the age}} of the Internet {{and digital}} communication, paper is used {{extensively}} as an important carrier of information. Technological advances, however, have made the printed document easy to modify for malicious purposes. Therefore, document authenticity plays an important role in forensic science where documents are disputed in a court of law. In fact, ‘questioned document examination’ (QDE) has become an important discipline within forensic science. QDE deals with scientific techniques that can provide evidence about a suspicious or <b>questionable</b> <b>document.</b>|$|E
50|$|Milanzi joined Congolese side TP Mazembe in 2010 from ESCOM United in {{suspicious}} circumstances, with FIFA {{having to}} intervene after Milanzi {{had signed a}} 3 and a half year deal, despite international rules stating players under 18 could only sign 3 year deals. The two sides' documentation reportedly did not match either, with rumours of Milanzi lying about his age, a common occurrence in African football. Because of this, when he called up to the Malawi national team in 2010, Milanzi had to travel through Zambia before entering Malawi, and often has trouble journeying between countries due to his <b>questionable</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1967, {{he joined}} Thos. De La Rue & Co. (printer of banknotes, postage stamps, stock certificates, passports, etc.) as Research Manager in their Maidenhead {{research}} centre. Part of his - and the centre's - role was [...] "to study {{the methods of}} counterfeiters and forgers and to devise methods of improving {{the security of the}} Company's products". Developing an interest in forgeries of all kinds, upon his retirement in 1977, Harrison set himself up in a private, independent capacity to examine suspect and <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> for all sides of the legal system - defence and prosecution - swiftly becoming [...] "used to giving evidence in Court and submitting to cross-examination".|$|R
40|$|Using easy ambient sonic-spray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (EASI-MS), fast and non-destructive fingerprinting identification and aging of ballpoint pen ink writings {{have been performed}} directly from paper surfaces under ordinary ambient conditions. EASI-MS data obtained directly from the ink lines showed that pens from different brands provide typical ink chemical profiles. Accelerated ink aging has also been monitored by EASI-MS revealing contrasting degradation behaviors for six different common ink dyes. As demonstrated for Basic Violet 3, some dyes display a cascade of degradation products whose abundances increase linearly with time thus functioning as 'chemical clocks' for ink aging. Analysis of <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> has confirmed the ink aging capabilities of EASI-MS. The order of superimposition at a crossing point has also been determined by EASI-MS. For two superimposed ink lines, continuous EASI-MS analysis has also shown that the EASI spray is able to penetrate through the layers and therefore both ink layers could be characterized...|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} {{nearly all}} mission property and livestock became about 455 large Ranchos of California {{granted by the}} Californio authorities. The Californio rancho owners claimed about 8600000 acre averaging about 18900 acre each. This land was nearly all originally mission land within about 30 mi of the coast. The Mexican-era land grants by law were provisional for five years {{in order for the}} terms of the law could reasonably be fulfilled. The boundaries of these ranchos were not established as they came to be in later times predominately based on what could be understood as figurative boundaries. They were based on just where another granted owner considered the end of their land, lands or vegetation landmarks. Conflict was bound to occur when these land grants were reviewed under United States control. Title to some grants under United States control were rejected based on <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> especially when with predated documents, that could have been created post-United States occupancy in January 1847.|$|R
50|$|The Walsh Street shootings were {{a subject}} of the Screen Australia/Film Victoria {{documentary}} Trigger Point, aired by the ABC in 2014, which also <b>documented</b> <b>questionable</b> cases of shootings of criminals by police, and training programmes aimed at reducing such incidents.|$|R

5000|$|On {{arrival in}} Cairo, Lady Ranfurly laid {{low in the}} flat of her friends Pamela and Patrick Hore-Ruthven, but {{gradually}} her return became known. Her actions infuriated the British military authorities, which made finding a job difficult. However, her secretarial skills were in short supply and she was soon recruited {{to work for the}} Special Operations Executive office in Cairo. Despite continued opposition from the Army, who failed in an attempt to have British ambassador Sir Miles Lampson remove her passport, she became the highly efficient secretary to George Pollock, the head of the SOE. [...] At first pleased with her job, she quickly became concerned about the SOE's actions, intentions and dubious security and finances, and considered that the organisation was working [...] "across, if not against, the war effort". In March 1941, she expressed her concerns to the visiting Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and in May to General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief for the Middle East. Wavell could take no direct action since SOE did not come under the War Office, but sharing her concerns, he asked her to pass on any documents that aroused her suspicion. She achieved this by stealing <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> from the office each evening, typing a copy of them and then returning the originals to their positions the next morning. Her subterfuge led directly to a major reorganisation of SOE Cairo in the summer of 1941.|$|R
5000|$|During the {{hearings}} public opinion shifted strongly against the Navy. The Navy's tendency to favor covert approaches to public relations resulted in efforts during the revolt {{being perceived as}} deceitful and underhanded. OP-23's use of <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> that made use of false capability limitations regarding [...] "strategic bombing myths" [...] damaged the Navy's credibility before the House Armed Services Committee during the October 1949 testimonies. Throughout 1949 the Air Force public relations machine had been extremely effective, using aviation magazines and other widely circulated press organizations to publish informative articles, garnering support both in Congress and directly with the American people. [...] "What drives a distinguished group of admirals to denounce strategic bombing while pleading for the means with which to conduct it, to find the A-bomb immoral {{in the hands of}} the Air Force but quite moral {{in the hands of the}} Navy?" [...] (Time Magazine) The Philadelphia Inquirer captured the mood, as reported by the popular press, best. [...] "The Navy brass can contribute to national safety by dropping their guerilla warfare against the other services and endeavor by forthright, constructive criticism to improve on defense strategy." [...] The Washington Post added: [...] "A real meeting of minds can not be achieved until both sides are willing to play on the same team, and right now the burden of proof is on the Navy." [...] A Gallup poll conducted on 15 October showed an overwhelming 74% of voters favoring the Air Force role in any future war, with only 4% favoring the Navy.|$|R
2500|$|Hovind was {{originally}} {{reported to the}} Internal Revenue Service by Pensacola Christian College senior vice president Rebekah Horton in the mid 1990s, after she learned of Hovind's anti-tax stand. [...] Hovind's organization had neither business licenses nor tax-exempt status, nor was it considered a church by people who worked there. The ministry's organizational structure was described by the United States Tax Court as appearing to be [...] "based on various <b>questionable</b> trust <b>documents</b> purchased from Glen Stoll, a known promoter of tax avoidance schemes", leading the Court to conclude that Hovind used these trust documents {{as well as other}} fraudulent means to conceal the ownership and control of his activities and properties.|$|R
5000|$|Ted has {{one special}} {{question}} of his own: about Barney's real job, given that he's always scoffed the gang by saying [...] "please" [...] when asked what he does for a living. When Barney still answers the same, Ted guesses that 'please' could actually be referring to the job and asks for more information. Barney reminds them of how he transformed from a hippie to his present state after a yuppie named Greg took his girlfriend, Shannon, from him back in 1998, and needed help transitioning fully into the corporate world. After tracking down Greg, who failed to recognize him, Barney accepted a lucrative job offer from Greg where he is simply responsible for signing any legally <b>questionable</b> <b>documents</b> {{put in front of}} him. The [...] "Please" [...] remark is explained as [...] "Provide Legal Exculpation And Sign Everything." [...] Ted and Robin are horrified, pointing out that Barney could be set up like another employee who was arrested the day he applied. Barney tells them the job was part of his master plan: he is actually working with the Justice Department to take down Greg for his company's crimes (and finally score his revenge for what Greg did to him years ago). Future Ted says that {{a few months after the}} wedding, Barney revealed his true identity to Greg as FBI agents arrest him on the spot. Satisfied with the questioning, Robin says goodbye to Barney for the last time before the ceremony. When Ted asks how Barney truly feels about finally getting married, Barney confirms he's nervous, but knows Robin is part of what makes him awesome and reaffirms his love for her.|$|R
50|$|An early {{target of}} the protesters {{included}} the Steven J. Baum P.C. law firm in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst. As the largest foreclosure law firm in the state, it had been criticized by activists and fellow lawyers for its aggressive focus on foreclosure without any effort to secure modifications where homeowners or businesses might be eligible. The firm also brought about criticism from their use of <b>questionable</b> robo-signed <b>documents</b> until a change in state court rules requiring an affirmation by the lawyer or client, greatly curtailed its new filings. Baum had attracted national attention after New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera published photos taken of its employees at its 2010 Halloween party, where costumes and decor ridiculed the homeless and attacked the firm's critics. A week after Occupy Buffalo picketed Baum's offices, the firm shut down due {{to a loss of}} business after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac forbade mortgage servicers from using the firm for foreclosure actions.|$|R

40|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is {{a common}} medical problem. The diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections is an important and frequent clinical task. Symptoms and routine urine analysis are not consistent or reliable indicators of UTI; a quantitative culture of the urine is necessary for a definitive diagnosis (1 - 3). Because symptoms and urine analysis are of <b>questionable</b> value in <b>documenting</b> persistence of infection, a follow-up quantitative urine culture is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy (1 - 5). The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate how the results of quantitative urine cultures were used in the management of patients with UTI, symptoms of UTI, or conditions that predispose to UTI...|$|R
5000|$|Originally {{written as}} {{a history of}} the Britons in an attempt to {{document}} a legitimate past, the Historia Brittonum contains stories of legend and superstition alike. [...] The historical accuracy of the Historia Brittonum is at best <b>questionable,</b> but the <b>document</b> is internally consistent and provides information from and indirectly about Nennius' sources. [...] Some historians argue that the Historia Brittonum gives good insight into the way 9th century Britons viewed themselves and their past. [...] Nennius makes several attempts to trace the history of the Britons back to the Romans and Celts through his empirical observations of what he refers to as [...] "The Marvels" [...] or [...] "Wonders of Britain". [...] These include ruins, landmarks and other aspects of the British countryside that Nennius deems worthy of documentation. His explanation of the physical landmarks and ruins take on a very mystical interpretation despite Nennius being a Christian monk. Within the writing of Nennius is a sense of nationalist pride attempting to legitimise the people of Britain and embellish the past through legend much as the Romans used the story of Romulus and Remus to legitimise the founding of Rome. [...] One such example of Nennius stressing legend is in his accounts of Arthur and his twelve battles. The Historia Brittonum would come to be the basis on which later medieval authors such as Geoffrey of Monmouth would write the romantic histories of King Arthur.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} FOI {{request for}} the audit, which <b>documented</b> <b>questionable</b> spending by trustees including a trip to Israel and billing taxpayers for overnight stays at a downtown Toronto hotel during a conference, created turmoil behind the scenes at the board, the emails show.“I am seriously concerned about {{the integrity of the}} FOI process given the sudden confusion and misinformation being provided … and given evident trustee tampering … the version (of the audit) below is entirely inconsistent with the discussions we have had and deliberately obfuscates what information has been changed in the reports and undermines the credibility on the completeness of the information being provided to requestors,” said an August email sent by Mavroyannis.Michel Drapeau, a lawyer, professor and author of several works on information requests, said “if ever there has been a ‘smoking gun’ in an (FOI) request records, you found it … The exchange of records illustrate better than anything I have seen in the recent past about the increasing level of ‘impotence’ of the FOI process which is victim to the open defiance, self-importance and arrogance of individuals who place their interests ahead of the public interest and their fiduciary duties,” he said.The “very obvious and repeated attempts to obfuscate and frustrate the ‘right to know’ of the public … goes totally against the accepted Canadian-wide concept of the rule of law.”He praised Mavroyannis, saying “she clearly comes across as a true and honest public servant doing her best to uphold the law (and) provide a ‘service’ to the public.”Ottawa University professor Amir Attaran, an expert in FOI requests who suggested asking the privacy commissioner to investigate, said that if tampering is confirmed, any staff involved should be fired.Mavroyannis, in an email to one individual whose name was blacked out, said that “at the Tuesday meeting this week, you indicated that you had made changes to …(the expense audit) based upon discussions” with someone whose name is also blacked out.“Yesterday at the meeting with the director, you indicated that there was yet another version of the trustee report containing changes, and there were many more changes to be made.”Another email adds: “We cannot alter files that are the subject of an FOI. I have repeatedly said that. This constant flip-flopping detracts from the credibility of the integrity of the information being provided, and the independence of the FOI process … this process should not be interfered with …”She {{went on to say that}} “throughout this file, I have seen trustees and staff discuss the information to be provided, and provide opinion for matters for which they are not responsible. There has been clear interference in my ability to carry out the FOI request responsibly.”Drapeau said trustees should not have been told about the FOI expense audit request at all, and that trustees cannot ask to “correct a record.”“This is tampering with a record,” he added. “If you need to correct a record you produce a new version of a record and leave the original safe and intact.”Mavroyannis’ emails refer to at least three versions.While the freedom of information act doesn’t specifically deal with tampering or destruction of records, Drapeau said “it is an offence to obstruct the commissioner during its investigation of a complaint.”The unredacted portions of the emails do not name any staff or trustees who are alleged to have tampered with or interfered with the FOI process.Chair Mari Rutka said trustees did discuss the FOI {{request for the}} audit report, but would not say when or if it was during a private meeting. She said they have been seeking more “clarity” around the FOI process.“I think one of the concerns that trustees had around the information that’s already come out is that the context of it be explained,” she said. “The initial documents that went out to the Star were draft documents that contained errors, and contained items that were flagged” and trustees were concerned their explanations for those items would not be included.Trustee Shelley Laskin said her portion of the expense audit, released to the Star and CTV, mistakenly contained censored information and that she did not ask staff, at any time, to do such censoring.She said she did, however, ask which version of the report would be released, given she’d seen two last April, which was two months before the Star’s FOI request was submitted.“Did I seek clarification of what would be released? Absolutely. Did I question the release of working documents which can be exempt? Absolutely. Were there a series of emails from me to staff to clarify which version of the working papers would be released. Absolutely.”Laskin, who is familiar with the FOI process from her previous job with an Ontario government ministry, said most trustees are not aware of the process and need to be better informed about their obligations under the law.|$|R
