6000|$|But I recall those aspirations. If these Arabs be {{like the}} other Arabs, their love for their {{beautiful}} mares is a fraud. These of my acquaintance have no love for their horses, no sentiment of pity for them, and no {{knowledge of how to}} treat them or care for them. The Syrian saddle-blanket is a <b>quilted</b> <b>mattress</b> two or three inches thick. It is never removed from the horse, day or night. It gets full of dirt and hair, and becomes soaked with sweat. It is bound to breed sores. These pirates never think of washing a horse's back. They do not shelter the horses in the tents, either--they must stay out and take the weather as it comes. Look at poor cropped and dilapidated [...] "Baalbec," [...] and weep for the sentiment that has been wasted upon the Selims of romance! ...|$|E
5000|$|A futon (布団) is a Japanese {{traditional}} bedding comprising a <b>quilted</b> <b>mattress</b> that {{is usually}} laid on the floor. A bedding set consists of both a mattress (lit. [...] "spreading futon") and a duvet (lit. [...] "covering futon"). Both elements of a futon bedding set are pliable enough to be folded and stored away during the day, allowing the room to serve for purposes other than as a bedroom.|$|E

5000|$|Like Thompson, the {{palaeontologist}} Adolf Seilacher emphasised fabricational {{constraints on}} form. He interpreted fossils such as Dickinsonia in the Ediacaran biota as [...] "pneu" [...] structures determined by mechanical inflation like a <b>quilted</b> air <b>mattress,</b> {{rather than having}} been driven by natural selection.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Dickinsonia fossil {{described}} as a [...] "pneu" [...] structure with chambers inflated like a <b>quilted</b> air <b>mattress.</b> In Adolf Seilacher's structuralist view, the structure is determined mechanically {{by the need to}} distribute the tension across the surface, rather than having been guided by natural selection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{segments}} of Dickinsonia {{have been described}} as [...] "pneus", chambers filled with a liquid at higher than ambient pressure, analogous to a <b>quilted</b> air <b>mattress.</b> Features in a few specimens have been interpreted as evidence of longitudinal muscle fibers, and a medial gut, but this interpretation has not reached acceptance.|$|R
500|$|Determining where Ediacaran organisms fit in {{the tree}} of life has proven challenging; it is not even {{established}} that they were animals, with suggestions that they were lichens (fungus-alga symbionts), algae, protists known as foraminifera, fungi or microbial colonies, or hypothetical intermediates between plants and animals. The morphology and habit of some taxa (e.g. Funisia dorothea) suggest relationships to Porifera or Cnidaria. Kimberella may show a similarity to molluscs, and other organisms have been thought to possess bilateral symmetry, although this is controversial. Most macroscopic fossils are morphologically distinct from later life-forms: they resemble discs, tubes, mud-filled bags or <b>quilted</b> <b>mattresses.</b> Due to the difficulty of deducing evolutionary relationships among these organisms, some palaeontologists have suggested that these represent completely extinct lineages that do not resemble any living organism. One palaeontologist proposed a separate kingdom level category Vendozoa (now renamed Vendobionta) in the Linnaean hierarchy for the Ediacaran biota. If these enigmatic organisms left no descendants, their strange forms might be seen as [...] a [...] "failed experiment" [...] in multicellular life, with later multicellular life evolving independently from unrelated single-celled organisms.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{of these}} organisms were quite unlike {{anything}} that appeared before or since, resembling discs, mud-filled bags, or <b>quilted</b> <b>mattresses</b> - one palæontologist {{proposed that the}} strangest organisms should be classified as a separate kingdom, Vendozoa.At least some may have been early forms of the phyla {{at the heart of}} the [...] "Cambrian explosion" [...] debate, having been interpreted as early molluscs (Kimberella), echinoderms (Arkarua); and arthropods (Spriggina, Parvancorina). Still, debate exists about the classification of these specimens, mainly because the diagnostic features that allow taxonomists to classify more recent organisms, such as similarities to living organisms, are generally absent in the ediacarans. However, there seems little doubt that Kimberella was at least a triploblastic bilaterian animal. These organisms are central to the debate about how abrupt the Cambrian explosion was. If some were early members of the animal phyla seen today, the [...] "explosion" [...] looks a lot less sudden than if all these organisms represent an unrelated [...] "experiment", and were replaced by the animal kingdom fairly soon thereafter (40M years is [...] "soon" [...] by evolutionary and geological standards).|$|R
