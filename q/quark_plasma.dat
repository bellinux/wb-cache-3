Application of the Levinson theorem proves that describing the pion Mott dissociation solely by means of spectral broadening of the pion bound state beyond T_Mott leaves out a significant aspect. Thus we acknowledge the importance of the continuum of scattering states and show its role for the thermodynamics of pion dissociation. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} self-consistant {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} nuclear matter as a crystal of solitons in the Wigner-Seitz approximation.

Results in all models are very sensitive to the form of the dispersion relation, so our approach represents a significant advance. We apply the method to both the Friedberg Lee model and the chiral quark-meson model of Birse and Banerjee.

40|$|The early {{universe}} {{was filled with}} a primordial form of matter called <b>Quark</b> Gluon <b>Plasma</b> that only exists at extremely high temperatures and densities, many times hotter than the core temperature of suns. By colliding heavy nuclei at top energies at machines like the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) we can create and investigate tiny bubbles of <b>Quark</b> Gluon <b>Plasma</b> for very short periods of time before they cool and decay. We can use so-called QCD jets i. e. highly energetic quarks and gluons to penetrate and probe these artificially created <b>Quark</b> Gluon <b>Plasma</b> bubbles by comparing them with jets created in vacuum in control experiments. This is a wonderful tool to study properties of this exotic form of matter. We conduct a systematic study of the functional relationship between the so-called jet quenching strength ? and the plasma entropy density s.
