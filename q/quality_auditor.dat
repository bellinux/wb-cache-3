40|$|PIPEs (Private Investments in Public Equity) {{are unique}} {{in that they are}} {{negotiated}} privately between sophisticated investors and the public firm. As a result, the issue price deviates from the firm's stock price, often resulting in a substantial PIPE discount. However, only a limited set of firms issues equity at such a discount. PIPE issuers tend to be low quality, less transparent firms that cannot raise capital through traditional sources. As indicators of this quality, I examine the firm's accruals and audit quality in the year of its PIPE issuance. I find that the PIPE discount is more strongly associated with audit quality, and that firms with low <b>quality</b> <b>auditors</b> are issued at a 5 % discount relative to comparable firms with high <b>quality</b> <b>auditors.</b> Much of this discount is due to self-selection, suggesting that higher quality PIPE issuers select high <b>quality</b> <b>auditors.</b> by Amit Koshal.

Three auditor choice decisions are examined: (i) appointment of a Big N or non-Big N auditor, (ii) appointment of a specialist or non-specialist auditor, and (iii) appointment of a new auditor (rotation) or reappointment of the incumbent audit firm (retention). The study uses annual report and other publicly available data for 125 local councils in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) over the ten year period 1993 - 2003. Appointment decisions are examined for two successive tenders (in the fiscal years 1995 and 2001). As expected, the study finds size, political visibility, location and audit risk to be associated with appointment of a quality audit firm. Political visibility, location, growth, incumbent auditor and audit partner change are found to be associated with auditor rotation/retention decisions. Local councils in NSW used the compulsory audit tendering opportunity to increasingly align themselves with a specialist auditor. Councils that were more politically visible were also found to be more highly aligned with a specialist auditor. The results are not consistent with competitive tendering leading to choice of a lower <b>quality</b> <b>auditor.</b> 67 page(s...|$|E

Consistent with the model, two hypotheses are developed; (I) there is a positive association between audit quality and firm-specific risk, and (2) financial reports attested to by higher <b>quality</b> <b>auditors</b> should have a greater marginal effect on current market value than the reports associated with low <b>quality</b> <b>auditors.</b> Two models are used to test these predictions. The first one is the auditor choice model, which is a multivariate logistic regression model, while the second one is the valuation model developed by Datar et al. (1991). No evidence is found to support the predicted positive relationship between audit quality and firm-specific risk However, the results are consistent with the expectation that there is a significant effect of audit quality on the market valuation of IPO stocks. This reflects a greater degree of confidence placed by investors on reports approved by high <b>quality</b> <b>auditors.</b> The results are also not sensitive to alternative definitions of variables, omitted variable problems, the presence of outliers or the size effect.

Current research relies heavily on one-sided matching theory (e. g. signaling) which assumes that companies can select any auditor they desire.

Consistent {{with the notion that}} audit firms are indeed selective of the quality of clients they serve we further find that this positive correlation increases as the demand on an audit firm’s capacity increases. Specifically,the increase inauditor demand resulting from changes in regulation and auditing standards subsequent to the early 2000 high-profile accounting scandals have increased the significance of auditor-client matching on quality.

Of interest to this study is the role that auditing firms play in adding credibility to the new issue.

Our empirical results show that high risk IPOs are associated with high <b>quality</b> <b>auditors.</b> Further, high <b>quality</b> <b>auditors</b> are associated with higher IPO market valuations and they allow entrepreneurs to retain lower ownership stakes in the IPO while maintaining market valuation.
