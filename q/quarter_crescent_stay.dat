40|$|Abstract：The working {{mechanism}} of the stationary crescent for radial compensation in the inner mesh gear pumps was studied in this paper. The force of {{the top and bottom}} stationary crescent in one hydraulic pressure changing cycle was analysed. The pressure distribution on the top and bottom stationary cressent in different positions and the hydraulic force at the x，y direction were determined. Under the condition of the force of the top and bottom stationary crescent is least and the two stationary <b>crescents</b> <b>stay</b> close to the tooth crest of internal gear and external gear to form radial seal，the angle {{of the end of the}} top stationary crescent in the high pressure area and the fixing angle of the seal stick was optimized. Experiment results show that the volumetric efficiency is 0. 94 when the outlet pressure reach to 30 Mpa, and the oil temperature is less than 55 °C, there is no abrasion on the two sationary crescents and the tooth crest...|$|R

5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Moon should ideally {{not be viewed}} at its full phase. During a full moon, rays of {{sunlight}} are hitting the visible portion of the moon perpendicular to the surface. As a result, there is less surface detail visible during a full moon than during other phases (such as the <b>quarter</b> and <b>crescent</b> phases) when sunlight hits the Moon at a much shallower angle. The brightness of a full moon as compared to a phase where a smaller percentage of the surface is illuminated tends to wash out substantial amounts of detail and can actually leave an afterimage on an observer's eye that can persist for several minutes. First quarter (six to nine days past new moon) is generally considered {{the best time to}} observe the Moon for the average stargazer. Shadows and detail are most pronounced along the [...] "terminator", the dividing line between the illuminated (day side) and dark (night side) of the Moon.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the incidence of intracranial aneurysm rupture increases at the time of a full moon period. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis SETTING: Time of rupture and neurosurgical treatment at a university hospital in the capital city of Germany. SETTING: 486 consecutive patients, irrespective of age and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of patients who attended an rupture of an intracranial aneurysm and surgical treatment during 1990 to 1998. The number of ruptures in each day was compared with the lunar phases in each month. (New moon, waxing <b>crescent,</b> first <b>quarter,</b> waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last <b>quarter,</b> waning <b>crescent)</b> RESULTS: The incidence of rupture of an intracranial aneurysm rose significantly at the time of a full moon or one to three days around the full moon period. Additional increased the number of rupture of an intracranial aneurysm on four of eight astronomical moon phases (3, 691 days per synodal moon rotation). With the period of the full moon as the reference period, the incidence rate ratio of four of eight lunar phases was significantly higher (New moon, first quarter, full moon and last quarter). CONCLUSIONS: The full moon and three special moon phases are associated with a significant increase in rupture of intracranial aneurysm. </P...|$|R
25|$|Soon, {{the only}} things keeping most {{passenger}} trains running were legal obligations. Meanwhile, companies {{who were interested in}} using railroads for profitable freight traffic were looking for ways to get out of those legal obligations, and it looked like intercity passenger rail service would soon become extinct in the United States beyond a few highly populated corridors. The final blow for passenger trains in the U.S. came with the loss of railroad post offices in the 1960s. On May 1, 1971, the federally funded Amtrak took over (with a few exceptions) all intercity passenger rail service in the continental United States. The Rio Grande, with its Denver-Ogden Rio Grande Zephyr and the Southern with its Washington, D.C.–New Orleans Southern <b>Crescent</b> chose to <b>stay</b> out of Amtrak, and the Rock Island, with two intrastate Illinois trains, was too far gone to be included into Amtrak.|$|R

The original brass is in three sections, comprising an arcade of three arches; under the central arch is a recumbent effigy of the deceased lying on a chest tomb, fully dressed with ruff collar and hands together in prayer. On the chest tomb is inscribed Memento Mori; above her is an escutcheon showing Dowrish (Argent, a bend cotised sable a bordure engrailed of the last) impaling Carew (Or, three lions passant sable). Under the two flanking arches are kneeling effigies of her one son and three daughters: under the left arch is shown her only son and heir Thomas Dowrish (1568-1628), with above him the arms of Dowrish impaling Stucley (Azure, three pears pendant or), and kneeling behind him his sister Dorothy Dowrish, the wife of Thomas Peyton, with above her an escutcheon showing Peyton (Sable, a cross engrailed or a mullet in the first <b>quarter</b> argent a <b>crescent</b> for difference) impaling Dowrish. On the right of Mary Carew are shown her two other daughters, both kneeling, firstly Elizabeth Dowrish, wife of George Trobridge (1564-1631) of Trobridge, near Crediton, above whom is shown an escutcheon showing the canting arms of Trobridge (Argent, a bridge gules arched with a flag on the top) (also shown in the modern heraldic window in Crediton Parish Church) impaling Dowrish. The third daughter who kneels behind Elizabeth is Margaret Dowrish, wife of William Limesey of Colby in Norfolk above whom is shown an escutcheon showing an eagle displayed (Limesey).
