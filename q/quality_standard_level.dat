40|$|Many lakes have {{experienced}} a transition from a clear into a turbid state without macrophyte growth due to eutrophication. There are several measures by which nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the surface water can be reduced. We used the shallow lake model PCLake to evaluate the effects of three measures (reducing external nutrient loading, increasing relative marsh area, and increasing exchange rate between open water and marsh) on water quality improvement. Furthermore, the contribution of different retention processes was calculated. Settling and burial contributed more to nutrient retention than denitrification. The model runs for a typical shallow lake in The Netherlands showed that after increasing relative marsh area to 50 %, total phosphorous (TP) concentration in the surface water was lower than the Maximum Admissible Risk (MAR, a Dutch government water <b>quality</b> <b>standard)</b> <b>level,</b> in contrast to total nitrogen (TN) concentration. The MAR levels could also be achieved by reducing N and P load. However, reduction of nutrient concentrations to MAR levels {{did not result in}} a clear lake state with submerged vegetation. Only a combination of a more drastic reduction of the present nutrient loading, in combination with a relatively large marsh cover (approximately 50 %) would lead to such a clear state. We therefore concluded that littoral marsh areas can make a small but significant contribution to lake recovery. ...|$|E

The most recent piece of legislation, Directive 2009 / 90 /EC, points out the necessity of ensuring {{the quality of the}} analytical data and prescribes that the laboratories appointed by the Member States as responsible for the chemical water monitoring shall ‘‘demonstrate their competences [...] . by [...] . analysis of available reference materials [...] . ’’. Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) are the anchor points for comparability of measurement results, in both space and time, ensuring their traceability to a common reference. In this article, we present a critical overview of existing matrix CRMs, related to WFD monitoring needs. Our survey concerns available water, biota and sediment matrix CRMs for the 33 Priority Substances (PSs) (and the eight ‘‘other certain pollutants’’) listed in the WFD, together with a reference to discontinued CRMs. Tables providing a more synoptic view are available on-line as supplementary information. For the four priority metals (Cd, Pb, Hg and Ni), there are sufficient CRMs for all matrices considered to cover the needs of the monitoring laboratories, but there is a serious lack of matrix CRMs for most of the organic PSs. Also, for the matrix water, there are no materials available for organic pollutants that could be classified as CRMs as commonly understood. We also briefly discuss pure compounds and solution CRMs for calibration purposes. In the final section, we show how a CRM could be used in the estimation of measurement uncertainty for checking compliance at the Environmental <b>Quality</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>level,</b> according to the technical specifications given in Directive 2009 / 90 /EC.

The purpose of this study, namely: 1) identifies the distribution of water quality pollution of the Bengawan Solo River; 2) determines the point of self purification process; 3) evaluate water quality conditions of the Bengawan Solo River contaminated by water quality standards that have been set. 	The research method used was a survey of the field, namely by making observations and measurements directly in the field. River water sampling using a purposive sampling technique, taking into account the criteria pollutant sources and the distance of the pollution. Types of data used include primary and secondary data, {{in the form of a}} data stream network maps and administrative maps for the approximate location of the sample, as well as the results of the value of the concentration of each of the parameters, both physically and chemically obtained from direct measurements in the field and laboratory test results.

[...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wastewater Utilization Program, 2009 The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide chemical, physical, and {{microbiological}} water quality baseline data for the lower Van Duzen River Basin mandated by California Regional Water Quality Control Board. Water quality data were collected from October 2006 to April 2008, and included temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total suspended solids, turbidity, and fecal coliforms. Data were collected from monitoring sites on five tributaries (Wolverton Gulch, Yager Creek, Cummings Creek, Hely Creek, and Grizzly Creek) and two sites on the mainstem Van Duzen River. All sampling parameters were measured using approved Environmental Protection Agency standard methods. Water temperature exceeded water <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> during the warm summer months in Yager Creek and the Van Duzen River. Fecal coliform concentrations exceeded standards of less than 200 CFU/ 100 ml at Wolverton Gulch, Yager Creek, Grizzly Creek, and the Van Duzen River during significant rainstorms. However, levels were never exceeded during warm summer months when United States Environmental Protection Agency full body contact standards would most likely occur. Water <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> for dissolved oxygen, pH, and conductivity levels were met at all sampling sites. The analysis of turbidity data will be used to assist the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in determining baseline conditions required for development of water <b>quality</b> <b>standards.</b> <b>Levels</b> of total suspended solids exceeded water <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> following rainstorms, but did not exceed standards during periods of no rainfall.

This white paper summarizes literature on source control and other BMPs used at construction sites, at private stormwater facilities, with illicit discharge detection and elimination (IDDE) programs, and in the context of inspections at businesses. The intended audience for this white paper is local government stormwater management program staff in Washington State, especially in the western Washington. Literature reviewed was from a preselected database of publication titles, and a series of ranked questions provided the organizing principle for this white paper. Key findings are as follows: Construction Source Control and BMPs Effective use of construction site TESC BMPs depends on the BMP type and operation and maintenance as well as the site and soil conditions. Based on the literature reviewed, compost blankets and filter socks, permeable check dams, and polyacrylamide (PAM) treatment of other BMPs have the best performance characteristics for controlling sediments and treating erosion at the source. A combination of source control BMPs, runoff BMPs, and chemical treatment BMPs are required to reduce construction site runoff down to permit benchmark levels (25 NTU) to meet water <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> <b>levels</b> for turbidity. As a widely used TESC BMP, literature indicates that sediment ponds have relatively low performance for containing sediments.

These organizations do not implement a robust CAPA process, {{and as a}} result they are still struggling today with CAPA. Many firms have been using root cause analysis and corrective action program. A case study on a company which has long recognized that using a good root cause, corrective {{and preventive}} action program is crucial to satisfy its customers, has been conducted. This is to help managers to make decisions effectively. Initially CAPA was not properly implemented and not cost-effective for the company. For example, it could not meet the operational management's needs timely, efficiently and effectively. Therefore, the authors had conducted a secondary research and adopted a universal process & <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> from CMMI <b>Level</b> 5 & ISO 20000 on the top levels of the CAPA procedure in order to improve the CAPA issues...|$|R

40|$|Basic {{principles}} {{and content of}} <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> of social services are described in the law 108 / 2006, about social services, and in related notice 505 / 2006. There are described the most important {{principles and}} obligations to provide social services by providers. <b>Quality</b> <b>standards</b> are a tool to achieve required level of services. They are also used as control mechanism for all of providers. These standards were released in 2002 and they started process of transformation some organizations. For this transformation are important a will of service provider and appropriate ammount of money to manage required changes. The <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are uniform tool for all of kinds of social services. It means to revise all of internal regulations of providing organizations. It means also to make emploees do along the new system. In the senior house in Sušice there was worked allong with these standards since the new legislation came into force. As a method were chosen conducted talks with clients and questionnaire for emploees. Althrow most of the clients are in serious health condition, they need care and help by personnel during whole day, conclusions in case of care were positive. All of the clients are satisfied with accomodation. Interesting is also the time of living there, 27 % of the clients live there more than 6 years. With sanitary care were satisfied 90 % of clients. Satisfaction of the clients with providing care means, that implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> increases <b>level</b> of provided care. Questionnaire for emploees proves, that very important matter is to move people´s mind and to remove old stereotypes of work. Not all of emploees are working with aim to provide help to the clients. There is large space for a work with current staff and {{in the field of}} option of new workers. Relationships between emploees in working process are not good. I thing, it is a legacy of the past. I would like to say, that {{it is a matter of}} each emploee to build relationships in organization. New principles and quality of work, it means to develop education and knowliges of each emploee.

The {{purpose of this study}} were to find out structure of macrozoobenthos community as bioindicator of waters quality in three estuaries of Ampenan district; find out the chemical and physical conditions of waters; determine the relationship of physical chemical of waters and macrozoobenthos diversity indices. The study was conducted by dividing of each estuary into 10 stations. Community structure and physical chemical waters parameters was analyzed descriptively. The relationship of physical and chemical waters quality parameters with macrozoobenthos diversity indices was analyzed by regression. The results showed that 8 species found in the estuary of Berenyok, 11 species in the estuary of Ancar and 12 species in the estuary of Jangkok. Conditions of community structure in three estuaries balanced enough up to unstable.
