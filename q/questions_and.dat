40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of question search. In question search, given a question as query, we are to return questions semantically equivalent or close to the queried question. In this paper, we propose to conduct question search by identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. More specifically, we first summarize questions in a data structure consisting of <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus. Then we model <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus in a language modeling framework for search. We also propose to use the MDLbased tree cut model for identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus automatically. Experimental results indicate that our approach of identifying <b>question</b> topic <b>and</b> <b>question</b> focus for search significantly outperforms the baseline methods such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and Language Model for Information Retrieval (LMIR). ...|$|R

Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military became aware of the unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
