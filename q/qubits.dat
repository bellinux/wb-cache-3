40|$|We {{measure the}} {{coherence}} {{of a new}} superconducting <b>qubit,</b> the low-impedance flux <b>qubit,</b> finding T_ 2 ^* ∼ T_ 1 ∼ 1. 5 μs. It is a three-junction flux <b>qubit,</b> but the ratio of junction critical currents is chosen to make the <b>qubit's</b> potential have a single well form. The low impedance of its large shunting capacitance protects it from decoherence. This <b>qubit</b> has a moderate anharmonicity, whose sign is reversed compared with all other popular <b>qubit</b> designs. The <b>qubit</b> is capacitively coupled to a high-Q resonator in a λ/ 2 configuration, which permits the <b>qubit's</b> state to be read out dispersively...|$|R
50|$|The flux <b>qubit</b> is {{distinguished}} from {{other types of}} superconducting <b>qubit</b> such as the charge <b>qubit</b> or phase <b>qubit</b> by the coupling energy and charging energy of its junctions. In the charge <b>qubit</b> regime the charging energy of the junctions dominates the coupling energy, while in a flux <b>qubit</b> the situation is reversed and the coupling energy dominates. Typically in a flux <b>qubit</b> the coupling energy is 10-100 {{times greater than the}} charging energy. It is this ratio that allows the Cooper pairs to flow continuously around the loop, rather than tunnel discretely across the junctions as in a charge <b>qubit.</b>|$|R

40|$|For quantum {{information}} processing, each {{physical system}} has different {{advantage for the}} implementation and so hybrid systems to benefit from several systems {{would be able to}} provide a promising approach. One of the common hybrid approach is to combine a superconducting <b>qubit</b> as a controllable <b>qubit</b> and the other quantum system with a long coherence time as a memory <b>qubit.</b> The superconducting <b>qubit</b> allows us to have an excellent controllability of the quantum states and the memory <b>qubit</b> is capable of storing the information for a long time. By tuning the energy splitting between the superconducting <b>qubit</b> and the memory <b>qubit,</b> it is believed that one can realize a selective coupling between them. However, we have shown that this approach has a fundamental drawback concerning energy leakage from the memory <b>qubit.</b> The detuned superconducting <b>qubit</b> is usually affected by severe decoherence, and this causes an incoherent energy relaxation from the memory <b>qubit</b> to the superconducting <b>qubit</b> via the imperfect decoupling. We have also found that this energy transport can be interpreted as an appearance of anti quantum Zeno effect induced by the fluctuation in the superconducting <b>qubit.</b> We also discuss a possible solution to avoid such energy relaxation process, which is feasible with existing technology...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we {{introduced}} negativity fonts {{as the basic}} units of multipartite entanglement in pure states. We show that the relation between global negativity of partial transpose of N- <b>qubit</b> state and linear entropy of reduced single <b>qubit</b> state yields an expression for global negativity in terms of determinants of negativity fonts. Transformation equations for determinants of negativity fonts under local unitaries (LU's) are useful to construct LU invariants such as degree four and degree six invariants for four <b>qubit</b> states. The difference of squared negativity and N-tangle is an N <b>qubit</b> invariant which contains information on entanglement of the state caused by quantum coherences that are not annihilated by removing a single <b>qubit.</b> Four <b>qubit</b> invariants that detect the entanglement of specific parts in a four <b>qubit</b> state are {{expressed in terms of}} three <b>qubit</b> subsystem invariants. Numerical values of invariants bring out distinct features of several four <b>qubit</b> states which have been proposed to be the maximally entangled four <b>qubit</b> states.

25|$|Implement the {{function}} f as a quantum transform. To achieve this, Shor used repeated squaring for his modular exponentiation transformation. It {{is important to}} note that this step is more difficult to implement than the quantum Fourier transform, in that it requires ancillary <b>qubits</b> and substantially more gates to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the <b>qubits.</b> Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems, in particular the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature. Currently, some quantum computers require their <b>qubits</b> to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an electrostatic <b>qubit</b> located near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of noninteracting bosons in a double-well potential, {{which is used}} for <b>qubit</b> measurements.
