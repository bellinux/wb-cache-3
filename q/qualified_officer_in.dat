Although there have been significant reforms within the PFM, it has been ineffective at preventing criminals from orchestrating drug trafficking and organized crime. Institutional law enforcement policies drive the quality of police <b>officers</b> <b>in</b> an agency, and the policies in Mexico’s PFM agency have not been effective to prevent crime. In fact, the Mexican government has continued {{to rely on the}} military for its public security. Therefore, this thesis analyzes the organizational factors that contribute to police effectiveness. It uncovers the institutional practices within the FBI to then apply them to those of the PFM. The thesis analyzes personnel recruitment policies that feed potential recruits into its training system. It then evaluates training and education regimens to identify gaps within the curriculum that can be improved upon. This is followed by an examination of career incentives, which attempts to lure and retain <b>qualified</b> <b>officers.</b> <b>In</b> addition, institutional oversight is assessed because of its potential to control rogue officers and leaders.

Four demand and six supply scenarios are developed and compared to give 24 possible patterns of projected officer shortages and surpluses over the years 1982 to 1997, and in steady state. The relative effectiveness of various accession and lateral entry policies is then examined in an attempt to identify an optimum accession and/or lateral entry program. Finally, the Navy's ability to meet the required accession goals is assessed by studying the projected supply of college graduates qualified to enter the nuclear submarine force. The pattern of shortages and surpluses projected indicates that unless attrition rates can be reduced, it will not be possible to fully man the submarine force with nuclear <b>qualified</b> <b>officers</b> before 1993 without a policy of lateral entry, for example, nuclear engineers working in industry. In the long run, all shortages can be eliminated by a policy of increased accessions. [URL] Australian Regular arm...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the need for <b>qualified</b> Contracting <b>Officers</b> <b>in</b> the execution and administration of contracts formulated under the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Modernization Program. This 15 -year Program is mandated by Republic Act (RA) 7898, otherwise known as the AFP Modernization Act. This law is implemented through Department of National Defense Circular (DC) No. 1 dated 06 March 2000 (replacing DC 29 dated 19 May 1996). The Circular provided adequate guidance for the conduct of major system contracting, but barely touched on the process of contract execution and administration by Contracting Officers, except for assigning this function to the Major Services {{under the supervision of the}} Chief of Staff, AFP (CSAFP). It assumes that the parties involved would infer the process of contract administration from the terms and conditions of the contract itself. Contract administration, as handled by <b>qualified</b> Contracting <b>Officers,</b> is a vital process in government acquisitions. It ensures the successful completion of the contract according to the satisfaction of the parties involved. Without this system in place, the AFP risks failure in its Modernization Program (AFPMP). This thesis ascertains the need for <b>qualified</b> Contracting <b>Officers</b> to handle the complex contracts that are sure to come out of the AFPMP. It evaluates the existing contract execution and administration structure in the AFP vis-aÌ -vis existing guidelines to establish the need for Î²Contracting OfficerÎ³ positions.
