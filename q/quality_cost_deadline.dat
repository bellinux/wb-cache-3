It means developing techniques and tools of busin excellence which lead the organization to outstanding performance on <b>quality,</b> <b>costs</b> and <b>deadlines</b> {{in order to meet the}} expectations of all their stakeholders. Such an approach is needed especially in the context of an economy marked by globalization, extremely complex and dynamic that causes spectacular changes in the business environment by integrating quality management principles on purpose to develop sustainable excellence. Not coincidentally, the new edition of the European excellence model EFQM integrates for the first time the principle "managing with agility“ with the principles: “developing organizational capability”, “harnessing creativity & innovation”, “adding value to the customer”, “sustaining outstanding results” for the organization and “creating a sustainable future”. Also, the new model for quality management system defined by the edition from 2015 of ISO 9000 standards, promotes the process-based approach, incorporating the cycle "Plan - Do − Check − Act" (PDCA) and the risk-based thinking, focusing on organizational change and innovation, in order to ensure a sustainable performance in business.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many companies are increasing their competitiveness through quality improvement. However, a widely held view among quality practitioners is that companies simply {{do not know the}} true total <b>cost</b> of <b>quality,</b> which are mostly hidden among the general overhead of the business. This problem is often attributed to an inappropriate costing system. Thus, any system that assisted companies in identifying and properly quantifying these costs will be valuable. This research, therefore, was aimed at developing a <b>Quality</b> <b>Cost</b> Information System for manufacturing industry, and to show that such a system could provide a basis for analysing <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> and developing and evaluating the quality improvement process. A literature review of the quality literature highlighted that the major problems that hindered potential users from implementing an effective and efficient <b>Quality</b> <b>Cost</b> system were: current <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> measurement systems were limited by their inability to trace <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> to their source; quality was manageable only if it could be measured; <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> did not easily fit into the traditional cost accounting structure; traditional accounting systems were unlikely to change radically to accommodate proper <b>quality</b> <b>costing.</b> This literature review was complemented by an industrial survey aimed at identifying knowledge of <b>quality</b> <b>costing</b> and current practices in manufacturing industry. The findings of the literature review and industrial survey formed the basis {{for the remainder of the}} study.

General findings indicated that the level of knowledge and practice on <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> among the project management team were relatively low. One of the main contributing factors was poor knowledge in the area related to <b>quality</b> <b>cost.</b> Despite of such scenario most of the respondents showed their interest in acquiring knowledge in the field of <b>quality</b> <b>cost.</b> Hence <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> approach is at the infancy stage in Malaysian construction industry...|$|R

A review of various opinions coming from practitioners and researchers about the existent <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> models reveals {{a set of}} drawbacks (e. g. too theoretical and too close to ideal cases; too academic, with less practical impact; too much personalized to particular business processes, with difficulties in extrapolating to other cases; not comprising all dimensions of a business system). Using concepts and tools in quality management theory and practice and algorithms of innovative problem solving, this paper formulates a novel approach to improve practical usability, comprehensiveness, flexibility and customizability of a <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> management system (QCMS) when implementing it in a specific software application. Conclusions arising from the implementation in real industrial cases are also highlighted. <b>Quality</b> <b>Costs,</b> Performance Planning and Monitoring, <b>Quality</b> Management, <b>Quality</b> <b>Cost</b> Software...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} tools for evaluating the success of a quality management programme is the measurement of <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> (prevention, appraisal and failure costs). The application of the concept of <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> originated in the manufacturing industry in the early 1950 s. As increasing attention has been given to improving the overall quality in the construction process since the early 1980 s, the application of total quality management (TQM) practices in the construction industry has gained much popularity. A systematic approach is needed for measuring <b>quality</b> <b>costs,</b> especially in the construction industry, due to the great number and complexity of activities involved in a typical project. This paper describes how a simple methodology can be used to capture <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> in construction projects. Pre-existing models for capturing construction <b>quality</b> <b>costs,</b> by Davis, by Abdul-Rahman, by Low and Yeo and by others, recognize <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> components but do not address the causes or sources of unwanted deviations. This paper proposes an alternative approach, based on the process cost model and in conformance with BS 6143 (1992), which is thought to better facilitate the fundamental goal of TQM, i. e. continual process improvement. A number of professionals involved in construction quality management were interviewed and responded favourably to the practicality of the proposed framework in the construction context.

It may result in customer dissatisfaction and <b>quality</b> <b>cost.</b> This paper deals with the determination of economic service life when considering <b>quality</b> <b>cost.</b> The <b>cost</b> of <b>quality</b> is measured by using a well-known quality loss function, quadratic loss function. The result shows that integrating <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> to the model of economic service life would make the economic service life shorter.

40|$|Purpose - To {{present a}} {{proactive}} <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> measurement methodology, which describes {{the value of}} quality improvements and the implication of this value on customers' perception regarding {{the value of the}} product. Design/methodology/approach - By describing the perceived customer value in a dynamic term, it becomes possible to derive an analytical model that recognizes the implication of a company's efforts to improve design quality and conformance quality on product value as perceived by the customers. <b>Quality</b> <b>costs</b> as a performance indicator of improved design quality and conformance quality (as the results of prevention and appraisal activities) can be expressed in terms of value (i. e. a trade-off between benefits and sacrifices), where the benefits of the improvement include higher product quality and reduction of failure costs. The sacrifices include the costs to perform improvement activities (i. e. prevention and appraisal <b>costs).</b> Expressing <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> in this way thus establishes a link between producer's efforts to improve quality and the way customers perceive the value of the product. The developed methodology of proactive <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> measurement has been applied for collecting, measuring, and reporting <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> in a Swedish wood-flooring manufacturing company. Findings - Transforming <b>quality</b> <b>cost</b> measurements into value provides a better explanation regarding the effect of prevention and appraisal activities on the quality improvement indicators. Thus, the value of quality improvements is a measure of return on quality improvements (ROQI), which indicates whether the quality improvement efforts gave higher, fair, or lower return. Originality/value - This paper develops and discusses a model of customer value by accommodating its relative-nature, and presents a proactive way of measuring <b>quality</b> <b>costs</b> (i. e. value-oriented and customer-oriented).
