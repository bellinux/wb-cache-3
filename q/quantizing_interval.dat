40|$|We design {{distributed}} and quantized average consensus algorithms on arbitrary connected networks. By construction, quantized algorithms cannot {{produce a}} real, analog average. Instead, our algorithm reaches {{consensus on the}} <b>quantized</b> <b>interval</b> that contains the average. We prove that this consensus in reached in finite time almost surely. As a byproduct of this convergence result, we show that the majority voting problem is solvable with only 2 bits of memory per agent. Index Terms — Consensus, quantization, gossip, voting. 1...|$|R
40|$|Examining {{spectral}} regions {{outside of}} the band where an antireflection coating is specified can aid in finding optimal design solutions. The reflectance versus wavenumber plots at low frequencies indicate the overall thickness of the design. These plots also point to whether the design will provide theminimum possible average reflectance in the specified band. It has been discovered that these patterns are nearly replicated by the plot of a quarter-wave stack at peak frequency. It is also found that optimal solutions exist only at <b>quantized</b> <b>intervals.</b> © 2010 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 310. 0310, 310. 5696, 310. 6805, 310. 4165, 310. 1210, 310. 1620. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a method for}} making approximate Bayesian inference based on quantizing the hypothesis space and repartitioning it as observations become available. The method relies on approximating an optimal inference by using a probability distribution for <b>quantized</b> <b>intervals</b> of the unknown quantity, and by adjusting the intervals so as to obtain higher resolution in regions of higher probability, and vice versa. We repartition the hypothesis space adaptively {{with the aim of}} maximizing the mutual information between the approximate distribution and the exact distribution. It is shown that this approach is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the approximate distribution, and we provide low-complexity algorithms for approximating multi-dimensional posterior distributions with tunable complexity/performance. The resulting quantized distribution for a one-dimensional case can be visualized as a histogram where each bar has equal area, but in general unequal width. The method can be used to provide adaptive quantization of arbitrary data sequences, or to approximate the posterior expectation of for instance some loss function by summing over a pre-specified number of terms...|$|R
40|$|This work {{explores the}} edge {{agreement}} problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system under quantized measurements. Under the edge agreement framework, we introduce an important concept about the essential edge Laplacian and also obtain a reduced {{model of the}} edge agreement dynamics based on the spanning tree subgraph. The quantized edge agreement problem of second-order nonlinear multi-agent system is studied, in which both uniform and logarithmic quantizers are considered. We do not only guarantee {{the stability of the}} proposed quantized control law, but also reveal the explicit mathematical connection of the <b>quantized</b> <b>interval</b> and the convergence properties for both uniform and logarithmic quantizers, which has not been addressed before. Particularly, for uniform quantizers, we provide the upper bound of the radius of the agreement neighborhood and indicate that the radius increases with the quantization interval. While for logarithmic quantizers, the agents converge exponentially to the desired agreement equilibrium. In addition, we figure out the relationship of the quantization interval and the convergence speed and also provide the estimates of the convergence rate. Finally, simulation results are given to verify the theoretical analysis. Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures; Round 2, revised to IET Control Theory & Applications, 201...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. 123 - 126). Due to {{the emergence}} of new sensitive communication applications like eCommerce and online banking; secure communication, electronic identification and authentication are becoming a must. Cryptography is the technique used to secure communication through encryption of data messages. Pseudo Random Bit Generators (PRBG) are used by different cryptographic techniques as a tool to encrypt messages. While the well known Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) PRBG offers good statistical propel 1 ies it offers poor security since the knowledge of 2 n outputs bits make the whole generated sequence predictable. This work proposes a new digital PRBG based on AD (Analog to Digital) conversion of a composed sinusoidal signal. The aim behind the new proposal is to improve the inviolability and the security offered by the classical LFSR. The autocorrelation properties of the proposed generator are studied and compared to the propel 1 ies of the famous LFSR. Moreover, the effect of six different variables which are namely the bandwidth of the analog signal, the sampling frequency, the period of the analog signal, the coding, the <b>quantizing</b> <b>intervals</b> and the numbers of bits per sample are studied. The proposed PRBG will be tested using the famous "Five Basic Test" set of statistical testing. 1 bound copy: xi, 126 leaves; ill.; 30 cm. available at RNL...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} finding {if 314 - 1 } in n {{dimensional}} Euclidean space such that {if 314 - 2 }, i = 1, 2, ···, N, is considered. The only assumption on the fi {{is that a}} solution exists in the quantized unit hypercube. Implicitly exhaustive solution procedures, which obtain solutions by implicitly considering every point in the quantized space without making computations at each point, are studied. The implicitly exhaustive feature is made possible by adapting “space filling curves≓ to discrete spaces of general dimensionality. Several space filling curves are surveyed, and Peano's continuous mapping from the unit interval onto the unit square {{is used as a}} basis for defining a mapping from the unit <b>quantized</b> <b>interval</b> onto the unit quantized hypercube, and inversely. Ternary arithmetic is the basis for the required functional relationships in the discrete mapping. The discrete mapping has attributes of quasi-continuity, and specific numerical bounds are derived in this respect. It is shown that these bounds are of optimal order dependence on the relevant variables. It is shown how to use knowledge of first and second order properties of the fi to obtain solutions on a digital computer using space filling curves as a basis for the concept of implicitly exhaustive search. The only global properties assumed are bounds on first, or possibly second, order variations. Concluding remarks bear on the ultimate practicality of the method, and present a limited amount of experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Copy number {{variation}} (CNV) {{is increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important contributor to phenotypic variation in health and disease. Most methods for determining CNV rely on admixtures of cells in which information regarding genetic heterogeneity is lost. Here we present a protocol that allows for the genome-wide copy number analysis of single nuclei isolated from mixed populations of cells. Single-nucleus sequencing (SNS), combines flow sorting of single nuclei {{on the basis of}} DNA content and whole-genome amplification (WGA); this is followed by next-generation sequencing to <b>quantize</b> genomic <b>intervals</b> in a genome-wide manner. Multiplexing of single cells is discussed. In addition, we outline informatic approaches that correct for biases inherent in the WGA procedure and allow for accurate determination of copy number profiles. All together, the protocol takes approximately 3 d from flow cytometry to sequence-ready DNA libraries...|$|R

This output {{consists}} of packets whose sizes are multiple of 20 Kbytes, while the arrival intervals are mainly gathering around 220 msec. Two markov models are proposed. The first model, which is called model A, takes into account only the packet sizes ignoring the arrival intervals. The second model (model B) <b>quantizes</b> the arrival <b>intervals</b> so as to better approximate them.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} an unusual transport phenomenon observed in {{two-dimensional electron gas}} under integer quantum Hall effect conditions. Our calculations {{are based on the}} screening theory, using a semi-analytical model. The transport anomalies are dip and overshoot effects, where the Hall resistance decreases (or increases) unexpectedly at the <b>quantized</b> resistance plateaus <b>intervals.</b> We report on our numerical findings of the dip effect in the Hall resistance, considering GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures in which we investigated the effect under different experimental conditions. We show that, similar to overshoot, the amplitude of the dip effect is strongly influenced by the edge reconstruction due to electrostatics. It is observed that the steep potential variation close to the physical boundaries of the sample results in narrower incompressible strips, hence, the experimental observation of the dip effect is limited by the properties of these current carrying strips. By performing standard Hall resistance measurements on gate defined narrow samples, we demonstrate that the predictions of the screening theory is in well agreement with our experimental findings.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of possible generation times in mammalian cells {{does not appear}} to be continous within the limits of range for each cell type; rather, generation time is quantized in multiples of 3 - 4 hr. Synchronous cultures of Chinese hamster V 79 cells were prepared using manual and automated methods to select and stage mitotic cells. Using synchronous cultures and time-lapse video tape microscopy, it was possible to show that generation times within a population of mitotically selected cells normally disperse in a <b>quantized</b> fashion, with <b>intervals</b> of 3 - 4 hr occurring between bursts in division. In addition, at temperatures above 37 degrees, V 79 cells have a 7. 5 - 8. 5 hr modal cell cycle, while at temperatures from 36. 5 degrees to 33. 5 degrees the modal cell cycle is 11 - 12 hr long. A survey of the synchrony literature reveals that the tendency to preferred generation times holds between cell lines. The {{distribution of}} modal generation times from a variety of different cell types forms a series with a similar interval but with a greater range of values than that observed here for V 79 cells. To satisfy the published data and the work presented here, I propose a subcycle, Gq, which has a traverse time equal to the period of the clock. The period appears to be fixed at close to the same value in all mammalian somatic cells. The timekeeping mechanism appears to be temperature compensated, since the time required to traverse Gq is constant at temperatures between 34 degrees and 39 degrees. It is suggested that cell cycle time increases at lower temperatures, lower serum concentration, and high cell densitite because the number of rounds of traverse through Gq increases...|$|R
