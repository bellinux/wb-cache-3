Although the British were suspicious of the diagnosis, they were concerned that he might die in prison like Mälzer, which would be a public relations disaster.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide smokers with {{information}} on the relative benefits of mitigating radon and <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> in reducing radon-related lung cancer risk. METHODS: The standard radon risk model, linked with models characterizing residential radon exposure and patterns of moving to new homes, was used to estimate the risk reduction produced by remediating high-radon homes, <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking,</b> or both. RESULTS: <b>Quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> reduces lung cancer risk from radon more than does reduction of radon exposure itself. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers should understand that, in addition to producing other health benefits, <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> dominates strategies to deal with the problem posed by radon...|$|R

5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis <b>quit</b> <b>smoking</b> in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are five {{times more likely to}} die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries also contribute to the driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had <b>quit</b> <b>smoking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Howard (Melissa Leo) quits smoking, and {{her partner}} Felton (Daniel Baldwin) fears her edginess will endanger his safety. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) also tries to <b>quit</b> <b>smoking,</b> but tries to live {{vicariously}} through his smoking partner Pembleton (Andre Braugher). Howard and Bayliss petition Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{to set up a}} non-smoking section for the squad room, but an amused Gee refuses because most of the detectives smoke. Howard, Felton, Bayliss and Pembleton find they share a common suspect in a Union Square murder, and plan a joint stakeout. Howard and Bayliss decide to ride together so Pembleton and Felton can smoke in the car. Although outwardly critical and skeptical, Pembleton and Felton are actually impressed with their partners' willpower and discuss the merits of quitting smoking. Howard and Bayliss, however, talk about nothing but smoking, prompting Bayliss to walk to Pembleton's car window and ask for a cigarette. As the result, the four detectives almost miss the suspect, and have to engage him in a foot chase to arrest him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Snus is {{considerably}} less hazardous to health than cigarettes. Recent data from Scandinavia {{have indicated that}} many smokers use snus as a method for <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking.</b> Methods Data from five repeated cross-sectional surveys of Norwegian men and women aged 16 - 74 were pooled (N = 6 262). Respondents were asked about current and former smoking and snus use. Former daily smokers (N = 1219) and current daily smokers {{who had tried to}} quit at least once (N = 1118) were asked about the method they had used at their latest quit attempt and how many quit attempts they had made. Former smokers were also requested to report what year they had made their final quit attempt. Results Snus was the most common method used for <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> among men, while NRT was most often used among women. Stratifying the data according to year of <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> (1945 - 2007) indicated a significant increase in use of the methods for quitting asked about over time. Among men, this was largely due to an increase in the use of snus. Among male quitters under the age of 45 years, 45. 8 % of those who had used snus on their last attempt to quit were current non-smokers (OR = 1. 61, CI 1. 04 - 2. 29), while 26, 3 % of those who had used NRT were current non-smokers. 59. 6 % of successful quitters and 19. 5 % of unsuccessful quitters who had used snus as a method for <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> had continued to use snus on a daily basis after quitting. Conclusion Norwegian men frequently use snus as a method for <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking</b> whereas {{women are more likely to}} use NRT. The findings indicate that switching to snus can be an effective method for <b>quitting</b> <b>smoking.</b> </p...|$|R
