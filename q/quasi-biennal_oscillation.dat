Using Northern Hemisphere data for 1964 - 78 and global data for 1978 - 93 it is shown that these spectral peaks are robust in both angular momentum and Eliassen-Palm flux divergence. This spectral signature represents a circulation anomaly in both hemispheres, and implies a dynamical origin to the previously observed similar spectral peaks in column ozone in the extratropics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe monthly {{variability}} of solar radiation over Mauritius is examined using monthly data from CMSAF (Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring) satellite {{during the period}} January 1983 -December 2005. It is found that the series analysed have periodicities which {{can be related to}} two well-known oscillations (<b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> - QBO and El Niño Southern Oscillation - ENSO). The results highlight a significant modulation of solar radiation by QBO that indicate the possible modulation of convective activity and cloud cover by this oscillation. A temporal conjunction between El-Nino events and high solar radiation disturbances is shown. Nevertheless, it was difficult to assess a simple correlation between ENSO and solar radiation variability over the studied period. This paper focuses on interannual oscillation and omits the intra-seasonal tropical perturbations (Madden Julian Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, Southern Antarctic Mode). This demonstrates a first approach on the interannual solar radiation variability over Mauritius...|$|E

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{response to}} the 11 year solar cycle (SC) and its combination with the <b>quasi-biennal</b> <b>oscillation</b> (QBO) are analyzed in four simulations of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version 3. 5 (WACCM 3. 5), which were performed with observed sea surface temperatures, volcanic eruptions, greenhouse gases, and a nudged QBO. The analysis focuses on the annual mean response of the model to the SC and {{on the evolution of}} the solar signal during the Northern Hemispheric winter. WACCM 3. 5 simulates a significantly warmer stratosphere under solar maximum conditions compared to solar minimum. The vertical structure of the signal in temperature and ozone at low latitudes agrees with observations better than previous versions of the model. The temperature and wind response in the extratropics is more uncertain because of its seasonal dependence and the large dynamical variability of the polar vortex. However, all four simulations reproduce the observed downward propagation of zonal wind anomalies from the upper stratosphere to the lower stratosphere during boreal winter resulting from solar-induced modulation of the polar night jet and the Brewer-Dobson circulation. Combined QBO-SC effects in the extratropics are consistent with observations, but they are not robust across the ensemble members. During boreal winter, solar signals are also found in tropospheric circulation and surface temperature. Overall, these results confirm the plausibility of proposed dynamical mechanisms driving the atmospheric {{response to the}} SC. The improvement of the model climatology and variability in the polar stratosphere is the basis for the success in simulating the evolution and magnitude of the solar signal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNitric acid (HNO 3) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{constituents}} impacting ozone loss in the stratosphere. Through different chemical reactions occuring in the stratosphere, HNO 3 transforms into nitrogen oxides (NO 2, NO 3), which in turn, lead to ozone destruction through catalytic cycles. Until now, no in-depth analysis of HNO 3 concentrations in the stratosphere has been carried out. It is now possible, thanks to the satellite IASI (Eumetsat), to have concentrations data since 2006. The satellite uses infrared radiation coming from the surface of the Earth and calculates the amount of radiation passing through the atmosphere and actually reaching the satellite. Through an inversion algorithm developed at Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), HNO 3 total columns can be retrieved. Satellite measurements of HNO 3 allow us to have a global coverage of the concentrations over the planet, with a good time and spatial resolution. Our work thus allows a global analysis, but also focuses on the polar regions, where nitric acid plays a particularly important role, since it allows the formation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) which are surfaces enhancing ozone destruction even more. After validation of the satellite data through comparison with ground-based measurements, our purpose is thus to analyse the variability of nitric acid through the years. We use a simple regression model taking into account parameters known to influence the concentrations variability. This model considers mainly atmospheric processes and natural parameters such as the solar flux or the <b>quasi-biennal</b> <b>oscillation.</b> The model will be improved and completed with other parameters later on, but our approach is first to ensure the ability of a simple model to represent HNO 3 variability through latitudes and time...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{temporal}} dynamics of precipitation in northwestern France in 8 {{relation to the}} dominant climatic pattern in Europe were investigated. The general trends 9 and the nonstationary behavior of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were described 10 using fractal analysis and Fourier spectral and continuous wavelet analysis of a NAO 11 index time series over the 1865 – 2004 period. The 44 -year and 8 -year multidecadal 12 components showed a clear increasing power {{during the second half}} of the last century. 13 The possible link between rainfall variability and the NAO was then investigated. The 14 links between the NAO and rainfall were not as obvious, as NAO-like components were 15 not easily retrieved in the precipitation records: Relationships between the NAO and 16 rainfall were very likely at certain timescales but were not systematically very obvious. 17 For instance, the characteristic <b>quasi-biennal</b> <b>oscillation</b> (QBO) of the NAO was barely 18 detected in precipitation, but a 6 -year fluctuation beginning in the 90 s was found to be 19 statistically significant at a 95 % confidence limit After investigating a possible link 20 with the Southern Oscillation Index, the occurrence of this fluctuation in the beginning of 21 the 90 s could be related to the observed shift of the QBO toward slightly higher 22 frequencies in the NAO time series. On the other hand, a modulation of the QBO by a 23 6 -year interannual fluctuation would suggest the existence of a 6 -year climate pattern 24 that could affect precipitation and, to a lesser extent, the NAO. Cross-wavelet analysis 25 between the NAO and precipitation revealed a loss in correlation across the 1970 – 2005 26 period, which seemed to be the fact of a QBO-like fluctuation.

40|$|Multi-regression {{analyses}} {{have often}} been used recently to detect trends, in particular in ozone or temperature data sets in the stratosphere. The confidence in detecting trends depends {{on a number of}} factors which generate uncertainties. Part of these uncertainties comes from the random variability and these are what is usually considered. They can be statistically estimated from residual deviations between the data and the fitting model. However, interferences between different sources of variability affecting the data set, such as the <b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> (QBO), volcanic aerosols, solar flux variability and the trend can also be a critical source of errors. This type of error has hitherto not been well quantified. In this work an artificial data series has been generated to carry out such estimates. The sources of errors considered here are: the length of the data series, the dependence on the choice of parameters used in the fitting model and the time evolution of the trend in the data series. Curves provided here, will permit future studies to test the magnitude of the methodological bias expected for a given case, as shown in several real examples. It is found that, if the data series is shorter than a decade, the uncertainties are very large, whatever factors are chosen to identify the source of the variability. However the errors can be limited when dealing with natural variability, if a sufficient number of periods (for periodic forcings) are covered by the analysed dataset. However when analysing the trend, the response to volcanic eruption induces a bias, whatever the length of the data series. The signal to noise ratio is a key factor: doubling the noise increases the period for which data is required in order to obtain an error smaller than 10 %, from 1 to 3 – 4 decades. Moreover, if non-linear trends are superimposed on the data, and if the length of the series is longer than five years, a non-linear function has to be used to estimate trends. When applied to real data series, and when a breakpoint in the series occurs, the study reveals that data extending over 5 years are needed to detect a significant change in the slope of the ozone trends at mid-latitudes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{patterns of}} pyroclastic dispersal and sedimentation from active volcanoes {{located in the}} Andean Central and Southern volcanic zones. Numerical approaches are utilized, including single-particle trajectories, advection-diffusion and particle-tracking models, {{in order to gain}} insights into the impact of future volcanic eruptions in the region. Numerical models and wind data have been tested considering recent eruptions that have occurred in the Andes, and both tephra dispersal and recorded fallout have been successfully rebuilt. As volcanic zones are separated by several degrees of latitude, different environmental conditions are observed. For the Central Volcanic Zone interseasonal variability is present, and even opposite transport directions are observed between austral summer and winter months. Interannual variability is also detected, being mostly related to the El Nifio Southern Oscillation in the troposphere, and to the <b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> in the stratosphere. Outcomes from the modeling indicate that distal regions from the volcanic sources are likely to be impacted for tephra fallout, in particular when westward transport occurs during the summer (northern segment) or when eastward transport is intensified during winter (southern segment). In contrast is the southernmost Southern Volcanic Zone where eastward transport is dominant throughout the year. Pyroclast dispersal is more widespread during the autumn-winter period, in connection with the arrival of frontal systems. Differences in atmospheric circulation between the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere are less evident at these latitudes. Probabilistic maps of tephra accumulation on the surface, derived for different eruptive scenarios, have been outlined for areas close to active volcanoes. Additionally, exceedance probability curves were estimated for places of interest. Volcanoes analyzed include El Misti in southern Peru, Parinacota in the Chile-Bolivia border and Lascar in northern Chile, which are located in the Central Volcanic Zone. Hudson volcano was selected from the Southern Volcanic Zone. Volcanic hazard implications are discussed for all case studies. In addition, pyroclastic transport and dispersal have also been addressed in some cases. Lahar flows were numerically simulated for Hudson volcano, and an estimation of the probability of occurrence of a moderate to high magnitude eruption was calculated. Some topics of the methodology are briefly discussed, including the importance of shape factor of particles on settling velocity. A sensitivity analysis of the estimated probability of tephra accumlation on the surface to the total number of simulations was investigated.

40|$|The {{tropical}} {{region is}} the main entry point of the chemical species in the troposphere lifted and transported by convection in the stratosphere through the tropopause and redistributed to higher latitudes via the Brewer Dobson circulation. Thus {{any change in the}} distribution of stratospheric constituents in the tropics {{will have an impact on}} their concentration at mid-latitudes. Long time series of O 3 and NO 2 columns in the tropics are available from 2 SAOZ UV-visible spectrometers stations: in Bauru (Brazil, 22 °S, 49 °W) since 1995 and in La Réunion (21 °S, 55 °E) in the Indian Ocean since 1993. The most significant modulation for both components at both stations is the seasonal cycle (~ 40 %). A multiple regression analysis of ozone and NO 2 columns at Bauru and la Reunion has quantified the impact of solar and geophysical parameters of their variability. Following this analysis, the cycles of the most influential parameters in the tropics are (in decreasing order) : the <b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> (QBO) with 40 % for both species, the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with 25 % for O 3 and 20 % for the NO 2, the solar flux with 15 % and 18 %, and finally the stratospheric aerosols with 20 % and 12 %. After subtracting these influences, the long-term residual variations of ozone are not significant. In contrast, NO 2 shows a significant increase at both stations between 2001 - 2006, followed by a decrease after 2007. Same analysis has been applied to a merged satellite data set above the stations with GOME (1995 - 2002) - SCIAMACHY (2003 - 2011) for NO 2 columns and EPTOMS (1995 - 2004) - OMI TOMS (2005 - 2011) for O 3 columns. The long-term residual variations of those data present similar behaviour as SAOZ. From variations of the Eddy heat flux, variations in average intensity of meridional exchange through the southern subtropical barrier related to the amplitude of planetary waves over the entire Southern Hemisphere have been identified since 2001. These distortions of amplitude of planetary waves, affecting all longitudes, have been detected through the modulation of the two tropical stations's equivalent latitude. After taking into account this influence, the NO 2 residual trend in the tropics is shown to be of 3 %/decade only, that is consistent with the known increase by 2. 5 %/decade, of N 2 O the source of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere...|$|E

The models integrations were made without identical contraints e. g. boundary conditions, incoming solar radiation). All models are able to represent the dominant features of the extratropical circulation. In this paper, the structure of the tropical winds and the strengths of the Kelvin waves are examined. Explanations for the differences exhibited. between the models. as well as between models and analyses, are also proposed. In the analyses a rich spectrum of waves (eastward and westward) is present and contributes to drive the SAO (SemiAnnual Oscillation) and the QBO (<b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation).</b> The amplitude of the Kelvin waves is close to the one observed in UARS (Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite) data. In agreement with observations, the Kelvin waves generated in the models propagate into the middle atmosphere as wave packets which underlines convective forcing origin. In most models, slow Kelvin waves propagate too high and are hence overestimated in the upper stratosphere and in the mesosphere, except for the UM which is more diffusive. These waves are not sufficient to force realistic westerlies of the QBO or SAO westerly phases. If the SAO is represented by all models only two of them are able to generate westerlies between 10 hPa and 50 hPa. The importance of the role played by subgrided gravity waves is more and more recognized. Actually, the EUGCM which includes a parametrization of gravity waves with a non-zero phase speed is able to simulate. with however some unrealistic features, clear easterly to westerly transitions as well as westerlies downward propagations. Thermal damping is also important in the westerlies forcing in the stratosphere. The model ARPEGE-climat shows more westerlies in the stratosphere than tile other three models probably due to the use of a simplified scheme to predict the ozone distribution in the middle atmosphere...|$|E

The goal of this study is identify pattems of several climate indices and their relationship with rivers flow time series, in order to further understand the main modes of adjustment of climate pattems that have significant relationships with the flow. We used monthly data of natural flows at 16 locations of hydroelectric plants in main Brazilians basins, available through the National Electric System Operator, and the following monthly climatic indices, provided by NOAA: Southem Oscillation Index - SOl; North Atlantic Oscillation - NAO; Pacific North America Pattem - PNA; Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation - AMO; Tropical Southem Atlantic - TSA; Tropical North Atlantic - TNA; Pacific Decadal Oscillation - PDO; SST anomalies in the Nino 3. 4 region (N 3. 4); <b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> - QBO; Atlantic Meridional Mode - AMM; Arctic Oscillation - AO; Antarctic Oscillation - AAO. The period of study was from 1979 to 2011. The principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the climate indices set, to identify the main modes, and simple correlation analysis was used to obtain the correlations between the time series of the modes resulting from PCA and the rivers flow series, lagged up to 4 months (with modes preceding the flow). The results indicated significant correlations to all the tested lagged between the flow streams and the first three climatic indices modes, that explaining respectively 25 %, 18 % and 11 % of the original variance. The first mode is characterized by lower frequency fluctuations (mainly decadal and multidecadal), presenting an adjustment between all indices considered. · with emphasis on pattems of low frequency (AMM, AMO, PNA, NAO).

Higher correlations are identified between this mode and the rivers flows in Tocantins and San Francisco basins. Other climate indices modes with lower explained variance also showed significant correlations with the flow, especially the case of indices associated with PDO, AAO, QBO, SOl and PNA.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of ENSO-like periodicities was emphasized in lacustrine sediments from Chilean Lake District. A 600 -year short core (PU-II) was retrieved in Lago Puyehue (40 °S). The age model {{was derived from}} varve counting, and further constrained by 137 Cs and 210 Pb accumulation rates and by correlation of an instantaneous event attributed to the massive Valdivia 1960 earthquake (Boës 2005). Varve thickness was calibrated with local climate conditions for the last 20 years. Thick varve deposition was strongly related to high local precipitation, with the highest correlation ratio (r= 0. 8) during Austral winter (May). The inflluence of ENSO-like oscillations in the varve deposition was demonstrated by a significant correlation between varve index and SOI (South Oscillation Index), especially in November. Spectral analysis {{was applied to the}} 600 -year varve thickness record to identify potential periodicities in the signal. The PU-II short core displays the most robust periodicities around subdecadal periods in agreement with major Southern Hemisphere climate oscillations (i. e., <b>Quasi-Biennal</b> <b>Oscillation</b> QBO, El Niño Southern Oscillation ENSO, Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO). Here we present additional investigations on the same varve record to better understand the climate control on the sediment deposition. Firstly, we focus on the temporal lag between varve thickness and November SOI. A cross-wavelet analysis of PU-II varve thickness and the historical 125 -year long SOI records allowed us to identify three spectral bands (2. 3 to 6. 3 years, around 9. 5 et 13. 9 years). Then, we quantified the leads and lags between varve index and SOI within these spectral bands. In the ENSO-like spectral band, the cross-correlation is the strongest in the sub-intervals 1866 - 1890 and 1935 - 1990. SOI and varve index display a small positive delay (of the order of 4 months) before 1890 and between 1960 and 1990; SOI is lagging behind the varve index. The delay is negative, of the same order of magnitude, between 1935 and 1960. Varve index obviously lags SOI by 1. 5 years only punctually, around 1900 (1890 - 1910), 1955 and in the 1990 s, when the cross-correlation is very weak. A control of the lacustrine sediment deposition by ENSO-like oscillation is then only confirmed by spectral analyses on limited time intervals. Rapid transitions between positive and negative time-delay could be related to instantaneous events like for instance the 1960 earthquake. Secondly, we investigate the cross-correlation between the PU-II varve record and the historical record of sunspots over the last 300 years. The solar activity-like period of around 11 years is clearly evidenced throughout the whole 1700 - 2000 AD interval. Like for SOI, the time delay between sunspots and varve index is not constant through time, its amplitude as well as its sign is variable. Before 1850 the varve index obviously lags behind the sunspot index by more or less three years. Later the signal remains unclear, with alternate leads and lags between the two records. The study of time delay between lacustrine varve archives and climate factors is a promising approach but more investigations are requested to fully understand the climate controls of sediment deposition in Lago Puyehue...|$|E
