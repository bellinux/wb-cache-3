500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{neptunium}} sulfide compounds have been characterized, including the pure sulfide compounds NpS, NpS3, Np2S5, Np3S5, Np2S3, and Np3S4. Of these, Np2S3, prepared by reacting NpO2 with hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at around 1000°C, is the most well-studied and three allotropic forms are known. The α form exists up to around 1230°C, the β up to 1530°C, and the γ form, which can also exist as Np3S4, at higher temperatures. NpS can be created by reacting Np2S3 and neptunium metal at 1600°C and Np3S5 can be prepared by the decomposition of Np2S3 at 500°C or by reacting sulfur and neptunium hydride at 650°C. Np2S5 is made by heating a mixture of Np3S5 and pure sulfur to 500°C. All of the neptunium sulfides except for the β and γ forms of Np2S3 are isostructural with the equivalent uranium sulfide and several, including NpS, α−Np2S3, and β−Np2S3 are also isostructural with the equivalent plutonium sulfide. The oxysulfides NpOS, Np4O4S, and Np2O2S have also been created, although the latter three have not been well studied.

40|$|The {{influence}} of pulsed nanosecond silent (or barrier) discharge on the flame velocity was investigated for propane/air {{mixture in a}} wide range of equivalence ratios at atmospheric pressure. It was experimentally obtained that blow-off flow rates are more than twice increased as compared to the system without silent discharge. Discharge energy input is less then 1 % of burner power. This effect is explained by the formation of atomic oxygen in silent discharge followed by acceleration of limiting chemical reactions. Experiment A set-up consisted of burner, pulse high-voltage power supply, gas supply system and diagnostic system has been used to settle the problem (fig. 1). The burner body is made of glass. The exit section is a rectangle with 30 mm x 2 mm dimensions, so flame basis is long enough to work in a 1 D geometry.
