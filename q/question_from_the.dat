5|$|The {{differences}} between millipedes and centipedes {{are a common}} <b>question</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, {{a single pair of}} antennae, and the presence of postanntennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, elbowed antennae for probing the substrate, a pair of robust mandibles and a single pair of maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a pair of small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a pair of large poison claws.|$|E

25|$|In 1298 Ibn Taymiyyah {{wrote an}} {{explanation}} of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama). The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a <b>question</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city of Hama, Syria. At that particular time Ash'arites held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God. Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.|$|E

He also had a nearly seven-year streak of not speaking at all in any context, finally breaking that silence on January 14, 2013, when he was understood to have joked that a law degree from Yale may be proof of incompetence.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{there are}} four sources from which Muslim {{scholars}} extract religious law or rulings, and upon which they base their fatwa. The first is the Quran, which is the holy book of Islam, and which Muslims believe is the direct and literal word of God, revealed to Prophet Mohammad. The second source is the Sunnah, which incorporates anything that the Prophet Mohammad said, did or approved of. The third source is the consensus of the scholars, meaning that if the scholars of a previous generation have all agreed on a certain issue, then this consensus is regarded as representing Islam. Finally, if no scripture is found regarding a specific <b>question</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> three first sources, then an Islamic scholar performs {{what is known as}} ijtihad. This means that they use their own logic and reasoning {{to come up with the}} best answer according to the best of their ability.|$|E

25|$|Court rulings in Saskatchewan {{have held}} that religious-based {{objections}} of provincial marriage commissioners to same-sex marriage {{do not need to}} be accommodated, because refusal by a government-appointed marriage commissioner to perform same-sex marriages would constitute a violation of the Charter equality rights of gay and lesbian individuals. In 2008, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal held that marriage commissioner Orville Nichols had discriminated against a same-sex couple by refusing to perform their marriage ceremony. The Tribunal ordered him to pay $2,500 in compensation to the couple. In 2009, the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench upheld the Tribunal's decision. In response to a reference <b>question</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Government of Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled in 2011 that two proposed bills which would have permitted marriage commissioners to refuse to perform same-sex marriages because of religious objections would be unconstitutional. Ordained religious ministers in Canada are not required to marry same-sex couples. A poll conducted in October 2006 found that 57% of Canadians believe that a marriage commissioner should be able to refuse to officiate at a gay wedding so long as there are enough marriage commissioners available, and 72% felt that clergy should have the right to refuse to officiate if doing so would violate his or her religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|The planned date of {{commissioning}} {{has been}} postponed several times. Thus, in July 1997, the commissioning {{of the new}} line was still expected in 2004. In December 2006, the Federal Government and Deutsche Bahn AG announced that the new line would be completed in 2016. In May 2006, the opening year was given as 2020 in {{a response to a}} parliamentary <b>question</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Green Party, although the Federal Minister of Transport Wolfgang Tiefensee indicated {{at the opening of the}} Nürnberg-Ingolstadt high-speed line, that the line would be opened in 2016/2017. At the end of 2007 the Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that the line would not be completed until 2041. Later, it became known that 2041 had been used in a meeting of the board of directors to refer to the completion date of the upgraded line between Fürth and Ebensfeld. The new line is still planned to be completed by 2017 at the latest. Commissioning is now scheduled for the timetable change on 8December 2017. According to information from mid-2015, this date is tight, but it can be kept. €29million were provided for the new line from the KonjunkturpaketI ("stimulus package I"). In December 2006, a parliamentary support group was founded called Vollendung des Verkehrsprojektes Deutsche Einheit Nr.8 ("Completion of German Unity transport project No. 8"), comprising over twenty Bundestag deputies. The parliamentarians were keen to accelerate the completion of the line. In April 2007, Transport Minister Tiefensee confirmed with the support group that the line would be completied by 2016, but in May 2008 the parliamentarians announced 2017 as the completion date in a press release.|$|E

The first Polish translation was released with a new title: Harry Potter i Insygnia Śmierci– Harry Potter and the Insignia of Death.

2500|$|Selenium Remote Control was a {{refactoring}} of Driven Selenium or Selenium B {{designed by}} Paul Hammant, credited with Jason as co-creator of Selenium. The original version directly launched {{a process for}} the browser in <b>question,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> test language of Java, [...]Net, Python or Ruby. The wire protocol (called 'Selenese' in its day) was reimplemented in each language port. After the refactor by Dan Fabulich, and Nelson Sproul (with help from Pat Lightbody) there was an intermediate daemon process between the driving test script, and the browser. The benefits included the ability to drive remote browsers, and the reduced need to port every line of code to an increasingly growing set of languages. Selenium Remote Control completely took over from the Driven Selenium code-line in 2006. The browser pattern for 'Driven'/'B' and 'RC' was response/request, which subsequently became known as Comet.|$|E
