40|$|Typical current {{protocols}} require lamps 1 - 2 h to stabilise before initial {{white reference}} measurements on NIRS instruments. However many in-line analytical applications that employ a near infrared (NIR) spectrometric system, which involves scanning of numerous samples each second, making reference measurements difficult and inconvenient.
