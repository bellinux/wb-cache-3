5|$|In 1988, {{following}} his mother's death, a young Peter <b>Quill</b> is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, {{a group of}} space pirates led by Yondu Udonta. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, <b>Quill</b> steals an orb but is attacked by Korath, a subordinate to the fanatical Kree, Ronan. Although <b>Quill</b> escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the orb.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, <b>Quill</b> tricks Yondu {{into taking}} a {{container}} supposedly containing the Stone, {{and gives the}} real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well {{that they did not}} deliver <b>Quill</b> to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and <b>Quill</b> learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. <b>Quill</b> finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quilling</b> {{paper is}} {{available}} on the consumer market in over 250 colors and dimensions. It can be divided into various categories, like solid colored <b>Quilling</b> paper, graduated <b>Quilling</b> paper, two-tone <b>Quilling</b> paper, acid free <b>Quilling</b> paper and other assorted parcels of <b>Quilling</b> paper. It is available in various dimensions, such as 1/8”, ¼” and 3/8 broad paper parcels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quilling</b> is {{relatively}} easy to learn compared to most other crafts, and with the resources available today, it can be learned by almost everyone. Basic <b>quilling</b> techniques can be learned almost anywhere and there are several videos online that can teach you how to start <b>quilling.</b> There are more exotic styles of <b>quilling</b> that aren't commonly taught, but can be learned through books that teach the specific style you are looking for. <b>Quilling</b> is also a great craft for kids as it teaches them fine motor skills and is a great craft to train their hand-eye coordination. To see <b>quilling</b> used in the classroom, you can contact your child's school district.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} porcupine is its coat of <b>quills.</b> An adult porcupine has about 30,000 <b>quills</b> that cover all of its body except its underbelly, face, and feet. <b>Quills</b> are modified hairs formed into sharp, barbed, hollow spines. They are used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter. Porcupines do not throw their <b>quills,</b> but when threatened, they contract the muscles near the skin which causes the <b>quills</b> {{to stand up and}} out from their bodies. When the <b>quills</b> are in this position, they become easier to detach from the body, especially when the porcupines swing their tails towards attackers. The barbs at the tip become lodged in the flesh of an attacker and are difficult and painful to remove. The <b>quills</b> are normally flattened against the body and in this position are less easily dislodged.|$|R
5|$|Feathers {{were used}} also for <b>quill</b> pens, for {{fletching}} arrows, and to decorate fishing lures.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, paleontologists {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} <b>quill</b> knobs on a well-preserved Velociraptor mongoliensis forearm from Mongolia, confirming the presence of feathers in this species.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey <b>Quill,</b> {{the former}} Supermarine test pilot, {{initiated}} {{a project to}} build an exact replica of K5054, the prototype Spitfire {{to be put on}} permanent public display as a memorial to R.J. Mitchell. A team of original Supermarine designers worked with Aerofab Restorations of Andover for 10 years to create the facsimile. It was unveiled to the public in April 1993 by <b>Quill</b> at the RAF Museum, Hendon, and is currently on loan to the Tangmere Military Aviation Museum.|$|E
40|$|Porcupine <b>quilling</b> is {{a common}} {{emergency}} presentation for dogs living in suburban and rural areas. Although complications secondary to <b>quilling</b> are relatively rare, they can be serious; reports include cutaneous abscesses, synovitis, septic arthritis, pneumothorax, and periocular complications. <b>Quills,</b> with their backward-pointing barbs, {{have been known to}} migrate deep into tissues far from their original site of entry, especially if they are not removed immediately. Since they cannot usually be seen on radiographs, advanced cross-sectional imaging in the form of ultrasound and CT is often needed to locate the <b>quills</b> if penetration into deeper tissues and organs is suspected. Sometimes dogs will present weeks after <b>quilling</b> with signs the owner has not attributed to the porcupine encounter. A history of <b>quilling,</b> however, should never be ignored...|$|R
50|$|Almost {{the entire}} body is covered with {{bristles}} which are either dark brown or black and rather coarse. This mammal is recognizable by the <b>quills</b> that run along the head, nape, and back that can be raised into a crest, hence the name crested porcupine. Also, some sturdier <b>quills</b> which are about 35 cm in length run along the sides and back half of the body. These sturdier <b>quills</b> are used, for the most part, for defense and are usually marked with light and dark bands which alternate; these are not firmly attached. This porcupine has a shorter tail which has rattle <b>quills</b> at the end. The rattle <b>quills</b> broaden at the terminal end and the broad portion is hollow with thin walls. When these <b>quills</b> are vibrated, they produce a hiss-like rattle.|$|R

5|$|Peter <b>Quill</b> / Star-Lord and a {{group of}} misfits, {{including}} Gamora, Rocket, Drax the Destroyer and Groot, fight to keep a powerful orb from the clutches of the villainous Ronan.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Quill</b> {{attempts}} {{to sell the}} orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing {{in a pair of}} bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket, and the tree-like humanoid Groot. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln. A powerful inmate there, Drax, {{attempts to}} kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan, who killed his family. <b>Quill</b> convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, <b>Quill,</b> Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the Milano.|$|E
5|$|All {{production}} aircraft were flight tested before delivery. During the Second World War, Jeffrey <b>Quill</b> was Vickers Supermarine's chief test pilot, {{in charge of}} flight-testing all aircraft types built by Vickers Supermarine. He oversaw a group of 10 to 12 pilots responsible for testing all developmental and production Spitfires built by the company in the Southampton area. <b>Quill</b> devised the standard testing procedures which, with variations for specific aircraft designs, operated from 1938. Alex Henshaw, chief test pilot at Castle Bromwich from 1940, was placed in charge of testing all Spitfires built at that factory. He co-ordinated a team of 25 pilots and also assessed all Spitfire developments. Between 1940 and 1946, Henshaw flew a total of 2,360 Spitfires and Seafires, more than 10% of total production.|$|E

50|$|Many <b>quilled</b> {{art works}} {{can be found}} on {{cabinets}} and stands, cribbage boards, ladies' purses, a wide range of both pictures and frames, work baskets, tea caddies, coats of arms and wine coasters. Storage boxes, larger than most jewelry boxes with drawers and/or tops that opened, <b>quilled</b> lock boxes, and much more. Some items were specially designed for <b>quilling</b> with recessed surfaces. <b>Quilling</b> was also combined or married with other techniques such as embroidery and painting.|$|R
5000|$|More commonly, their <b>quills</b> and guardhairs {{are used}} for {{traditional}} decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs {{are used in the}} creation of the Native American [...] "porky roach" [...] headdress. The main <b>quills</b> may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the <b>quills</b> for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the <b>quills</b> it left stuck in the blanket.|$|R

5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with <b>quill</b> knobs on the ulna. <b>Quill</b> knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E

50|$|Porcupines' <b>quills,</b> or spines, take {{on various}} forms, {{depending}} on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin, and embedded in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines have <b>quills</b> embedded in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines, single <b>quills</b> are interspersed with bristles, underfur, and hair.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quills</b> are {{released}} by contact or may drop {{out when the}} porcupine shakes its body. New <b>quills</b> grow to replace lost ones. Porcupines were long believed {{to have the ability}} to project their <b>quills</b> to a considerable distance at an enemy, but this has since been proven to be untrue.|$|R
40|$|A {{relationship}} was detected between {{the presence of}} embedded porcupine <b>quills</b> and the diagnosis of rabies in raccoons in eastern Canada during 1999 – 2004. No {{relationship was}} found between the presence of <b>quills</b> in raccoons and the diagnosis of canine distemper. Raccoons with embedded <b>quills</b> should be submitted for rabies testing...|$|R
5|$|The Ravagers and Quill's group {{join with}} the Nova Corps {{to confront the}} Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group {{breaching}} the Dark Aster with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Gamora fights and defeats Nebula, who then escapes, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but <b>Quill</b> distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. <b>Quill</b> grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.|$|E

50|$|Her quillwork is labor-intensive. She gathers her own <b>quills</b> from freshly killed porcupines, then washes and dyes them. She uses both {{synthetic}} {{and natural}} dyes, such as bloodroot, blackberries, and wolf moss. Sorting the <b>quills</b> by color and size is the lengthiest {{step in the}} process. The <b>quills</b> are then softened in a bath of warm water, and Fogarty flattens them with her own teeth. She then appliqués or wraps the <b>quills</b> to moose or deer hide to create intricate patterns.|$|R
50|$|During the Renaissance, French and Italian nuns and monks used <b>quilling</b> to {{decorate}} book covers and religious items. The paper {{most commonly used}} was strips of paper trimmed from the gilded edges of books. These gilded paper strips were then rolled to create the <b>quilled</b> shapes. <b>Quilling</b> often imitated the original ironwork of the day.|$|R

50|$|Brush-tailed porcupines live {{in small}} family groups of about eight members. Different family groups can share resources. When {{attacked}} by a predator, the porcupine raises its <b>quills</b> so it looks twice its size, rattles its tail <b>quills,</b> and stomps its feet. As with all porcupines, the brush-tailed porcupine backs into the attacker and inflicts damage with its <b>quills.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Quills</b> {{were the}} primary writing {{instrument}} {{in the western world}} from the 6th to the 19th century.
