50|$|These {{butterflies}} {{are rather}} similar to Argynnis aglaja, Argynnis adippe and Brenthis daphne, {{which have the}} same orange color on the upperside of the wings, but show different markings and spots. Moreover {{the underside of the}} hindwings does not have the large pearly spots characteristic of the <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> <b>fritillary.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over 1000 {{species of}} Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) have been {{recorded}} at Minsmere. The 32 recorded butterfly species include the silver-studded blue, the Camberwell beauty and the <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> <b>fritillary.</b> In September 2004 the moth species Catocala conjuncta, previously unrecorded in Britain, {{was found on the}} reserve. To acknowledge its place of capture it was given the common name Minsmere crimson underwing.|$|E
50|$|The adults fly in July/August and {{lay eggs}} {{near to the}} larval food plants which are species of violets, (similar to the pearl-bordered fritillary). The eggs are often laid in places where there are dead bracken {{on the ground or}} in areas where the {{underlying}} rock is limestone the eggs may be laid in moss overlying rocks. The mosaics are typically one-third grass and two-thirds bracken. It likes drier conditions (but not as dry as the <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> <b>fritillary)</b> than its more common relative Argynnis aglaja, preferring sandy or rocky hills and banks with patches of the food plant for the larvae. It is among the first butterfly species to disappear when the vegetation becomes too lush.|$|E

30|$|In the FSE trials, the {{abundance}} of arthropods changed {{in the same direction}} as their resources and herbivores, pollinators, and beneficial natural enemies of pests were reduced [130]. The FSE findings are supported by results in a 1 -year canola field study in Canada, where wild bee abundance was highest in organic fields, followed by conventional fields and lowest in HR crops [131]. This might also impact vertebrates: If weed abundance and spectra are diminished, birds [132] and migrating adult amphibians [39] may have difficulties finding enough seeds or invertebrates for food. A prominent example of indirect effects of HR crops on biodiversity on a large scale is the monarch butterfly case. Recent US data indicate that, within the last decade and in parallel to the widespread and increased adoption of HR crops, the population size of the migratory monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) has declined significantly, due, at least in part, to the widespread loss of milkweeds (Asclepias syriaca) in the Midwest [133 – 135]. Milkweed is the main food plant of monarch larvae, and the Midwest is the main breeding ground for monarchs. In case HR maize and HR oilseed rape would be widely grown in Europe, a similar scenario has been predicted for the European butterfly <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> <b>fritillary</b> (Issoria lathonia) [136].|$|E
40|$|Grazing at low {{stocking}} rates {{has become}} a common management practice in nature restoration projects in the Netherlands. However, detailed knowledge of grazing impact is often poor, in particular for invertebrates. This study addressed the impact of extensive grazing on butterflies. Butterflies are critical indicators of habitat quality for many plant and animal species. We compared monitoring data from 1992 to 1996 for calcareous coastal dune areas in the Netherlands with different management: 11 grazed areas, 7 ungrazed areas and 4 areas managed by annual cutting. Grazing typically concerned year-round grazing by cattle and/or ponies, at low stocking rates (0. 050. 26 head ha 1 yr 1). Butterfly abundance was related to species composition {{and structure of the}} vegetation. Changes in butterfly abundance were positive in grazed and ungrazed areas compared to cut areas. Species richness was not affected by management, but individual species differed in their response. Species from open grassland benefited most from grazing, particularly Issoria lathonia (<b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>Spain</b> <b>Fritillary)</b> and Lycaena phlaeas (Small Copper). No clear negative effects of grazing were observed, but species occurrence was not always positively related to the environmental characteristics associated with grazing. In the long run, even lower stocking rates might prove more beneficial to the butterfly community as a whole. Four of the more frequently observed species, I. lathonia, Hipparchia semele (Grayling), Pyrgus malvae (Grizzled Skipper) and Aricia agestis (Brown Argus), are listed as threatened to susceptible in the Netherlands. All were apparently favored by grazing. It is concluded that extensive grazing has good potential to enhance butterfly diversity in restoration projects...|$|E
