40|$|In a Service-Oriented System (SOS), service requesters specify {{tasks that}} need to be {{executed}} and the <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> to meet, whereas service providers advertise their services’ capabilities and the <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> they can reach. Service selectors then match to the relevant tasks, the candidate services that can perform these tasks to the most desirable <b>quality</b> <b>levels.</b> One of the key problems in QoS-aware service selection lies in managing tradeoffs among QoS expectations at runtime, that is, situations in which service requesters specify <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> that cannot be simultaneously met. We propose a service selection approach that can deal with tradeoffs. The approach consists of: (i) rich QoS models to be used by service requesters when expressing QoS expectations and service providers when describing services’ QoS, and for representing preference and priority relationships between QoS dimensions; and (ii) a multi-criteria decision making technique that uses the models for service selection...|$|R

25|$|The {{goals of}} care are to {{optimise}} survival and locoregional disease control, and prevent spread to distant {{areas of the}} body (metastasis), while minimising {{short and long term}} morbidity. There is no high <b>quality</b> <b>Level</b> I evidence from prospective clinical trials in HPV+OPC, therefore treatment guidelines must rely on data from treatment of OPC in general and from some retrospective unplanned subsetting of those studies, together with data for head and neck cancer in general. Treatment for OPC has traditionally relied on radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or other systemic treatments, and surgical resection. Depending on stage and other factors treatment may include a combination of modalities. The mainstay has been radiotherapy in most cases. a pooled analysis of published studies suggested comparable disease control between radiation and surgery, but higher complication rates for surgery +/- radiation. Ideally a single modality approach is preferred, since triple modality is associated with much more toxicity, and a multidisciplinary team in a large centre with high patient volumes is recommended.|$|E
25|$|Smaragd: The ripest wines {{that must}} contain at least 12.5% APV. The maximum {{residual}} sugar level for these wines is 9 g/l. This designation {{was first used}} in 1986, right after the diethylene glycol scandal and was intended to denote the highest <b>quality</b> <b>level</b> of Wachau wines. All grapes destined for this designation must attain at least 18.5°KMW and all finished wine must be sealed with a long natural cork that is at least 49mm long and branded with vintage year, since 2007 also screwcaps are allowed. The wines have to be aged in bottle and not released till after May 1 following harvest though some producers will age their inventory longer. Smaragd wines {{tend to be the}} most sought after and critically acclaimed Wachau wines with well made examples from favorable vintages having the potential to age for more than 20 years. The symbol for this class is an emerald lizard that can found sunning itself on the stone terraces along the Danube.|$|E

25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and <b>quality</b> <b>level</b> of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family that emphasizes the value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E
