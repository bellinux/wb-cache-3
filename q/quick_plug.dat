40|$|This work {{presents}} the vapor pressure and concentration measurement of newly discovered environmentally friendly refrigerants 1, 1 -difluoroethane (R 152 a) and 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 -Pentafluorbutane (R 365 mfc), besides their mixture. The experimental procedure {{used in this}} work was a VLE recirculation type apparatus in which the liquid phase is circulating around the equilibrium cell. Â Special attention was given to enable a highly accurate vapor pressure measurement up to maximum pressure of 25 bar. The liquid sampling method was perfected {{through the use of}} <b>quick</b> <b>plug</b> valves at the circulation loop of the VLE apparatus. This approach has a great effect in solving the problems of changing the volume of the fluids inside the equilibrium cell, since the sampling unit needs a minimum amount of fluid to be sampled. Moreover a new method for measuring the concentration of this mixture through using a vibrating tube densitometer apparatus (DMA-HPM) has been realized. This apparatus was able to supply data in the temperature range of - 10 to 200 Â°C and pressure of 0 to 1400 bar, with an uncertainty of 0. 1 %. Â The experimental data was validated using the Volume Translated Peng Robinson Equation of State and high precision fundamental equations of state by McLinden from National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). Other models such as Modified Huron Vidal, Wong Sandler, Lee Kesler and Hoffman Florin have been verified. Amongst all the models, McLinden et. al model achieved vapor pressure deviations of less than 0. 073 % for R 365 mfc. The concentration deviations reached - 3. 1 %,- 9. 8 % for a composition of 33. 6 % R 152 a and 44. 1 % R 365 mfc respectively. The deviations of VTPR and VTPR-MHV 2 have led to similar results data in the pure fluids and the mixture respectively. ...|$|E

40|$|Session : Flow Assurance: Transportability StrategiesInternational audienceProduction {{of crude}} oil with natural gas and water at low {{temperature}} and high pressure favours conditions for gas hydrate formation which can cause many troubles, up to blockage of pipelines. This work deals with hydrate kinetics of crystallization and agglomeration together with slurry transport and deposition under flowing conditions. Effects of various parameters are studied including: commercial anti-agglomerant low dosage hydrate inhibitor (AA-LDHI), water volume fraction, and water salinity {{in a mixture of}} Kerdane® and water. Experiments were made in the “Archimede” 80 bar flowloop equipped with a FBRM (Focused Beam Reflectance Measurement) and a PVM (Particle Video Microscope) probe and temperature, pressure drop, flow rate and density measurements. The hydrate conversion and volume fraction are calculated from the experimental results. The flow was induced through a “gas lift” system without volumetric pump. The methane is injected {{at the bottom of the}} riser at very high flow rate, which enhanced the gas transfer from the bubbles into the liquid phase. The experimental results at high water cut systems revealed a high rate of methane hydrate formation and <b>quick</b> <b>plugging</b> by using our “gas-lift” system (bubble riser). On the contrary, at low water cut systems with the bubble riser, shorter induction time but longer flowing time after gas hydrate formation were observed thanks to salt or AA-LDHI. Some details are given on the mechanism of crystallization, agglomeration and deposition with our “gas lift” system with and without AA-LDHI...|$|R
