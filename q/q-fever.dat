The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the current follow-up strategy targeted to identify patients with chronic <b>Q-fever.</b> METHODS: A cohort of adult acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients, diagnosed between 2007 and 2009, for whom a twelve-month follow-up sample was available, was invited to complete a questionnaire and provide a blood sample, four years after the acute episode. Antibody profiles, determined by immunofluorescence assay in serum, were investigated with a special focus on high titres of IgG antibodies against phase I of Coxiella burnetii, as these are considered indicative for possible chronic <b>Q-fever.</b> RESULTS: Of the invited 1, 907 patients fulfilling inclusion criteria, 1, 289 (67. 6 %) were included in the analysis. At any time during the four-year follow-up period, 58 (4. 5 %) patients were classified as possible, probable, or proven chronic <b>Q-fever</b> according to the Dutch <b>Q-fever</b> Consensus Group criteria (which uses IgG phase I >/= 1 : 1, 024 to as serologic criterion for chronic <b>Q-fever).</b> Fifty-two (89. 7 %) of these were identified within the first year after the acute episode.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic <b>Q-fever,</b> a {{condition}} with high morbidity and mortality, may develop after an acute infection with Coxiella burnetii (acute <b>Q-fever).</b> Several strategies {{have been suggested}} for early detection of chronic <b>Q-fever,</b> focusing on follow-up of known acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients and detection of asymptomatic or unknown chronic infections. As there is no international standard or consensus, the aims {{of this study were}} to summarise the available literature and assess the evidence for different follow-up and screening strategies. DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review by searching PubMed and Embase. Twenty articles were included, of which fourteen only provided information on follow-up of known acute <b>Q-fever</b> cases, four presented data on identification of previously unknown C. burnetii infections, and two had information on both topics. RESULTS: The conversion rate of acute to chronic <b>Q-fever</b> ranged from 0 to 5. 0 %. Most studies advised serological follow-up of acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients, but without consistent advice on optimum timing and duration. The recommendation to use echocardiography for all acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients to detect valvular damage remains controversial. Screening of high-risk patients in an outbreak setting is advised by studies investigating such strategy. CONCLUSIONS: There is sufficient evidence to support serological follow-up of all known acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients at least once during the first year following the acute infection, and more frequently in patients with known risk factors for chronic disease, such as heart valve- or vascular prosthesis.

40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{long-term}} work participation of <b>Q-fever</b> patients and patients with Legionnaires' disease, and to identify which factors are associated with a reduced work participation in <b>Q-fever</b> patients. METHODS: <b>Q-fever</b> patients participated at four time points until 12 months after onset of illness, patients with Legionnaires' disease only at 12 months. Data were self-reported using questionnaires on the amount of hours that patients worked, and on socio-demographic, medical, psychosocial and lifestyle aspects. RESULTS: Our study included 336 <b>Q-fever</b> patients and 190 patients with Legionnaires' disease. There was a decrease in the proportion of <b>Q-fever</b> patients with reduced work participation over time, from 45 % at 3 months to 19 % at 12 months (versus 15 % of patients with Legionnaires' disease at 12 months).

40|$|Abstract Background Between 2007 and 2011, the Netherlands {{experienced}} the largest documented <b>Q-fever</b> outbreak to {{date with a}} total of 4108 notified acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients. Previous studies have indicated that <b>Q-fever</b> patients may suffer from long-lasting health effects, such as fatigue and reduced quality of life. Our study aims to determine the long-term health impact of <b>Q-fever.</b> It will also compare the health status of <b>Q-fever</b> patients with three reference groups: 1) healthy controls, 2) patients with Legionnaires’ disease and 3) persons with a <b>Q-fever</b> infection but a-specific symptoms. Methods/design Two groups of <b>Q-fever</b> patients were included in a prospective cohort study. In the first group the onset of illness was in 2007 – 2008 and participation was at 12 and 48 months. In the second group the onset of illness was in 2010 – 2011 and participation was at 6 time intervals, from 3 to 24 months. The reference groups were included at only one time interval. The subjective health status, fatigue status and quality of life of patients will be assessed using two validated quality of life questionnaires.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Whether {{immunological}} mechanisms underlie <b>Q-fever</b> {{fatigue syndrome}} (QFS) remains unclear. For acute <b>Q-fever,</b> the antigen-specific interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) response {{may be a}} useful tool for diagnosis, and the IFNgamma/interleukin(IL) - 2 production ratio may be a marker for chronic <b>Q-fever</b> and treatment monitoring. Here we explored the specific IFNgamma production and IFNgamma/IL- 2 ratio in QFS patients. METHODS: IFNgamma and IL- 2 production were tested in ex-vivo stimulated whole blood of QFS patients (n = 20), and compared to those previously determined in seropositive controls (n = 135), and chronic <b>Q-fever</b> patients (n = 28). Also, the correlation between patient characteristics and IFNgamma, IL- 2, and IFNgamma/IL- 2 ratio was determined. RESULTS: QFS patients were younger (p < 0. 001), but gender distribution was similar to seropositive controls and chronic <b>Q-fever</b> patients. Coxiella burnetii Nine Mile stimulation revealed a higher IFNgamma production in QFS (median 319. 5 pg/ml) than in seropositive controls (120 pg/ml, p < 0. 01), but comparable to chronic <b>Q-fever</b> (2846 pg/ml). The IFNgamma/IL- 2 ratio was similar to that in seropositive controls, but lower than in chronic <b>Q-fever</b> patients (p < 0. 01). Symptom duration was positively correlated with IL- 2 production, and negatively correlated with the IFNgamma/IL- 2 ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These results point to an altered cell-mediated immunity in QFS, and suggest a different immune response than in chronic <b>Q-fever...</b>|$|E

Prevalence in sheep and goat was 14. 06 %, from 2. 098 examined samples antibodies against <b>Q-fever</b> were detected in 295. Prevalence at epizootiological sites was from 0. 0 to 39. 16 % at cattle, and 0. 0 to 32. 26 % at sheep and goats. Based on this data, epizootiological map of <b>Q-fever</b> spread at cattle and sheep and goats was established. Indirect immunoenzymatic method (i_ELISA) showed highest sensitivity (compared to CFT 92. 1 %) and specificity (compared to CFT 95. 8 %) for diagnostics of <b>Q-fever</b> in our conditions.

The aim of this study was to qualify and quantify the health status of <b>Q-fever</b> patients after long-term follow-up. Methods 870 <b>Q-fever</b> patients of the 2007 and 2008 outbreaks were mailed a questionnaire 12 to 26 months after the onset of illness. We assessed demographic data and measured health status with the Nijmegen Clinical Screening Instrument (NCSI). The NCSI consists of three main domains of functional impairment, symptoms and QoL that are divided into eight sub-domains. The NCSI scores of <b>Q-fever</b> patients older than 50 years (N = 277) were compared with patients younger than 50 years (N = 238) and with norm data from healthy individuals (N = 65) and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (N = 128). Results The response rate was 65. 7 %. After applying exclusion criteria 515 <b>Q-fever</b> patients were included in this study. The long-term health status of two thirds of <b>Q-fever</b> patients (both younger and older than 50 years) was severely affected for at least one sub-domain. Patients scores were most severely affected on the sub-domains general QoL (44. 9 %) and fatigue (43. 5 %). Hospitalisation in the acute phase was significantly related to long-term behavioural impairment (OR 2. 8, CI 1. 5 - 5. 1), poor health related QoL (OR 2. 3,CI 1. 5 - 4. 0) and subjective symptoms (OR 1. 9, CI 1. 1 - 3. 6).

40|$|Abstract Background A <b>Q-fever</b> {{outbreak}} {{occurred in}} an urban area {{in the south of}} the Netherlands in May 2008. The distribution and timing of cases suggested a common source. We studied the spatial relationship between the residence locations of human cases and nearby small ruminant farms, of which one dairy goat farm had experienced abortions due to <b>Q-fever</b> since mid April 2008. A generic geographic information system (GIS) was used to develop a method for source detection in the still evolving major epidemic of <b>Q-fever</b> in the Netherlands. Methods All notified <b>Q-fever</b> cases in the area were interviewed. Postal codes of cases and of small ruminant farms (size > 40 animals) located within 5 kilometres of the cluster area were geo-referenced as point locations in a GIS-model. For each farm, attack rates and relative risks were calculated for 5 concentric zones adding 1 kilometre at a time, using the 5 - 10 kilometres zone as reference. These data were linked to the results of veterinary investigations. Results Persons living within 2 kilometres of an affected dairy goat farm (> 400 animals) had a much higher risk for <b>Q-fever</b> than those living more than 5 kilometres away (Relative risk 31. 1 [95 % CI 16. 4 - 59. 1]).

Methods: <b>Q-fever</b> patients and patients with Legionnaires' disease fulfilling the Dutch notification criteria filled out a questionnaire at one year after onset of illness. The proportion of patients with an abnormal score was calculated for 12 health status subdomains and mean scores for the most relevant subdomains were compared between the patient groups. Results: We included 309 <b>Q-fever</b> patients and 190 patients with Legionnaires' disease in the study.

40|$|Rodents {{are known}} to cause massive food losses, but are also implicated as {{reservoirs}} {{for a wide variety}} of zoonotic pathogens. This review discusses the contribution of rodents in the spread and transmission of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of <b>Q-fever.</b> We found that rodents have been implicated as reservoirs for <b>Q-fever,</b> but their role in pathogen maintenance, geographic spread and transmission still remains to be clarified. As there are indications for a role of rodents in <b>Q-fever</b> epidemiology, including during the 2007 – 10 outbreak in the Netherlands, the overall lack of knowledge on the role of rodents warrants studies into their contribution in transmission of C. burnetii from the sylvatic cycle to the domestic cycle, in within-herd transmission, in transmission to surrounding farms and in direct transmission to humans. Although the basic sylvatic and domestic cycles of C. burnetii infection can operate independently, they will overlap in many instances as many areas in the world are occupied by both domestic and wild animals. This area of <b>Q-fever</b> ecology is of interest and research should focus on this aspect of <b>Q-fever</b> epidemiology and, in particular, on the role of rodents therein. More studies are needed that elicit the exact role of rodents in epidemiology of C. burnetii to further optimise disease control...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In The Netherlands, 1168 <b>Q-fever</b> {{patients}} were notified in 2007 and 2008. Patients and general practitioners (GPs) regularly reported persisting symptoms after acute <b>Q-fever,</b> especially fatigue and {{long periods of}} sick leave, to the public health authorities. International studies on smaller <b>Q-fever</b> outbreaks demonstrate that symptoms may persist years after acute illness. Data for the Dutch outbreaks were unavailable. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify sick leave after acute <b>Q-fever</b> and long-term symptoms. METHODS: Our study targeted 898 acute <b>Q-fever</b> patients, notified in 2007 and 2008 residing in the Province Noord-Brabant. Patients from the 2008 cohort were mailed a questionnaire at 12 months and those of the 2007 cohort at 12 - 26 months after onset of illness. Patients reported underlying illness, Q-fever-related symptoms and sick leave. RESULTS: The response rate was 64 %. Forty percent of the working patients reported long-term (> 1 month) sick leave. Pre-existent heart disease odds ratio (OR) 4. 50; confidence interval (CI) 1. 27 - 16. 09), hospitalization in the acute phase (OR 3. 99; 95 % CI 2. 15 - 7. 43) and smoking (OR 1. 69; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 84) were significant predictors for long-term absence. Of the patients who resumed work, 9 % were-at the time of completing the questionnaire-still unable to function at pre-infection levels due to fatigue or concentration problems. Of the respondents, 40 % reported persisting physical symptoms at the time of follow-up. Fatigue (20 %) was most frequently reported. Daily activities were affected in 30 % of cases. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Q-fever</b> poses a serious persisting long-term burden on patients and society...|$|E
40|$|The post-Q-fever fatigue {{syndrome}} (QFS) (inappropriate fatigue, myalgia and arthralgia, night sweats, changes in mood and sleep patterns) follows about 20 % of laboratory-proven, acute primary <b>Q-fever</b> cases. Cytokine dysregulation resulting from chronic immune stimulation and modulation by persistence of Coxiella burnetii cells or their antigens is hypothesized. We studied cytokine release patterns of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) stimulated with various ligands in short-term culture, from 18 patients with active QFS, and 27 controls: six with resolving QFS, five {{who had had}} acute primary <b>Q-fever</b> without subsequent QFS, eight healthy <b>Q-fever</b> vaccinees and eight healthy subjects without <b>Q-fever</b> antibody. Conditioned media (CM) from PBMC stimulated in short-term culture with <b>Q-fever</b> antigens, PHA or measles antigen (as an unrelated antigen) were assayed for IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 5, IL- 6, IL- 10 and IFN gamma by AgEIA, and for IL- 1 and TNF alpha/beta by bioassay. Aberrant cytokine release patterns were observed with PBMC from QFS patients when stimulated with <b>Q-fever</b> antigens: an accentuated release of IL- 6 which was significantly [p = 0. 01, non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) ] in excess of medians for all four control groups. With IL- 2, the number of responders in the active QFS group was decreased relative to control groups (Fisher's exact test, p = 0. 01) whereas the number of IFN gamma responders was increased (Fisher's exact test, p = 0. 0008). Significant correlations were observed between concentrations of IL- 6 in CM, total symptom scores, and scores for other key symptoms. I. A. Penttila, R. J. Harris, P. Storm, D. Haynes, D. A.

40|$|<b>Q-fever</b> is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. In 2007, a large human outbreak occurred in the Netherlands. A goat farm {{in the same area}} with abortion due to <b>Q-fever</b> was seen as a possible source of this outbreak. In this study, bulk milk samples from dairy goat farms in the Netherlands were collected and tested, using a PCR and an ELISA, to estimate the prevalence of <b>Q-fever.</b> Furthermore, on four goat farms with a Q fever history and eight farms without a Q fever history, 100 animals per farm were serologically tested (ELISA) and vaginal swabs (PCR) were taken. On each farm, bulk milk samples (PCR and ELISA) were taken also. Of the 302 bulk milk samples 94 (31. 1 %) were PCR-positive and 85 (28. 1 %) ELISA-positive. 75 (24. 8 %) samples were PCR- and ELISA-positive. Of the 302 samples 198 (65. 6 %) were negative for both the tests. 104 (34. 4 %) were positive for one or both tests. The seroprevalence on the farms with <b>Q-fever</b> history ranged from 5 - 30 % and on the farms without <b>Q-fever</b> history from 0 - 64 %. The shedding into the vaginal mucus ranged from 8 - 39 % for the farm with Q- fever history and from 0 - 46 % for the farms without <b>Q-fever</b> history. The PCR of the milk was positive on 7 farms and negative on 5 farms. The ELISA of the milk was positive on 6 farms and negative on 6 farms. If the bulk milk was ELISA- and/or PCR-positive there were also animals on the farm that were seropositive and/or that shed the bacterium in the vaginal mucus. With the data from this research better research for the risk factors and the prevention methods is possible...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: During {{the largest}} <b>Q-fever</b> {{outbreak}} ever reported, a cohort study {{was established to}} assess the health status of <b>Q-fever</b> patients over a 24 -month period and to identify factors associated with health status. Methods: Laboratory-confirmed <b>Q-fever</b> patients participated at six time points after onset of illness. Scores on twelve subdomains from two health status instruments were calculated for each time point to determine progression and compare to reference groups. Results: The study included 336 <b>Q-fever</b> patients. There is a significant linear improvement over time in nine of the twelve health status subdomains. For example, the proportion of patients with severe fatigue improved from 73. 0 % at three months to 60. 0 % at twelve months and 37. 0 % at twenty-four months, but this was still high compared to a healthy reference group (2. 5 %). For the three most severely affected subdomains -‘Fatigue’, ‘General Quality of Life’ and ‘Role Physical’- the baseline characteristics significantly associated with a long-term reduced health status were being female, being a young adult and having pre-existing health problems. Conclusions: Despite a significant linear improvement over time in nine of the twelve health status subdomains, more than {{one out of three}} patients still suffered from a reduced health status at 24 months.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Q fever is a {{zoonotic}} infection that may cause severe hepatitis. <b>Q-fever</b> hepatitis {{has not yet}} been associated with autoimmune hepatitis and/or primary biliary cirrhosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a 39 -year-old man of Sri Lankan origin with chronic <b>Q-fever</b> hepatitis who developed autoantibodies compatible with autoimmune hepatitis/primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic acid in addition to antibiotic therapy markedly improved hepatic enzyme levels suggesting that autoimmunity, potentially triggered by the underlying infection, was involved in the pathogenesis of liver damage. CONCLUSION: We suggest that Coxiella burnetii might trigger autoimmune liver disease. Patients with <b>Q-fever</b> hepatitis who respond poorly to antibiotics should be investigated for serological evidence of autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or overlap syndrome, as these patients could benefit from adjunctive therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid. Conversely, C. burnetii serology might be necessary in patients with autoimmune liver disease in order to exclude underlying Coxiella infection...|$|E
40|$|<b>Q-fever</b> is a {{zoonotic}} disease caused by Coxiella burnetii that can create an acute or chronic {{form of the}} illness. In March 2014, <b>Q-fever</b> was identified by serology and Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), in a 62 year-old male that was a Nepalese refugee. The male visited a livestock farm with a slaughterhouse in rural Central New York State, twenty-two days prior to onset of symptoms. He had direct handling of goats on this farm prior to slaughter. We describe the case presentation of his illness and the public health epidemiological investigation...|$|E
