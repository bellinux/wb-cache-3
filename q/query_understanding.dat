We envision a new environment where active GPSs are ubiquitously attached to every object in the environment. We term this environment the Ubiquitous Global Positioning Environment (UGPE, for short). Users in an UGPE environment will be able to subscribe to a variety of services. Services range from assisting the navigation of objects by continuously informing users of the surrounding obstacles/objects, to users forming groups of objects that are queried on a continuous basis. This vision paper highlights challenges and opportunities for database and information management research arising from this new environment.

5000|$|Search engines {{provide an}} {{interface}} {{to a group}} of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a search query. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain. There are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites. Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space, other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of natural language. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion. <b>Query</b> <b>understanding</b> methods can be used to standardize query language.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Information {{retrieval}} techniques treat questions democratically: all questions, {{regardless of}} their grammar or orientation, are processed by the same rules and manipulated in similar ways. In about 12 % of the questions in our data users ask about a process. Treating a request for how to do something as a request for information about a topic disregards an important subtlety in the question. We use the knowledge that a question asks about a process, rather than a fact, to develop categories of information need implied by the questions to aid in retrieval. We focus on questions because by their nature questions carry more information. A well-known technique for improving retrieval is query expansion. A variety of query expansion and disambiguation techniques have been studied [1] [2] [3] [5], and although none distinguish between fact-orientation and taskorientation, several do distinguish categories of information need not explicit in the <b>queries.</b> <b>Understanding</b> that th...|$|R
40|$|Search engines receive queries with a {{broad range}} of {{different}} search intents. However, they do not perform equally well for all <b>queries.</b> <b>Understanding</b> where search engines perform poorly is critical for improving their performance. In this paper, we present a method for automatically identifying poorly-performing query groups where a search engine may not meet searcher needs. This allows us to create coherent query clusters that help system designers generate actionable insights about necessary changes and helps learning-to-rank algorithms better learn relevance signals via specialized rankers. The result is a framework capable of estimating dissatisfaction from Web search logs and learning to improve performance for dissatisfied queries. Through experimentation, we show that our method yields good quality groups that align with established retrieval performance metrics. We also show that we can significantly improve retrieval effectiveness via specialized rankers, and that coherent grouping of underperforming queries generated by our method is important in improving each group...|$|R

40|$|<b>Query</b> <b>understanding</b> {{has been}} well studied {{in the areas of}} {{information}} retrieval and spoken language understanding (SLU). There are generally three layers of query understanding: domain classification, user intent detection, and semantic tagging. Classifiers can be applied to domain and intent detection in real systems, and semantic tagging (or slot filling) is commonly defined as a sequence-labeling task [...] mapping a sequence of words to a sequence of labels. Various statistical features (e. g., n-grams) can be extracted from annotated queries for learning label prediction models; however, linguistic characteristics of queries, such as hierarchical structures and semantic relationships, are usually neglected in the feature extraction process. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages linguistic knowledge encoded in hierarchical parse trees for <b>query</b> <b>understanding.</b> Specifically, for natural language queries, we extract a set of syntactic structural features and semantic dependency features from query parse trees to enhance inference model learning. Experiments on real natural language queries show that augmenting sequence labeling models with linguistic knowledge can improve <b>query</b> <b>understanding</b> performance in various domains.

40|$|Web {{search queries}} without {{hyperlink}} clicks are often re-ferred to as abandoned <b>queries.</b> <b>Understanding</b> {{the reasons for}} abandonment is crucial for search engines in evaluat-ing their performance. Abandonment can be categorized as good or bad depending on whether user information need-s are satisfied by result page content. Previous research has sought to understand abandonment rationales via us-er surveys, or has developed models to predict those ra-tionales using behavioral patterns. However, these models ignore important contextual {{factors such as the}} relationship between the abandoned query and prior abandonment in-stances. We propose more advanced methods for model-ing and predicting abandonment rationales using contextu-al information from user search sessions by analyzing search engine logs, and discover dependencies between abandoned queries and user behaviors. We leverage these dependen-cy signals to build a sequential classifier using a structured learning framework designed to handle such signals. Our ex-perimental results show that our approach is 22 % more ac-curate than the state-of-the-art abandonment-rationale clas-sifier. Going beyond prediction, we leverage the prediction results to significantly improve relevance using instances of predicted good and bad abandonment...|$|R
40|$|Todays web {{search engines}} try to offer {{services}} for finding various information {{in addition to}} simple web pages, like showing locations or answering simple fact <b>queries.</b> <b>Understanding</b> the association of named entities and documents {{is one of the}} key steps towards such semantic search tasks. This paper addresses the ranking of entities and models it in a graph-based relevance propagation framework. In particular we study the problem of expert finding as an example of an entity ranking task. Entity containment graphs are introduced that represent the relationship between text fragments on the one hand and their contained entities on the other hand. The paper shows how these graphs can be used to propagate relevance information from the pre-ranked text fragments to their entities. We use this propagation framework to model existing approaches to expert finding based on the entity’s indegree and extend them by recursive relevance propagation based on a probabilistic random walk over the entity containment graphs. Experiments on the TREC expert search task compare the retrieval performance of the different graph and propagation models. 1...|$|R

Artwork is interspersed among essays that approach speculation and progressive change from surprising perspectives. A radical cartographer asks whether "the speculative" can be represented on a map. An ethnographer investigates religious possession in Islam to contemplate states between the divine and the seemingly human. A financial technologist <b>queries</b> <b>understandings</b> of speculation in financial markets. A multimedia artist and activist considers the relation between social change and assumptions about the conditions to be changed, and an architect posits purposeful neglect as political strategy. The book includes an extensive glossary with more than twenty short entries in which scholars contemplate such speculation-related notions as insurance, hallucination, prophecy, the paradox of beginnings, and states of half-knowledge. The book's artful, nonlinear design mirrors and reinforces the notion of contingency that animates it.
