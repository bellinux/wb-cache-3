25|$|The primary <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mission {{addresses}} is {{the role}} of size and water in determining the evolution of the planets. Ceres and Vesta are highly suitable bodies with which to address this question, as they are two of the most massive of the protoplanets. Ceres is geologically very primitive and icy, while Vesta is evolved and rocky. Their contrasting characteristics are thought to have resulted from them forming in two different regions of the early Solar System.|$|E

Sisson returned to the US in May and became head of the CPI's Foreign Section in July 1918. His report describing the documents reached Wilson on May 9, 1918, and the administration released them to the American press on September 15. Most of the press reported without <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German General Staff had hired Lenin and Trotsky and disredited the Russian revolutionaries.|$|E

25|$|As {{the inquiry}} unfolded, home videos of {{initiation}} rites in the CAR's French-speaking commando {{found their way}} into the media. The new Minister of National Defence David Collenette argued that the videos were disgusting, demeaning and racist. With the continued accumulation of such politically damaging visibility, the Minister of National Defence advised Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to disband the Canadian Airborne Regiment in 1995. It has been suggested that this move was as much driven by budget cuts to the Canadian Forces as by the Somalia Affair, but there is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> affair gave the minister the public support needed to make his request for disbandment.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile buyers who specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E

500|$|Another {{aspect of}} the game that has {{attracted}} criticism is the reuse of graphical designs from Final Fantasy X.

500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity {{greater than the sum}} of its parts." [...] He has been described as [...] "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".|$|E

Her last sentences responded to White's, saying that there was no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jury had been properly instructed on entrapment law and thus, their decision that Jacobson could not claim entrapment should be allowed to stand.|$|E

500|$|Carr's {{essay was}} widely {{discussed}} in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer Bill Thompson observed that Carr's argument had [...] "succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate", Damon Darlin of The New York Times quipped that even though [...] " [...] {{has been talking about}} [...] article in The Atlantic magazine", only [...] "ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr." [...] The controversial online responses to Carr's essay were, according to Chicago Tribune critic Steve Johnson, partly the outcome of the essay's title [...] "Is Google Making Us Stupid?", a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> article proper doesn't actually pose and that he believed was [...] "perfect fodder for a 'don't-be-ridiculous' blog post"; Johnson challenged his readers to carefully consider their online responses in the interest of raising the quality of debate.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{historians have}} been {{divided on the}} issue. T. F. Tout, writing in 1914, {{rejected}} the idea. J. S. Hamilton, who wrote a biography of Gaveston in 1988, {{on the other hand}} says that [...] "there is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king and his favourite were lovers". Pierre Chaplais, writing a few years later, had more reservations. Chaplais cites the fact that Edward had four children with his wife – and even an extra-marital son – as well as the relative silence of contemporary commentators on the topic. He also finds {{it hard to believe that}} Philip IV of France would have allowed the English king to marry his daughter Isabella if Edward was known to be homosexual. Mark Ormrod has pointed out the inherent anachronism of speaking of homosexuality in a medieval context. Instead Ormrod suggests the focus should be on the motivation behind the use of sexuality in contemporary attacks on the King and Gaveston.|$|E

In the album review by Rolling Stone, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan [...] "added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel's songs" [...] and concluded that [...] "A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that's the point." [...] AllMusic's review expressed that [...] "there's little <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> addicting combination of Keenan's aching voice and Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000's best splashes in whatever was left of 'modern rock'." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{controversial}} {{element of}} the CCE's plans was {{the extension of the}} railway to Golders Green. The route of the tube tunnels took the line under Hampstead Heath and strong opposition was raised, concerned about the effect that the tunnels would have on the ecology of the Heath. The Hampstead Heath Protection Society claimed that the tunnels would drain the sub-soil of water and the vibration of passing trains would damage trees. Taking its lead from the Society's objections, The Times published an alarmist article on 25 December 1900 claiming that [...] "a great tube laid under the heath will, of course, act as a drain; and it is quite likely that the grass and gorse and trees on the Heath will suffer from the loss of moisture... Moreover, it seems to be established beyond <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trains passing along these deep-laid tubes shake the earth to its surface, and the constant jar and quiver will probably have a serious effect upon the trees by loosening their roots." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites, Anonymous also organized a campaign {{on one of}} their websites to [...] "begin bumping Digg", referring to an attempt to drive up Scientology-related links on the website Digg.com. On January 25, 2008, eight of the top ten stories on Digg.com were about either Scientology-related controversies or Anonymous and attempts to expose Scientology. Digg CEO Jay Adelson told PC World that Anonymous had not manipulated the site's algorithm system to prevent artificial poll results, stating: [...] "They must have {{done a very good job}} of bringing in a diverse set of interests ... It just happened to hit a nerve that the Digg community was interested in." [...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre in the aftermath of the incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005. Adelson commented on the popularity of Scientology theme within the Digg community: [...] "In the history of Digg, there's no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community ...
