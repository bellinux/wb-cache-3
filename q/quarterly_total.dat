40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{estimated}} the treatment effects of biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs) on the <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> health-care expenditure, while controlling non-random assignment to treatment (endogeneity) and allowing heterogeneity in treatment effects. The structural parameters, heterogeneous (ATE), and homogeneous (ATE 1) average treatment effects {{were defined as}} the impact of treatment on <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> health-care expenditure, if patients are randomly assigned to biologic DMARDs.; A retrospective cohort was selected from California Medicaid paid claims between 01 / 01 / 1999 and 12 / 31 / 2005. Non-overlapping quarters were created from pharmacy claims for biologic (adalimumab and etanercept) and standard (leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine) DMARDs. Final sample included 23, 297 observations on 5, 239 individual patients.; A fixed-effects panel data correlated random coefficients (CRC) model allowed for heterogeneity in treatment effects. Endogeneity was controlled by adding a generalized residual function constructed based on Lee’s (1983) approach. Selection choice model was varied from the multinomial, nested, and mixed logit.; Controlling endogeneity significantly increased ATE 1 for both biologic DMARDs, as compared to naïve fixed-effects (baseline standard DMARD). Nested-logit based ATE 1 was higher {{as compared to the}} multinomial-logit ATE 1. Allowing for unobserved heterogeneity resulted in the ATE of adalimumab to decrease under the multinomial-logit corrected model, while an increase was observed in the nested-logit corrected model. In case of ATE for etanercept, an increase was observed under both the above mentioned models as compared to ATE 1.; The results point out the need to control for time-varying endogeneity in panel data models. When treatment effects are heterogeneous and especially when treatment selection is a discrete choice set, the specification of latent index model matters. Sorting on gains is an important source of bias in medical outcomes and in this study, it manifested in terms of large differences in the magnitude of ATE 1 and ATE parameters, which questions homogeneity assumption.; The methodological issues addressed in this study impact our understanding of the cost effects of drug treatment. Models need to be realistic to mimic real life clinical decisions to inform important drug coverage decisions.

Scientific forecasting of water consumption is an important approach for the rational allocation of water resources. Taking the hospitals in Wuhan City as an example and basing the analysis on the characteristics of actual water consumption, we proposed a modified grey GM (0, 1 ∣sin) model of oscillation sequence. Using the grey theory, the variable weight-strengthening buffer operator (VWSBO) was introduced into this model to weaken the interference of the disturbance term on the data sequence. The actual <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> water consumption data for hospitals in Wuhan City during the period from 2010 to 2012 were used to verify the effectiveness and practicality of this modified grey GM (0, 1 ∣sin) model in predicting water consumption.

In the late 1980 s populations of Spectacled Flying-foxes (SFF) (Pteropus conspicillatus), a species confined, in Australia, to north Queensland became infected by paralysis tick (Ixodes holocyclus), resulting in mortality. This Pteropus-tick relationship {{was new to}} Australia. Curiously, the relationship was confined to several camps on the Atherton Tableland, north Queensland. It was hypothesised that an introduced plant, wild tobacco (Solanum mauritianum), had facilitated this new host-tick interaction. This study quantifies the impact of tick paralysis on SFF and investigates the relationship with climate. Retrospective analysis was carried out on records from the Tolga Bat Hospital for 1998 – 2010. Juvenile mortality rates were correlated to climate data using vector auto-regression. Mortality rates due to tick paralysis ranged between 11. 6 per 10, 000 bats in 2003 and 102. 5 in 2009; more female than male adult bats were affected.

This paper aims to assess the association of the HEP with improved utilization of maternal health services in Northern Ethiopia using institution-based retrospective data. METHODS: Average <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> attendances for antenatal care (ANC), delivery care (DC) and post-natal care (PNC) at health posts and health care centres were studied from 2002 to 2012. Regression analysis was applied to two models to assess whether trends were statistically significant. One model was used to estimate the level and trend changes associated with the immediate period of intervention, while changes related to the post-intervention period were estimated by the other. RESULTS: The total number of consultations for ANC, DC and PNC increased constantly, particularly after the late-intervention period. Increases were higher for ANC and PNC at health post level and for DC at health centres. A positive statistically significant upward trend was found for DC and PNC in all facilities (p< 0. 01). The positive trend was also present in ANC at health centres (p = 0. 04), but not at health posts.

40|$|Alternative market assets, i. e. {{those which}} {{are not part of}} the ''traditional'' {{financial}} assets, have become increasingly popular globally during the last decade. The purpose of this study is to examine the potential benefits of including real investment assets, specifically timberland and real estate holdings, for a investor investing to either domestic or international markets. Specifically the questions to be asked are: Do Finnish real investment assets offer diversification benefits in respect of increased risk-adjusted returns? What are the optimal asset allocations? The analyzed time-series for alternative investments represent <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> returns of average Finnish timberland and nonsubsidized housing assets during the period of 1987 /Q 1 - 2014 /Q 4. The problem will be approached by the means of portfolio diversification theory utilizing both static and dynamic backtesting optimization frameworks to determine the VaR- and CVaR-efficient allocations. The results indicate, that the benefits of allocating wealth into real investment assets may differ markedly. While for all-domestic portfolio the efficient frontier does not markedly shift, for internationally diversified portfolio efficient frontiers are greatly enhanced in terms of risk-return characteristics, when real estate and timber assets are included. Dynamic optimization routine reveals that the optimal allocations are clearly time-dependent and especially the weight of timber tends to be negatively affected by financial and economic crisis periods. However, the implied risk-reduction contributions indicate that both timber and real estate assets are able to lower the overall riskiness of investment portfolio also throughout these crisis periods. The optimal weight of real estate is rather persistent, often being over 50 % in both portfolios, apart from the early 1990 s. Therefore, it can be concluded that the studied real investment assets have great potential to enhance the risk-return characteristics of risky portfolios...|$|E

40|$|The way {{passenger}} traffic is distributed at multiple airport systems continues to intrigue air transportation planners, urban planners, and policy-makers as researchers attempt to unravel how airlines, air travelers and airports {{relate to each}} other. While previous research efforts have typically concentrated on the air travelers' choice of airports, the current thesis addresses how the competitive behavior of airlines operating in a deregulated environment influences the air traveler's choice of airports and the resulting distribution of {{passenger traffic}} in the multiple airport system. The methodology of the research first involves identifying four scenarios under which airlines compete in multiple airport environments, after which an anecdotal analysis of a select number of city-pair markets for each scenario was performed to solicit supporting evidence of competitive behavior of airlines. To keep the preliminary investigation simple, the author has chosen to study the dual-airport systems at Chicago and Houston. Owing to limitations of the data from O&DPlus and ONBOARD, the author used a strict set of criteria to identify 14 city-pair markets to analyze the response of passengers and airlines to challengers entering the city-pair markets between 1984 and 1993. The six quantitative indicators used in the anecdotal analyses include: average fares, average number of nonstop departures per day each way, quarterly origindestination traffic, quarterly non-origin-destination traffic, average quarterly load factors, and the <b>quarterly</b> <b>total</b> airport-to-airport origin-destination traffic. The results of the research indicate that while competition is evident, a general trend of competitive behavior of the airlines in the multiple airport environment is not discernible. The entry of a challenger typically elicits a variety of responses. Significant stimulation of the origin-destination traffic was observed in cases where low-fare carriers entered the market. The fact {{that the number of}} non-origin-destination passengers usually exceeds the number of origin-destination passengers may indicate that justification for the service in the airport-pairs examined goes beyond simply satisfying the demand for travel in the origin-destination market. Although quantitative modeling techniques were not used in this study, the author believes that future researchers should contend with the complex, multi-dimensional nature of airline competition before attempting to accurately model the competitive behavior of airlines at multiple airport systems.

40|$|Abstract. An {{implication}} of two-country international real business cycle mod-els is that {{total factor productivity}} should be an exogenous stochastic process. Economic theories which feature labor hoarding, variable capacity utilization, and increasing returns predict that measured productivity shifts are not exoge-nous; instead, expansionary aggregate demand shocks should {{lead to an increase}} in measured productivity. For each of the G- 7 countries, this paper measures <b>quarterly</b> aggregate <b>total</b> factor productivity for the domestic country and its rest-of-world (G- 6) counterpart. In each case the domestic productivity measures are not strictly exogenous: expansionary U. S. monetary policy shocks, as well as other G- 6 monetary policy shocks, lead to productivity expansions. The evi-dence indicates that international business cycle models are misspecified unless they feature endogenous productivity mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Shortages {{of health}} workers are {{obstacles}} to utilising global health initiative (GHI) funds effectively in Africa. This paper reports and analyses two countries' health workforce responses {{during a period}} of large increases in GHI funds. Methods Health facility record reviews were conducted in 52 facilities in Malawi and 39 facilities in Zambia in 2006 / 07 and 2008; <b>quarterly</b> <b>totals</b> from the last quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2008 inclusive in Malawi; and annual totals for 2004 to 2007 inclusive in Zambia. Topic-guided interviews were conducted with facility and district managers in both countries, and with health workers in Malawi. Results Facility data confirm significant scale-up in HIV/AIDS service delivery in both countries. In Malawi, this was supported by a large increase in lower trained cadres and only a modest increase in clinical staff numbers. Routine outpatient workload fell in urban facilities, in rural health centres and in facilities not providing antiretroviral treatment (ART), while it increased at district hospitals and in facilities providing ART. In Zambia, total staff and clinical staff numbers stagnated between 2004 and 2007. In rural areas, outpatient workload, which was higher than at urban facilities, increased further. Key informants described the effects of increased workloads in both countries and attributed staff migration from public health facilities to non-government facilities in Zambia to PEPFAR. Conclusions Malawi, which received large levels of GHI funding from only the Global Fund, managed to increase facility staff across all levels of the health system: urban, district and rural health facilities, supported by task-shifting to lower trained staff. The more complex GHI arena in Zambia, where both Global Fund and PEPFAR provided large levels of support, may have undermined a coordinated national workforce response to addressing health worker shortages, leading to a less effective response in rural areas. </p...|$|R
