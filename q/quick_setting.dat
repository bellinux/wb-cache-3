50|$|With the {{introduction}} of Portland cement during the 19th century, the use of lime mortar in new constructions gradually declined. This was {{largely due to the}} ease of use of Portland cement, its <b>quick</b> <b>setting,</b> and high compressive strength. However, the soft and porous properties of lime mortar provide certain advantages when working with softer building materials such as natural stone and terracotta. For this reason, while Portland cement continues to be commonly used in new constructions of brick and concrete construction, in the repair and restoration of brick and stone-built structures originally built using lime mortar, the use of Portland cement is not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|Alker is {{characterized}} by its <b>quick</b> <b>setting</b> time (approximately 20 minutes), hence preventing clay shrinkage and {{eliminating the need for}} curing and drying processes. If needed, a retarding agent may also be added to the mixture. It is a porous material with a lower volumetric weight, and nearly four times more pressure resistance compared to traditional earthen wall materials. Structurally, Alker is comparable to concrete as a conglemerate material. It must be noted however that while properties of concrete improve in direct ratio to the amount of cement it contains, increased amounts of clay (the binding element) in the Alker mixture have negative effects on its physical properties, particularly in terms of pressure and erosion resistance.|$|E

50|$|The {{calcined}} gypsum sets quickly. When calcined gypsum {{is added}} to soil, the setting time is reduced even further, to mere minutes. Often this <b>quick</b> <b>setting</b> is too fast and a retardant must {{be added to the}} mix so it can be poured. In Alker, lime {{is added to}} extend working time to 20 minutes. Cast Earth uses another retardant for an even greater working time. This ingredient is proprietary and a carefully guarded secret. When the material is dry, it is similar to adobe in various ways, outperforming it in tensile strength, hardness, and erosion resistance. It also has less tendency to crack and shrink. Some Cast Earth walls do soak up water, however, depending upon the porosity of the earthen materials used. For example decomposed granite tends to be prone to absorption if the eaves of the roof is inadequate or it is exposed to water for a prolonged time. ie; days. Limestone materials however, tend to repel water once the walls are completely dried/cured.|$|E
50|$|Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat {{building}} due {{to their}} superior holding power and ease of use. In its thickened state it {{is used as a}} strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap wooden tongue depressors is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for shaping coved joints with epoxy. Silicon bronze ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a <b>quick</b> <b>setting</b> (20mts), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the bridge}} was constructed, the railway {{authorities}} carried out settlement studies of all 28 piers {{in view of the}} foundation conditions on which they were founded. These measurements indicated that pier settlement in only one pier, namely [...] "pier 27" [...] in the Kovvur Channel was of the order of 211 mm, which needed corrective action, while in all other piers the settlement was less than 75 mm indicating that pier foundations had settled down. Since the rotation in the vertical plane exceeded the prescribed value for differential settlement, BBR, consultants to Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), anticipated that the top plate of the bearing is [...] "likely touch the bottom plate thereby damaging the bearing." [...] To remedy the situation, the consultant advised HCC, to maintain a uniform gradient of 200 mm between the piers 26, 27 and 28. However, the lifting of bearings by 200 mm was executed during the month of May 2003, even though the settlement of the pier in question was not significant after May 2002. This was achieved by using Conbextra HES (which has properties of free flow, achieving high early strength and <b>quick</b> <b>setting),</b> a cementation material manufactured by M/s. FOSROC, India. The gap of 200 mm between the pedestal top and bottom of bearing was filled with this material. This was done by careful planning of stopping train operations (by taking two breaks of short intervals) over the bridge during the period of rectification supported by eight 400 tonnes capacity hydraulic jacks with lock nut and shim plates’ arrangement.|$|E

50|$|At 210 m {{in height}} the minaret is the tallest {{religious}} {{structure in the}} world. It has a laser beam fitted at the top, which is electronically operated in the evening. It is oriented towards Mecca, across the sea and has a range of 30 km. The minaret is said to enhance the visual alignment of the boulevard. It is square in shape thrusting skyward. The base to the top width ratio of 1 to 8 (between basement and the summit) has a marble covering on the exterior with austere decoration. The faces of the facade have carved ornamentation with different materials. There are stitches of roudani tracetine on a 100,000 MP surface. This decorative material (with chrome and green as dominant colours), is {{a substitute for the}} use of bricks, the material used in many other notable minarets, and has given the mosque an extraordinary elegance. Green tiles decorate the minaret for one third of the height from the top, and then changes colour to deep green or turquoise blue; it is said that in the Hassan II minaret, the designer had used his sea-foam green and God’s blue to celebrate the life of a king. The concrete used for the minaret was a special high-grade type, which could perform well under severe conditions of a combined action of strong wind and seismicity. This was achieved by the Science Department of the BouyguesGroup, the contractors for the project, who developed an extra-strength concrete four times stronger than ordinary concrete. Called B.H.P (highly resistant concrete), it offers a resistance to compression value of 1200 bars per sqcm (claimed to be a world record) and has a very <b>quick</b> <b>setting</b> time. This enabled the building of a taller structure with due underpinning of the foundation, while adhering to the construction schedule. Cranes were also designed to suit the height of the minaret for concreting.|$|E
