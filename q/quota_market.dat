40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates China's land <b>quota</b> <b>markets,</b> {{a recent}} land policy innovation that virtually transfers urbanization {{permission from the}} countryside to cities. To circumvent national government's quota restrictions on converting agricultural land to urban land, local governments have created new land quotas by demolishing sparsely located farmhouses, and resettling peasants into high-density apartments. These quotas are then sold in new land <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> to real estate developers. I find that China's land <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> alter the traditional calculus of location and land use theory: the rural hinterlands have suddenly become valuable to urban land markets, particularly for industrial projects. In fact, the more distant a village is, {{the more likely it}} will be involved in land <b>quota</b> <b>markets.</b> Remoteness becomes a spatial advantage. These dramatic changes are the result of reconstructing property rights in land. The quotas traded on the market are a right to convert land use from rural to urban, separate from development rights to invest in specific properties. These institutional changes were initiated by recalibration of inter-governmental relationships: the Central Government delegates more autonomy to local governments and the municipality centralizes control over land from subordinating district and county governments. The implications of the new land <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> are profound and many. The <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> further draw land resources away from the rural areas to urban areas, and reinforces the imbalances between big and small cities. Since these institutional changes are driven by public finance at its core, the scale of our analysis needs to be regional rather than at the scale of the city. Lastly, <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> have mixed welfare impact on different types of peasants. For peasants on the urban fringe, the scale of land taking is likely to increase, displacing more peasants than without the <b>quota</b> <b>markets.</b> For peasants in the deep rural areas, their housing conditions and access to infrastructure and public services are improved. However, their transition to urban lifestyle takes place before their transition to urban mode of production, therefore their long-term economic prospect is dismal. by Yuan Xiao. Thesis: Ph.

When all fishers are price takers in the <b>quota</b> <b>market,</b> the social optimum is likely to be achieved given the total allowable catch (TAC) level. On the other hand, when low-cost fishers have market power in the <b>quota</b> <b>market,</b> the inefficiency may be serious: excess entry of low-cost fishers and insufficient exit of high-cost fishers may take place.

40|$|Abstract only. ITQ {{introduction}} has {{had several}} effects on fisheries in terms of, for example, {{changes in the}} composition of the fishing fleet and fishing efficiency gains. After ITQ introduction in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998, an increasing number of fishers have become dependent on quota leasing to catch fish (Putten van and Gardner Accepted). At the same time quota owners who lease out their entire quota, increasingly characterises the fishery. The economic, social and cultural implications of structural changes observed in ITQ fisheries around the world (Eythórsson 2000) also apply in Tasmania, although the particulars of these developments vary. Changes in the Tasmanian industry are also observed in terms of the characteristics of the lease <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> and market participants. Brokers have an increasingly important role in trading lease quota thereby reducing the number of personal interactions. The role of processors in the lease <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> is also pertinent {{not only in terms of}} price developments but also in market interactions and dependencies. The change in market relationships and connections, in parallel with increasing dependence on lease quota by a large component of the industry, may be particularly relevant as strong social connections characterise this fishery. In this research, social networks in the quota lease market of the ITQ managed Tasmanian rock lobster fisheries are analysed. Changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics proceeding quota introduction in 1998 are analysed. The economic characteristics of different lease quota fisher types are also considered in this context. Network parameters indicate that the lease <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> can be represented by a scale-free network. Over time the market has become more strongly dependent on internal networks, in particular processors who take on the roles of pseudo brokers to ensure fisher loyalty. The change in network structure of the lease <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> indicates that a small number of quota owner investors and processor quota redistributors appear to be in an increasingly powerful position in this market. This development is surprising because disproportionate quota ownership by processor, as observed in many other ITQ managed fisheries, has been averted in Tasmania. Processor control in the lease market cannot be gained by purchasing quota due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through investment in quota, it has been gained by virtue of redistributing lease quota...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} individual transferable quota regimes on technology choice, such as choice of vessel size, by using the laboratory experiment method. We find that even if vessel sizes change over time, the quota price can converge to the fundamental value conditioned on the vessels chosen. We also find that subjects choose their vessel type to maximise their profits based on the quota trading prices in the previous period. This result implies that the efficiency of <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> in the beginning period is important because any inefficiency in <b>quota</b> <b>markets</b> may affect vessel sizes in ensuing periods. Moreover, {{we find that the}} initial allocations may significantly influence vessel sizes through two channels: first, a higher initial allocation to a subject increases the likelihood that the subject invests in a large-sized vessel; second, the quota price may be higher and more unstable under unequal allocation than under equal allocation; thus, whether the allocation is equal influences subjects' choice of vessel type. © 2014 Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc...|$|R

By using simple numerical simulations, it is further investigated to what degree a cost-effective climate policy differs from a free <b>quota</b> <b>market,</b> under various assumptions about learning effects, diffusion of technology and environmental targets. The results indicate that optimal taxes may be significantly higher in the industrial world than in the developing world.

40|$|Bycatch is {{a nearly}} {{universal}} problem for fisheries, {{and it is}} increasingly common to place strict limits on allowable bycatch either on individuals or an industry sector. Individual bycatch quotas strengthen individual incentives to avoid bycatch and may reduce {{the likelihood that the}} bycatch cap will limit target species catch. However, in cases where bycatch is highly uncertain and variable, individual quotas and markets may be subject to high price variability and may fail to allocate quota efficiently. In some cases such as sea turtles, marine mammals, rare seabird and certain fish species, the allowable take may be less than one per permit holder. There are a number of reasons to believe that a transferable <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> may not function effectively in these cases. I explore the implications of stochasticity and uncertainty of bycatch for valuing quota in an individual bycatch quota system.

40|$|Catches {{of several}} {{potential}} choke {{species in the}} Pacific groundfish IFQ are highly uncertain and tend to be concentrated while quota is broadly distributed. An analysis prior to implementation of the IFQ suggested substantial risk of individual vessels accidentally exceeding quota allocations for several rockfish species and Pacific halibut. Many fishermen lacked confidence {{that they would be}} able to acquire quota on the market to cover incidental catch and consequently joined risk pools to mitigate this risk. I update the analysis of bycatch risk using tow level catch data since implementation of the IFQ. The analysis indicates that expected catch rates of most choke species have declined suggesting more effective bycatch avoidance behavior. However, there remains a significant risk that vessels’ catch of some choke species can be several times median quota allocations, in part because many vessels have increased catch and effort by leasing quota pounds, but quota share ownership has remained distributed. The results underscore the importance of an efficient <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> to redistribute quota to match realized catches, but a recent analysis suggests that the <b>quota</b> <b>market</b> is not distributing quota effectively and is subject to high transactions costs.  This provides and explanation for the persistence of risk pools despite the fact that aggregate catches of overfished rockfish species and Pacific halibut have remained well below total quotas. ...|$|E
