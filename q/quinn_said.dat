50|$|By his own account, <b>Quinn</b> was <b>said</b> to {{have been}} born in Calcutta, India to an Indian family.

Between the months of May and August, the band recorded a six track demo at Sawmills Studio and, having signed a deal with Backbeat Records, a limited number of copies of [...] "Caught by the Fuzz" [...] and [...] "Mansize Rooster" [...] were released. The demo had also quickly reached EMI, however, and that led to the group being signed by the Parlophone label, which would re-release the two songs. <b>Quinn</b> <b>said</b> [...] "it took about three and a half months total recording time and cost less to make than the video for Alright." ...|$|E
500|$|In late March, Trebelhorn {{projected}} that Bates would be Milwaukee's starting second baseman for the 1990 MLB season, although Dale Sveum was {{bearing down on}} the starting spot. Bates started at second on Opening Day against the Chicago White Sox, and despite a 2–1 Brewers' loss, Bates' play was complimented. Facing the Red Sox on April 14, Bates hit his only MLB extra base hit, a double, in the 8th inning but committed two errors on defense. He later scored the go-ahead run on a Gary Sheffield double in a 9–5 Milwaukee victory. Previously, he stole second base and home plate in the 2nd. His second (and final) MLB RBI occurred on April 18. Rob Deer scored on his single, after Bates entered {{the game in the}} 6th inning to replace Sveum, who had been hit by a pitch an inning earlier. By April 27 Bates was hitting [...]103 over 29 at bats, as Molitor came off the DL and expected to take over at second: Seth Livingstone of The Telegraph called the switch [...] "merciful". Four days later, Bates was demoted to Denver, where he was the team's all-time leader in steals. For the Zephyrs, he batted [...]327 in 25 games before Milwaukee traded him to the Cincinnati Reds on June 9. This occurred as part of a four-player deal, in which Bates and outfielder Glenn Braggs were sent to Cincinnati for pitchers Ron Robinson and Bob Sebra. Reds general manager Bob <b>Quinn</b> <b>said</b> he made the trade because, while [...] "we felt comfortable with our pitching staff, we didn't feel comfortable with the right-handed hitters off the bench". Bates later said that he repeatedly asked the Brewers to trade him.|$|E

50|$|Felder gained {{popularity}} among his conservative Jewish constituents for advocating strongly on their behalf, including in matters relating to Israel. Although personally opposed to homosexuality as being against Orthodox Judaism, he backed Christine Quinn for City Council Speaker {{in what was}} seen as a political move to gain allies. Although Felder claimed to support <b>Quinn,</b> he <b>said</b> he could not actually vote for her because of religious reasons. When the time came to vote Quinn for Council Speaker, Felder did not cast a vote and took a trip to the restroom. Unlike nearly all other New York Democrats, who identify as being pro-choice, Felder is a staunch opponent of abortion rights.|$|R

One such threat, reported in The New Yorker, proposed that: [...] "Next time she shows up at a conference we... give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal... a good solid injury to the knees.

In his review for The Independent, Anthony <b>Quinn</b> <b>said</b> of Schwartzman that [...] "he perfectly captures the poignancy of a character who understands his failings but hasn't yet the emotional resources to conquer them". In her review for The Washington Post, Rita Kempley praised Schwartzman's performance for winning [...] "sympathy {{and a great deal}} of affection for Max, never mind that he could grow into Sidney Blumenthal". Entertainment Weekly gave Rushmore an [...] "A" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "Anderson concentrates on beautifully disciplined filmmaking, employing 1960s British Invasion hits [...] [...] [...] to further define Max's adolescent dislocation". Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, wrote, [...] "To their credit, Anderson and Wilson share none of the class snobbery that subtly infuses much of Salinger's work ... But like Salinger they harbor a protective gallantry toward their characters that becomes the film's greatest strength and its greatest weakness".|$|E
2500|$|Snow Patrol have founded Polar Music, a {{publishing}} company run through Kobalt Music. The venture is independent from the band's publishing deal with Universal Music.

[...] Quinn, and his fellow band members Connolly and Lightbody are acting as A. The company's first signing was Johnny McDaid, previously of the Northern Irish band Vega4. <b>Quinn</b> has <b>said</b> that they wish to sign artists to a one-album deal, and {{do not want to}} put undue pressure on the artists with a bigger, multi-year deal.

2500|$|To {{respond to}} {{widespread}} criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended {{to show that}} Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed {{as a way to}} [...] "demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism". Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be sockpuppets that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods. <b>Quinn</b> <b>said</b> that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, [...] "#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic". Arthur Chu wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage white guilt and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.|$|E
2500|$|Jeepster dropped Snow Patrol in 2001, a {{decision}} that was criticised by Hot Press magazine as brainless. By July 2001, many major labels had started showing interest in Snow Patrol, but the band were cash-strapped and had no record deal. Lightbody sold {{a major part of}} his record collection to raise money to keep the band going. Lightbody calls the time [...] "miserable", but was confident of getting signed to another label quickly. However, the music scene in the United Kingdom had turned its attention to American bands and British bands were not getting signed. The band spent this time constantly writing songs. Lightbody, bored at this point, assembled The Reindeer Section, a Scottish supergroup, and found a record label to release the group's recordings. <b>Quinn</b> <b>said</b> that though the time was hard for everyone involved except for Nathan, the question of splitting up never arose. It was during this time the band wrote [...] "Run" [...] (which had been around since 2000) in a room on an acoustic guitar, which later became the band's breakthrough single. The band's [...] "low point" [...] came when they played a concert to 18 people at a popular strip club in High Wycombe. The show took place in a shoddy VIP area, and the management had to unscrew poles used by pole dancers to make space for the band to play, something that Gary would later joke about whilst performing at a sold out Wembley Arena. Quinn calls the show [...] "horrendous". Desperate for attention, the band raised £200 to nominate themselves for a Mercury Prize, but failed to get shortlisted.|$|E

In October 2009, Snow Patrol played at a headlining set at the second annual fundraiser for ONEXONE, a charitable organization committed to fighting health issues and preserving {{the lives of children}} globally. The band played at Children in Need, a BBC charity concert, organized by Take That singer Gary Barlow in November 2009. Following the event's tradition of every artist duet-ting with another, Barlow had asked the band if they were interested in duet-ting with British singer Cheryl Cole. <b>Quinn</b> later <b>said</b> that it was not something the band would normally do, but agreed to, because it was for charity. Cole rehearsed with the band one night before the show and sang Martha Wainwright's vocal parts on [...] "Set the Fire to the Third Bar". Additionally, the band played [...] "Chasing Cars" [...] backed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In December 2009, the band will play at the fourth edition of Versus Cancer, an annual one-off concert to raise funds for the treatment of cancer.

At {{the end of the}} month he ran for the first time over one mile and started a 33/1 outsider for the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood. Ridden by Richard Hughes he took the lead in the straight and maintained his advantage until the final furlong when he was overtaken and finished third behind Rock of Gibraltar and Noverre. On 17 August, Reel Buddy, racing for the twenty-fifth time, started 7/2 second favourite for the Group Three Hungerford Stakes over seven furlongs at Newbury. Ridden by Richard Quinn, he started slowly but began to make progress approaching the last quarter mile. After looking unlikely to obtain clear run he took the lead inside the final furlong and held off the late challenge of his stable companion Umistim to win by a short head and record his first Group race success. After the race, Hannon commented that he had thought that Reel Buddy would need [...] "tin-opener" [...] to get through the [...] "wall of horses" [...] in front of him in the straight and said [...] "He dwelt and then I thought he was never going to get out of there, but in the end he got there too soon". <b>Quinn,</b> however, <b>said</b> [...] "The only time I was worried was taking him down the start as he was a bit keen!"

500|$|Lemmie Quinn, foreman of {{the metal}} room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank {{in his office at}} 12:20.

According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, it would have taken at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30a.m. to 1:30p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon.
