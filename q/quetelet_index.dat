25|$|The {{body mass}} index (BMI) or <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of an individual.

40|$|SUMMARY Potential {{predictors}} of systolic and {{diastolic blood pressure}} change between 1960 and 1967 in the biracial population of Evans County, Georgia, were investigated. An all possible regres-sions multiple linear regression analysis was used. For systolic blood pressure change, the level of systolic blood pressure, age, and change in <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> were significant (p < 0. 05) correlates in white men. The level of systolic blood pressure, the level and change of socioeconomic status, change in <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index,</b> and change in cholesterol were significant correlates for white women. The level of <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> was of borderline significance (p < 0. 055) when the other significant variables {{were included in the}} model for white women. The change in <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> was the only significant correlate of systolic blood pressure change in blacks. For diastolic blood pressure change, age, change in hematocrit, and change in <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> were significant correlates for white men. Age, level and change of socioeconomic status,'level and change of <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index,</b> and change in hematocrit were the significant correlates in white women. In black men, change in <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> and age were signifi-cant. In black women, only age was a significant correlate of diastolic blood pressure change. These results indicate that there may be important differences in these correlates between race-sex groups and thus in the mechanism of blood pressure change for different race-sex groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> and subsequent risk for cancer of endocrine target organs was studied in {{a cohort of}} 47, 003 women, examined for height and weight in the years 1963 - 65, and followed up in the Swedish Cancer Register until 1987. High <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> {{was associated with a}} decreased risk for breast cancer among women less than 55 years of age at risk, while a high <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> predicted an increased risk among older women. Among women > or = 55 years of age, the excess relative risk for breast cancer associated with high <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> declined significantly during the follow-up period. Cancer of the ovaries and the uterine cervix were not significantly related to <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> in any age group. In women > or = 55 years of age, the relative risk for cancer of the uterine corpus associated to <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> was higher than that for breast cancer, and this association persisted during the entire follow-up period of more than 20 years.

Waist/hip ratio increased with increasing <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> and age. Postmenopausal women did not have higher waist/hip ratios compared to premenopausal women after adjustment for <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> and age. In pre- and postmenopausal women, waist/hip ratio increased with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per day (while <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> decreased) and a positive linear relationship was found between parity and waist/hip ratio (also after adjustment for <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> and age).

Two hundred thir-teen women and 1 50 men with {{a wide spectrum of}} weights, heights, and ages underwent densitometric analysis for the de-termination of percent body fat (%BF). %BF was then con-trasted with various well-established BMIs. Although %BF was correlated with all the BMIs(r = 0. 60 - 0. 82), applying objective definitions of obesity based on BMIs or %BF by densitometry often produced conflicting results. It was also found that the 95 % confidence intervals for predicting %BF by using <b>Quetelet’s</b> <b>index</b> were very wide. Because of the wide variation for individuals between densitometrically determined body fat and body fat as estimated by BMIs, we conclude that BMIs should be used with caution as indicators of obesity.

40|$|Introduction: Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} is {{a highly}} prevalent disease and is considered an inevitable correlate of ageing. Several theories have been advanced {{in a bid to}} explain its pathogenesis, the most popular ones relating to sex steroid hormones (1). Currently facets of the metabolic syndrome of which two principal components are insulin resistance and high BMI have been postulated to be related to growth of the prostate (2). Insulin resistance is assessed by the HOMA-IR index. Some studies have demonstrated an association between these indices {{and the size of the}} prostate (3). While others have not (4). We set out to investigate this association. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the <b>Quetelet‘s</b> <b>Index,</b> HOMA-IR index and the prostate volume amongst patients scheduled for surgery for prostate enlargement. Methods: Consecutive male patients attending the urology clinic were recruited into the study. Their anthropometric measures were taken and <b>Quetelet‘s</b> <b>index</b> was derived from the same. Prostate volumes were determined by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). Serum samples were taken, after an overnight fast and assayed for insulin and glucose levels. Tissue specimens were examined at the Aga khan University Hospital Histopathology labs. Prostate volume was considered the main outcome. Regression modeling was employed to assess the relationship between the BMI and prostate volume and that between the HOMAIR index and the prostate volume. Results: A total of 130 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 69. 8 (SD 9. 152). The mean BMI was 22. 66 (SD 4. 01), while the mean prostate volume was 81. 2 cc (SD 38. 98). The age of the patients was associated with the prostate volume and according to our model there was an increase in the mean prostate volume with age.

Analyses were stratified by axillary node status, estrogen receptor status, and way of detection (by first screening or afterwards). Results of the stratified analyses were suggestive of a modifying effect of these factors. The absence of an association between obesity and survival time might be explained by two counteracting mechanisms.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{recently}} presented hypothesis {{contends that}} the excess coronary heart disease mor-tality associated with hypertension is more prominent in lean men than in overweight men. This hypothesis was addressed using data collected in the Israeli Ischemic Heart Disease Study (n = 10, 059). The ratios of age-adjusted 15 -year death rates in hypertensive and normotensive men were 4. 7, 2. 8, 2. 0, and 1. 9 in the <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> groups of 2. 83 g/cm 2, respectively. The corresponding ratios for all-cause mortality were 2. 2, 2. 1, 2. 0, and 1. 7, respectively. The group with the highest all-cause age-adjusted mortality, at 33. 6 %, {{was that of the}} leanest (< 2. 29 g/cm, bottom 20 % of the <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> distribution) hypertensive subjects. The same group also displayed the highest coronary heart disease mortality (age-adjusted rate, 18. 2 %). The findings persisted for both smokers and nonsmokers and after exclusion of men with coronary heart disease or diabetics at intake, men on antihypertensive medication, or those who died in the first 2 years of follow-up (1963 - 1965). A multivariate risk score for developing myocardial infarction was calculated, based on levels of age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index.</b> This score varied little across the four <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> groups in hypertensive men: 5 -year mean estimated risks of myocardial infarction were between 70 and 74 / 1000. In normotensive men the scores increased from 19 / 1000 in the leanest subjects to 29 / 1000 in the overweight ones. The overall trend of 15 -year coronary heart disease mortality is thus in line with the multiple risk of 5 -year myocardial infarction incidence, but the source of the risk differences between lean and overweight hypertensive subjects remains unclear. These findings may have important implications in making decisions regarding the mode of treatment, especially in the wide group of mildly hypertensive persons in whom the benefit of treatment is still controversial.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} maternal fatness on the mortality of infants born preterm up to the corrected age of 18 months 795 mother-infant pairs were studied. Maternal fatness was defined by <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> (weight/(height 2)) and all infants weighed less than 1850 g at birth. In 771 mother-infant pairs maternal age, complications of pregnancy, mode of delivery, parity, social class, and the baby's sex and gestation were analysed by a logistic regression model for associations with infant mortality (but deaths from severe congenital abnormalities and those occurring during the first 48 hours after birth were excluded). In a subgroup of 284 mother-infant pairs all infant deaths except those from severe congenital abnormalities were analysed {{in association with the}} infant's birth weight and gestation and the mother's height and weight; this second analysis included another 24 infants who had died within 48 hours after birth. In the first analysis mortality overall was 7 % (55 / 771), rising from 4 % (71 / 173) in thin mothers (<b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> 30). After adjusting for major demographic and antenatal factors, including serious complications of pregnancy, maternal fatness was second in importance only to length of gestation in predicting death of infants born preterm. In the second analysis mortality overall was 15 % (44 / 284), rising from 9 % (5 / 53) in thin mothers to 47 % (8 / 17) in mothers with grades II and III obesity. In both analyses the relative risk of death by 18 months post-term was nearly four times greater in infants born to obese mothers than in those born to thin mothers. In addition, maternal fatness was associated with reduced birth weight, whereas it is associated with macrosomia in term infants...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationships}} ofrelative {{weight to}} energy intake and to physical activity were studied among 141 females aged 34 - 59 y. As observed {{in previous studies}} <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index</b> (wt/ht 2) was inversely related to energy intake (r =- 0. 1 1). However, obese women tended to be older (r = 0. 16), exercise less (r =- 0. 30), and drink less alcohol (r =- 0. 16) than nonobes...|$|E
40|$|In 1984 and 1985, 25 -year {{follow-up}} {{studies were}} carried out in the Italian, Finnish, and Dutch cohorts of men originally examined around 1960 in the Seven Countries Study. Risk factors for coronary heart disease were determined in 2, 255 men aged 65 - 84 years. The average serum total cholesterol levels of the elderly men in Finland and the Netherlands were similar, at around 236 mg/dl (6. 10 mmol/liter). The average serum total cholesterol levels of the elderly men in Italy were about 10 mg/dl (0. 26 mmol/llter) lower. During 25 years of follow-up, the average serum total cholesterol level increased by 29 mg/dl (0. 75 mmol/ liter) among the Italian survivors, decreased by 23 mg/dl (0. 59 mmol/lrter) in the Finnish survivors, and did not change in the Dutch survivors. Age, <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index,</b> and coffee consumption were the most important correlates of total cholesterol in these elderly men. <b>Quetelet</b> <b>index,</b> alcohol consumption, age, and cigarette smoking were significantly associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-terol.

40|$|Analysis of 5, 989 couples, {{for whom}} fathers 2 ̆ 7 and mothers 2 ̆ 7 heights and weights were recorded, showed that {{paternal}} height {{had a significant}} influence (p less than 0. 0007) on birth-weight while paternal body mass <b>index</b> (<b>Quetelets</b> <b>Index)</b> had no significant effect (p greater than 0. 05). Depending upon mother 2 ̆ 7 s height, the average effect of father 2 ̆ 7 s height (ranging from 165 cm to 184 cm) on birth-weight was up to 152 g, with a greater effect where the mother was taller (up to 235 g) and a lesser effect where the mother was shorter (confirming the effect of maternal constraint). The significance of these findings lies more {{with the need to}} consider this effect as an important variable in statistical analysis involving birth-weight than in its immediate obstetrical implications...|$|R
40|$|Endogenic {{factors as}} one of {{possible}} reasons for low back pain were investigated and discussed in this study. The study included 122 male bus drivers, average age 44. 2 years, average period of active service 24. 4 years. The following anthropometric indexes have been calculated: <b>Quetelet’s</b> <b>index,</b> percentage of body fat, relative body weight, Olivier’s typologic index, Lorenz’s constitution index and muscle index. According to inquiry form regarding history of low back pain the subjects were divided in two groups: 36 had no low back pain history and 76 {{had a history of}} recurrent low back pain. The results showed statistically nonsignificant differences in the anthropometric parameters and the calculated indexes between these two groups of subjects. The chosen subject sample showed that nutritional status, body build, constitution and muscular development are not associated with the incidence of low back pain...|$|R
40|$|A new {{and highly}} {{reproducible}} method for measuring radiographic joint {{space in the}} rheumatoid knee is described. The joint space was measured in radiographs of the knees of 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and correlated by computer analysis with age, sex, duration of disease, erosions, degenerative change, therapy and <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index</b> (an index of obesity). Narrowing of both compartments of the knee correlated significantly with the duration of disease. Narrowing of the lateral, but not medial, compartment showed some degree of correlation with obesity as measured by <b>Quetelet's</b> <b>index,</b> but this did not achieve significance. The presence of erosions was associated with marked narrowing of joint space which frequently occurred early {{in the course of}} the disease; three-quarters of the patients showing even moderate erosions had at least one knee compartment narrowed to 2 mm or less and in half of these the changes had occurred in less than 10 years. Joint space narrowing also correlated strongly with degenerative change which was, however, remarkable for its infrequency. A NUMBER of studies have shown an increased association between obesity and osteo-arthrosis of weight-bearing joints (1 - 6) and of particular joints in certain occupations, though a smaller number of studies do not agree (7 - 9). Such an observation is consistent with the generally accepted view that mechanical stress is one of the factors contributing to the development of osteoarthrosis. If the same mechanical factors are also operative in rheumatoid arthritis, destructive changes in weight-bearing joints might be expected to be greater in obese patients with this disease. The knee was chosen as a convenient joint to evaluate this hypothesis, but firstly a reproducible method of measuring radiographic joint space had to be devised. Using this technique the joint space in knee radiographs of a series of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was correlated by computer analysis with the degree of obesity, disease duration and other factors which may be relevant to joint damage...|$|R
