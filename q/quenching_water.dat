Residual traces in the raw synthesis gas after quench could bring about the poisoning of catalysts and corrosion effects on plant facilities. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of quenching operation on the trace components during test campaigns of the autothermal non-catalytic reforming of natural gas (Gas-POX) mode in the HP POX (high pressure partial oxidation) test plant. In order to achieve this, Aspen Plus simulation model of the quench chamber of the HP POX test plant was developed to re-calculate the quench chamber input amount of different trace compounds from their output amount measured during test points of the Gas-POX campaigns.

We tested this by fixing one hexamer and quenching slowly from 370 K, leading to increased correlation with pure ice.

These potentially valuable fossil fuels are found over large areas of Southern and Eastern Utah and vary widely in quality depending on the amount of intermixed inorganic material.

The total heating values of the synthesis gas from the carbon shales examined ranged from 4 to 62 percent of that of coal. The process water requirements per unit of heaing value obtained for gasification of the carbonaceous shales tended to be 5 to 15 percent higher than that for coal.

40|$|When {{porcelain}} enamels or vitreous-type ceramic coatings {{are applied}} to ferrous metals, there {{is believed to be}} an evolution of hydrogen gas both during and after the firing operation.

To determine experimentally the relative importance of the principal sources of the hydrogen causing the defects, a procedure was devised in which heavy hydrogen (deuterium) was substituted in turn for regular hydrogen in each of five possible hydrogen-producing operations in the coating process. The findings of the study were as follows: (1) the principal source of the defect-producing hydrogen was the dissolved water present in the enamel frit that was incorporated into the coating.

40|$|Corrosion is the {{deterioration}} of physical properties of the material due to a reaction with its environment. It converts refined metal to their more stable oxide. Corrosion of the material will depends on mainly on two factors the material of construction and the environment present. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} find the responsible factors in both the aqueous environment and the material of construction. Characterization of the water used for the quenching purpose in Rourkela Steel Plant, Odisha yielded the list of contaminants present in it. The effect of the presence of these compounds on the rate of corrosion has been studied by performing experiments using simulated quenching processing water which is later affirmed by the literature available. The reference level used for the study is taken from the reported literature values {{as well as from the}} obtained experimental results. The single effects as well as the combined effects of the water quality parameters are also taken to account for the corrosion study. An inhibitor is used to check the inhibiting efficiency of the selected chemical. The surface morphology has been studied by SEM and XRD analysis which detects the type of corrosion taking place. EDX analysis of the <b>quenching</b> <b>water</b> establishes the presence of oxygen, carbon and sulphate. XRD analysis infers the formation of various corrosion products such as FeO, Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 etc. Literature suggests parameters such as hardness, BOD, COD and presence of various elements such as chloride, sulphate, nitrite, etc. also affects the corrosion rate of a material. On characterisation of the <b>quenching</b> <b>water,</b> the following parameters were obtained: BOD 110. 56, DO 10. 00, COD 508. 80, Hardness 400. 96, phenol 70. 08, sulphate 7. 68, Chloride 223. 00, Nitrite 0. 20, Ammonia 116. 80, and finally organic nitrogen as 246. 60 mg/l. Another important parameter which plays a role in the rate of corrosion is the formation of passive layer on the surface of the metal. A wide range of chemical compounds are known to inhibit corrosion in various environments. In the present work, aniline was studied to determine its corrosion inhibition efficiency. The results show that aniline was highly efficient against corrosion due to chlorides while least efficient against corrosion owing to phenols.

40|$|Even though highly {{corrosion}} resistant in general, AlMgSi (6000 -series) alloys may sometimes develop susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC). In this work {{the effect of}} Cu content and various thermomechanical treatments on IGC of AlMgSi model alloy extrusions of nominal composition 0. 55 wt% Mg and 0. 60 wt%Si was investigated. The corrosion susceptibility was tested according to the standard BS 11846 method B, which essentially involved degreasing, alkaline etching, desmutting in concentrated HNO 3 and 24 h immersion in an acidified NaCl solution. The validity of this test as a reliable laboratory tool for qualitative ranking of samples for IGC susceptibility was verified by comparing it to results obtained by outdoor exposure in an industrial-marine environment at Karmøy, located {{on the coast of}} Norway The most important factor causing IGC susceptibility of the model alloys was the Cu content. The high Cu models were susceptible to IGC, although the Cu content was as low as 0. 12 – 0. 17 wt. % Cu. Model alloys with low Cu content (0. 005 – 0. 02 wt. %) were resistant. However, the corrosion mode of the high Cu alloys was strongly related to the thermomechanical history. Therefore, by applying the correct heat treatment, it was possible to reduce or eliminate IGC susceptibility also on the high Cu samples. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated gave the most susceptible variants where nearly all grain boundaries exposed to the corrosive test solution were attacked (uniform IGC). Artificial aging reduced the IGC susceptibility by confining the intergranular attacks to localised sites (localised IGC), and near fully resistance to localised corrosion developed in the peak aged temper. Rapid <b>quenching</b> (<b>water</b> quenching) after extrusion prevented IGC, but high susceptibility (uniform IGC) was introduced as a result of short time aging. Further aging to peak hardness reduced IGC susceptibility (local IGC), but did not remove it completely. Overaging introduced slight pitting susceptibility to the air cooled extrusion. In contrast overaging reintroduced localised IGC to the solution heat treated air cooled samples. The solution heat treated and water quenched samples were susceptible to localised IGC both in the the T 6 temper (peak aged) and in the overaged temper. The grain boundary microstructure was also strongly dependent on the thermal history. Samples which were slow-cooled (air cooling) after extrusion and samples which were subsequently solution heat treated exhibited extensive precipitation of large (_ 5 μm) elongated grain boundary precipitates of the equilibrium phases _ (Mg 2 Si) and Q (Al 4 Mg 8 Si 7 Cu 2). The Q-phase was however not present on the low Cu alloys. The shape and size of these precipitates were not affected by artificial aging. On the high Cu alloy, a Cu enriched grain boundary film was additionally present. This film coarsened as a result of artificial aging. Water quenching after extrusion effectively prevented grain boundary precipitation, and this could thus explain the observed resistance of the water quenched high Cu alloys to IGC. Small grain boundary Q-phase precipitates evolved as a result of artificial aging of water quenched samples, which explained slight deterioration of IGC resistance of such samples. The susceptibility to IGC was related to enriched Cu along the grain boundaries, in the form of discrete Q-phase precipitates and the continuous Cu enriched film. IGC was caused by a microgalvanic coupling between the Cu enriched grain boundary (noble) and the adjacent solute depleted zone (active). The Cu containing film formed a continuous cathodic path on the grain boundaries, which resulted in significant (uniform) IGC, characterised by knife-edge attacks along the grain boundaries. Increased IGC resistance was obtained by artificial aging which coarsened the film and broke the continuous microgalvanic path, resulting in coarse localised IGC or a surface virtually resistant to all forms of localised corrosion. The present work showed that IGC can be avoided or eliminated either by reducing the Cu content or applying the correct thermomechanical treatment. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
