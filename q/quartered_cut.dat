30|$|The flow of {{the cold}} fluid is {{controlled}} by the shape of the baffle. The degree of turbulence created and energy utilized in the turbulence are governed by the baffles. Different baffle cuts, i.e., 25  % baffle <b>cut,</b> <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut,</b> and mirror <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> are used for this analysis. The baffles are not only meant for structural support but also increase the external surface area of the tubes which resulted in improvement in the heat transfer.|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut,</b> the {{direction}} of the flow of the cold fluid changes in the X-Y plane and also in the Z direction. As a result, the total length of the flow increased and the heat transfer rate also proportionately increased. In the circular tube, the heat transfer rate increases up to 11  % when the 25  % baffle cut is replaced by <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> (90 baffle cut) and it is up to 10  % when the elliptical tubes are used from Figs.  15, 16, and 17. This is due to the increase flow length in the Z direction. In {{the case of}} the mirror <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> (M 90 baffle cut), the flow of the cold fluid splits in two streams and follows the helical path due to the baffle shape. Separation of the cold fluid and increase in flow length leads to a better heat transfer rate. Figures  15, 16. and 17 indicate that the heat transfer rate increases up to 14  % when <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> is replaced by mirror <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> in the circular tube, and it is up to 16  % if elliptical tubes are used.|$|R

50|$|Va (வ; Tamil numeral for 1/4; working title: Va <b>Quarter</b> <b>Cutting)</b> is a 2010 Indian Tamil-language neo-noir comedy film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Pushkar-Gayathri. It stars Shiva, SPB Charan and Lekha Washington in the lead roles, with Kalyan, John Vijay and Abhinayashree playing supporting roles. The film's story takes place in one night, in which a man, {{with the help of his}} would-be brother-in-law, hunts for a last liquor before leaving to Saudi Arabia. The plot is similar to the 2004 Hollywood movie Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.|$|R
30|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} simulations {{are carried}} {{for a single}} shell and multiple pass heat exchangers with different tube geometries i.e. circular tubes to elliptical tubes. The experiment was carried out with hot fluid in tube side and cold fluid in shell side with circular tubes at 600 tube orientation and 25 % baffle cut. Heat transfer rates and pressure drops are calculated for various Reynolds numbers from 4000 to 20000. Fluent software is used for numerical investigations. Both circular and elliptical tube geometries with 450, 600 and 900 orientations are used for the numerical studies. In addition to 25 % baffle <b>cut,</b> <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> and mirror <b>quarter</b> baffle <b>cut</b> arrangements are used for comparison. The experimental values of heat transfer rates and pressure drops over shell side and tube side {{along the length of}} STHE are compared with those obtained from fluent software.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT From a {{total of}} 78 chickens, 24 {{carcasses}} were used to estimate the percentage for the individual cuts and their composition. Fifty-four carcasses were cut vertically into halves of which two-thirds were quartered, yielding front and hind <b>quarters</b> (<b>Cuts</b> 2 and 3). Half of these <b>quarters</b> were <b>cut</b> into individual pieces, yielding breasts and thighs with back ribs, drumsticks, and wings. The muscles and skin of one-third {{from each of the}} seven different cuts described above were analyzed raw for lipid oxidation products; while the remaining two-thirds were microwaved. Half of the microwaved cuts were analyzed 2 hours after cooking; the other half, after 4 days of storage at 4 C. The results indicated that the absolute amount of lipid oxidation products in chicken muscles and skin after microwave cooking and refrigerated storage was affected by the initial level of those products in the raw samples and by the particular cut of meat Cooking the different cuts of chicken carcasses by microwave significantly increased the amount of malonaldehyde (MA) and lipid-oxidation fluorescent products (LOFP) in the aqueous phase of Folch-extracted muscles and skin and in the organic phase of Folch-extracted skin lipids. Microwave cooking for the separate broiler parts (especially the drumsticks and wings, as compared to halves or quarters) produced the lowest amount of lipid oxidation products due to the shorter cooking time. Refrigerated storage of broiler parts cooked by microwave produced substantial amounts of MA and LOFP in the aqueous phase of the Folch extracted skin and in the organic phase of the Folch-extracted lipids from the muscles...|$|R
