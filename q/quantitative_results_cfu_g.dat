To this purpose, the soil was NePeK fertilized and four trials, obtained with different combinations of soil treatment, listerial inoculums and seed planting, were followed for each aromatic plant. Soil was weekly investigated for total microbial counts and L. monocytogenes evolution. At the starting time, un-inoculated autoclaved soil showed a limited microbial load (103 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> dw 1), while un-inoculated non-autoclaved soil contained approximately 108 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> dw 1 microorganisms.

40|$|The {{rational}} {{for this}} study was to assess the microbial quality of fresh vegetables at the farm gate of the Water Works road vegetable farm at Gumbihini in the Tamale Metropolis. A total of thirty-six (36) vegetables comprising lettuce, amarantus and cabbages and eight (8) wastewater samples were collected at random and analysed for a period of four months, to assess the microbial contamination level. Samples were analysed for total coliforms, faecal coliforms, E. coli and helminthes eggs. All vegetables sampled during the study period recorded high levels of total and faecal coliform bacteria. Mean faecal coliforms for the various vegetables were as follows; lettuce 3. 7 ± 0. 5 <b>CFU.</b> <b>g</b> - 1, amarantus 3. 5 ± 0. 6 <b>CFU.</b> <b>g</b> - 1 and cabbage 3. 1 ± 0. 6 log <b>CFU.</b> <b>g</b> - 1 fresh weight. FC levels were above the International Commi s sion on Microbiological Specifications for Foods (ICMSF) recommended level of 3 log <b>CFU.</b> <b>g</b> - 1 fresh weight.

Lettuce generally recorded high levels of microbial contamination because of the large surface area occupied by its leaves. Two helminth eggs (Strongiloides stercoralis) were identified in lettuce while four (Ascaris lumbricoides) were identified in wastewater. Microbial loads recorded in wastewater were generally higher than that of vegetables.

This study was carried out to assess the rate of internalisation of microbes in common Ghanaian vegetables. Standard microbiological methods were employed in microbial enumeration of vegetables collected at the market and farm levels, as well as irrigation water and soil samples. The overall mean counts of vegetables were 4. 0 x 10 3 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1; 8. 1 x 10 2 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1; 2. 0 x 10 2 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1; 3. 5 x 10 2 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1 for total bacteria, coliform counts, faecal coliform counts and yeast counts, respectively. The rate of internalisation of coliforms in vegetables irrigated with stream/well water was 2. 7 times higher than those irrigated with pipe water. The mean coliform counts (4. 7 x 10 7 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1) and faecal coliform counts (1. 8 x 10 6 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> - 1) of soil samples {{were similar to those}} of stream water suggesting both sources exerted similar contamination rates on the vegetables. Generally, there were no significant variations between the rates of internalisation of microbes at the market and farm levels at p< 05, indicating that internalisation of microbes in the vegetables mainly occurred at the farm level. The study has shown that microbial contamination of vegetables in Ghana {{is not limited to the}} external surface, but internal vegetable parts could harbour high microbial loads and pose risk to consumers. Safety practices associated with the commodity should therefore not be limited to external washing only.

In sour rot grapes counts varied between 6 Æ 34 ± 1 Æ 03 and 7 Æ 68 ± 0 Æ 38 log <b>CFU</b> <b>g)</b> 1. Hanseniaspora uvarum was the most frequent species from sound samples. In both types of damage, the most frequent species were Candida vanderwaltii, H. uvarum and Zygoascus hellenicus. The latter species was recovered in high frequency because of the utilization of the selective medium DBDM (Dekkera ⁄ Brettanomyces differential medium). The scarce isolation frequency of the wine spoilage species Zygosaccharomyces bailii (in sour rotten grapes) and Zygosaccharomyces bisporus (in honeydew affected grapes) could only be demonstrated by the use of the selective medium ZDM (Zygosaccharomyces differential medium). Conclusions: The isolation of several species only from damaged grapes indicates that damage constituted the main factor determining yeast diversity. The utilization of selective media is required for eliciting the recovery of potentially wine spoilage species. Significance and Impact of the Study: The impact of damaged grapes in the yeast ecology of grapes has been underestimated...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} work was to evaluate the bio potential of fermented cheese whey, for use on disinfection of minimally processed lettuce organically grown. Assays were made with whey obtained from inoculated milk during cheese processing, fermented for 120 h at 37 C, after which, among other carbohydrates, lactic acid was measured by HPLC, giving average yields of 18 g L 1. The sanitizing effect of whey, undiluted, 75 and 50 % solutions, was compared with 110 ppm sodium hypochlorite, after rinsing. Aerobic Microorganisms (AM), Psychrotrophic Microorganisms (PM) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT), were used as indicators for hygiene quality.

Site 1 had higher contamination than Site 3. Bacteria were isolated using metal(loid) -supplemented (Cd, Zn, and As) media. Isolates were grouped by random amplified polymorphic DNA and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Strains were also examined for their metal(loid) tolerance. The counts of metal(loid) -tolerant bacteria were higher in Site 1 and ranged between log 7. 17 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> 1 soil in As-containing medium and log 7. 57 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> 1 soil in Zn-containing medium, while counts at Site 3 varied between log 5. 33 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> 1 soil in Cd-containing medium and log 6. 97 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> 1 soil in As-containing medium. The composition of bacterial populations varied between locations.

Some of these display a capacity to inhibit spoilage as well as several strains of pathogenic micro-organisms, e. g. Listeria monocytogenes which is isolated frequently from cold-smoked salmon (CSS). Eight batches of sliced vacuum-packed CSS from Norway, Scotland and Spain were collected at retail. Packs were stored at 5 1 C and examined for chemical and microbiological characteristics, at purchase date and at expiration date. pH, water activity and salt content were similar to available data on lightly preserved fish products. There was a consistent pattern {{in the development of the}} microflora on CSS; the initial level of LAB was low on freshly produced CSS (102 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> 1); however, storage in vacuum packaging at refrigeration temperature was elective for LAB. At the end of the stated shelf-life these micro-organisms, represented mainly by Lactobacillus spp., attained ca. 107 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> 1 while Enterobacteriaceae counts were consistently lower (105 <b>cfu</b> <b>g</b> 1), which indicates the ability of LAB to grow and compete with few carbohydrates available and in the presence of moderate salt concentrations.

The results suggested that synbiotic use of B. mycoides and OS signifi- cantly improved some immune parameters of marron, particularly the glutathione peroxidase, and to some extent total haemocyte counts. However, the synbiotic feed did not synergistically improve marron growth, in fact the use of B. mycoides-supplemented diet alone demonstrated significantly higher growth in marron compared with the growth of marron fed on other test diets. Supplementation of the basal diet with host origin B. mycoides significantly increased the intestinal bacterial population (3. 399 825 <b>CFU</b> <b>g</b> 1 of gut) in marron compared with other diets. Organic selenium as Sel-Plex in Trypticase Soya Broth also confirmed that OS did not increase the amount of growth of B. mycoides and resulted in a lower intestinal bacterial population in the synbiotic diet-fed marron.
