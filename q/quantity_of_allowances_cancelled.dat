40|$|The “Climate {{action and}} {{renewable}} energy package” proposed by the European Commission {{in the beginning of}} 2008 suggests auctioning as basic principle for allocation for the upcoming third trading phase of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme that runs from 2013 to 2020. Overall, it is estimated that at least two third <b>of</b> the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> will be auctioned in 2013, to be increased to 100 % by 2020. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of a properly chosen auction design as the significantly higher auction share, compared to the past and current trading phase, is expected to yield a thin secondary market for CO 2 allowances. We elaborate main criteria that a viable auction design is supposed to fulfil and propose a specific auction design for the third trading phase. The auction we recommend is a simultaneous dynamic uniform double auction...|$|R

40|$|From an {{analysis}} of the available national allocation plans for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), it can be inferred that (i) the total allocation to installations covered under the EU ETS is rather generous and (ii) most EU Member States ban the transfer <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> (banking) into the second period (2008 - 2012). In this article, we explore the cost-efficiency issues associated with such a generous allocation <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> to the trading sectors in combination with the ban on banking. It is argued that allocation to the trading sectors is higher than implied by a cost-minimization approach. Moreover, due to the reduced level of flexibility, a ban on banking increases overall compliance costs. In addition, the results of a simulation game conducted with real company participants and with a student control group suggest that a generous primary allocation in the first phase combined with a ban on banking also leads to a cost-inefficient choice of abatement measures within periods. The results of the simulations are also consistent with the conjecture that forward markets and auctioning off a part <b>of</b> the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> result in more reliable price signals and more cost-efficient outcome...|$|R

40|$|The European Union’s (EU) {{emissions}} trading scheme (ETS) started on 01 January 2005. The ETS covers CO 2 emissions from large emitters {{in the power}} and heat generation industry and selected energy-intensive industrial sectors. The EU member states have developed national allocation plans (NAP) stating the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> and how they propose to allocate them. This study analyzes available NAPs to examine whether EU countries require less from its ETS sectors than its non-ETS sectors and whether some ETS sectors have been favored in the allocation. Allocations are compared against three reference points (projected emissions, historical emissions and a calculated Kyoto Protocol CO 2 target). The NAP analysis indicates that the relative generous allocations are {{likely to result in}} minor steps towards meeting the countries’ commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Available data indicates that sectors exposed to international competition have been favored in terms of allocations. Therefore, non-ETS sectors in many countries have to substantially reduce their emissions to meet the Kyoto targets unless JI and CDM are used extensively...|$|R
40|$|The “American Power Act ” {{proposed}} by Sen. John Kerry and Sen. Joseph Lieberman {{would establish a}} broad-based U. S. cap-and-trade system. Using an input-output model we estimate the distributional cost of the cap-and-trade portions of the bill to households by income, age group, U.

In a typical year (2020), households would face a gross annual burden of $ 125. 9 billion per year or $ 1, 042 per household, with costs disproportionately borne by low-income households. On a net basis, the large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> distributed freely to companies leads households in the top income quintile to benefit financially, redistributing to these households roughly $ 12. 3 billion per year from the bottom 80 percent of earners. Overall, we estimate the bill would reduce U. S. employment by roughly 522, 000 jobs in 2015, rising to over 5. 1 million jobs by 2050. Finally, we explore two theoretical issues: (1) we offer microeconomic evidence that shareholders rather than households are most likely to benefit from the bill’s free allowances to electricity and natural gas utilities; and (2) we show how the bill’...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the rules}} {{provided}} in the National Allocation Plans of the EU Member States (MS) for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emission trading system (EU-ETS) {{with respect to their}} impact on energy efficiency and innovation and on technology variety. The allocation rules considered are total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> allocated, allocation methods (auction versus grandfathering), rules for banking <b>of</b> left-over <b>allowances</b> into the second period (2008 - 2012), allocation to newcomers and closures of installations, and information about future allocation. Since the overall allocation appears rather generous, allowance prices are expected to be low, in particular since almost all MS prohibit banking into the second period. Thus, price-induced innovation effects will be weak. Similarly, the auction shares are too small to have any innovation effects. Closures result in a stop of further allocation, providing disincentives for innovation. In several MS these disincentives are softened because allowances may be transferred to new installations. However, new entrants typically receive allowances for free based on specific emissions and projected output. These specific values are either based on benchmarks for homogenous product groups or depend on best available technologies. In some countries a plethora of benchmarks within the same product categories threaten to thwart the flexibility provisions of the EU-ETS. Finally, future allocation rules are vastly unknown, amplifying the uncertainty about the benefits of new investments. In conclusion, existing allocation rules provide only modest incentives for innovation...|$|R
40|$|In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, setting {{limits on}} the {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions of industrialized countries. The European Union agreed to reduce its emissions of GHG by 8 % during the period 2008 – 2012 in comparison to their 1990 levels. Subsequently, in a scheme known as “burden-sharing”, Portugal was allowed to increase its emissions by 27 % in the same period. Large industrial facilities are responsible for a significant share of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions and are object of a European Directive (2003 / 87 /EC) establishing the scheme for GHG emission allowance trading within the European Union, launched {{with the purpose of}} allowing the reduction of GHG emissions cost-effectively. According to the Directive, Member States shall develop a National Allocation Plan (NAP) stating the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> that each one intends to allocate and how it proposes to allocate them among the activities included in the trading scheme. In this work, an analysis of the Portuguese industry is performed, focused on the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions levels in the period 1990 – 2001 and on the estimation of the two parameters for the period 2002 – 2012, considering different economic growth scenarios and investments on energy reduction technologies. Results show that all the analysed sectors present a significant growth in CO 2 emissions, exceeding the limit established in the frame of the Kyoto Protocol, and that measures other than cost-effective energy technologies will have to be implemented...|$|R
30|$|The EU Directive for {{the period}} 2013 – 2020 [8], as it was agreed in December 2008, aims at {{improving}} and extending the greenhouse gas emission <b>allowance</b> trading system <b>of</b> the Community.

It is understood that most of the regulations for {{the first year of the}} inclusion of aviation into the EU-ETS which are described above will be further applied. However, the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> emission <b>allowances</b> to be allocated to aircraft operators shall then be equivalent to only 95 % of the historical aviation emissions, multiplied by the number of years in the eight-year period. The use of the project based Kyoto instruments “Joint Implementation” and “Clean Development Mechanism” will be lowered significantly for aircraft operators. In the period 2013 until 2020, aircraft operators may use emission permits from “Joint Implementation” and “Clean Development Mechanism” only up to 1.5 % of the amount <b>of</b> <b>allowances</b> they are required to surrender per year (in 2012 : 15 %).

At the macro level, we assess whether the submitted ET-budgets are stringent, and whether they imply a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions between the EU ETS sectors (energy and industry) and the remaining sectors (transportation, tertiary and households). Comparing the submitted ET-budgets with those already approved by the EC suggests that the EC's decisions significantly improved the effectiveness and economic efficiency of the EU ETS. But given the high share of Kyoto Mechanisms companies are allowed to use, the EU ETS is unlikely to require substantial emission reductions within the EU. At the micro level, we assess (across countries and phases) the allocation methods for existing and new installations, for closures and for clean technologies. A comparison of the NAPs for the second phase and the first phase (2005 - 2007) provides insights into the (limited) adaptability and flexibility of the scheme.

However other equal mechanisms should be applied to the excluded installations instead. A study was carried out to evaluate other mechanisms for small installations.

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} potential for GHG emission {{reductions in the}} new EU member states and the EU accession countries by improving energy efficiency, investing in renewable energy supply and other measures, part {{of which could be}} tapped by JI. However, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and especially the recently adopted "Linking Directive" is probably going to {{have a significant impact on}} this JI potential. Especially two provisions are important: The baseline of a project has to be based on the acquis communautaire, the environmental regulations of which are substantially higher than the Accession Countries' existing ones. Projects, which directly or indirectly reduce emissions from installations falling within the scope of the EU ETS, can only generate certificates if an equal number <b>of</b> EU <b>allowances</b> are <b>cancelled.</b> JI is thus put into direct competition with the EU ETS.

The comparison is accomplished from three perspectives: the first perspective evaluates the degree of correlation between line items demanded and the line items appearing in the APL's; the second perspective provides a projection {{of the effect of}} increased forklift operating hours on the quantities demanded among those demands for line items allowed by the APL's; and the third perspective identifies those line items for which demand generated rendered the quantities demanded significantly different from the quantities allowed by the APL's. As a result of these comparisons and the low correlation between demand data and allowance projections, it is hypothesized that the crucial variable contributing to this low correlation is the low utilization of the equipments in terms of annual operating hours. The conclusion reached is that APL's for forklifts, as presently formulated, are a support planning document of dubious value in situations of low equipment utilization such as observed in this study.
