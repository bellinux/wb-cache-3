5000|$|<b>Quadazocine</b> (WIN-44,441) is an opioid {{antagonist}} of the benzomorphan family {{which is used}} in scientific research. It acts as a silent antagonist at {{all three of the}} major opioid receptors—μ, κ, and δ, but with a significant preference in affinity for the μ receptor and the κ2 subtype. As such, it has been touted as a [...] "κ2-selective" [...] antagonist, though, of course, this is not entirely accurate on account of its similar affinity for the μ receptor. As would be expected, <b>quadazocine</b> reverses the effects (e.g., analgesia) of opioid agonists like morphine and fentanyl in animals.|$|E
40|$|Rationale: The {{endogenous}} opioid system may mediate the reinforcing effects of ethanol {{as well as}} sweet-tasting solutions. For example, opioid antagonists, such as naltrexone, reduce ethanol- and sucrose-reinforced responding in rhesus monkeys. If these effects are due to blockade of the µ-receptor, then an opioid antagonist such as <b>quadazocine</b> with a receptor selectivity profile {{similar to that of}} naltrexone should reduce responding at doses correlated with its µ-selectivity. Objectives: To determine whether <b>quadazocine</b> would reduce responding for ethanol and sucrose at µ-selective doses, and whether <b>quadazocine</b> and naltrexone would reduce responding for a bitter-tasting drug solution such as phencyclidine. Methods: Rhesus monkeys were given access to ethanol, sucrose, or phencyclidine concurrently with water. Prior to the drinking sessions, <b>quadazocine</b> (0. 032 – 3. 2 mg/kg) or saline was injected intramuscularly. During the phencyclidine experiment, naltrexone (0. 1 and 0. 32 mg/kg) was also tested. Results: The highest <b>quadazocine</b> doses (1 and 3. 2 mg/kg) reduced ethanol and sucrose fluid deliveries without affecting the concurrently available water. <b>Quadazocine</b> reduced the fluid deliveries of both phencyclidine and water when concurrently available. Naltrexone reduced only phencyclidine fluid deliveries. Conclusions: The opioid antagonist effect on oral-reinforced responding is not selective for ethanol or sweet-tasting solutions; responding for phencyclidine was reduced as well. <b>Quadazocine</b> and NTX may reduce responding by blocking the µ-receptor because the relative potency of these antagonists to reduce oral self-administration was similar to their relative potency to produce withdrawal in morphine-dependent monkeys. However, water responding was low in these experiments, and thus we cannot rule out rate-dependent effects of the antagonists...|$|E
40|$|In rhesus monkeys, kappa oploid {{agonists}} {{have been}} shown to 1) increase urinary output, 2) increase tail-withdrawal latencies from warm water and 3) produce distinct discriminative stimulus effects. In order to explore further the relation between these effects and activity at the kappa opioid receptor type, the antag-onist activity of <b>quadazocine</b> against several kappa oploid ago-fists was examined with the tail-withdrawal and dwg-discrimi-nation procedures. <b>Quadazocine</b> dose dependently antagonized the icreases in tI-withdrawal latency produced by the kappa agonists bremazoane, ethylketazocine and U- 50, 488, as well as the discriminative stimulus effects of these drugs. The dose-ratio analysis of Schild revealed apparent pA 2 values for <b>quadazocine</b> in combination with bremazocine, ethylketazocine and U- 50, 488 of 6. 1, 6. 4 and 6. 4, respectively, with the tail-withdrawal proce...|$|E

The mu oploid agonists alfentanil and fentanyl, the kappa oploid agonists ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) and U 69, 593, the delta opioid agonist BW 373 U 86 (±) - 4 [...] piperazinal) - 3 -hydroxy-benzyl) -N,N-diethylbenzamide dihydrochIoride and the nono-ioid, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine all produced a dose-dependent decrease in rates of responding. <b>Quadazocine</b> (0. 1 - 1 0 mg/kg) antagonized the rate-decreasing effects of all the opiold agonists, but not of ketamine. The invivo apparent pA 2 values (95 % CL) for <b>quadazocine</b> in combination with each agonist were: alfentanil, 7. 7 (7. 6 - 7. 8); fentanyl, 7. 7 (7. 6 - 7. 8); EKC, 6. 3 (5. 9 - 6. 7); U 69, 593, 6. 5 (5. 9 - 7. 0); and BW 373 U 86, 5. 5 (5. 3 - 5. 8).

40|$|The recent {{synthesis}} of fentanyl derivatives, {{some of which}} appear to have novel profiles of pharmacological effects, has provided compelling evidence that μ opioid efficacy might be altered systematically by modifications in the parent compound fentanyl. In the present study a new 4 -(heteroanilido) -piperidine, compound 28, was studied for its effects in rhesus monkeys. In self-administration studies compound 28 maintained rates of lever pressing similar to those maintained by alfentanil; the reinforcing effects of compound 28 were attenuated by the opioid antagonist <b>quadazocine.</b> In drug discrimination studies compound 28 did not substitute for the κ agonist ethylketocyclazocine and did substitute for the μ agonist alfentanil. In morphine-treated subjects discriminating between saline and naltrexone, compound 28 did not substitute for naltrexone; however, in morphine-abstinent subjects compound 28 reversed naltrexone lever responding. Moreover, this discriminative stimulus effect in morphine-abstinent subjects was antagonized by naltrexone and by <b>quadazocine</b> {{in a manner consistent}} with μ receptor mediation. Compound 28 also was an effective analgesic in a warm-water, tail-withdrawal procedure and it decreased markedly respiratory function. The analgesic effects as well as the respiratory depressant effects of compound 28 were antagonized by <b>quadazocine.</b> Together, these results show compound 28 to be a potent, efficacious μ agonist of similar potency to alfentanil. Large differences in apparent efficacy at μ receptors between compound 28 and another compound in this series (mirfentanil), clearly demonstrate that, within this chemical family, small chemical changes can confer significant differences in pharmacologic effect...|$|E
40|$|This study {{characterized}} the antinociceptive, respiratory {{and heart rate}} effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonists D- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (D- 9 -THC) and WIN 55212 {(R) -(1) - 2, 3 -dihydro- 5 -methyl- 3 -[(4 -morpholinyl) methyl]pyrol-[1, 2, 3 -de]- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 6 -yl) (1 -naphtalenyl) methanone monomethane-sulfonate}, N-arachidonyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and the mu and kappa opioid receptor agonists heroin and U 69593, alone and {{in conjunction with a}} cannabinoid receptor antago-nist, SR 141716 A [N-(piperidin- 1 – 1 -yl) - 5 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 1 (2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) - 4 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazole- 3 -carboxamide hydrochloride] and an opioid receptor antagonist, <b>quadazocine,</b> in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Using 12 adult rhesus monkeys, latencies to remove the tail from a 50 °C water bath, respiration in 5 % CO 2 and heart rate were measured. When administered alone, SR 141716 A (1. 8, 5. 6 mg/kg i. m.) did not alter nociception, respiration or heart rate. D- 9 -THC (0. 1 – 10 mg/kg i. m.) and WIN 55212 (0. 1 – 10 mg/kg i. m.) dose-dependently increased antinociception and dose-dependently decreased respiratory minute and tidal volumes and heart rate. These antinociceptive, respiratory and heart rate effects were reversed by SR 141716 A but not by the opioid antagonist <b>quadazocine</b> (1 mg/kg i. m.). Anandamide (10 mg/kg i. m.) also produced antinociception. Heroin (0. 01 – 10 mg/kg i. m.) and U 69593 (0. 01 – 3. 2 mg/kg i. m.) also dose-dependently increased antinociception and decreased respiratory and heart rate mea-sures; these effects were antagonized by <b>quadazocine</b> but not by SR 141716 A. These results demonstrate selective and re-versible antagonism of cannabinoid behavioral effects by SR 141716 A in rhesus monkeys. Acute administration of cannabinoid receptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|The kappa receptor-selective agonist U- 50, 488 was {{administered}} chronically to rhesus monkeys. Tolerance developed to the overt behavioral effects of U- 50, 488 without cross-tolerance to morphine. Withdrawal behaviors produced by deprivation, naloxone or <b>quadazocine</b> administration in U- 50, 488 -dependent monkeys consisted of hyperactivity, excessive grooming, and yawning. The syndrome was suppressed in a dose-related manner by a kappa agonist, ethylketazocine, {{but not by}} doses of morphine that suppressed its own withdrawal. The mu-selective antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine, at doses which are active in morphine-dependent monkeys, did not precipitate withdrawal in U 50, 488 -dependent monkeys.

40|$|Rationale : By {{acting on}} {{peripheral}} opioid receptors, opioid agonists can attenuate nociceptive responses induced {{by a variety}} of agents. Objectives : This study was conducted to characterize capsaicin-induced thermal hyperalgesia in rats and to evaluate the hypothesis that local administration of either mu or kappa opioid agonists (fentanyl and U 50, 488, respectively) can attenuate capsaicin-induced nociception. Methods : Capsaicin was administered s. c. in the tail of rats to evoke a nociceptive response, which was measured by the warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure. Either fentanyl or U 50, 488 was co-administered with capsaicin in the tail to evaluate local antinociceptive effects. In addition, the local antagonism study was performed to confirm the site of action of both opioid agonists. Results : Capsaicin (0. 3 – 10 µg) dose dependently produced thermal hyperalgesia manifested as reduced tail-withdrawal latencies in 45 °C water. Co-administration of either fentanyl (0. 32 – 3. 2 µg) or U 50, 488 (10 – 100 µg) with capsaicin (3 µg) attenuated capsaicin-induced hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this local antinociception was antagonized by small doses (10 – 100 µg) of an opioid antagonist, <b>quadazocine,</b> applied s. c. in the tail. However, the locally effective doses of <b>quadazocine,</b> when applied s. c. in the back (i. e., around the scapular region), did not antagonize either fentanyl or U 50, 488. Conclusions : In this experimental pain model, activation of peripheral mu or kappa opioid receptors can attenuate capsaicin-induced thermal hyperalgesia in rats. It supports the notion that peripheral antinociception can be achieved by local administration of analgesics into the injured tissue without producing central side effects...|$|E
40|$|Butorphanol and {{nalbuphine}} {{have substantial}} affinity for m and k-opioid receptor sites, yet their behavioral effects in monkeys are largely {{consistent with a}} m receptor mechanism of action. Using ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) discrimination and diuresis assays in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), {{the purpose of the}} current investigation was to characterize the in vivo k-opioid activity of these compounds through the use of an insurmount-able m-opioid receptor antagonist, clocinnamox. Alone, butor-phanol (0. 001 – 0. 032 mg/kg i. m.) failed to generalize to EKC, and pretreatment with the competitive opioid receptor antago-nist <b>quadazocine</b> (0. 1 or 0. 32 mg/kg i. m.) did not alter this generalization.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{butorphanol}} were studied in assays of antinoci-ception, respiratory depression, sedation, diuresis and reinforc-ing effects in rhesus monkeys, and opioid binding in monkey brain.

Over a similar dose range, butorphanol caused substantial respiratory depression, without an obvious plateau. Con-strained <b>quadazocine</b> apparent pA analysis on the respiratory depressant and antinociceptive effects of butorphanol yielded different values between the two assays (respiratory depres-sion pA = 6. 61; antinociception pA = 8. 26). Butorphanol (0. 1 mg/kg) antagonized the antinociceptive effects of etonitazene in 55 #{ 176 }Cwater, but caused a nonparallel leftward shift in the U 50, 488 dose-effect curve; both effects were probably due t...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} i. v. {{dynorphin}} A(1 – 17) {{and its main}} nonopioid biotransformation fragment, dynorphin A(2 – 17), were com-pared in rhesus monkeys {{with those of the}} selective k-opioid agonist, U 69, 593, in assays of operant behavior, thermal an-tinociception, and neuroendocrine function (prolactin release). Dynorphin A(1 – 17) (0. 1 – 3. 2 mg/kg i. v.) and U 69, 593 (0. 001 – 0. 032 mg/kg s. c.) decreased rates of schedule-controlled (fixed ratio 20) food-reinforced responding, whereas dynorphin A(2 – 17) (1 – 3. 2 mg/kg i. v.) was ineffective. Pretreatment studies with the opioid antagonist <b>quadazocine</b> (0. 32 mg/kg s. c.) revealed that the operant effects of dynorphin A(1 – 17) were not medi-ated by k- or m-opioid receptors.

40|$|Rationale : E- 2078 ([N -methyl-Tyr 1, N -methyl-Arg 7, d -Leu 8] {{dynorphin}} A(1 – 8) ethylamide) is a dynorphin A(1 – 8) analog with {{a reduced}} {{tendency to be}} biotransformed, {{when compared to the}} unmodified opioid peptide. E- 2078 has been found to produce κ-opioid agonist effects in vivo in rodents. Objective : In the present studies, we investigated whether systemically administered E- 2078 could produce κ-agonist effects in rhesus monkeys, in tests of antinociception, diuresis and ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) discrimination. Methods : E- 2078 (0. 32 – 18 mg/kg, SC, IM or IV) was tested in the warm water (50 °, 55 °C) tail withdrawal assay of thermal antinociception. The diuretic effects of E- 2078 (0. 056 – 1. 8 mg/kg, SC) were also compared to those of the κ-agonist, U 69, 593 (0. 01 – 0. 32 mg/kg, SC). Lastly, the effects of E- 2078 (0. 1 – 3. 2 mg/kg, SC or IV) were studied in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate EKC (0. 0056 mg/kg SC) from vehicle, in a food-reinforced operant procedure. Results : E- 2078 did not produce thermal antinociception in rhesus monkeys following SC or IM administration, up to the largest doses presently studied (i. e., 18 and 10 mg/kg, respectively). E- 2078 caused thermal antinociception by the IV route, but this effect was not apparently mediated by κ- or µ-opioid receptors, as shown by its insensitivity to <b>quadazocine</b> (1 mg/kg) pretreatment. However, SC E- 2078 caused diuresis, and this effect was blocked by <b>quadazocine</b> pretreatment, consistent with mediation by κ-opioid receptors. E- 2078 generalized in EKC-discriminating monkeys, but only after the largest dose (3. 2 mg/kg), and only following IV administration. Conclusions : The present studies suggest that systemically administered E- 2078 can produce some κ-receptor mediated effects in rhesus monkeys, but its profile of action is not identical to non-peptidic κ-agonists following all routes of administration, or across all experimental situations...|$|E
40|$|The {{antagonist}} {{effects of}} clocinnamox were evaluated against opioid agonists, acting at μ, κ and ∂-receptors, in rhesus monkeys (n = 3 – 4) responding under a fixed-ratio 30 (FR 30) schedule for food delivery. Clocinnamox (0. 032 – 0. 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently antagonized fentanyl (0. 001 – 0. 32 mg/kg) after either a 3 -h or 1 -day pretreatment; there was substantial recovery of agonist potency by 1 week after clocinnamox. Etonitazene (0. 0001 – 0. 01 mg/kg) was also antagonized by clocinnamox (0. 1 mg/kg), {{but to a}} lesser extent than fentanyl. The smaller extent of antagonism was not due to the appearance of non μ-opioid response-decreasing effects of etonitazene, since the competitive antagonist <b>quadazocine</b> (0. 1 mg/kg) shifted the etonitazene dose-effect curve in the presence of clocinnamox (0. 1 mg/kg). Clocinnamox (0. 1 – 0. 32 mg/kg) did not antagonize the rate-suppressing effects of the ∂-agonist BW 373 U 86 (0. 0. 01 - 1. 0 mg/kg) or the κ-agonist U 69, 593 (0. 001 – 0. 032 mg/kg). These results are consistent with previous in vivo and in vitro evidence that characterized clocinnamox as an insurmountable antagonist, with selectivity for μ-over κ- and δ-receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} SNC 80 and other {{structurally}} related d-opioid receptor agonists were assessed {{under conditions of}} chemi-cally induced hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli in four rhesus monkeys. The shaved tail of each monkey was exposed to warm water (38, 42, 46, and 50 °C), and the tail-withdrawal latency from each temperature was recorded. The effects of drugs on the temperature that produced a 10 -s tail-withdrawal latency (the T 10 value) were examined. Capsaicin (0. 01 – 0. 32 mg) injected into the tail of monkeys dose dependently de-creased the T 10, indicating that capsaicin increased sensitivity to thermal stimuli. A dose of 0. 1 mg of capsaicin decreased the T 10 from 48. 0 to 42. 1 °C (a 25. 9 °C change) 15 min after injec-tion. SNC 80 (1. 0 – 10. 0 mg/kg s. c.) dose dependently blocked the capsaicin-induced decrease in the T 10, and 10. 0 mg/kg SNC 80 fully blocked the effects of capsaicin. The d-selective antagonist naltrindole (0. 1 – 1. 0 mg/kg) dose dependently antag-onized the effects of SNC 80, whereas a m-selective dose of the opioid antagonist <b>quadazocine</b> (0. 1 mg/kg) did not. Two other d-selective agonists, SNC 162 (1. 0 – 10. 0 mg/kg) and SNC 243 A (1. 0 – 10. 0 mg/kg), also dose dependently blocked capsaicin-induced thermal hypersensitivity. In contrast, neither SNC 67 (10. 0 mg/kg), which is the (2) -enantiomer of SNC 80, nor the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) ketorolac (1. 0 – 10. 0 mg/kg) modified the effects of capsaicin. SNC 80 was also effective in reversing thermal hypersensitivity induced by pros-taglandin E 2 (0. 0158 mg) and Freund’s complete adjuvant (10 % concentration). These findings suggest that d-agonists have antinociceptive effects in primates under conditions of chemi-cally induced thermal hypersensitivity and might be effective under {{a broader range of}} conditions than clinically availabl...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{reflexes}} in {{the rabbit}} are suppressed tonically by endogenous opioids. The contributions made to this suppression by mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors {{have been investigated}} by studying {{the actions of a}} range of opioid antagonists and agonists on reflexes evoked by sural nerve stimulation in the ankle extensor gastrocnemius medialis (g. m.), and in the knee flexor semitendinosus (s. t.). When given at a total dose of 88. 5 micrograms kg- 1 i. v., either of the universal opioid receptor antagonists (-) -naloxone and (-) -quadazocine enhanced the g. m. response to more than 7 times the pre-drug control values, and the s. t. reflex to 1. 5 times controls. The effects of <b>quadazocine</b> were stereospecific. The selective delta antagonist ICI 174864 (3. 5 mg kg- 1 i. v. total) also augmented the g. m. reflex but only to twice pre-drug controls. The mu-agonists fentanyl (100 micrograms kg- 1) and morphine (50 mg kg- 1) suppressed both g. m. and s. t. reflex responses to less than half control levels by a naloxone-reversible mechanism. The kappa-agonists bremazocine (50 micrograms kg- 1 total), tifluadom (100 micrograms kg- 1), ethylketocyclazocine (200 micrograms kg- 1) and U 50488 H (1 mg kg- 1) potentiated the g. m. reflex and had variable effects on the s. t. response. Naloxone usually added to the facilitatory actions of these drugs. kappa-Opioid receptor agonists also caused a profound, naloxone-reversible depression of arterial blood pressure. It may be concluded that the endogenous opioid-mediated suppression of spinal reflexes in the rabbit is mediated mainly, if not exclusively, through mu-receptors. There are no known endogenous ligands which are specific for the mu-receptor, so in the present case it seems that selectivity is determined by the receptor population rather than by the ligand...|$|E
