50|$|The term {{phonation}} has {{slightly different}} meanings {{depending on the}} subfield of phonetics. Among some phoneticians, phonation is {{the process by which}} the vocal folds produce certain sounds through <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibration.</b> This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general. Phoneticians in other subfields, such as linguistic phonetics, call this process voicing, and use the term phonation to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example. Voiceless and supra-glottal phonations are included under this definition.|$|E

Active {{vibration}} control use an active force from secondary path to suppress or attenuate periodic or <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibration</b> and noises, {{one of the}} popular control algorithms is filtered-x least mean square (FxLMS) adaptive method. Based on structure of FxLMS algorithm, the paper uses Level- 2 S-fun {{to create a new}} FxLMS blocks in Matlab/Simulink and apply it on vibration active control system simulator.

40|$|Subject to a {{mechanical}} load or a voltage, a membrane of a dielectric elastomer deforms. As for the deformation mode, the dynamic performance and stability are strongly affected by how mechanical forces are applied. In the current study, {{by using the}} Euler-Lagrange equation, an analytical model is developed to characterize the dynamic performance of a homogeneously deformed viscoelastic dielectric elastomer under the conditions of equal-biaxial force, uniaxial force, and pure shear state, respectively. Numerical results are shown to describe the electromechanical deformation and stability. It is observed that the resonant frequency (where the amplitude-frequency curve peaks) has dependencies on the deformation mode, the level of mechanical load, and the applied electric field. When a dielectric elastomer membrane is subject to equal-biaxial force or pure shear state, it undergoes a nonlinear <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibration.</b> An aperiodic motion of the dielectric elastomer system is induced by the boundary condition of a uniaxial force.

Fluid excited vibrations of structures can result in unwanted impact forces {{which can lead to}} metal fatigue failures. Mathematical theories based on linear models have been used for several decades. In this research the authors explored the phenomena associated with nonlinear effects using experimental models, mathematical models and numerical computation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydrodynamic}} journal bearings-rotor {{system is}} a common machine element that is strongly nonlinear due to oil film forces. In this study, bifurcation of the response of an unbalanced bearings-rotor system with nonlinear suspension is investigated {{based on the assumption}} of an incompressible lubricant to-gether with the short bearing approximation. Theoretical bifurcation analysis of bearing center motion is carried out by means of numerical investigation, the procedure here being numerical integration. The six ma-jor parameters characterizing the theoretical model of the system are considered with nondimensional speed. Jump phenomena, subharmonic and <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the bearing center trajectory, are found in this system. It is concluded that the bearing center trajectory had undesirable nonsynchronous vibrations. Under-standing the bifurcation behavior of these parameters provides theoretical and practical ideas for controlling bearings-rotor systems and optimizing their operation.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} {{in the design of}} rotating machinery is the occurrence of undesirable vibration. In this paper, stability and bifurcation of the unbalance response of a rigid rotor supported by squeeze film damper with asymmetry in centralizing spring are investigated. The unbalanced rotor response is determined by the shooting method and the stability of these solutions is examined by using the Floquet theorem. Numerical examples are given for both symmetric (Kx=Ky) and asymmetry (Kx≠Ky) centralizing springs in x or y direction. Jump phenomenon and subharmonic and <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibrations</b> are predicted for a range of design and operating parameters such as the unbalancing (U), gravity (W), bearing (B) and spring (K). The results show that increasing the spring stiffness asymmetry parameter in y direction has no influence on the nature of system response and occurrence of bifurcation. But, examining the effect of increase in stiffness parameter in x direction leads to occurrence instability and period-doubling bifurcation in response to the system. Our findings show that this phenomena are due to the weight force in the y direction. Finally, it is shown that the unsymmetrical stiffness of squeeze film dampers in the presence of cavitation promoting the chance of undesirable nonsynchronous vibrations...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinearities in {{aircraft}} {{mechanisms are}} inevitable, {{especially in the}} control system. It is necessary to investigate the effects {{of them on the}} dynamic response and control performance of aeroelastic system. In this paper, based on the state-dependent Riccati equation method, a state feedback suboptimal control law is derived for aeroelastic response and flutter suppression of a three degree-of-freedom typical airfoil section. With the control law designed, nonlinear effects of freeplay in the control surface and time delay between the control input and actuator are investigated by numerical approach. A cubic nonlinearity in pitch degree is adopted to prevent the aeroelastic responses from divergence when the flow velocity exceeds the critical flutter speed. For the system with a freeplay, the responses of both open- and closed-loop systems are determined with Runge-Kutta algorithm in conjunction with Henon's method. This method is used to locate the switching points accurately and efficiently as the system moves from one subdomain into another. The simulation results show that the freeplay leads to a forward phase response and a slight increase of flutter speed of the closed-loop system. The effect of freeplay on the aeroelastic response decreases as the flow velocity increases. The time delay between the control input and actuator may impair control performance and cause high-frequency motion and <b>quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibration...</b>|$|E
40|$|Dry {{friction}} dampers {{are widely}} used to reduce vibration. The forced vibration response of a simplified turbine blade with {{a new kind of}} under-platform dry friction dampers is studied in this paper. The model consists of a clamped blade as two rigidly connected beams and two dampers in the form of masses which are allowed to slide along the blade platform in the horizontal direction and vibrate with the blade platform in the vertical direction. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the two dampers, and the horizontal and transverse platform vibrations are coupled by friction at the contact interfaces which is assumed to follow the classical discontinuous Coulomb’s law of friction. The vertical motion of the dampers leads to time-varying contact forces and can cause horizontal stick-slip motion between the contact surfaces. Due to the relative horizontal motion between the dampers and the blade platform, the vertical contact forces and the resultant friction forces act as moving loads. The Finite Element (FE) method and Modal Superposition (MS) method are applied to solve the dynamic response, together with an algorithm that can capture nonsmooth transitions from stick to slip and slip to stick. <b>Quasi-periodic</b> <b>vibration</b> is found even under harmonic excitation...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} numerical {{investigation of}} the coupling between the vibration of a flexible plate and the acoustic radiation is performed. The nonlinear Euler equations are {{used to describe the}} acoustic fluid while the nonlinear plate equation is used to describe the plate vibration. Linear, nonlinear, and <b>quasi-periodic</b> or chaotic <b>vibrations</b> and the resultant acoustic radiation are analyzed. We find that for the linear plate response, acoustic coupling is negligible. However, for the nonlinear and chaotic responses, acoustic coupling has a significant effect on the vibration level as the loading increases. The radiated pressure from a plate undergoing nonlinear or chaotic vibrations is found to propagate nonlinearly into the far field. However, the nonlinearity due to wave propagation is much weaker than that due to the plate vibrations. As the acoustic wave propagates into the far field, the relative difference in level between the fundamental and its harmonics and subharmonics decreases with distance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the description of}} some phenomena associated with dynamic behavior of rotors interacting with stationary components. Numerical simulations show rotor vibration spectrum rich in subharmonic, <b>quasi-periodic,</b> and chaotic <b>vibrations.</b> The nonlinear calculation techniques are applied to demonstrate the changes of the vibration patterns for different operating conditions. Some conclusions are discussed with regard to unique characteristics of rub-induced rotor response, initial conditions, as well as appropriate ranges of system parameters. Of special interest are {{the changes in the}} apparent nonlinearity of the system dynamics as rubs are induced at different rotor speeds. In particular, starting with 2 nd order sub/superharmonics, which are symptomatic of quadratic nonlinearity, progressively higher order polynomial behavior is excited, i. e., cubic, giving rise to 3 rd order sub/superharmonics. As the speed is transitioned between such apparent nonlinearities, chaotic like behavior is induced {{because of the lack of}} whole or rational tone tuning between the apparent system frequency and the external source noise. The cause of such behavior will be discussed in detail along with the results of several parametric studies...|$|R
40|$|Laminar flows {{past two}} tandem {{cylinders}} which {{are free to}} move transversely in a parallel-wall channel were studied numerically by the lattice Boltzmann method. With fixed Reynolds number Re= 100, blockage ratio,beta= 1 / 4 and structural damping xi= 0, the effect of streamwise separation between two cylinders at a range of S/D=[1. 1, 10] on the motions of cylinders and fluids was studied for both mass ratios of m*= 1 and m*= 0. 1. A variety of distinct vibration regimes involving periodic, <b>quasi-periodic</b> and non-periodic <b>vibrations</b> with corresponding flow patterns were observed. A {{detailed analysis of the}} vibration amplitudes, vibration frequencies and relative equilibrium positions for both mass ratios demonstrated that as S/D increases, the interaction of the two cylinders first enhances and then reduces. In the strong coupling regime, both cylinders oscillate periodically around the centerline of the channel with large vibration amplitudes and high vibration frequencies. By comparing with the case of an isolated cylinder, a further study indicated that the gap flow {{plays an important role in}} such a dynamic system, and the vortex cores formation behind the front cylinder causes the interaction of the cylinders decouple rapidly. Based on the present observations, such a dynamic model system can be considered as a novel type of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) and is expected to find applications in fluid mixing and heat transfer.

40|$|Considering {{the needs}} of high {{rotating}} speed and high efficiency in the modern machines, the decreasing clearance between the rotor and the stator is a necessary design. To improve the performance efficiency {{of these kinds of}} machines, the radial clearance between the rotating rotor and the stator becomes smaller and smaller. As a result, it is easier for rotor-stator rub to happen and the normal operation of machines will be affected more severely. When a rub-impact happens, the partial rub arises at first. During a complete period, the rub and impact interactions occur between the rotor and stator once or fewer times. Gradual deterioration of the partial rub will lead to the full rub and then the vibration will affect the normal operation of the machines severely. The majority of works was focused on the development of some mathematical models {{in order to make the}} rubbing phenomenon more accurately to be understood in the past few decades. Now in our work general model of a rub-impact rotor-bearing system is set up and the corresponding governing motion equations are given. The rubbing model consists of the following forces i. e., radial elastic impact and the tangential Coulomb type of friction. Through numerical calculations, rotating speeds, unbalance and stiffness values are used as control parameters to investigate their effect on the rotor-dynamic system with the help of time histories, phase plane plots, whirl orbits. Complicated motions, such as periodic, <b>quasi-periodic</b> even chaotic <b>vibrations,</b> are observed under different operating conditions. Stator flexibility effects are also studied using a modified Jeffcott rotor model. Numerical methods employed in our work are Newmark’s method and Runge-Kutta method. The Graphs that have been obtained from both methods were compared Finite Element Model of the rotor dynamic system is developed with 2 -noded Timoshenko beam elements. The rotary degrees of freedom are eliminated by static condensation. The Campbell diagram is obtained by accounting both gyroscopic effect and Viscous damping matrices. The Newmark time integration scheme is adopted again by incorporating the intermittent rubbing forces at the central node simulating the rigid disk stator interactions and we are trying to get the results, to compare with the obtained results. The thesis is organized as follows: Chapter- 1 describes introduction to rotor dynamic problem and literature survey. Chapter- 2 deals with the dynamic modeling and equations of motion of various models considered in the present work. Chapter- 3 describes the results part as solution of these equations.
