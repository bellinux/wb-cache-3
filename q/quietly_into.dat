25|$|In {{the night}} of 29 October, 52 Indonesian volunteers sailed across the Straits of Malacca in commandeered fishing vessels, and landed {{on each side of}} the western mouth of the Kesang River. Their {{objective}} was to avoid being sighted initially by Malaysian security forces and slip <b>quietly</b> <b>into</b> the swampland, where they would attempt to blend in with the populace, begin sowing the seeds of rebellion, and launch guerrilla raids against Malaysian infrastructure. However, Malaysian fishermen spotted the raiders in the process of landing, and quickly informed the police. British troops of General Terence McMeekin's 28th Commonwealth Brigade were immediately directed to the scene, where they swept the region and killed or captured all but two of the invaders, who managed to fade into the wilderness. The remainder were swiftly shipped off to internment locations. The British were assisted by Australian troops of the Royal Australian Regiment's 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Bruce McDonald, who had also received similar tip-offs and assisted in the rout of the Indonesian force.|$|E

[...] He added that the [...] "band's grooves still sound taut, emotive and world-class." [...] Adam Sweeting of The Guardian gave the album two out of five stars. In the review he stated that [...] "Riot Act isn't one thing or the other: tracks such as [...] "Ghost" [...] or [...] "Get Right" [...] gesture towards hard rock without really putting the hammer down, while a more reflective piece like [...] "All or None" [...] doesn't exploit its own possibilities." [...] Sweeting observed, [...] "On full, Pearl Jam sound like Stillwater, Cameron Crowe's fictional 1970s second-raters from his film Almost Famous." [...] Kyle Reiter of Pitchfork said that the album [...] "meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness", and stated that it [...] " [...] them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory." ...|$|E

In January 2013, {{it was revealed that}} The Oath of the Vayuputras would be released on 27 February of the same year, by Westland Publishing. Tripathi explained that {{the final version of the}} book was longer than he had expected it to be, and consisted of 53chapters, making it twice as long as the other books. During an interview with The Times of India, the author discussed some of the important scenarios being presented in the book. He explained that since Shiva is a mortal in his series, he would have a fitting epilogue in the book, with many of the loose ends of the plot finally being deciphered. Shiva would meet the chief of the Vasudevas and the Vayuputras in the hidden cities of Ujjain and Pariha. [...] "Some loose ends will be left deliberately open for the readers to interpret. As for losing someone we love? The Shiva trilogy chronicles a battle against evil. And evil does not go <b>quietly</b> <b>into</b> the night; instead, it puts up a strong fight against Good. So yes, people will die in Vayuputras," [...] he concluded.|$|E
