We propose a standard for specifying the quality of databases, which is based on the dual concepts of data sound-ness and data completeness. The relational model of data is extended by associating a quality specication with each relation instance, and by extending its algebra to calculate the quality specications of derived relation instances. This provides a method for calculating the quality of answers to arbitrary queries from the overall quality specication of the database. We show practical methods for estimating the initial <b>quality</b> <b>speci</b> cations of given databases, and we report on experiments that test the validity of our methods. Finally, we describe how quality estima-tions are being applied in the Multiplex multidatabase system to resolve cross-database inconsistencies. 1 Data Qualit...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} for extending the Cooperative Control Synthesis methodology {{to include a}} more accurate modeling of the pilot's controller dynamics. Cooperative Control Synthesis (CCS) is a methodology that addresses {{the problem of how}} to design control laws for piloted, high-order, multivariate systems and/or nonconventional dynamic con gurations in the absence of ying <b>qualities</b> <b>speci</b> cations. This is accomplished by emphasizing the parallel structure inherent in any pilot-controlled, augmented vehicle. The original CCS methodology is extended to include the modi ed optimal control model (MOCM), which is based upon the optimal control model of the human operator developed by Kleinman, Baron, and Levison in 1970. This model provides a modeling of the pilot's compensation dynamics that is more accurate than the simpli ed pilot dynamic representation currently in the CCS methodology. Inclusion of the MOCM into the CCS also enables the modeling of pilot-observation perception thresholds and pilot-observation attention allocation effects. This Extended Cooperative Control Synthesis (ECCS) allows for the direct calculation of pilot and system open- and closed-loop transfer functions in pole/zero form and is readily implemented in current software capable of analysis and design for dynamic systems. Example results based upon synthesizing an augmentation control law for an acceleration command system in a compensatory tracking task using the ECCS are compared with a similar synthesis performed by using the original CCS methodology. The ECCS is shown to provide augmentation control laws that yield more favorable, predicted closedloop ying qualities and tracking performance than those synthesized using the original CCS methodology...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpatial {{representativeness}} of a {{monitoring station}} and spatial extent of an exceedance zone {{in case of}} non-compliance with environmental objectives are notions appearing in the European legislation on ambient air <b>quality.</b> No <b>speci</b> c approach is prescribed to delimit such areas. We developed a probabilistic methodology based on a preliminary kriging estimate of atmospheric concentrations at each point of the domain. In the proposed de nition, a point is considered as belonging {{to the area of}} representativeness of a station if its concentration di ers from the station measurement by less than a given threshold. Additional criteria related to distance or environmental characteristics may also be introduced. The standard deviation of the estimation error is then used, to select the points, at a xed risk, where the di erence of concentration with respect to the station is below the threshold and to provide the probability of overshooting a limit value. Stability in time and sensitivity to the selected criteria are rst tested with NO 2 annual concentration data produced by combining surface monitoring observations and outputs from the CHIMERE chemistry transport model. On the local scale, data from passive sampling surveys and high resolution auxiliary variables are used to provide a more precise estimate of background pollution. Tra c related pollution can also be accounted for in the map with help of additional information such as distance to the road, tra c-related NOx emissions, or road tra c counts. The methodology is applied to NO 2 experimental datasets for di erent French cities to assess the spatial representativeness of stations and delimit areas of exceedance of the NO 2 annual limit value...|$|R
40|$|This work {{shows how}} a single {{compiler}} front-end and optimization suite {{may be used}} to generate high <b>quality</b> code <b>speci</b> c processors. A C language front-end is used. An initial pass of the compiler is used to instrument the program in order to collect a trace of the dynamic behavior of programs into an execution pro le used to guide later code optimization phases. Generic code optimization techniques are applied, then machine speci c optimizations are performed. Code is then generated using a machine speci c code generator, and then several more machine speci c optimizations are performed. Results gathered in generating code for the Sparc architecture are presented in this work. In spite of an incomplete suite of optimizations, the output code is of comparable overall quality to that generated by the Sun compiler. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS My Mom and Dad's encouragement and support enabled me to achieve asmuch asIhave. I thank Professor Janek Patel with whom I spoke at great length; the conversations I had with him helped me to choose the University of Illinois. I thank Professor Wen-Mei Hwu; the thesis work I have done was interesting and appropriately challenging. As a result, I was able to change careers and do exciting and challenging work on production quality compilers. I thank all my friends in the Center for Reliable and High-performance Computing and in the Computer Science Department at the University. The time we spentworking, sharing information and relaxing together allowed me to remain sane and fairly relaxed at a time that would have otherwise been extremely stressful.

40|$|The article {{presents}} data on production volumes of sack paper, which {{is produced by}} the world's leading companies. The main raw material for the manufacture of this product is unbleached softwood sulphate pulp having a high cost. In the present research work the fiber composition effect upon sack paper properties was investigated. This {{makes it possible to}} determine the optimal mass ratio of unbleached kraft primary fibers (kraft pulp) and seco ndary fibers (waste paper) for the manufacture of sack paper. Doptimal continuous design (Kono, 1962) for the estimating second order polynomial full models was used as the experiment design for the optimization of the pulp fiber composition. Considering the restrictions on the <b>quality</b> parameters <b>speci</b> fied in GOST 2228 – 81 “Sack paper. Specifications” the analysis of the obtained experimental data using the search function in Mi crosoft Excel 2007 gave the following results on the sack paper fiber composition: kraft pulp content (X 1) – 43. 30 % of a. d. s.; polyacrylonitrile fibers content (X 2) – 0. 15 % of a. d. s.; waste paper content – 56. 55 % of a. d. s. During the experiment it was found that an increase of polyacrylonitrile fibers content from 0. 05 to 0. 20 % in the kraft pulp structure leads to the increase of sack paper tensile strength by 25 – 28 % (breaking length increased from 5, 700 to 7, 300 m). But paper whiteness at the same time decreased by 9. 7 %. This made possible to reduce the content of expensive kraft pulp in the composition of sack paper by 27 % (taking into account the 30, 000 t/year production of sack pa per, saving of kraft pulp can reach 8, 000 t/year) ...|$|R
