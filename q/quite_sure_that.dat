25|$|The {{size of the}} U.S. {{military}} {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century, unprecedented in peacetime, caused concern in some circles, primarily as to the potential effect of maintaining such a large force in a democratic society. Some predicted disaster and were concerned with the growing militarization of American society. These writers were <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> a distinctly military culture was inherently dangerous to a non-militaristic liberal society. Others warned that the ascendancy of the military establishment would fundamentally change American foreign policy and would weaken the intellectual fabric of the country. However, most of the arguments were less apocalyptic and settled along two tracks. The two tracks are highlighted, respectively, by Samuel P. Huntington's Soldier and the State and Morris Janowitz's The Professional Soldier.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E
500|$|... "Indian Camp" [...] is {{constructed}} in three parts: the first places Nick {{and his father}} on a dark lake; the second {{takes place in the}} squalid and cramped cabin amid terrifying action; and the third shows Nick and his father back on the lake—bathed in sunlight. Hemingway's use of counterpoint is evident when, for example, at the end, Nick trails his hand in lake water that [...] "felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning". Paul Strong believes the deleted section may have provided context and additional counterpoint to the plot, with Nick's aloneness in the [...] "stillness of the night" [...] juxtaposed against the middle scene, crowded with people. Paul Smith writes that by cutting the piece, Hemingway focuses on the story's central point: the life and death initiation rituals, familiar to the residents of the Indian camp but alien to young Nick. Unable to express his feelings fully, in the end, Nick trails his hand in the water and [...] "felt <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he would never die".|$|E

500|$|Fonda made radio {{broadcasts}} on Hanoi Radio throughout her two-week tour, commenting on her visits to villages, hospitals, schools, and factories damaged {{in the war}} and denouncing U.S. military policy in Vietnam. Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam, and her {{radio broadcasts}}. During {{the course of her}} visit, Fonda visited American prisoners of war (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When stories of torture of returning POWs were later being publicized by the Nixon administration, Fonda called the returning POWs [...] "hypocrites and liars and pawns", adding about the prisoners she visited, [...] "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed." [...] In addition, Fonda told The New York Times in 1973, [...] "I'm <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> there were incidents of torture... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie." [...] Her visits to the POW camp led to persistent and exaggerated rumors which were repeated widely in the press and continued to circulate on the Internet decades later. Fonda, as well as the named POWs, have personally denied the rumors, and subsequent interviews with the POWs showed these rumored allegations to be false as the persons named had never met Fonda.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{had been}} asked to become honorary {{director}} of a prospective Royal Hibernian General Railroad Company but as he wrote to Lord Grey on 20 January 1825: [...] "...my answer has been that whatever I could do to prevent the establishment of such a company, I would do—think of placing at the mercy of a set of London capitalists all the landed property of Ireland. ... traffickers in money—a very useful class, I grant—but are we <b>quite</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> setting afloat such projects, putting them in newspapers, may not be converted into swindling means?" ...|$|E

"When Jeanette MacDonald {{approached}} me for coaching lessons", wrote Lehmann, [...] "I was really curious how a glamorous movie star, certainly spoiled by the adoration of a limitless world, {{would be able}} to devote herself to another, a higher level of art. I had the surprise of my life. There couldn’t have been a more diligent, a more serious, a more pliable person than Jeanette. The lessons which I had started with a kind of suspicious curiosity, turned out to be sheer delight for me. She studied Marguerite with me—and lieder. These were the ones which astounded me most. I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Jeanette would have developed into a serious and successful lieder singer if time would have allowed it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The UN {{resolution}} {{does not}} specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan. Lord Caradon {{said that the}} parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. [...] "Nevertheless so important {{is the future of}} Jerusalem that it might be argued that we should have specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution. It is easy to say that now, but I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if we had attempted to raise or settle the question of Jerusalem as a separate issue at that time our task in attempting to find a unanimous decision would have been far greater if not impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Archbishop of Munster, August von Galen, had {{rallied to}} the {{nationalist}} cause at {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939, but by 1941, his leadership of Catholic opposition to Nazi euthanasia had led to [...] "the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy {{since the beginning of}} the Third Reich." [...] The speeches angered Hitler. In a 1942 Table Talk he said: [...] "The fact that I remain silent in public over Church affairs is not in the least misunderstood by the sly foxes of the Catholic Church, and I am <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> a man like Bishop von Galen knows full well that after the war I shall extract retribution to the last farthing". Hitler wanted to have Galen removed, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The regional Nazi leader, and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end.|$|E
2500|$|The {{selection}} of Williamsport as county seat {{was a major}} controversy in {{the early history of}} Lycoming County. It involved a bitter rivalry between an old frontier town and an upstart town that was built on a swamp. The first commissioners and officers of Lycoming County had their first offices and held their first court in Jaysburg (now part of the Newberry section of Williamsport). Jaysburg was on the western side of Lycoming Creek on a high piece of land. The land to the east of Lycoming Creek was known as [...] "Deer Park" [...] and was quite swampy. Jaysburg was at the time the only sizeable village west of Muncy. Although Muncy was and still is in Lycoming County it was not considered as an option for county seathood, possibly due to its proximity to the southern and eastern borders of the county. Jaysburg's buildings were sufficient enough to serve as the first courthouse and jail in the history of Lycoming County. It seemed to be the most logical place for establishing a county seat and many of its residents were <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> their town would indeed be the county seat. This was not to be. The county seat was awarded to a new community across the creek and Jaysburg soon disappeared from the map and its land was absorbed by the new city of Williamsport.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2008 BBC Radio 4 made a {{programme}} titled The Human Button, providing {{new information}} on {{the manner in which}} the United Kingdom could launch its nuclear weapons, particularly relating to safeguards against a rogue launch. [...] Former Chief of the Defence Staff (most senior officer of all British armed forces) and Chief of the General Staff (most senior officer in the British Army), General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank, explained that the highest level of safeguard was against a prime minister ordering a launch without due cause: [...] Lord Guthrie stated that the constitutional structure of the United Kingdom provided some protection against such an occurrence, as while the Prime Minister is the chief executive and so practically commands the armed services, the formal commander-in-chief is the Monarch (to whom they swear allegiance to and indeed, is called the [...] "Royal" [...] Navy/Air Force), to whom the chief of the defence staff could appeal: [...] "the chief of the defence staff, if he really did think the prime minister had gone mad, would make <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> that order was not obeyed... You have to remember that actually prime ministers give direction, they tell the chief of the defence staff what they want, but it's not prime ministers who actually tell a sailor to press a button in the middle of the Atlantic. [...] The armed forces are loyal, and we live in a democracy, but actually their ultimate authority is the Queen." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 1820 Lord Grey {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam, {{asking him to}} support {{parliamentary}} reform: [...] "Your known opinions bear no inconsiderable part in the difficulty which I feel on this subject. Do you still feel it quite impossible to admit any modification of them?" [...] Fitzwilliam replied on 10 December [...] "that hitherto the parliamentary reform has never been placed before me {{in a manner that}} has in the least degree weakened my objection, or lessened my apprehension of the extreme danger, that would in my opinion inevitably attend its admission". The reformers themselves could not agree on a specific reform programme, constitutional perfection would never be seen to have been reached so there would be endless reform, and that the present system was beneficial: [...] "Are we <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the theoretic systems will be better for the purpose of good and free government, than the existing, undefined, indescribable mode of election, loose and various as it is?" [...] On 12 February 1821 Fitzwilliam wrote to Wood that reform was [...] "a dangerous experiment—certain destruction in the hands of vain and presumptuous fabricators of constitutions". On 17 February he again wrote to Wood: [...] "I feel the constitution is on the wane, its spirit being gone, it cannot last—whether despotism or anarchy will be the first upshot I know not, but if the constitution is not now maintained in its true spirit both will ensue".|$|E
