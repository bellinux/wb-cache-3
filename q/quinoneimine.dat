Although formation of protein-reactive acylating metabolites by phase II metabolism has been well-studied and proposed to be the cause of these toxic side effects, the oxidative bioactivation of MFA has not yet been competely characterized. In the present study, the oxidative bioactivation of MFA was studied using human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human P 450 enzymes. In addition to the major metabolite 3 ′-OH-methyl-MFA, resulting from the benzylic hydroxylation by CYP 2 C 9, 4 ′-hydroxy-MFA and 5 -hydroxy-MFA were identified as metabolites resulting from oxidative metabolism of both aromatic rings of MFA. In the presence of GSH, three GSH conjugates were formed that appeared to result from GSH conjugation of the two <b>quinoneimines</b> formed by further oxidation of 4 ′-hydroxy-MFA and 5 -hydroxy-MFA. The major GSH conjugate was identified as 4 ′-OH- 5 ′-glutathionyl-MFA and was formed at the highest activity by CYP 1 A 2 {{and to a lesser extent}} by CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 3 A 4. Two minor GSH conjugates resulted from secondary oxidation of 5 -hydroxy-MFA and were formed at the highest activity by CYP 1 A 2 and to a lesser extent by CYP 3 A 4. Additionally, the ability of seven human glutathione S-transferases (hGSTs) to catalyze the GSH conjugation of the <b>quinoneimines</b> formed by P 450 s was also investigated.

Several commonly used drugs implicated in adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are known to form reactive QI metabolites upon bioactivation by P 450, such as acetaminophen (APAP), diclofenac (DF), and mefenamic acid (MFA). In the present study, the reductive activity of human NQO 1 toward the QI metabolites derived from APAP and hydroxy-metabolites of DF and MFA was studied, using purified bacterial P 450 BM 3 (CYP 102 A 1) mutant M 11 as a bioactivation system. The NQO 1 -catalyzed reduction of the QI metabolites was quantified relative to spontaneous glutathione (GSH) conjugation. Addition of NQO 1 to the incubations strongly reduced the formation of all corresponding GSH conjugates, and this activity could be prevented by dicoumarol, a selective NQO 1 inhibitor. The GSH conjugation was strongly increased by adding human GSTP 1 - 1 {{in a wide range of}} GSH concentrations. Still, NQO 1 could effectively compete with the GST catalyzed GSH conjugation by reducing the QIs. In conclusion, we identified the QI metabolites of the 4 '- and 5 -hydroxy-metabolites of DF and MFA as novel substrates for human NQO 1. NQO 1 -mediated reduction proves to be an effective pathway to detoxify these QI metabolites in addition to GSH conjugation.

40|$|A novel electroanalytical {{methodology}} for the sensing of anticarcinogenic catechin compounds epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and epigallocatechin (EGC) is presented. The protocol {{is based on}} the electrochemical oxidation of aminophenol in aqueous solutions, where the <b>quinoneimine</b> oxidation product chemically reacts with the EGCG or EGC compounds resulting in consumption of <b>quinoneimine</b> and consequently results in a reduction in the magnitude of the <b>quinoneimine</b> reduction wave, which is found to provide an analytical signal from which to indirectly detect EGCG and/or EGC. The voltammetric response of 2, 6 -dichloro-p-aminophenol (AP) at an edge plane pyrolytic graphite electrode in a pH 10 buffer solution to additions of EGCG is examined and AP is shown to be effective for the above analytical procedure. Basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes are then modified with 4 -amino- 2, 6 -diphenylphenol (phenyl-AP) where it is demonstrated that determination can proceed using the immobilized phenyl-AP in the form of surface deposited microcrystals, obviating the need for dissolving the molecules within the solution phase.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} useful model system in which to study the genetic basis of regulation of fat storage. One {{of the most frequently}} used methods for evaluating the levels of stored fat (triglycerides) in flies is a coupled colorimetric assay available as a kit from several manufacturers. This is an aqueous-based enzymatic assay that is normally used for measurement of mammalian serum triglycerides, which are present in soluble lipoprotein complexes. In this short communication, we show that coupled colorimetric assay kits cannot accurately measure stored triglycerides in Drosophila. First, they fail to give accurate readings when tested on insoluble triglyceride mixtures with compositions like that of stored fat, or on fat extracted from flies with organic solvents. This is probably due to an inability of the lipase used in the kits to efficiently cleave off the glycerol head group from fat molecules in insoluble samples. Second, the measured final products of the kits are <b>quinoneimines,</b> which absorb visible light in the same wavelength range as Drosophila eye pigments. Thus, when extracts from crushed flies are assayed, much of the measured signal is actually due to eye pigments. Finally, the lipoprotein lipases used in colorimetric assays also cleave non-fat glycerides. The glycerol backbones liberated from all classes of glycerides are measured through the remaining reactions in the assay. As a consequence, when these assay kits are used to evaluate tissue extracts, the observed signal actually represents the amount of free glycerols together with all types of glycerides. For these reasons, findings obtained through use of coupled colorimetric assays on Drosophil...|$|R
40|$|The earlier {{stage of}} the {{polymerization}} reaction of polyaniline has been studied employing in situ spectroelectro-chemical techniques. The r sults indicate that the nitrene cation {{appears to be a}} key intermediate species, which leads to all three possible dimers including a head-to-tail dimer (N-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine), a tail-to-tail dimer (benzidine), and a head-to-head dimer (hydrazobenzene). The oxidized forms of these dimers were all shown to be capable of growing polyaniline in the presence of aniline, even though aniline was not oxidized. The cyclic voltammetric peaks observed ur-ing the PA synthesis in the middle potential regions were shown to arise from the redox reactions of these dimers, oligo-mers, and degradation products of polyaniline including <b>quinoneimines</b> and p-benzoquinone. Polyaniline (PA) has received a great deal of interest as one of the conductive polymers due to its straightforward methods of preparation and the stability of its conductive form in air (1 - 18). PA can be prepared chemically (2, 4) or electrochemically (1, 3, 7 - 18) in aqueous or nonaqueous media. Only those prepared in acidic aqueous media have a conductive form. Its applications as energy storage media (2 - 4) and as electrochromic devices (10, 11) have been discussed. Despite much work on PA preparation methods and its various properties, its growth mechanisms in the earlier phase of the polymerization reaction still remains unclear. Recently, Stilwell and Park have reported the autocataly-tic nature of the polymerization reaction and its related ki-netic data (16). From the extensive studies, a conclusion is reached that the PA growth reaction competes with degra-dation reaction paths (16, 19). The rate of autocatalytic re-action has also been determined employing normal pulse voltammetric techniques (18). In the early studies by Mohilner et al.

40|$|Vertebrates {{possess a}} complex alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (ADH) system composed of multiple molecular forms, which are currently classified into seven classes {{according to their}} structural properties. ADHs are dimeric zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes/ketones using NAD+/NADH as electron acceptor and donor, respectively. The classes have broad but only partially overlapping substrate repertoires. This thesis mainly deals with mechanistic aspects of ADH function. The main {{focus is on the}} catalytic properties and possible physiological functions of ADH 2. Structural studies of the native enzyme and of mutated forms establish the "functional window" in which ADH 2 operates, and give in addition some general insights into dehydrogenase catalysis, The tissue distribution of the five known human classes of ADH was determined by assessing rnRNA expression in 23 adult and four fetal tissues. The expression patterns were distinctly different. ADH 1 and ADH 3 were widely distributed while ADH 2 and ADH 5 were concentrated in the liver and ADH 4 was concentrated in the stomach. ADH 5 was predominantly found as a fetal form in the liver. These results suggest that there are several possible locations for ethanol metabolism in addition to the liver. Human ADH 1 and ADH 2, but not ADH 3, function as aldehyde dehydrogenases. The reaction proceeds by a ping-pong mechanism with aldehyde being both oxidized and reduced, which results in equimolar concentrations of the two products, alcohol and carboxylic acid. ADH 1 C was the most efficient isozyme in aldehyde oxidation. As a general rule, alcohols are preferred substrates even for the ADH 1 C-NAD+ complex, although in some cases aldehydes can be equally good. This is shown by experiments with the serotonin metabolite 5 -hydroxy-indole- 3 -acetaldehyde. ADH 2 variants from mouse and rabbit were cloned and characterized together with the previously cloned variants from human and rat. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ADH 2 is a remarkable divergent enzyme, although rat and mouse ADH 2 were unexpectedly similar. These two rodent ADH 2 s had several unique properties, and, most importantly, their catalytic efficiency for various alcohols was two to three orders of magnitude lower than other ADHs. In rabbit liver, two isoforms of ADH 2 were found, one of which was a low activity variant with no activity for long aliphatic alcohols. The variation in activity profile is not compatible with a general metabolic function, but rather implies that detoxification mechanisms are species-specific. The mouse ADH 2 structure has a novel topology of the substrate-binding pocket, which provides the structural basis for understanding the unique substrate and inhibitor repertoire of this enzyme. The two subunits of the dimer have different semi-opened interdomain conformations. Both conformations resemble that of ADH 3, and are half way between the opened apo- and the closed holo-complex of ADH 1. The activity of the mouse ADH 2 was restored by replacing proline 47 with histidine. The structure of this high activity mutant emphasizes the importance of a short hydride transfer distance for efficient catalysis, and provides further evidence that formation of an alcoholate intermediate is crucial for catalysis. The reduction of p-benzoquinone is catalyzed fairly efficiently by all species variants of ADH 2, and this activity is not affected by the Pro 47 His mutation. However, it is expected that only small quinones and <b>quinoneimines</b> will be substrates since the substrate pocket only allows larger substituents in the para-position. It is concluded that the ADH fold is suitable for generation of functional diversity, both in terms of isoenzyme divergence and mechanistic multiplicity...|$|R

The X-ray crystal structure of the model compound from anthraquinone had indicated that the ring system is not planar due to steric hindrance between the peri-hydrogen of anthraquinone and the ortho-hydrogen of the N-phenyl ring. The X-ray crystal structure of the model compound prepared from 4, 8 -dehydrobenzo-[1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b']dithiophene- 4, 8 -dione reveals the quinone moiety to be planar. This indicates that the incorporation of a benzoquinone moiety with two fused thiophene rings in the model compound relieved the steric hindrance observed in the anthraquinone model compound.

On the basis of the results of in vitro testing, isoquine (ISQ 1 (3 a)) (IC 50 = 6. 01 nM +/- 8. 0 versus K 1 strain), the direct isomer of amodiaquine, was selected for in vivo antimalarial assessment.

It was suggested that formation of a reactive <b>quinoneimine</b> metabolite was involved in mechanism-based inactivation (MBI) and/or hepatotoxicity. We investigated the mechanism of MBI of P 450 3 A 4 by lapatinib. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of P 450 3 A 4 after incubation with lapatinib did not show any peak corresponding to irreversible modifications. The enzymatic activity inactivated by lapatinib was completely restored by the addition of potassium ferricyanide. These results indicate that the mechanism of MBI by lapatinib is quasi-irreversible and mediated via metabolic intermediate complex (MI complex) formation. This finding was verified by the increase in a signature Soret absorbance at approximately 455 nm. Two amine oxidation products of the metabolism of lapatinib by P 450 3 A 4 were characterized: N-hydroxy lapatinib (M 3) and the oxime form of N-dealkylated lapatinib (M 2), suggesting that a nitroso or another related intermediate generated from M 3 is involved in MI complex formation. In contrast, P 450 3 A 5 was much less susceptible to MBI by lapatinib via MI complex formation than P 450 3 A 4. In addition, P 450 3 A 5 had a significantly lower ability than 3 A 4 to generate M 3, consistent with N-hydroxylation as the initial step in the pathway to MI complex formation. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the primary mechanism for MBI of P 450 3 A 4 by lapatinib is not irreversible modification by the <b>quinoneimine</b> metabolite, but quasi-irreversible MI complex formation mediated via oxidation of the secondary amine group of lapatinib...|$|E

Addition of pooled human liver cytosol and recombinant hGSTA 1 - 1, hGSTM 1 - 1, and hGSTP 1 - 1 to incubations of diclofenac with human liver microsomes or purified CYP 102 A 1 M 11 L 437 N as a model system significantly increased total GSH-conjugation.

A sample was synthesised starting from a 50 : 50 mixture of U- 13 C aniline and 15 N-labelled aniline; two-dimensional 13 C refocused INADEQUATE, 15 N- 13 C Double CP, 15 N PDSD and 1 H- 13 C/ 15 N refocused INEPT MAS NMR spectra revealed the presence of <b>quinoneimine</b> structural units. Structural models that are consistent with the connectivities revealed by the 13 C refocused INADEQUATE and 15 N- 13 C Double CP spectra are proposed. GIPAW chemical shift calculations are performed for model structures based on the proposed oligomeric structures; noting that the model structures do not take into account intermolecular hydrogen bonding and CH-pi interactions, agreement and discrepancy to experiment are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of ortho-aminophenol (oAP) by cyclic voltammetry (CV), on platinum substrates in neutral solution, produces a polymeric film (PoAP) that grows to a limiting thickness of about 10 nm. The insulating film has potential {{use as a}} bioimmobilizing substrate, with its specificity depending on the orientation of its molecular chains. Prior investigations suggest that the film consists of alternating <b>quinoneimine</b> and oAP units, progressively filling all the platinum sites during the electrosynthesis. This work concerns {{the evaluation of the}} growth orientation of PoAP chains, which until now was deduced only from indirect evidence. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used in situ with an electrochemical cell so that PoAP deposition on a specific area can be observed, thus avoiding any surface reorganization during ex situ transport. In parallel with microscopy, XPS experiments have been performed using cluster ion beams to profile this film, which is exceptionally thin, without damage while retaining molecular information...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} on o-aminophenol (oAP) electropolymerization by {{cyclic voltammetry}} (CV), onto platinum, {{in aqueous solution}} (phosphate buffer) at neutral pH, have shown the reproducible formation of an insulating film of inherent adherence and thinness, poly(o-aminophenol) (PoAP). The applicability of this produced film as a permselective membrane for biosensors was demonstrated, {{as well as the}} influence of the platinum surface state on its self-limited growth and morphology. Based on these findings, we have continued our investigation on insulating PoAP by combining compositional (XPS) and electrochemical (CV) analyses. To evaluate the finite film on its compositional homogeneity and stability, we have highlighted, in turn, different analyzed depths by angle-resolved XPS, repeated experiments and performed stability test in ultra-high vacuum. This investigation, combined with an accurate curve-fitting procedure, has allowed the estimation of the PoAP thickness and the assignment of chemical states for determining its polymerization sequence. We show that PoAP thickness is about 7 nm; its repeat formula comprises alternating <b>quinoneimine</b> and oAP units, including approximately one water molecule, and the polymer chains are terminated with carbonyl-type groups...|$|E

40|$|Azoreductases are flavoenzymes {{that have}} been characterised {{in a range of}} prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Bacterial azoreductases are {{associated}} with the activation of two classes of drug, azo drugs for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and nitrofuran antibiotics. The mechanism of reduction of azo compounds is presented that requires tautomerisation of the azo compound to a <b>quinoneimine</b> and provides a unifying mechanism for the reduction of azo and quinone substrates by azoreductase. The importance of further work in characterisation of azoreductases from enteric bacteria is highlighted to aid in the development of novel drugs for the treatment of colon related disorders. Human azoreductases are known to {{play a crucial role in}} the metabolism of a number of quinone containing cancer chemotherapeutic drugs. The mechanism of hydride transfer to quinones, which is shared not only between eukaryotic and prokaryotic azoreductases but the wider family of NAD(P) H quinone oxidoreductases, is outlined. The importance of common SNPs in human azoreductases is described not only in cancer prognosis but also due to their effects on the efficacy of quinone drug based cancer chemotherapeutic regimens. This highlights the need to screen patients for azoreductase SNPs ahead of treatment with these regimens...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{integrated}} {{approach is developed}} for the formation, identification and biological characterization of electrochemical conversion products of p 38 α mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. This work demonstrates the hyphenation of an electrochemical reaction cell with a continuous-flow bioaffinity assay and parallel LC-HR-MS. Competition of the formed products with a tracer (SKF- 86002) that shows fluorescence enhancement in the orthosteric binding site of the p 38 α kinase is the readout for bioaffinity. Parallel HR-MSn experiments provided information on the identity of binders and non-binders. Finally, the data produced with this on-line system were compared to electrochemical conversion products generated off-line. The electrochemical conversion of 1 -{ 6 -chloro- 5 -[(2 R, 5 S) - 4 -(4 -fluorobenzyl) - 2, 5 -dimethylpiperazine- 1 -carbonyl]- 3 aH-indol- 3 -yl}- 2 -morpholinoethane- 1, 2 -dione resulted in eight products, three of which showed bioaffinity in the continuous-flow p 38 α bioaffinity assay used. Electrochemical conversion of BIRB 796 resulted, amongst others, {{in the formation of}} the reactive <b>quinoneimine</b> structure and its corresponding hydroquinone. Both products were detected in the p 38 α bioaffinity assay, which indicates binding to the p 38 α kinase...|$|E

The methods {{are based on}} the oxidn. of GNC with a measured excess of cerium(IV) sulfate in acid medium followed by detn. of the unreacted oxidant by 2 different reaction schemes. In titrimetry, the unreacted oxidant was detd. by back titrn. with ferrous ammonium sulfate (FAS) in sulfuric acid medium and spectrophotometry involves the reaction of residual cerium(IV) with p-DMAB to form brownish-colored p-dimethylamino <b>quinoneimine</b> whose absorbance was measured at 460 nm. In both methods, the amt. of cerium(IV) sulfate reacted corresponds to GNC concn. Titrimetry is applicable over 3 - 10 mg range where as, in spectrophotometry, the calibration graph is linear over the range of 2 - 10 Î¼g mL- 1 and the calcd. molar absorptivity value is 1. 960 Ã— 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1. The validity of the proposed methods was tested by analyzing pure and dosage forms contg. GNC.

40|$|Bazedoxifene is a {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) {{that has been}} developed for use in post-menopausal osteoporosis. However, it contains a potentially toxic 5 -hydroxy- 3 -methylindole moiety. Previous studies on the 5 -hydroxyindole and the 3 -alkylindole-containing drugs indometacine, zafirlukast and MK- 0524 structural analogs have shown that they are bioactivated by cytochrome P 450 s through a dehydrogenation process to form <b>quinoneimine</b> or 3 -methyleneindolenine electrophilic species. In the present study, bazedoxifene was synthesized and then evaluated, together with raloxifene and 2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -methyl- 1 H-indol- 5 -ol (13), a 3 -methyl- 5 -hydroxyindole-based structural fragment of bazedoxifene, {{for its ability to}} form reactive electrophilic species when incubated with human liver microsomes (HLM) or recombinant CYP isozymes. We showed that bazedoxifene was bioactivated only in trace amounts with recombinant CYP isozymes. In contrast, the N-dealkylated fragment of bazedoxifene (2 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) - 3 -methyl- 1 H-indol- 5 -ol) was bioactivated in considerable amounts to an electrophilic intermediate, which was trapped with glutathione and identified by LC-MS/MS. This suggests that bazedoxifene would require initial N-dealkylation, which could subsequently lead to the formation of the reactive intermediate. However, such an N-dealkylated metabolite of bazedoxifene was not detected after the incubation of bazedoxifene in HLM or recombinant CYP isozymes...|$|E
40|$|A silicon chip-based {{electric}} detector {{coupled to}} bead-based sandwich hybridization (BBSH) {{is presented as}} an approach to perform rapid analysis of specific nucleic acids. A microfluidic platform incorporating paramagnetic beads with immobilized capture probes {{is used for the}} biorecognition steps. The protocol involves simultaneous sandwich hybridization of a single-stranded nucleic acid target with the capture probe on the beads and with a detection probe in the reaction solution, followed by enzyme labeling of the detection probe, enzymatic reaction, and finally, potentiometric measurement of the enzyme product at the chip surface. Anti-DIG–alkaline phosphatase conjugate was used for the enzyme labeling of the DIG-labeled detection probe. p-Aminophenol phosphate (pAPP) was used as a substrate. The enzyme reaction product, p-aminophenol (pAP), is oxidized at the anode of the chip to <b>quinoneimine</b> that is reduced back to pAP at the cathode. The cycling oxidation and reduction of these compounds result in a current producing a characteristic signal that can be related to the concentration of the analyte. The performance of the different steps in the assay was characterized using in vitro synthesized RNA oligonucleotides and then the instrument was used for analysis of 16 S rRNA in Escherichia coli extract. The assay time depends on the sensitivity required. Artificial RNA target and 16 S rRNA, in amounts ranging from 1011 to 1010 molecules, were assayed within 25 min and 4 h, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Previous XPS {{investigations}} of insulating poly(o-aminophenol) (PoAP), electrosynthesized by cyclic voltammetry on Pt substrates, revealed {{the formation of}} a thin film of about 7 [*]nm of thickness, firmly adherent onto the electrode surface and stable even under Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) conditions. A constant repeat formula made of alternating <b>quinoneimine</b> and monomer units was derived with polymer chains terminating as carbonyl-type groups. Based on these findings, we have continued our investigation on insulating PoAP by employing time-of-flight SIMS whose superior surface sensitivity is well-known. The aim was to corroborate the polymer structure with particular reference to the top surface layers in view of possible bio-applications and to understand the possible way of interaction with the underlying platinum electrode surface. In order to do this, we analyzed PoAP films grown at different levels of the electrochemical synthesis (1, 5, and 20 scan cycles) and the platinum substrate itself. The individuation of the main characteristic fragments and the behavior of their intensity by varying the stage of the electropolymerization allowed to confirm the polymer structure and the presence of terminating carbonyl groups. Remarkably, from the analysis of the PoAP/Pt interface at the early stage of the polymer formation, it was possible to discern that polymer chains tend to interact with the electrode surface preferentially by the nitrogen atom of the oxidized monomers.

40|$|Toxic oil {{syndrome}} (TOS) was {{a massive}} food-borne intoxication that occurred in Spain in 1981. Epidemiological studies imputed 3 -(N-phenylamino) propane- 1, 2 -diol (PAP) derivatives as the toxic agents. The in vitro bioactivation of PAP by rat and human liver microsomes was studied. In both cases, 3 -[N-(4 ′-hydroxyphenyl) amino]propane- 1, 2 -diol (1) was detected as the main metabolite. Inhibition studies with pooled human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of P 450 -specific inhibitors suggest that 2 C 8 and 2 E 1 are the main enzymes involved in PAP bioactivation, followed by 3 A 4 / 5, 1 A 1 / 2, and 2 C 9. Incubations of PAP with 10 different recombinant P 450 enzymes showed that 2 C 8, 2 C 9, 2 C 18, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 catalyzed PAP 4 ′-hydroxylation. Incubations of phenol 1 with rat and human liver microsomes {{in the presence of}} GSH resulted in the formation of a glutathione conjugate of a <b>quinoneimine</b> metabolite derived from 1. In rat liver microsomes, P 450 enzymes {{play a key role in}} the bioactivation of 1, whereas in human liver microsomes, autoxidation appears to be the major mechanism. The implications of these results for toxic oil syndrome are discussed. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E
