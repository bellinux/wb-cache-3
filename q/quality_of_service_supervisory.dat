40|$|Designing an {{optimised}} telemetry {{control system}} {{will improve the}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for <b>Supervisory</b> Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems implemented by CSE-W. Arthur Fisher and enable system expansion thus minimising revenue for their future system designs. The telemetry control system ensures {{a high degree of}} data reliability and integrity to meet SCADA operational requirements. This thesis presents the design and development of an optimised telemetry control system using Kingfisher Remote Terminal Units (RTU’s) with Kingfisher Series 2 protocol. To determine the system response for data transmission over the bandwidth, quantitative research methods were undertaken to evaluate communication blocks within the Kingfisher protocol. There are usually different techniques used to collect data from remote stations. The Kingfisher S 2 protocol implements two techniques namely “Exception Reporting” and the “Polling” technique for data acquisition. The polling technique was the most efficient in terms of bandwidth utilization for transferring data therefore the system was designed using a pure polling system approach. It also enabled the communication links for remote stations to be monitored and enabled a deterministic system design approach to be implemented. Research focused on polling system optimization whereby efficient polling frequencies were calculated based on theory presented by (O. J. Boxma, Levy, & Weststrate, 1991). The aim was to efficiently allocate the limited bandwidth resource to a number of remote stations thus optimising the system performance. The proposed theory was implemented for system optimisation. It enables efficient polling frequencies to be calculated for a polling cycle hence optimising the bandwidth utilisation and eliminating fairness problems for the medium access control. Bandwidth optimisation enables system expansion thus reducing the networks need for additional resources. A pure polling telemetry communication system was implemented in this design using point to multipoint network topology over half duplex radio channel. Empirical data modelling enabled the design <b>of</b> the <b>service</b> duration period to allow for time sharing between the remote stations to share the bandwidth. The bandwidth was designed to share real time data and event log for SCADA systems monitoring and control. Queuing analysis was performed to establish system parameters and enable system optimisation. From the literature review the implemented design methodology uses the “mean delay approximation” method which was used to calculate efficient visit frequencies and enabled the optimisation of the bandwidth to the remote stations based on the workload of each remote site. The software for the telemetry control system was developed and tested using ladder logic. The results prove that the bandwidth utilisation can be efficiently controlled thus optimising the telemetry control system. The implemented design improves the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for the SCADA system by providing regular real time system status poll requests for control purposes and was given the highest priority for medium access. It also performs a polling of individual sites according to the “mean delay approximation method” to efficiently allocate bandwidth amongst the remote stations depending on their workload thus optimising the system. The system was designed to be responsive to high priority event log data thus enabling system flexibility...|$|R

40|$|End {{users and}} service {{customers}} today want to perform <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation for multimedia services and distributed applications. In this undertaking, they need assistance and appropriate procedures and tools. Unfortunately, today's <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> frameworks and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> management {{products on the}} market do not help. This thesis fills the gap. It argues {{that it is possible to}} find a common simple <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation procedure for end users and that a corresponding evaluation process can be automated. This thesis proposes a new <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation framework that is suited to end user interests and needs, that is application-oriented and networkindependent, that is open and extensible, and that has the potential to complement today's <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> frameworks. It encompasses: 1. A new 5 -step <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation procedure Its purpose is to identify those few quality characteristics that are decision-relevant and that have a major influence on service quality as perceived by an end user. In a first step, all quality characteristics are identified from related international standards or specifications ("identification"). Those that are essential and decision-relevant for end user perception are chosen next ("rating"). They have to be selected for evaluation ('selection') and quantified ("quantification") before simple, objective, and cost-effective evaluation methods can be used ("evaluation") in the last step. 2. A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation architecture <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation has to be automated to be successful and to provide usable results. An appropriate architecture involving end users, evaluation meth-ods, and the applications and services under test is designed. The usage of intelligent agents is proposed to do automated <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation for applications and services. The architecture introduced includes single agent building blocks and communication and coordination models for <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation agents. 3. A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation infrastructure A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation infrastructure is needed to establish a trusted environment in which end users can do <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation. Its first design introduces certification authorities and agent registries as infrastructure prerequisites for standardized and authenticated <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation agents. This thesis is about <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation and it addresses <b>quality</b> issues <b>of</b> multimedia applications and distributed services.

40|$|Shared roadways are a cost {{effective}} method for providing bicycle facilities {{in areas with}} limited right-of-way; shared roadways have automobiles and bicycles operating in the same traveled way. However, shared roadways may negatively affect traffic operations and there is limited guidance on appropriate shared roadways implementation. This thesis has three objectives: evaluate the impact of shared roadways on automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> compare automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways, and provide guidance on the implementation of shared roadways. The author hypothesizes that shared roadways should only be implemented when automobile Level <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (LOS), bicycle LOS, and facility safety are "acceptable. " The author accomplishes the objectives by generating data using microsimulation models. The author uses microsimulation model data to evaluate automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways. In the evaluation <b>of</b> automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the measures <b>of</b> effectiveness are automobile LOS threshold (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in automobile LOS) and automobile average travel speed (the average travel time divided by the segment length, a space mean speed). To compare automobile and bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the author uses the bicycle LOS model in NCHRP Report 616 to generate bicycle LOS thresholds (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in bicycle LOS). After generating bicycle LOS thresholds, the author compares the bicycle LOS thresholds to the automobile LOS thresholds. Finally, the author uses {{the findings of the}} investigations to provide guidance on the implementation of shared roadways. In this thesis, the author finds automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways decreases as automobile free-flow speed, automobile volume, and bicycle volume increase.

40|$|Many {{computations}} {{exhibit a}} trade off between execution time and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly {{if it is}} given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and performance. We present a new <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler {{that is designed to}} help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> losses. Our <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> losses...|$|R

40|$|A high {{efficiency}} (i. e., the ratio between the transported traffic {{and the costs}} for transporting the traffic) and a well-defined <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> are two very important goals for IP networks. From this follows the central question of this dissertation: How can an Internet service provider optimise the efficiency and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> its network? This thesis shows that efficiency and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> strongly depend on the network architecture, traffic engineering, network engineering, and the interconnections. Therefore, a system-oriented approach is employed. With this approach, all previously mentioned areas are analysed and optimised, considering their mutual influences. In the context of network architectures, {{the focus of the}} research lies on methods for providing <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> Within this thesis, analytical models are developed in order to determine and analyse the overprovisioning factor of a plain best-effort network compared to networks that support explicit service differentiation. Furthermore, the different IETF <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> architectures are evaluated and compared in an experimental study. In this context, a bandwidth broker for Differentiated Services networks is developed. It offers strong <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> guarantees and a {{high efficiency}} by overbooking. Besides the network architecture, the interconnection structure (i. e., the connections to other networks) also influences the efficiency and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> a network. In this dissertation, different approaches to optimise the efficiency, reliability, and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> the interconnection structure are developed and evaluated. The dissertation shows that with these approaches, significant cost savings and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> improvements can be realised. How the efficiency respectively the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> obtained with the network architecture and interconnections can be further improved by traffic engineering is also analysed within this dissertation. Weaknesses of existing approaches are identified and corrected. Due to the steadily increasing traffic volumes, capacity expansion is the most important network engineering task of a provider. Therefore, capacity expansion strategies are elaborated and evaluated in this dissertation. They also consider the influence of different network architectures and traffic engineering...|$|R

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> from a user {{perspective}} of a transportation facility or service is a fundamental concept of the Highway Capacity Manual. In determining <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> an arterial, six levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> thresholds are defined in the Highway Capacity Manual based on average through vehicle speed. In fact, the arterial level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> {{is not so much}} describing the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> transportation <b>service</b> provided by the facility, as much as the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provided to through motorized vehicles (i. e., automobile users). Although this <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> concept does address the primary mode of travel, it does not address the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> the arterial provides to other major potential modes: transit, pedestrian and bicycle. Proposed levels <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual for pedestrians and bicyclists are essentially based on how crowded the respective modal facilities are. However, recent research on pedestrian and bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> indicate that the most important factors are lateral separation of the mode from motorized vehicles, and motorized vehicle volume, speed, and type. For scheduled fixed route bus users the most important factors for <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> along an arterial are frequency of transit vehicles (headways and hours <b>of</b> <b>service)</b> and pedestrian access. This paper presents methods of determining the level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to scheduled fixed route bus users, pedestrians and bicyclists on arterials as well to through vehicles. It is based on level <b>of</b> <b>service</b> research for the individual modes, with a more comprehensive arterial approach based on research being conducted in Florida. It also presents Florida’s proposed multimodal arterial <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> approach at a planning level and how future editions of the Highway Capacity Manual could be structured to take a more multimodal analysis approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{integration}} of distributed multimedia systems support into a communications architecture, including new multiservice networks, {{is important in}} realising end-to-end <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (QoS) guarantees. A key observation is that <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> provides a unifying theme around which new QoS architecture can be constructed. For applications relying on the transfer of multimedia, and in particular continuous media flows, {{it is essential that}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> is configurable, predictable and maintainable system-wide, including the endsystem devices, communications subsystem and networks. Although researchers have addressed many isolated areas of QoS provision, until recently little attention had been paid to the development of QoS architecture which incorporates <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> interfaces, and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> control and management mechanisms across all architectural layers. The approach taken in this paper is, first, to set out terminology and elements of a generalised QoS f [...] ...|$|R
