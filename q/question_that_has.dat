500|$|Whether one of {{the three}} texts was the {{standard}} version, from which the other two were originally translated, is a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> remained controversial. Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version, the product of the Egyptian government under the Macedonian Ptolemies, was the original. Among recent authors, John Ray has stated that [...] "the hieroglyphs were the most important of the scripts on the stone: they were there for the gods to read, and the more learned of their priesthood". Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously, while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree [...] "an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions". Richard Parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life. The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why its decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected, especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> perplexed the sages from the beginning of time and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above all there is the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E

The episode also explores the moral side of The Smoking Man and his affinity for evil. Kenneth Silber of Space.com notes that The Smoking Man's [...] "enticing blandishments confirm he is a highly dangerous foe, one whose Machiavellian creativity borders on the Satanic."

500|$|Why Sibelius {{should have}} failed to prepare The Wood Nymph for {{publication}} is a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> perplexed scholars. On the advice of Ferruccio Busoni, Sibelius in 1895 offered The Wood Nymph to the Russian music publisher Mitrofan Belyayev {{but it was not}} published. Murtomäki has suggested that Sibelius, despite having been fond of The Wood Nymph, was [...] "unsure about the true value" [...] of his output from the 1890s, an ambivalence that is perhaps best illustrated by the piecemeal publication history of, and multiple revisions to, the four Lemminkäinen legends (appearing in the composer's 1911 diary under a list of works to be rewritten, The Wood Nymph, too, seems to have been scheduled by Sibelius for a reexamination, albeit one that never came to pass). Scholars have offered a number of explanations as to why Sibelius may have [...] "turned his back" [...] on his early compositions. Perhaps, as master, he looked back on the works of his youth as technically [...] "inferior" [...] to his mature output; or, as evolving artist, he sought distance from passionate, nationalistic exclamations as he developed his own, unique musical style and aimed to transition from [...] "local hero" [...] to [...] "international composer"; or, as elder statesman, he feared he might have [...] "revealed himself too much" [...] in early [...] "confessional" [...] works, such as En saga, Lemminkäinen and the Maidens of the Island, and The Wood Nymph. In the absence of any new information from Sibelius's papers, however, the reason why The Wood Nymph was never published ultimately [...] "appears doomed to remain a subject of speculation".|$|E

[...] It was revealed Kat would reveal the identity of her lover during an episode in which Kat and Alfie argue, Alfie attacks {{one of the suspects}} and Kat shouts that he has the wrong brother.

The big revelation was always {{going to be in the}} Queen Vic in front of everyone and it will not disappoint. Jessie [...] and Shane [...] are both brilliant and this is one episode viewers will not want to miss. Alfie goes for one of the Branning brothers as he is convinced it's him who's been sleeping with his wife. Kat storms through the pub as he's got him on the floor and reveals the truth. We all got goosebumps as she yelled the line, 'You've got the wrong brother' [...] It really is classic Enders." [...] The source added, [...] "Sadly it doesn't look like [...] be able to get over this one." [...] EastEnders confirmed that viewers would discover the identity of Kat's lover in the episode broadcast on 20 December 2012. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said it would be a [...] "dramatic climax" [...] to the storyline. On being told who Kat's lover is, Richie said he understood and found it clever, though he had previously thought it would be Michael or Ray. Richie told Radio Times that Alfie is still in denial about the affair but becomes Kat's [...] "stalker", following her to the bedsit. He then pieces the evidence together and realises Kat is having an affair with someone he knows.|$|E
