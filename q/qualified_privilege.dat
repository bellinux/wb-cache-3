5|$|The {{court was}} unwilling to extend the {{traditional}} defence of <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> as it was {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for the election is not.|$|E
25|$|The tort of {{defamation}} in India {{has largely}} followed the approach {{taken by the}} UK. Indian courts have endorsed the defences of absolute and <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege,</b> fair comment and justification. In UK, if the defendant is only successful in proving the truth {{of some of the}} several charges against him, the defence of justification might still be available if the charges not proved do not materially injure the reputation. While there is no such provision in India, the law is possibly the same. Recently, incidents of defamation in relation to public figures are highlighted.|$|E

The Article offers the unique perspective of a trial judge and his courtroom interactions with lawyers and witnesses alike. It discusses cases relating to established courtroom privileges, such as marriage, attorney/client and priest/penitent, as well as <b>qualified</b> <b>privileges</b> such as the journalism privilege. Further, it {{discusses the}} potential for new or novel privileges, such as the accountant/auditor-client work product privilege and the academic peer review privilege. Finally, the Article lays out suggestions for trial judges for how to best utilize the privilege rules while simultaneously promoting fairness and justice...|$|R

50|$|Goodale {{subsequently}} {{wrote an}} article for the Hastings Law Journal in which he argued that Justice Powell’s concurrence with the majority actually argued for a <b>qualified</b> reporter’s <b>privilege,</b> “though, on its face, their ruling said just the opposite.” He argued the Court’s ruling was narrow and so the reporter’s privilege should be judged on a case-by-case basis.|$|R
25|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} human rights, the courts have stated that there is no difference between the protection offered by the common law, and that guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. The right to freedom of expression has traditionally been considered as residual in character but certain types of speech are protected in positive terms. This is the case of debates in Parliament which are protected by parliamentary privilege, media reporting on parliamentary proceedings is covered by absolute privilege, while reports of court proceedings are protected by <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> so long as they are fair, accurate and not published with malice.|$|E
2500|$|In a key New Zealand {{defamation}} case (Lange v Atkinson [...] 3 NZLR 385), Lange sued {{political scientist}} Joe Atkinson for representing {{him in the}} magazine North & South as a lazy prime minister. In a 1998 judgment, and on appeal in 2000, the courts affirmed a new <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> for the media to discuss politicians when expressing the criticisms as the [...] "honest opinion" [...] of the author.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal's final {{hearing in}} Lange v Atkinson (No. 2) remains the leading {{case on the}} law of <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> in New Zealand and affirmed that <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> extends to {{publications}} concerning the conduct of publicly elected officeholders and those seeking such office.|$|E

40|$|As the European Court of Human Rights {{has come}} to <b>qualify</b> the <b>privilege</b> against {{self-incrimination}} {{and the right of}} silence in recent decisions, this article argues that the Court has failed to provide a convincing rationale for these rights.

40|$|Both, {{reputation}} {{and freedom of}} speech are constitutional rights. But whether we want it or not, they regularly meet and are in conflict with one to another. But, as many judgments show, courts rather rarely reach a judgment, what is excellent within its juridical construction. That’s why the target of this job was to examine as many judgments it’s possible and to inspect cases of defamation in the U. S. A. (as it has the most higher degree of speech protection, after Sullivan case), together with the praxis of the European Court of Human rights and of national courts. Author {{wanted to create a}} test for the courts. This work consists of seven main chapters. The second one looks at the statutory regulation about {{reputation and}} freedom of speech. The next – what is absolute and <b>qualified</b> <b>privileges</b> (for Latvian jurisdiction has no similar concept), fourth will go on and try to define different possible status of persons; fifth will examine, how an opinion might be defended; sixth will consider about factual basis and standards of liability, but the last chapter will lay down the borders to criticize persons. Finally, the test is built up from three categories of criteria – id est it includes the public interest, what varies from political questions till just private. Then, the test weighes out, whether the factual basis is true and if not, what kind of liability (malice, actual malice, bona fide) is to apply, taking into account, what is the status of the defamed person – public official, public figure, quasi-public official figure or private person. So, the most ample protection is intended for a private person (even strict liability), but the less – for public official/figure. But the protection of opinion varies from the status of the person and the interest the case involved...|$|R

[...] Whether or not a child abuser is deemed a [...] "known molester" [...] is left to the discretion of the local branch.

50|$|Using {{his article}} {{as a basis}} for {{protecting}} reporters’ sources, he persuaded other media companies, such as Time, NBC, CBS, and The Washington Post to refuse to comply with government subpoenas. He argued using the power of contempt to resist requests for sources would cause state and federal courts, as well as state legislatures, to recognize a <b>qualified</b> reporters’ <b>privilege.</b> This strategy succeeded, as over 1000 reporters privilege cases have been brought before state and federal court since his Hastings Law Review article, while only two or three were brought before. As of 2013, thirty nine states and the District of Columbia have some form of a reporter’s shield law, ten other states have a common law privilege, and most federal circuits recognize a reporter's privilege as well—many using the language proposed in Goodale’s law review article.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} recent {{developments}} in the right and ability of journalists to protect their sources’ anonymity in the United Kingdom, {{particularly in light of}} the Snowden revelations of June 2013, and the significance of collaboration between the global online media organization Wikileaks and mainstream news organisations. It explores two key difficulties faced by journalists: the notion of a <b>qualified</b> professional <b>privilege</b> and the unknown extent of covert requests by public authorities for disclosure involving communications data and metadata. In doing so, it comments upon the opening filled by Wikileaks, which protects its sources’ anonymity through high data security and encryption. This paper’s findings tend to show that the covert practice of blanket mass digital surveillance of individual communications including journalists’ is undermining source protection and the rise of Wikileaks as an alternative model is challenging the traditional role of journalists as mediators and gatekeepers in the digital era...|$|R
50|$|Freedom of {{the media}} is also {{recognised}} as an important democratic principle. New Zealand is ranked eighth on the Press Freedom Index 2010 and there tends to be strong legal, public and media comment where this right is infringed. Section 68 of the Evidence Act 2006 provides a <b>qualified</b> form of <b>privilege</b> for journalists who wish to protect the identity of their sources. The Court of Appeal has also laid down guidelines for the police when searching media premises for law enforcement reasons, so that their sources remain protected.|$|R
50|$|The next {{question}} was {{whether or not these}} statements were protected by <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege.</b> To establish privilege, the appellants had to show that they had a reciprocal right and duty to make and receive the report, and that the defamatory statements were relevant or germane and reasonably appropriate to the occasion. One of the recognised occasions that enjoys <b>qualified</b> <b>privilege</b> is where such statements are published in the discharge of a duty or in the exercise of a right.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of industrial polluters {{have taken advantage of}} protective features of the Federal Bankruptcy Code to avoid compliance with environmental injunctions, and thus have undermined the enforcement of environmental laws designed to protect the public from toxic wastes. Two provisions of the Code are at issue: section 362, which stays judicial proceedings against a party that files a bankruptcy petition; and section 554, which allows a trustee to abandon burdensome property. The lower courts have struggled, with little success, to find allowable limits to the protection afforded by these statutory provisions. Both provisions have come {{to the attention of the}} Supreme Court. Recently, in Ohio v. Kovacs, the Supreme Court considered whether an environmental injunction that had been stayed through the automatic stay could be discharged in bankruptcy.
