The role of the individual is paramount. <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> emphasizes that ‘people matter’. First of all, the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> is ‘human-centered’ and only secondarily ‘institution-oriented’. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> operates with a strong bottom-up momentum and encouragement. Therefore, for the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix,</b> democracy matters and is key and crucial. <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> addresses knowledge production and innovation in the context of democracy. There cannot be a <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> (or Quintuple Helix) ‘outside’ (or without) democracy. Here we see a co-development and co-evolution of democracy and knowledge production and innovation for knowledge society and knowledge democracy. This addressed and asserted co-evolution of the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> (Quintuple Helix) with democracy is even more plausible, when democracy is not being understood in terms of a ‘narrow’ electoral democracy, but when democracy is being carried and driven by a ‘broader’ conceptual understanding, for which freedom, equality, sustainable development, and the idea of ‘quality of democracy’ are equally crucial (Campbell and Carayannis [2013 a]; [2015]).|$|E

This is being stated explicitly by the concept and model of the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> innovation systems (Carayannis and Campbell [2006], [2009], [2010])a. How does the Quadruple Helixb differ from ‘N-Tuple of Helices’ (Leydesdorff [2012])? N-Tuple of Helices on the one hand, and the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and the Quintuple Helix innovation systems (<b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> Plus) on the other, are not driven by the same emphasis, and their ramifications point into different directions (for a summary and overview, see also the interview in Park [2014]). While the N-Tuple of Helices {{can be regarded as}} an abstract meta-concept of helices, the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> is more concrete in its qualities by being interested in developing and proposing solutions and problem-solving approaches based on a broader conceptual and theoretical understanding. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> focuses (as a final test) on reform, strategy, policy, and implementation processes and on transformation of economy, society, and democracy (economy in democracy). The Quintuple Helix could be interpreted as a <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> Plus extension, thus representing a further development and evolution in the line of thinking that integrates the ecology (also social ecology) into our approaches for knowledge production and innovation (Carayannis and Campbell [2010]; Carayannis et al.

This engagement builds strong simmelian ties with these actors and enables PIs to develop collective value motives by bridging diverse knowledge and creating common value motives.

30|$|The {{article focuses}} on creatively designing, redesigning, and {{discussing}} concepts of knowledge production and innovation. The points of departure are the Triple Helix, <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix,</b> and Quintuple Helix for innovation, and Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3 for knowledge production. These concepts are all published and thus publicly accessible. Particularly, {{the concept of the}} <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> innovation system is being discussed and conceptually further developed in a twofold assessment approach: (1) democracy and knowledge production and innovation, and (2) art, arts-based research, and arts-based innovation. This should contribute to a continuous discourse building of the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix.</b> The emphasis is on a deepening reflection.|$|E
30|$|The Triple Helix {{innovation}} model {{concentrates on}} university-industry-government relations (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). In that respect, Triple Helix represents a basic model for knowledge production and innovation application. The {{models of the}} <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and Quintuple Helix innovation systems are designed to already comprehend and to refer to an extended complexity in knowledge production and knowledge application (innovation); thus, the analytical architecture of these models is conceptualized broader. To use metaphoric terms, the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> embeds and contextualizes the Triple Helix, while the Quintuple Helix embeds and contextualizes the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> (and Triple Helix). The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> adds as a fourth helix the “media-based and culture-based public,” “civil society,” and “arts, artistic research, and arts-based innovation” (Carayannis and Campbell 2009, 2012, p. 14, and 2014; see also Danilda et al. 2009, and Bast et al. 2015). The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> also could be emphasized as the perspective that specifically brings in the “dimension of democracy” or the “context of democracy” for knowledge, knowledge production, and innovation. The Quintuple Helix innovation model is even more comprehensive in its analytical and explanatory stretch and approach, adding furthermore the fifth helix (and perspective) of the “natural environments of society” (Carayannis and Campbell 2010, p. 62).|$|E
30|$|Our {{following}} {{analysis is}} structured {{in the following}} sections. In the ‘Arts and artistic research’ section, we explore further the cross-connections and interconnection between arts and artistic research.

The ‘Innovation systems in conceptual evolution: Mode 3 knowledge production in <b>Quadruple</b> and Quintuple <b>Helix</b> innovation systems’ section embeds artistic research {{in the context of the}} concepts of <b>Quadruple</b> and Quintuple <b>Helix</b> innovation systems. We demonstrate how concepts of innovation and innovation systems have evolved and how knowledge production, innovation, and structures of organizations are intertwined in co-evolution. Finally, in the ‘Conclusions’ section, the conclusion to our analysis, we speculate on possible future scenarios of co-development of arts, research, innovation, and society. This co-development has all the potentials of becoming crucial for the further progress of innovation and innovation systems that drives knowledge economy, knowledge society, and knowledge democracy.|$|R
30|$|The {{article is}} {{structured}} into different sections. In the “Knowledge and systems and systems theory” section, we shortly {{refer to a}} first introduction and relation of “knowledge,” “systems,” and “systems theory,” indicating opportunities of a mutual leveraging. The “What is a system?” section is devoted to a detailed discussion and review of systems theory. It focuses on how a system can be defined, referring to the concepts of “elements” and “self-rationale” of a system. Constructivist notions are emphasized, implying that social (societal) systems cannot be understood independently of an “observer,” since they are not naturally predetermined but {{to a large extent}} “socially constructed”. A further emphasis is placed on designing a conceptual bridge between the elements/self-rationale of a system and clusters/networks. Clusters and networks (and networks of clusters and networks) express a crucial relevance for knowledge and innovation. Through bridging elements/self-rationale and clusters/networks, the application of systems theory and systemic notions to knowledge gains additional plausibility. In the “Knowledge and knowledge systems” section, the application of systems and systems theory to knowledge and innovation is pursued in more concrete terms. Explicitly, the appropriateness of a “multi-level hierarchy” is being tested. The ramifications of such a multi-level design can either follow the logic of multi-level systems of knowledge or multi-level systems of innovation. In advanced policy terms, a political system—which operates for governing a society (and economy)—not only aims to influence the economy through economic policy but also through innovation policy, which reflects on the knowledge base of a society and economy. An economic policy, perhaps, does not take the knowledge base that comprehensively into account. In the context of the “Results and discussion: the knowledge systems perspective of “Mode 3 ”” section, under the umbrella term of “Mode 3,” we again summarize our lines of arguments, by setting up a list of short propositions. In the final section (the “Conclusion: Mode 3 knowledge production in <b>Quadruple</b> and Quintuple <b>Helix</b> innovation systems” section), we explore how Mode 3 knowledge production systems relate to <b>Quadruple</b> and Quintuple <b>Helix</b> innovation systems.|$|R

The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> {{model is}} based on the Triple Helix model and adds as fourth helix the ‘public’, more {{specifically}} being defined as the ‘media-based and culture-based public’ and civil society. This ‘fourth helix associates with “media”, “creative industries”, “culture”, “values”, “lifestyles”, “art”, and perhaps also the notion of the “creative class”’ (Carayannis and Campbell [2009], pp. 218, 206).|$|E
30|$|Arts, democracy, and {{innovation}} co-evolve. At {{the beginning of}} our article analyses, we introduced the blueprint for a vision and manifesto on knowledge production {{and innovation}} in <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> innovation systems. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> regards itself to be human-centered oriented. While for the Triple Helix model the existence of a democracy is not (per se) necessary for knowledge production and innovation, the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> is here more explicit. The way how the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> is being engineered, designed, and architected clearly shows that there cannot be a <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> innovation system without democracy or a democratic context. The following attributes and components define the fourth helix in the Quadruple Helix: media-based and culture-based public, civil society, and arts, artistic research, and arts-based innovation. By this, the fourth helix in the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> represents the perspective of the dimension of democracy or the context of democracy for knowledge, knowledge production, and innovation. This is particularly true when democracy is being understood to transcend the narrow understanding of being primarily based on or being primarily rooted in government institutions (within Triple Helix). Civil society, culture-based public, quality of democracy, and sustainable development convincingly demonstrate what the rationales and requirements are for conceptualizing democracy broader (Campbell and Carayannis [2013 a]).q Political pluralism in a democracy co-evolves with the pluralism, diversity, and heterogeneity of knowledge, knowledge production, and innovation (Democracy of Knowledge, see Carayannis and Campbell, [2009], [2012], p. 55). We postulate here a congruence of structures and processes in democracy and in innovation systems. The Quintuple Helix extends the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> by aspects of the natural environments of society and economy, the social ecology, and the socio-ecological transition. Also, this environmental context of society can be better addressed in a democracy than in a non-democracy. The current world appears to be challenged by a race between developing democracies versus emerging autocracies over knowledge production and innovation.|$|E

30|$|The Triple Helix {{innovation}} model {{focuses on}} university-industry-government relations. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> embeds the Triple Helix by adding as a fourth helix the ‘media-based and culture-based public’ and ‘civil society’. The Quintuple Helix innovation model is even broader and more comprehensive by contextualizing the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and by additionally adding the helix (and perspective) of the ‘natural environments of society’. The Triple Helix acknowledges explicitly {{the importance of}} higher education for innovation. However, in one line of interpretation {{it could be argued}} that the Triple Helix places the emphasis on knowledge production and innovation in the economy so it is compatible with the knowledge economy. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> already encourages the perspective of the knowledge society, and of knowledge democracy for knowledge production and innovation. In a <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> understanding, the sustainable development of a knowledge economy requires a coevolution with the knowledge society. The Quintuple Helix stresses the necessary socioecological transition of society and economy in the twenty-first century; therefore, the Quintuple Helix is ecologically sensitive. Within the framework of the Quintuple Helix innovation model, the natural environments of society and the economy also should be seen as drivers for knowledge production and innovation, therefore defining opportunities for the knowledge economy. The European Commission in 2009 identified the socioecological transition as a major challenge for the future roadmap of development. The Quintuple Helix supports here the formation of a win-win situation between ecology, knowledge and innovation, creating synergies between economy, society, and democracy. Global warming represents an area of ecological concern, to which the Quintuple Helix innovation model can be applied with greater potential.|$|E

To determine whether the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> model has an effect on the firms’ profitability, the authors employed the classification analysis method (Classification And Regression Trees). The sample is composed by 4215 manufacturing firms located in science parks. In our empirical model, the variable ‘‘citizen’’ classifies businesses with high Return On Investment in the best way. This shows that in science parks ‘‘the fourth helix’’ (citizen) has an important role in classifying the firms with the highest performance. Moreover, the majority of firms that attribute high importance to the collaboration with private financial institutions in order to finance innovations have a high ROI.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} based economic transformation strategy in Malaysia {{is part of}} its broader economy competitiveness strategy developed to achieve the goals set for Vision 2020. However, Malaysia is facing hurdles in knowledge economy transformation such as weak education and training system, institutional support, and info-structure, deficient research and development capacity, unstable science and technology base, unskilled workers, and lack of techno-entrepreneurs. To discover the {{knowledge based}} transformation solution for these problems, a framework has been developed to check the impact of performance determinant variables on economic competitiveness of Malaysia using <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> (university, industry, government and public/civil society) research collaboration as mediators. A quantitative, descriptive research design was used in which twenty nine economic performance determinant variables were tested for mediation with university, industry, government and public. Two hundred and eighty two questionnaires were distributed using the convenience sampling method to collect the data. The study validated the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> mediation impact using regression analysis. Mediation was further validated using the Sobel Test. The study confirmed that the performance determinant variables have a strong and positive role in determining economy competitiveness. The results also confirmed that a strong <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> mediation is necessary; however, there exists a “weak link” between the key stakeholders in the economy of Malaysia. The results established that the university and government are comparatively strong contributors whilst civil society’s contribution is moderate and the industry is the weakest link in the competitiveness of an economy. It is therefore, concluded that a successful knowledge based transformation depends upon the collaborations between university, industry, government and civil society sector. It is recommended that a strong <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> innovation based collaboration should be the focus and the tool for knowledge based economic transformation to strengthen the economic performance and competitiveness of Malaysia...|$|E

The Quintuple Helix extends the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> by aspects of the ‘natural environments of society and economy,’ ‘social ecology,’ and the ‘socio-ecological transition’. Also, this environmental context of society can be better addressed in a democracy than in a non-democracy. The current world appears to be challenged by a race between developing democracies versus emerging autocracies over knowledge production and innovation. The contributions of arts, arts-based research, and arts-based innovation to knowledge production and innovation systems are manifold. Art helps and aids us in thinking ‘beyond the box’. The traditional understanding of arts emphasizes the aesthetic dimension of arts. Art and arts can also be understood (and re-invented) as a manifestation of knowledge, knowledge production, and knowledge creation. Arts and artistic research are now being regarded as drivers for forming and pluralizing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary configurations and networks with research in the sciences and the application and use of knowledge and innovation in the context of not only society and democracy, but also the economy. Art, arts-based research, and arts-based innovation contribute to creating (co-creating) the basis for new models of economic growth. This indicates opportunities for a creative design or creative design processes in the further co-evolution of knowledge economy, knowledge society, and knowledge democracy.|$|E
30|$|Etzkowitz’s {{position}} {{is consistent with}} the ideas of <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> (Carayannis and Campbell 2009) in which society or the public is added as the fourth helix, but Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz (2003) do not consider the necessity of transforming the Triple Helix to <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> by arguing that civil society or the public is the institutional foundation in which the Triple Helix has evolved. Although civil society is characterised by its alleged independence from the state (Perry and Fuller 1991), it cannot live without the state. Neither can it exist without reference to a market dominated by private actors. Rather, it serves as a buffer zone between the control of authorities and private initiatives (Seppälä 1992) and thus facilitates both top-down governance and grassroots initiatives to best interact and engage with each other in innovation processes (Carayannis and Campbell 2012).|$|E

40|$|From a {{literature}} review, responsible {{innovation in the}} collective innovation process was specified as {{the application of the}} intertwining dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness in an evolutionary environment with actors of an innovation system that contains a constant group of institutions, while an open knowledge environment is present. Three concepts helped to define what a responsible innovation system is. Systems of Innovation helped to determine that innovation systems emerge on a regional level. The <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> helped with the categorisation of the active institutions (Government, Industry, Academia, Civil Society) and the evolutionary characteristics of a system. Open Innovation helped to determine what an open knowledge environment entails in innovation. A responsible innovation system is then defined as an open knowledge network that allows for both emergence and evolution of the four institutions of the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and the regional innovation system to develop, while the dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion and responsiveness are mutually shared among the actors. A combined framework was constructed consisting of three elements: components, relations and functions. In the components, the actors are characterised according to the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and the system is evaluated on its inclusion of all institutions. In the relations, two-way knowledge channels are revealed, with the help of Open Innovation. In the functions the three virtual spaces of Knowledge, Innovation and Consensus are created, each with its specific role of explaining interaction in the system. The Consensus Space will only form if the dimensions of anticipation, reflexivity and responsiveness are found in the activities within and among the actors of the system. Also a number of conditions for a responsible innovation system to emerge were set up.|$|E

The Triple Helix focuses on the knowledge economy, which may be approached by a non-democratic framework.

Per definition, to already begin with a conceptual starting point, it is impossible for a non-democratic (authoritarian) political regime to try to implement a <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix.</b> There is no <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> without democracy. In addition, evidence suggests that the ecological sensitivity of the Quintuple Helix (Carayannis et al.

For the <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix,</b> the ‘democracy matters’: this is in line with a view of a ‘Neo-Renaissance’ where democracy encourages development in action for smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, by this advocating sustainable development. This should allow for ‘happy accidents’. For discourses on knowledge and innovation, a Democracy versus Technocracy issue can be postulated, where technocratic (and bureaucratic) approaches to innovation in non-democratic regimes are being questioned and challenged by knowledge production and innovation in democracies. Also, for the developing countries and emerging markets, this has implications and ramifications, where there should be expectations that developments in knowledge and innovation are paralleled by progress in democratization (of course, this may not be always the case in empirical terms or empirically). Democracy acts as one of the levers that happy accidents in knowledge production and innovation are being transformed and translated into opportunities and benefits for society and to the people. Can there also be a ‘democratic capitalism’[*], and which attempts of realization can there be approached or tried out (Carayannis and Kaloudis [2010])? [...]...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper {{questions}} whether the emphasis placed within translational research on a linear model of innovation provides the most effective model for managing health technology innovation. Several alternative perspectives are presented that have potential to enhance the existing model of translational research. A case study is presented of innovation of a clinical decision support system. The paper concludes from the case study that an extending the triple helix model of technology transfer, to one based on a <b>quadruple</b> <b>helix,</b> present a basis for improving the performance translational research. Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach is used to help understand development of an innovative technology within a teaching hospital. The case is then used to develop and refine a model of the heath technology innovation system. Findings - The paper concludes from the case study that existing models of translational research could be refined further through the development of a <b>quadruple</b> <b>helix</b> model of heath technology innovation that encompasses greater emphasis on user-led and open innovation perspectives. Research limitations/implications - The paper presents several implications for future research based on the need to enhance the model of health technology innovation used to guide policy and practice. Practical implications - The <b>quadruple</b> <b>helix</b> model of innovation that is proposed can potentially guide alterations to the existing model of translational research in the healthcare sector. Several suggestions are made for how innovation activity can be better supported at both a policy and operational level. Originality/value - This paper presents a synthesis of the innovation literature applied to a theoretically important case of open innovation in the UK National health Service. It draws in perspectives from other industrial sectors and applies them specifically to the management and organisation of innovation activities around health technology and the services in which they are embedded. ...|$|E
30|$|The Triple Helix {{model is}} one the {{patterns}} that has determined {{the most important}} variables affecting knowledge-based economy {{and the relationship between}} these variables so as to understand the knowledge-based economy. “In Triple Helix (TH) innovation model, the academia (colleges, universities), government and industry constitute the three helices which collaborate with each other in order to create or discover new knowledge, technology, products and services” (Report of <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> Research For the CLIQ Project 2010, p. 14).|$|E
30|$|The {{article focuses}} on creatively {{designing}} and re-designing concepts on knowledge production and innovation. The points of departure are the Triple Helix, <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix,</b> and Quintuple Helix for innovation, and Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3 for knowledge production. These concepts are all published and thus publicly accessible. The article engages in a detailed literature review on these concepts in their contextualization. The concept of the Quintuple Helix innovation system is being analytically applied to the ecological (socio-ecological) issue of global warming.|$|E

Increased understanding of knowledge transfer (KT) from universities to the wider regional knowledge ecosystem offers opportunities for increased regional innovation and commercialisation. The aim {{of this article is}} to improve the understanding of the KT phenomena in an open innovation context where multiple diverse <b>quadruple</b> <b>helix</b> stakeholders are interacting. An absorptive capacity-based conceptual framework is proposed, using a priori constructs which portrays the multidimensional process of KT between universities and its constituent stakeholders in pursuit of open innovation and commercialisation. Given the lack of overarching theory in the field, an exploratory, inductive theory building methodology was adopted using semi-structured interviews, document analysis and longitudinal observation data over a three-year period. The findings identify five factors, namely human centric factors, organisational factors, knowledge characteristics, power relationships and network characteristics, which mediate both the ability of stakeholders to engage in KT and the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. This research has implications for policy makers and practitioners by identifying the need to implement interventions to overcome the barriers to KT effectiveness between regional <b>quadruple</b> <b>helix</b> stakeholders within an open innovation ecosystem...|$|E
30|$|Art {{and artistic}} {{research}} p in Quadruple and Quintuple Helix innovation systems: The {{concepts of the}} <b>Quadruple</b> <b>Helix</b> and Quintuple Helix innovation systems are explicitly sensitive for the roles of arts and of artistic research for innovation. Within the context of that line of thinking, arts, artistic research, and arts-based innovation (AAA) are essential for the further evolution and progress of innovation systems. Universities and other higher education institutions of the arts represent crucial organizations for innovation systems (national and multi-level innovation systems). In multi-level innovation systems, the global, national, and local innovation systems co-evolve in parallel and in being mutually intertwined.|$|E
