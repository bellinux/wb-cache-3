25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve fitting with more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{variation}} of the transmission quadrupole is the triple <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> The “triple quad” has three consecutive quadrupole stages, the first acting as a mass filter to transmit a particular incoming ion to the second quadrupole, a collision chamber, wherein that ion can be broken into fragments. The third quadrupole also acts as a mass filter, to transmit a particular fragment ion to the detector. If a quadrupole is made to rapidly and repetitively cycle through a range of mass filter settings, full spectra can be reported. [...] Likewise, a triple quad {{can be made to}} perform various scan types characteristic of tandem mass spectrometry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} type of mass {{spectrometer}} (MS) associated with a gas chromatograph (GC) is the <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> sometimes referred to by the Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) trade name [...] "Mass Selective Detector" [...] (MSD). [...] Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer. [...] Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, however these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories. [...] Other detectors may be encountered such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), {{or in the case of}} an ion trap MSn where n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.|$|E

2500|$|The {{development}} of affordable and miniaturized computers has helped in the simplification {{of the use}} of this instrument, as well as allowed great improvements in the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. [...] In 1964, Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI), a leading U.S. supplier of analog computers, began development [...] of a computer controlled <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> under the direction of Robert E. Finnigan. [...] By 1966 Finnigan and collaborator Mike Uthe's EAI division had sold over 500 quadrupole residual gas-analyzer instruments. [...] In 1967, Finnigan left EAI to form the Finnigan Instrument Corporation along with Roger Sant, T. Z. Chou, Michael Story, and William Fies. In early 1968, they delivered the first prototype quadrupole GC/MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University. When Finnigan Instrument Corporation was acquired by Thermo Instrument Systems (later Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1990, it was considered [...] "the world's leading manufacturer of mass spectrometers".|$|E

5000|$|The {{quadrupole}} mass analyzer (QMS) is {{one type}} of mass analyzer used in mass spectrometry. It {{is also known as}} a transmission <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> quadrupole mass filter, or <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> As the name implies, it consists of four cylindrical rods, set parallel to each other. [...] In a <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> the quadrupole is the component of the instrument responsible for filtering sample ions, based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Ions are separated in a quadrupole based on the stability of their trajectories in the oscillating electric fields that are applied to the rods.|$|E
50|$|Selected ion {{monitoring}} (SIM) is a {{mass spectrometry}} scanning mode {{in which only}} a limited mass-to-charge ratio range is transmitted/detected by the instrument, {{as opposed to the}} full spectrum range. This mode of operation typically results in significantly increased sensitivity. Due to their inherent nature, this technique is most effective—and therefore most common—on <b>quadrupole</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers</b> and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers.</b>|$|R
