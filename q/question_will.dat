5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from deployable mines to energy shields. Every ship is also equipped with a standard energy shield which will protect the player from damage caused by collisions or weapons fire. If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> be eliminated from the race.|$|E
5|$|The Wipeout {{games are}} {{a series of}} futuristic racers which involve players {{piloting}} anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups {{come in the form of}} offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, rockets, to energy shields, auto pilots, and mines. Power-ups are usually collected by flying over different coloured pads on race tracks. Speed boost pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player receives a short momentous boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing corporation (collectively referred to as 'teams' in-game) although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Every ship has different characteristics, for example each ship will vary in handling, thrust, maximum speed and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with a compulsory shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire. If the shield runs out, the ship in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> explode and the player is consequently eliminated from the race.|$|E

5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this <b>question</b> <b>will</b> ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
25|$|Suffrage {{is often}} {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} elections for representatives. However, suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives. Suffrage describes not only {{the legal right to}} vote, but also the practical question of whether a <b>question</b> <b>will</b> be put to a vote. The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally by elected or non-elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|The labor {{theory of}} product-value is wrong, which obviates {{the bulk of}} Marx's argument. Marginal utility theory predicts that a {{relatively}} high rate of profit attracts further investment, but each additional unit of production will generally tend to be of less utility (and therefore less value) to the market, causing the overall rate of profit to fall absent any technological innovation increasing productivity. The commodity in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> lose its appeal to investors, who will then invest in other, newer lines of production offering higher returns.|$|E

25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The <b>question</b> <b>will</b> be whether Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy of picking up cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females {{are not likely to be}} ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E
25|$|Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig) {{is a day}} {{away from}} his fourteenth birthday. As the Stanton {{children}} walk home, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), the local mistress of the Manor, and her Butler Merriman Lyon (Ian McShane) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson (James Cosmo) and Old George (Jim Piddock), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively clear sky. Will’s birthday {{is so close to}} Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen (Emma Lockhart), who gives him his only birthday present (a Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village and one of his brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they <b>question</b> <b>Will</b> under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into rooks. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives a strange and Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen (Jordan J. Dale).|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of materialist {{understandings}} of psychology, eliminativism stands in opposition to reductive materialism [...] which argues that mental states as conventionally understood do exist, and that they directly correspond to the physical state of the nervous system.

500|$|Every ship in {{the game}} has its own characteristics; {{depending}} on the team selected, a ship will vary in terms of speed, acceleration, manoeuvrability, and shield strength. Each ship is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapon fire. If the shield runs out, the ship and player in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> explode, resulting in elimination from the race. However, players may replenish energy by absorbing unwanted weapon pick-ups. The weapons are the same ones featured in Wipeout Pulse; defensive weapons range from shields—which temporarily make the player's ship invulnerable to damage—to land mines and stationary bombs. Offensive weapons include machine guns, missiles, rockets, and a [...] "quake" [...] – which {{comes in the form}} of a devastating earthquake that damages all opponents situated in front of the player. In addition, every ship is equipped with air brakes which can be used for manoeuvring through corners at high speed.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{candidates}} {{have been proposed}} as {{the means by which}} Benjamin Franklin acquired the letters. [...] John Temple, despite his political differences with Hutchinson, was apparently able to convince the latter in 1774 that he was not involved in their acquisition. [...] He did, however, claim to know who was involved, but refused to name him, because that would [...] "prove the ruin of the guilty party." [...] Several historians (including Bernard Bailyn and Bernard Knollenberg) have concluded that Thomas Pownall was the probable source of the letters. [...] Pownall was Massachusetts governor before Francis Bernard, had similar views to Franklin on colonial matters, and had access to centers of colonial administration through his brother John, the colonial secretary. [...] Other individuals have also been suggested, but all appear to have an only tenuous connection to Franklin or the situation. [...] Historian Kenneth Penegar believes the <b>question</b> <b>will</b> remain unanswerable unless new documents emerge to shed light on the episode.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor, {{aware of}} his {{imminent}} death at the fixed point of time on 22 April 2011 at Lake Silencio in Utah, attempts {{to track down the}} Silence to learn why he must die.
