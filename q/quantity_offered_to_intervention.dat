40|$|Objectives: Active {{telephone}} recruitment (‘cold calling’) can enrol almost 45 {{times more}} smokers to cessation services than media. However, {{the effectiveness of}} proactive telephone counselling with cold-called smokers from the broader community is unknown. This study examined whether proactive telephone counselling improved abstinence, quit attempts and reduced cigarette consumption among cold-called smokers. Methods: From 48014 randomly selected electronic telephone directory numbers, 3008 eligible smokers were identified and 1562 (51. 9 %) smokers recruited into the randomised controlled trial. Of these, 769 smokers were randomly allocated to proactive telephone counselling and 793 to the control (ie, mailed self-help) conditions. Six counselling calls were <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> smokers willing <b>to</b> quit within a month and four to those not ready to quit. The 4 -month, 7 -month and 13 -month follow-up interviews were completed by 1369 (87. 6 %), 1278 (81. 8 %) and 1245 (79. 9 %) participants, respectively. Results: Proactive telephone counselling participants {{were significantly more likely}} than controls to achieve 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 4 months (13. 8 % vs 9. 6 %, p= 0. 005) and 7 months (14. 3 % vs 11. 0 %, p= 0. 02) but not at 13 months. There was a significant impact of telephone counselling on prolonged abstinence at 4 months (3. 4 % vs 1. 8 %, p= 0. 02) and at 7 months (2. 2 % vs 0. 9 %, p= 0. 02). At 4 months post recruitment, telephone counselling participants were significantly more likely than controls to have made a quit attempt (48. 6 % vs 42. 9 %, p= 0. 01) and reduced cigarette consumption (16. 9 % vs 9. 0 %, p= 0. 0002).

40|$|Introduction: People {{from working}} poor {{families}} {{are at high}} risk of poor health partly due to limited healthcare access. Health empowerment, a process by which people can gain greater control over the decisions affecting their lives and health through education and motivation, can be an effective way to enhance health, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), health awareness and health-seeking behaviours of these people. A new cohort study will be launched to explore the potential for a Health Empowerment Programme to enable these families by enhancing their health status and modifying their attitudes towards health-related issues. If proven effective, similar empowerment programme models could be tested and further disseminated in collaborations with healthcare providers and policymakers. Method and analysis: A prospective cohort study with 200 intervention families will be launched and followed up for 5  years. The following inclusion criteria will be used at the time of recruitment: (1) Having at least one working family member; (2) Having at least one child studying in grades 1 – 3; and (3) Having a monthly household income that is less than 75 % of the median monthly household income of Hong Kong families. The Health Empowerment Programme that will be <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> families will comprise four components: health assessment, health literacy, self-care enablement and health ambassador. Their health status, HRQOL, lifestyle and health service utilisation will be assessed and compared with 200 control families with matching characteristics but will not receive the health empowerment intervention. Ethics and dissemination: This project was approved by the University of Hong Kong—the Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster IRB, Reference number: UW 12 - 517.

APPROACH: We illustrate our analysis using a case study of the unexpected development of recurrent stereotyped events in patients following the use of DBS to treat severe chronic pain. Examining these unexpected complications in light of medical ethical principles, we argue that serious complications of novel DBS treatments do not necessarily make it unethical <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> the <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> eligible patients.

40|$|Background: Delirium {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{complications}} in hospitalized elderly, with incidences ranging from 3 - 56 %. The objective of this meta-analysis was two-fold, first <b>to</b> investigate if <b>interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent delirium are effective and second to explore which factors increase the effectiveness of these interventions. Methods: An electronic search was carried out on articles published between January 1979 and July 2009. Abstracts were reviewed, data were extracted and methodologic quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Effect sizes of the interventions were expressed as ORs (odds ratios) and 95 % CIs (confidence intervals). A random effect model was used to provide pooled ORs. To explore which factors increase the effectiveness of the interventions, ORs were stratified for several factors. Results: Sixteen relevant studies were found. Overall the included studies showed a positive result of any <b>intervention</b> <b>to</b> prevent delirium (pooled OR: 0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 46 - 0. 88). The largest effect was seen in studies on populations with an incidence of delirium above 30 % in the control group (pooled OR: 0. 34; 95 % CI: 0. 16 - 0. 71 versus 0. 76; 95 % CI: 0. 60 - 0. 97). Conclusions: <b>Interventions</b> <b>to</b> prevent delirium are effective. <b>Interventions</b> seem <b>to</b> be more effective when the incidence of delirium in the population under study is above 30 %.

It may be necessary for mental health practitioners <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>intervention</b> strategies in accordance with individual temperament. Aims To investigate the relationship between job stress and temperament among nurses in a general hos-pital and to provide insight into personality traits influencing their mental or physical health. Methods A questionnaire survey of nurses in a general hospital. Work stress was measured using the Japanese version of the Effort–Reward Imbalance (ERI) scale. Temperament was assessed by a Japanese version of Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to determine the independent con-tribution of temperament to effort–reward ratio and over-commitment. Results Response rate was 48 % (326 / 685). Temperament predicted part of the variance of the four ERI ratios (effort–reward ratio 26 %; effort–esteem ratio 27 %; effort–promotion ratio 26 %; and effort–security ratio 18 %) and also of over-commitment (38 %). Depressive temperament influenced all four ERI ratios and over-commitment. Anxious temperament influenced only over-commitment.

40|$|Online {{edition of}} journal {{available}} from [URL] To examine {{the use of}} psychotropic drugs in 24 rural and urban longterm care (LTC) facilities, and compare the effect of an education intervention for LTC staff and family members {{on the use of}} psychotropic drugs in intervention versus control facilities. Methods: Interrupted time series with a non-equivalent no-treatment control group time series. Data on drug use were collected in 24 Western Canadian LTC facilities (10 urban, 14 rural) for three 2 -month time periods before and after the intervention. Pharmacy records were used to collect data on drug, class of drug, dose, administration, and start/stop dates. Chart reviews provided demographics, pro re nata (prn) use, and indications for drug use. Subjects comprised 2443 residents living in the 24 LTC facilities during the 1 -year study. An average of 796. 33 residents (32. 7 %) received a psychotropic drug. An education intervention on psychotropic drug use in LTC was <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> physicians, nursing staff, pharmacists and family members. Results: Approximately one-third of residents received a psychotropic drug during the study, often for considerable lengths of time. A minority of psychotropic drug prescriptions had a documented reason for their use, and 69. 5 % of the reasons would be inappropriate under Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) legislation. Few psychotropic drug prescriptions were discontinued or reduced during the study. More urban LTC residents received neuroleptics and benzodiazepines than their rural counterparts (26. 1 % vs. 15. 7 %, and 18. 0 % vs. 7. 6 %, respectively). The education intervention did not result in any significant decline in the use of these drugs in intervention facilities. Conclusion: The results suggest substantial use of psychotropic drugs in LTC, although rural LTC residents received approximately half the number of psychotropic drugs compared with urban residents. A resource-intensive intervention did not significantly decrease the use of psychotropics. There is a need for better monitoring of psychotropic drugs in LTC, particularly given that voluntary educational efforts alone may be ineffective agents of change.
