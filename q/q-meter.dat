Three of the four science instruments contained within the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) are passively cooled to their operational temperature range of 36 K to 40 K with radiators, and the fourth instrument is actively cooled to its operational temperature of approximately 6 K. Thermal-vacuum testing of the flight science instruments at the ISIM element level {{has taken place in}} three separate highly challenging and extremely complex thermal tests within a gaseous helium-cooled shroud inside Goddard Space Flight Centers Space Environment Simulator. Special data acquisition software was developed for these tests to monitor over 1700 flight and test sensor measurements, track over 50 gradients, component rates, and temperature limits in real time against defined constraints and limitations, and guide the complex transition from ambient to final cryogenic temperatures and back. This extremely flexible system has proven highly successful in safeguarding the nearly $ 2 B science payload during the 3. 5 -month-long thermal tests.

40|$|The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an {{upcoming}} flagship observatory mission {{scheduled to be}} launched in 2018. Three of the four science instruments are passively cooled to their operational temperature range of 36 K to 40 K, and the fourth instrument is actively cooled to its operational temperature of approximately 6 K. The requirement for multiple thermal zoned results in the instruments being thermally connected to five external radiators via individual high purity aluminum heat straps. Thermal-vacuum and thermal balance testing of the flight instruments at the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) element level will take place within a newly constructed shroud cooled by gaseous helium inside Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Space environment Simulator (SES). The flight external radiators are not available during ISIM-level thermal vacuum/thermal testing, so they will be replaced in test with stable and adjustable thermal boundaries with identical physical interfaces to the flight radiators. Those boundaries are provided by specially designed test hardware which also measures the heat flow {{within each of the}} five heat straps to an accuracy of less than 2 mW, which is less than 5 % of the minimum predicted heat flow values. Measurement of the heat loads to this accuracy is essential to ISIM thermal model correlation, since thermal models are more accurately correlated when temperature data is supplemented by accurate knowledge of heat flows. It also provides direct verification by test of several high-level thermal requirements. Devices that measure heat flow in this manner have historically been referred to a "Q-meters".

The method then examines the possibility of employing the coaxial cavity as an important and necessary measuring device for dielectric measurements using CPM. It was the aim in the investigations to state clearly what assumptions were made so that the accuracy of the calculated results could be assessed. A new measurement technique, using a Sweep Generator/ Spectrum Analyzer Assembly (SG/SA) was introduced. The technique is based on very precise measurements of the changes in cavity Q and its resonant frequency, displayed on Spectrum Analyzer, when the test sample of the material is inserted. Because the main objective of the project is the method of measurements, the assessment of its validity and accuracy was fully discussed. Measurements were carried out on fifteen materials of various types of ceramics over the frequency range of interest. These materials were used mainly for the assessment of the validity and accuracy of the new Sweep Generator/Spectrum Analyzer Assembly technique, and also a test of the capability of the constructed broadband coaxial cavity to be used for dielectric measurements.

Studies have been made to correlate molecular properties such as symmetry, and electronic and sterlc effects to the occurrence of double-internal rotation. Symmetric diaryl molecules such as sulfones, sulfoxides, and dibenzothiophenes were found to undergo predominantly over-all molecular rotation in polystyrene matrices. Asymmetric diaryl ethers and ketones displayed a major contribution to dielectric relaxation from ovei*-al 1 molecular rotation. Symmetric diaryl ethers, ketones, and sulfides (e. g., diphenyl ether, benzophenone, and diphenyl sulfide) were found to undergo primarily double-internal rotation, both in polystyrene and as compressed solids. Some large molecules such as 1, 2 -diphenylcyclopropenone underwent co-operative motion with the polymer chains near the glasstransition temperature of polystyrene.
