Sixteen channels are allocated in the 2.4 GHz band, with each channel spaced 5 MHz apart, though using only 2 MHz of bandwidth. The radios use direct-sequence spread spectrum coding, which is managed by the digital stream into the modulator. Binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) {{is used in the}} 868 and 915 MHz bands, and offset <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> (OQPSK) that transmits two bits per symbol is used in the 2.4 GHz band.|$|E

The performance of cost-effective SSB WDM/ SCM implementations, without optical filters in the transmitter, presents a strong dependency on the imperfect sideband suppression ratio that can be directly achieved with the electro-optical modulator. A direct detected broadband multichannel SCM link composed of a state-of-the-art optical IQ modulator and five <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keyed</b> (QPSK) subcarriers per optical channel is presented, showing that a suppression ratio of 20 dB obtained directly with the modulator produced a penalty of 2 dB in overall performance, due to interference between adjacent optical channels...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} publication [1], an iterative closed-loop carrier synchronization scheme for binary <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keyed</b> (BPSK) modulation was proposed {{that was based}} on feeding back data decisions to the input of the loop, the purpose being to remove the modulation prior to carrier synchronization as opposed to the more conventional decision-feedback schemes that incorporate such feedback inside the loop. The idea there was that, with sufficient independence between the received data and the decisions on it that are fed back (as would occur in an error-correction coding environment with sufficient decoding delay), a “pure ” tone in the presence of noise would ultimately be produced (after sufficient iteration and low enough error probability) and thus could be tracked without any squaring loss. This article demonstrates that, with some modification, the same idea of iterative information reduction through decision feedback can be applied to <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keyed</b> (QPSK) modulation, something that was mentioned in the previous publication but never pursued.

50|$|In {{digital radio}} systems, several {{variable}} bit-rate data streams are multiplexed together to a fixed bitrate transport stream {{by means of}} statistical multiplexing. This {{makes it possible to}} transfer several video and audio channels simultaneously over the same frequency channel, together with various services. On communications satellites which carry broadcast television networks and radio networks, this is known as multiple channel per carrier or MCPC. Where multiplexing is not practical (such as where there are different sources using a single transponder), single channel per carrier mode (SCPC) is used. Digital SCPC differs from the older analog SCPC transmission method in that a digital SCPC signal carries more than just a single audio channel (two are used) but also coding and decoding information, ancillary and control data, and network identification data. Digital SCPC and MCPC subcarrier transmissions use satellite broadcast standards such as DVB-S and its successor DVB-S2 along with MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 compression formats, respectively. BPSK modulation has been replaced with newer modulation schemes such as QPSK (<b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying).</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of optically multiplexed multicarrier systems with channel spacing equal to the symbol rate per carrier, we propose and systematically investigate an electronic signal processing technique to achieve near-interchannel crosstalk free and intersymbol-interference (ISI) free operation. We theoretically show that achieving perfect orthogonality between channels in these systems, together with ISI free operation as needed in generic communication systems, requires the shaping of the spectral profiles of not only the demultiplexing filter, but also the signal of each channel before demultiplexing. We develop a novel semianalytical method to quantitatively analyze the levels of residual crosstalk and ISI arising from nonideal system response in these systems. We show that by prefiltering the signal {{to ensure that the}} system impulse response before channel demultiplexing approaches the targeted condition, the residual crosstalk due to imperfect orthogonality can be significantly mitigated and the necessity for carrier phase control in single-quadrature format-based system can be relaxed. Further combining prefiltering and receiver-side postfiltering to adaptively trim the demultiplexing filter enhances the performance. The use of the combined digital signal processing (DSP) in coherent-detection <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shifted</b> <b>keying</b> (QPSK) -based optically multiplexed multicarrier system shows that this method outperforms conventional QPSK-based multicarrier system without DSP or with only receiver-side DSP, especially when the responses of the transmitter and the demultiplexing filter are not precisely designed and the sampling rate of the analogue-to-digital converter is not sufficiently high. In addition, the inclusion of ISI free operation, with this aspect similar to the reshaping method in conventional wavelength-division-multiplexing systems, allows the relaxation of the modulation bandwidth and chromatic dispersion compensation...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 2001 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaDue {{to rapidly}} {{increasing}} downlink data rates between spacecraft and ground stations, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has developed an}} all-digital variable data rate receiver. The majority of the receiver is implemented on a single {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that is capable of processing data rates in excess of 300 mega-symbols per second or 600 mega-bits per second (Mbps) using <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keyed</b> (QPSK) modulation [1 - 5]. Developed jointly by the Goddard Space Flight Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the high rate digital demodulator (HRDD) ASIC uses parallel processing algorithms, which combined we call the advanced parallel receiver architecture (APRX), to perform the necessary functions of a satellite communications receiver. An overview of the next generation of the advanced parallel receiver architecture (APRX) is presented here, including a new parallel adaptive equalizer currently being implemented. The next generation receiver implementing this architecture will process in excess of 600 Megasymbols per second; the ASIC will process in excess of 1. 2 Gbps using quadrature amplitude modulation (QPSK) and 2. 4 Gbps using 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The majority of the functions of the receiver are performed in the next generation high rate digital demodulator ASIC. A key property of such high data rate wireless communications systems is the use bandwidth efficient modulations often achieved through the use of sophisticated pulseshaping. The next generation ASIC, like the current generation ASIC, is designed to have programmable matched filters. The detection/matched filter bank in the ASIC should be programmed to “match” the received pulse-shape. This is particularly important for good biterror- rate performance in systems employing higher order modulations, such as 16 -QAM employing partial-response pulse-shaping spanning many symbols. Such bandwidth efficient pulse-shaping methods require many coefficients in the matched filter; this creates increased computation and complexity in the receiver. Often such ideal receivers are not practical or possible to implement, and sub-optimal detection filtering techniques must be used. We will demonstrate that the use of a sub-optimum or truncated matched filter in some systems introduces severe intersymbol interference (ISI) distortion that results in poor BER results. However, we demonstrate for a specific pulse-shaped 16 -QAM that if the demodulated baseband symbols are processed with a relatively simple equalizer very good performance may be achieved. The overall system complexity of such a system may be much lower than implementing the true matched filter [6]. Finally we present an overview of the next generation advanced parallel receiver (APRX) capable of demodulating such pulse-shaped 16 -QAM that includes a novel parallel adaptive equalizer...|$|R
