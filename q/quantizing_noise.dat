Introduction. With the {{development}} of digital technology more {{attention is paid to}} making radio-receiving tracks based on SDR technology (Software Defined Radio), which is based on the processing of digitalized radio-frequency signals exclusively by means of software in real time. Moreover the construction of data-acquisition systems on one integral chip (SoC) is widely used right now. The main fundamental basis of SoC systems is the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). One important step of receiving of radio-frequency signals is a digital down conversion, followed by filtration and repeated decimation. Since processing in DDC is made in a fixed calculation format, than before the immediate implementation of this structure on FPGA, it is necessary to analyze the effect of fixed calculation bits on the quality of signal processing. Later {{it can be used to}} choose DDC internal calculation bits without sacrificing the set quality of signal processing and hardware resources on its implementation. In the well-known papers, analysis of the effect of signal quantization is reduced to two methods: deterministic and probability methods. Deterministic method gives the top-of the-line evaluation of <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> at the output of digital system. Probability method is based on evaluation of <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> dispersion at the output of the device. Evaluation of the signal and the quantization noise in the SDDC based on their PSD. In this section, mathematical expressions were obtained for the construction of PSD signal and the <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> at the output of each of the subsystems of the digital DDC. Criterion for selecting SDDC bit is the relative level of PSD <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> at the output of the digital system. Since the ADC is fixed, the choice of bit computing in SDDC should be such that the total <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> in SDDC would not exceed the ADC <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> at the output of the digital system. Example calculation and construction of PSD signal and quantization noise in Matlab for reception QPSK-signal. In this part of the article an example of the analysis of DDC structure for receiving QPSK- signal was considered. Mathematical Matlab's model has been developed which allows to calculate the PSD of the signal and the quantization noise depending on the internal structure of the SDDC bit based on the formulas of section 2 this paper. These expressions make it possible to construct a PSD noise separately from each SDDC source output, and separately estimate the contribution of each source of <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> to the total noise at the output of the digital system. From these results a decision on the choice of a particular quantization step that depends on the selected calculating bit at each stage of processing was made. Conclusions. <b>Quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> dispersion is not an adequate quality evaluation of processing in multi-stage and multi-rate systems, which include software DDC under review. In such systems the sequential changes of the line, as well as the nature of the spectrum of interfering components, including quantization noise, happen. Therefore in this paper I propose a different approach based on the calculation of the power spectral density (PSD) of the <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> at the output of the device, taking into account the filtering effect of all of its stages and repeated decimation. ? ?????? ?????? ????????? ????? ??????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ?? ????????? ??????? ? ????????

40|$|The {{basic concept}} of three-level delta {{modulation}} (TLDM) is to quantize the error signal of a delta modulator into three levels {{instead of the}} usual two levels as in ordinary DM.

The problem of transmitting these signals over a noisy channel is examined, where the input signal is band-limited Gaussian noise. Two parameters that can be adjusted to optimize the performance of the system with respect to <b>quantizing</b> <b>noise</b> are considered: step size and quantizer threshold setting. The effect of additive channel noise on the performance of a TLDM system is assessed in terms of baseband transmission, probability of error, FSK and PSK transmission, transmission bandwidth, and baseband pulse transmission.

Successive approximation, which makes use of a D/A converter to achieve A/D is thoroughly examined. The lab also explores companding. While designing systems that interface with the real world, it is often necessary to get analog data {{from the real world}} into the computer for processing and similarly to bring digital data out of the computer back into analog form. These processes describe A/D and D/A conversion, respectively. This lab explores the hardware and software components and the processes used to accomplish such conversions. Conversions are usually linear but there are instances in which there is significant benefit to non-linear conversions. Human hearing, for instance, has a logarithmic sensitivity scale and it makes sense to emphasize weak audio and suppress loud audio for listener comfort. In a compressor/expander (compander) arrangement, voice on a telephone line becomes more intelligible against noise because quiet signals become quantized in finer detail while louder signals have a coarse conversion with larger quantization steps.

We compute these statistics, and compare results with computer simulations and with observations. We consider cross-correlation of two signals (or auto-correlation of one); we suppose that each signal is complex, and consists of spectrally-varying Gaussian noise. Variance and covariance {{as a function of}} frequency thus completely characterize the signals. We suppose that these signals are then quantized, and correlated. For many samples, the correlation is drawn from a Gaussian distribution at each frequency, and is completely characterized by its average and variance. The average correlation is proportional to that of the unquantized signals (or is related linearly, for an autocorrelation). The variance of the correlation depends on the spectra of the signals and on the quantizer levels. Specifically, it is a product of linear functions of the normalized autocorrelation spectra of the two signals. We present expressions for the variance, and compare results with computer simulations and with VLBI observations of the Vela pulsar. We find excellent agreement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a novel general strategy for building steganography detectors for digital images. The process starts with assembling a rich {{model of the}} noise component as a union of many diverse submodels formed by joint distributions of neighboring samples from <b>quantized</b> image <b>noise</b> residuals obtained using linear and non-linear high-pass filters. In contrast to previous approaches, we make the model assembly {{a part of the}} training process driven by samples drawn from the corresponding cover- and stego-sources. Ensemble classifiers are used to assemble the model as well as the final steganalyzer due to their low computational complexity and ability to efficiently work with high-dimensional feature spaces and large training sets. We demonstrate the proposed framework on three steganographic algorithms designed to hide messages in images represented in the spatial domain: HUGO, edgeadaptive algorithm by Luo et al. [32], and optimallycoded ternary ± 1 embedding. For each algorithm, we apply a simple submodel-selection technique to increase the detection accuracy per model dimensionality and show how the detection saturates with increasing complexity of the rich model. By observing the differences between how different submodels engage in detection, an interesting interplay between the embedding and detection is revealed. Steganalysis built around rich image models combined with ensemble classifiers is a promising direction towards automatizing steganalysis for a wide spectrum of steganographic schemes. I...|$|R

Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation of the fault pattern leads to a difficult combinatorial optimization problem, so we propose a variation in which an approximate maximum a posteriori probability estimate is found instead, by solving a convex relaxation of the original problem, followed by rounding and simple local optimization. Our method is extremely efficient, and scales to very large problems, involving thousands (or more) possible faults and measurements.

The filter models short-term redundancy in time; the shape of the power spectrum of the signal and the residual <b>noise,</b> <b>quantized</b> using an algebraic codebook, is used for reconstruction of the waveforms. In addition to temporal redundancy, redundancy in the coding of the filter and residual noise across spatially related signals is also exploited, yielding better compression performance in terms of SNR for a given bit rate. The proposed coding technique was tested on sets of multichannel electromyography (EMG) and EEG signals as representative examples. For 2 -D EMG recordings of 56 signals, the coding technique resulted in SNR greater than 3. 4 ± 1. 3 dB with respect to independent coding of the signals in the grid when the compression ratio was 89 %. For EEG recordings of 15 signals and the same compression ratio as for EMG, the average gain in SNR was 2. 4 ± 0. 1 dB. In conclusion, a method for exploiting both the temporal and spatial redundancy, typical of multidimensional biomedical signals, has been proposed and proved to be superior to previous coding scheme...|$|R
