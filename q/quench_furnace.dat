The results mean that the cooling rate of works will be slow there. Different exit velocities of five nozzles cause the uneven flow distribution, which will affect the cooling uniformity of works.

40|$|Monotectic alloy {{materials}} {{are created by}} rapid melt/rapid solidification processing on the NASA KC- 135. Separation of the uniform liquid into two liquids may occur by either of two processes; spinodal decomposition or nucleation followed by growth. In the first case, the liquid is unstable to composition waves, which form and grow, giving liquids of two different compositions. In the latter process discrete particles of the second liquid phase form via thermal fluctuations and then grow by diffusion. The two processes are very different, with the determining process being dictated by temperature, composition, and thermodynamic characteristics of the alloy. The first two quantities are process variables, while the third is determined by electronic interactions between the atoms in the alloy. In either case the initial alloy decomposition is followed by coarsening, resulting in growth of the particle size at nearly constant volume fraction. In particular, reduced gravity experiments on monotectic solutions have shown a number of interesting results in the KC- 135. Monotectic solutions exhibit a miscibility gap in the liquid state, and consequently, gravity driven forces can dominate the solidification parameters at 1 g. In reduced gravity however, {{the distribution of the}} phases is different, resulting in new and interesting microstructures. The Rapid Melt/Rapid <b>Quench</b> <b>Furnace</b> allows one to melt a sample and resolidify it in one parabola of the KC- 135 's flight path, thus eliminating any accumulative influence of multiple parabolas to affect the microstructure of the material...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for stronger and better-performance materials {{in response to the}} limited energy supply and the finite natural resources, {{it is important to understand}} the microstructure formation in a multicomponent and multiphase alloys. This knowledge can help to tackle the challenges in designing new materials that are typically multicomponent. Eutectic alloys are one of the interesting materials offering superior casting and advantageous mechanical properties. However, the current knowledge is only limited to binary and some ternary systems. Thus the aim of this study is to expand the eutectic growth theory to higher order system, including further investigation of a special divorced eutectic growth in a ternary alloy and the expansion of the knowledge of the coupled eutectic growth to a model quaternary system. Both unconstrained and constrained growth processing techniques are used in this study. The former is realized in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) which offers accurate heating and cooling control and thus near isothermal conditions. The latter is achieved either in the advanced solidification processing facility (ASPF) of Department of Materials Engineering, KU Leuven or in the European Space Agency Solidification and <b>Quench</b> <b>Furnace</b> (ESA SQF) installed in the Materials Science Lab (MSL) on the International Space Station (ISS). Two types of three-dimensional (3 D) characterization techniques, namely computer tomography (CT) and serial sectioning technique using the focused ion beam technique (FIB), are applied to characterize the intermetallic phase particles in the Al-Mn-Si alloy and the quaternary eutectic structure in the model Al-Cu-Ag-Mg quaternary alloy. Banded structure caused by the symbiotic growth mechanism is successfully achieved in the Al-Mn-Si sample processed in the ESA SQF. The 3 D analysis shows that intermetallic particles formed in the Al-Mn-Si eutectic alloy have different sizes, which contradicts the single value predicted by the conventional particle pushing and engulfment transition model (PET). A new mechanism including the effect of TiB 2 particles which was neglected in previous studies is proposed and shows qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Various three-phase and four-phase eutectics are determined in the model Al-Cu-Ag-Mg alloy processed in the DSC. The univariant three-phase eutectics in the quaternary alloy show similar morphologies as their counterparts in the ternary eutectics. The four-phase eutectics in the quaternary alloy are categorized to two groups based on their different constituent eutectic phases and show primarily fibrous morphology. 3 D reconstruction of the directionally solidified quaternary eutectic confirms the fibrous structure and unveils the fiber merging and splitting behaviors that are different from the 2 D observations. The formation of the complex four-phase eutectic structure is a result of the complex solute distribution process in multicomponent systems and is in agreement with the prediction of Cooksey and Hellawel. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} and thermodynamics of the Nb-O {{system and the}} related Ti-Nb-O system were studied to elucidate: 1) Kinetic characteristics of block structure oxides at T> 1300 Â°C, 2) Thermo dynamic properties of block structure oxides at T> 1300 Â°C and 3) Phase equilibria in the metastable Nb 2 O 5 systems. Single crystals of B- and P-Nb 2 O 5. were prepared by the Chemical Vapour Transport Technique Tinder predominantly convection controlled conditions. Phase equilibria experiments were carried out in a Cahn microbalance system and a newly designed Horizontal <b>Quench</b> <b>Furnace</b> line. Controlled oxygen potentials were generated from CO 2 /CO or CO 2 /H 2 gas mixtures. Structural studies of the oxides involved X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Results of phase equilibria studies in the NbO 2 - (B-Nb 2 O 5) system at 750 Â°C <T< 900 Â°C indicated that the transformation of B- to the block structure phase takes place readily on the area of contact with the Pt. container, probably catalyzed by the platinum surface. The transformed oxides contained both disordered and ordered fragments. In diffraction studies, the disordered structures simulated the tetragonal symmetry of M-Nb 2 O 5, the existence of which was contradicted by HRTEM results. A new phase Nb 43 O 107 having monoclinic lattice parameters of a = 20. 3 Ã, b = 3. 8 Ã, c = 61. 5 Ã and Î² = 117 Â° was detected in the ordered crystals. Its structural relationships with the neighbouring phases in the Nb-O system is discussed. At 700 Â°C and controlled oxygen potentials, B-Nb 2 O 5 transformed directly into NbO 2 on reduction. In the system NbO 2 - (P-Nb 2 O 5) at isotherm 750 Â°C and controlled oxygen potentials, Nb 12 O 29 existed as the only stable intermediate phase. Phase equilibria in the system (Ti-Nb-O) were determined by equilibrating TiNb 2 O 7, Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 and TiNb 24 O 62 at 1400 Â°C. The oxide-gas equilibrium was attained rapidly (< 1 hr). The (p, x) isotherms showed complete bivariance in the systems (Ti,Nb) O 2 - TiNb 2 O 7, (Ti,Nb) O 2 - Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 and (Ti,Nb) O 2 - TiNb 24 O 62.

An abrupt process: TiNb 2 O 7 â metastable transient Me 25 O 60 â Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 was also detected. Associated with the reduction of Ti-Nb oxides is the generation of a rutile phase Ti x Nb 1 -x O 2, the composition of which is dependent upon the oxygen potential.

In the case of coated steels, like Usibor® 1500 P, furnace heating also transforms a protective Al-Si layer into a permanent Al-Si-Fe intermetallic coating. Modeling this process requires knowledge of the thermophysical properties of the material, specifically, radiative properties and how the sensible energy and latent heat of austenitization change with blank temperature. While the sensible energy is known, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the radiative properties and the latent heat of austenitization. In this work the effective specific heat of Usibor® 1500 P is inferred through inverse analysis of temperature data collected on coupons heated in a muffle furnace. This technique is first used to validate the heat transfer model, and then used to reveal the distribution of latent heat of austenitization at higher temperatures. The characterization of the radiative properties is carried out on Gleeble-heated coupons using a near-infrared spectrometer and a Fourier transform infrared reflectometer.

40|$|Quartz and orthopyroxene in mafic {{rocks are}} {{commonly}} observed {{to be surrounded}} by fringes of granular pyroxene, and of olivine and clinopyroxene, respectively. This study reproduces the conditions of formation of these textures, and investigates their origins, kinetics and phase relations. Pieces of silica glass or crystals of orthopyroxene were dissolved into tholeiitic and slightly alkaline basalts, suspended from wire loops in an atmospheric pressure <b>quenching</b> <b>furnace,</b> and run for 10 minutes to 32 days at subliquidus temperatures between 1120 ° and 1190 °C and oxygen fugacities close to the QFM buffer. Polished sections of charges were examined primarily by backscattered electron imagery and by microprobe analysis. The textures developed in silica dissolution experiments consist of fringes of elongate skeletal pyroxenes radially arranged around the silica. The pyroxenes first nucleate {{on the surface of the}} silica. As dissolution continues, growth continues mostly on existing crystals, rather than by the nucleation of additional crystals. Dissolution rates for silica range from 2. 8 * 10 ⁻¹¹ to 4. 4 * 10 ⁻¹⁰ms⁻¹, and are time-independent until growth of the pyroxene fringe hinders transport processes in the melt. This causes dissolution to slow down, until it ceases altogether after 3 to 8 days. A silica-rich layer of melt forms around the surface of charges run at higher temperatures, suggesting that convection driven by variations in surface tension may operate in the charges. The textures developed in orthopyroxene dissolution experiments consist of granular olivines, some of which nucleate on the pyroxene surface, whereas others nucleate within the pyroxene as a result of the decomposition of included phases. With time, olivine crystals become connected and form complex grain shapes. Dissolution rates for orthopyroxene range from 1. 7 * 10 ⁻¹¹ to 1. 2 * 10 ⁻⁹ ms⁻¹. At higher temperatures dissolution rates are constant, but at lower temperatures dissolution is time-dependent. Unlike silica dissolution, orthopyroxene dissolution does not cease as a result of continued neocryst growth hindering melt transport, indicating that the fringe remains permeable. For both systems, the neocryst compositions are strongly dependent on the chemistry of the melt formed at the interface between the dissolving crystal and the bulk melt, and the neocrysts may be metastable with respect to the bulk melt. Chemical equilibration of olivine neocrysts with time is observed for longer experiments. Textural equilibration of olivine grains occurs by the processes of liquid-phase sintering in runs longer than 12 hours. Subliquidus dissolution data are applied to textures from natural samples collected from dykes, lava flows and lava lakes, to estimate the residence time of reacted crystals; values range from 0. 6 to 208 days for reacted quartz, and from 0. 7 to 462 days for reacted orthopyroxenes.

Whilst nitrogen {{is by far the most}} common quenching gas, helium is a viable option where higher cooling rates are required, particularly for carburised components. This paper explores the improvements in gas quenching technology that allow components manufactured from standard carburising steels to be quenched with high-pressure helium and illustrates the improvements it offers over high pressure nitrogen quenching. As helium is an expensive rare gas, recycle systems make its use more economically attractive. The factors that need to be taken into account when designing such systems, including the necessity for purification, are discussed. Sources of helium and the means of delivery, particularly in Asia, are also covered...|$|R

After compacted, sintering process {{has been done in}} vacuum pressure (10 - 4 torr) at (550 oC for 120 minute) and (900 oC for 60 minute) then cooling inside <b>furnace.</b> <b>Quenching</b> heat treatment carry out at (850 oC for 60 minute) then cooling in cold water to (3 - 4 oC). The microstructure has been studied by optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM), porosity, compression behavior(stress-strain) for quenched specimens also have been studied. The results have been approached that the hardness increases with percent chrome while the porosity decreases. The compression stresses to fracture, have been increased with respect to (0. 3...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{chalcogenides}} {{have delivered}} the highest efficiencies among thermoelectric materials. Although the thermal stability of thermoelectric materials at device operating temperatures {{has been of}} concern, recent studies have reported the efficiencies of materials prepared with different fabrication techniques. Here, we have fabricated a p-type, multiphase lead chalcogenide compound of (PbTe) 0. 55 (PbS) 0. 35 (PbSe) 0. 1, with three common fabrication techniques of <b>quenched,</b> quenched-annealed and <b>furnace</b> cooled followed by spark plasma sintering. The compound contains PbS-rich precipitates within a PbTe-rich matrix. The achieved samples from various fabrication procedures demonstrate distinct microstructures that evolve with thermal cycling. We {{have shown that the}} thermoelectric efficiency of metastable compound is irreversible during thermal cycling, and changes by only three thermal cycles during measurements. Our findings highlight the importance of the choice of fabrication and post-processing techniques for thermoelectric materials...|$|R
40|$|Phase change {{memory devices}} {{are based on}} the rapid and {{reversible}} amorphous to crystalline transformations of phase change materials, such as Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 and AgInSbTe. Since the maximum switching speed of these devices is typically limited by crystallization speed, understanding the crystallization process is of crucial importance. While Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 and AgInSbTe show very different crystallization mechanisms from their melt quenched states, the nanostructural origin of this difference has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we show that an amorphous state includes different sizes and number of nanoscale nuclei, after thermal treatment such as melt <b>quenching</b> or <b>furnace</b> annealing is performed. We employ fluctuation transmission electron microscopy to detect nanoscale nuclei embedded in amorphous materials, and use a pump probe laser technique and atomic force microscopy to study the kinetics of nucleation and growth. We confirm that melt quenched amorphous Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 includes considerably larger and more quenched in nuclei than its as deposited state, while melt quenched AgInSbTe does not, and explain this contrast by the different ratio between quenching time and nucleation time in these materials. In addition to providing insights to the crystallization process in these technologically important devices, this study presents experimental illustrations of temperature dependence of nucleation rate and growth speed, which was predicted by theory of phase transformation but rarely demonstrated.
