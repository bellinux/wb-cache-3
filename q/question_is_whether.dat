5|$|An ongoing <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> RAD {{should be}} thought of as a {{disorder}} of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

25|$|A natural <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> every infinite-dimensional Banach {{space has}} an infinite-dimensional {{subspace}} with an unconditional basis. This was solved negatively by Timothy Gowers and Bernard Maurey in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> {{language}} is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, {{or whether it is}} a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.|$|E
25|$|Undue {{influence}} is an equitable doctrine that involves one person {{taking advantage of}} a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption.|$|E

25|$|In {{computing}} it may {{be required}} to generate permutations of a given sequence of values. The methods best adapted to do this depend on whether one wants some randomly chosen permutations, or all permutations, and in the latter case if a specific ordering is required. Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> possible equality among entries in the given sequence is to be taken into account; if so, one should only generate distinct multiset permutations of the sequence.|$|E
25|$|Carrying out a {{military}} plan in winter {{was not the}} major failure of the operation. A valid <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> or not the plan could have been executed better. It {{would be hard to}} exceed the performance of the Turkish soldiers. The IX and X Corps marched with maximum effectiveness given the conditions. The majority of the units managed to move to the correct positions. In respect to the inflicted Russian casualties, they should be credited.|$|E
25|$|Originalism {{allows the}} dead hand of prior generations to control {{important}} contemporary issues to an extraordinary and unnecessary level of detail. While {{everyone agrees that}} broad constitutional principles should control, if the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> abortion is a fundamental right, why should past centuries-old intentions be controlling? The originalist's distinction between original meaning and original intention here is unclear due {{to the difficulty of}} discussing meaning in terms of specific details that the Constitutional text does not clarify.|$|E
50|$|Accepting {{that the}} {{appellant}} {{had not been}} defended properly, the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> it had amounted to a fatal irregularity which vitiated the proceedings.|$|R
25|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Davis, {{the sitting}} governor, should be recalled; those voting on it were 55.4% {{in favor of}} recall and 44.6% opposed.|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{assessments}} including examinations {{are most}} common or traditional form of assessment. At times these are replaced or supplemented by performance tests {{not only as}} an alternative means of assessment, but also for improvement of student learning and performance. This paper presents a study designed to examine three questions. The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> a performance test administered {{in conjunction with a}} traditional cognitive test result in increased learning beyond the traditional test alone as indicated by scores on the traditional cognitive test. The second <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the order of administration of a performance test and a traditional test result in differential learning as indicated by the combination of performance test and traditional test scores. The third <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the order of administration of performance test and traditional test affect knowledge retention as indicated by a final exam. Statistical analysis of the results is presented...|$|R
25|$|Other {{mechanisms}} {{have also}} been proposed, in particular, Alfvén waves, wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by Hannes Alfvén (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> these waves might just be {{a different way of}} looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.|$|E
25|$|A major <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> human {{psychological}} faculties {{are mostly}} innate {{or whether they}} are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share {{the same set of}} basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether,</b> {{if there}} was a {{perceptible}} beat, it was heard at regular intervals as in modern western music, or irregularly. Gratwick argues that the ictus was not isochronous, but that the timing depended on whether the anceps syllables were long or short. His view is that so far from attempting to make the word accent match the ictus, Roman writers often deliberately tried to avoid such coincidence, especially {{at the beginning and end}} of the line, to avoid monotony.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the lapse of {{time was}} reasonable, {{taking into consideration}} {{the nature of the}} prejudice suffered, the nature of the case, and the systematic delay.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> there <b>was</b> an {{unlawful}} conspiracy, and {{the second}} <b>question</b> <b>was</b> how to measure the damages for any loss, given the difficulty of knowing how many people might have attended different films.|$|R

25|$|Human {{missions}} to Mars will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements. A key <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> astronauts can have {{different sets of}} reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important {{so that it can}} be determined to what extent the Sensory-motor coupling skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{historical}} {{scholars have}} focused on the timing and the formation of the Mishnah. A vital <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> it is composed of sources which date from its editor's lifetime, and to what extent is it composed of earlier, or later sources. Are Mishnaic disputes distinguishable along theological or communal lines, and in what ways do different sections derive from different schools of thought within early Judaism? Can these early sources be identified, and if so, how? In response to these questions, modern scholars have adopted a number of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E

50|$|During the lead-up to the Iraq War, two <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> raised {{regarding}} {{an alleged}} connection between Saddam Hussein's government and al-Qaeda. The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda had a cooperative relationship, {{and the second}} <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Saddam Husein's government supported the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|R
25|$|Assuming that an indeterministic {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is {{for all practical purposes}} confined to microscopic phenomena. This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some hardware random number generators work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition), this in itself would mean that such traditional free will does not exist (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} unanswered <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> such rare variants exist {{because of}} chance mutations, population founder events and maintenance by {{processes such as}} drift, or whether there is any selective advantage involved in their maintenance and spread. An {{example of such a}} rare variant effect was recently discovered among Samoan islanders. Among the islanders the variant is extremely common, but in other populations it is extremely rare or absent. The variant predisposes to obesity but strangely is protective against type 2 diabetes. Based on cell studies it was suggested the variant may protect individuals against periods of 'famine' and there is also evidence that it has been under positive selection. The most likely scenario then is that this rare variant was established in the islanders by a founder effect among a small initial colonising population, and was able to spread because of a selective advantage it conferred within that small group. Hence, in small populations under particular environmental conditions it may be feasible that the 'thrifty gene' idea is correct. It {{remains to be seen if}} rare variants that fill the gap in the missing heritability estimates are also 'thrifty genes' or if they are rare chance events sustained by drift, as implicated for the common variants currently linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

And what sacrifices, what obstacles, will these people endure? That's the emotion line of the film [...] its reason for existence," [...] he recalled. While Spock's bodily resurrection was complete, his mind was a blank slate—The Search for Spock, Michele and Duncan Barrett argue, says that the important <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> an individual's mind functions, as {{this is the key}} to a meaningful existence.|$|E
