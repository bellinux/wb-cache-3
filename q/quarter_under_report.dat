5000|$|Lindahl {{pricing and}} {{taxation}} requires {{the knowledge of}} the demand functions for each individual for all private and public goods.

Each individual can lower his tax cost by <b>under</b> <b>reporting</b> his benefits derived from the public good or service. This informational problem shows that survey-based Lindahl taxation is not incentive compatible. Incentives to understate or <b>under</b> <b>report</b> one's true benefits under Lindahl taxation resemble those of a traditional public goods game.|$|R
