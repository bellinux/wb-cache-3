5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves {{before reaching the}} target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Thomas ap Rhys, Gruffydd grow <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince's tomb.|$|E
5|$|Dacre Castle was {{probably}} built by Margaret Multon, {{the wife of}} Ralph Dacre, {{in the middle of}} the 14th century. The Dacre family had risen in prominence in Cumbria during the 12th and early 13th centuries, and William Dacre, Ralph's father, had acquired a licence to crenellate the property of Dunmallogt in 1307, <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the future site of Dacre Castle. Ralph married Margaret in 1317, becoming extremely wealth as a result, and received permission to found Naworth Castle in 1335. Margaret built Dacre Castle at some point between Ralph's death in 1339 and 1354, with the intention of creating a fortified home. Many tower houses were built across the region during the period in response to the threat of Scottish raids and invasions. There may have been an older building already on the site, possibly moated, but this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this article, the {{molecular}} weight of wet Natural Rubber (NR) with different initial moisture contents, 3. 80 %, 10. 05 %, 19. 76 %, respectively, dried by microwave at frequency of 2450 MHz was investigated using GPC. It {{can be seen}} from the results that an obvious trend of Mn and Mw changes was presented. With the increment of initial moisture contents, Mn and Mw decreased gradually. The molecular weight distribution (d) increased with the initial moisture contents increment, but <b>quite</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> each other...|$|R

5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> one another.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow is less social {{than other}} sparrows while breeding, {{due to its}} dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it {{sometimes}} breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, {{it has not been}} recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ground, especially when they are built in trees.|$|E
