40|$|International audienceWe examine French nominal {{pairs of}} the type BERGER 'shepherd' ~ BERGÈRE 'shepherdess' and CHIEN 'dog' ~ CHIENNE 'bitch dog'. These pairs are {{considered}} {{from the viewpoint of}} their lexicographic modeling in an Explanatory Combinatorial lexical database: the French Lexical Network (fr-FLN). We first present, in section  1, the linguistic problem we are dealing with; we identify two main types of semantic relations involved in these lexical pairs: sex-based <b>quasi-synonymy</b> [...] that is analyzed in detail in section  2 [...] and sex-based contrastive opposition [...] dealt with in section  3. As conclusion, section  4, we look at the implications of our modeling of such relations on the graph structure of the fr-FLN...|$|E

The Prolex model is based on two main concepts: firstly, a language independent pivot and, secondly, the prolexeme (the projection of the pivot onto particular language), that {{is a set of}} lemmas (names and derivatives). These two concepts model the variations of proper name: firstly, independent of language and, secondly, language dependent by morphology or knowledge. Variation processing is very important for NLP: the same proper name can be written in different instances, maybe in different parts of speech, and it can also be replaced by another one, a lexical anaphora (that reveals semantic link). The pivot represents different referent's points of view, i. e. language independent variations of name. Pivots are linked by three semantic relations (<b>quasi-synonymy,</b> partitive relation and associative relation). The prolexeme is a set of variants (aliases), quasi-synonyms and morphosemantic derivatives. Prolexemes are linked to classifying contexts and reliability code...|$|E
