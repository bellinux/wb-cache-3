50|$|Similar to the {{preceding}} days, the slow moving trough and associated cold front moved slowly eastward on May 21. Strong instability {{ahead of the}} system prompted the SPC to issue a moderate risk of severe thunderstorms for extreme southeast Oklahoma, southwest Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and northeast Texas; however, the main threat was damaging winds rather than tornadoes. With CAPE values of 2,500-4,000 J/kg and 50 to 65 mph shear across the region, conditions were once again favorable {{for the development of}} supercells capable of producing large hail. Activity was expected to be scattered at first, with some isolated supercells capable of producing tornadoes, but a squall line was anticipated to develop quickly and become the dominant feature. In the Northeast and Great Lakes region, southwesterly flow ahead of the trough brought warm, moist air into the area. Moderate instability, with CAPE values ranging from 1,000-2,000 J/kg and steep lapse rates were supporting of damaging straight-line winds, especially across Michigan, New York and Massachusetts. Later on, instability increased in the Northeast along a <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>front,</b> leading to the risk of isolated supercells and a mesoscale convective system.|$|E

Fogs have more serious consequences in the Lechang-Ruyuan section of the Beijing-Zhuhai Expressway (the longest expressway in China) that passes through {{the main part of the}} Nanling Mts., where the road rises from 200 m to more than 800 m above sea level (ASL). For a major motorway in the mountainous areas of Nanling Mts., two multidisciplinary integrated eld observations were carried out, which measured visibility by the naked eyes, visibility by instrument, spectrum of fog-drops, liquid water content (LWC) of fog, tethered sounding, dual-parameter low-level sounding, turbulence diusion within fog layers, aerosol spectra of size and composition, sampled fog water compositions, and sampled rainwater compositions. Typical cases were probed for their analyses of synoptics, micro- and macro-structures and microphysics. It is understood that heavy fogs take place with high frequency in the area and bring about serious consequences.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} the factors {{leading to the}} climatological precipitation gradient between the northern Alpine rim and the Alpine foreland, based on routine observations and reanalysis-driven simulations with the MM 5 model for the time period of 1991 – 2000. To investigate the relative contribution of different precipitation types, precipitation events are classified into 4 groups. These are: Cold fronts, warm fronts, convection and a group carrying the remaining events. Convective precipitation in connection with fronts is attributed to the respective frontal class. Unclassified events predominantly consist of postfrontal upslope precipitation and <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>fronts.</b> In addition, the wind direction at Alpine crest level (700 hPa) is used to categorize the events, and a distinction between summer and winter is made. Two mechanisms {{are found to be}} mainly responsible for the precipitation gradient towards the Alps. On the one hand, con-vective precipitation in connection with southwesterly flows is more abundant in the Alps than in the adjacent forelands because convection is primarily triggered over the Alps. This mechanism is predominantly active in summer. On the other hand, frontal precipitation in connection with northwesterly and northerly winds is intensified at the northern Alpine rim due to orographic lifting. Also, postfrontal precipitation occurring with northerly flow is more intense in the Alps than in the foreland. In contrast, fronts from exactly 270 ◦ produce more precipitation in the forelands than in the Alps. In this case, the wind blows parallel to the mountain range and lee effects related to upstream topography reduce the precipitation intensity in the Alps...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tropical}} rain belt ‘Changma front’ is {{created in the}} Bay of Bengal and the western North Pacific as a sub-system of East Asian Monsoon. The northward movement of the ‘Changma front’ {{is influenced by the}} development of the subtropical ridge. This northward moving <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>front</b> is called 'Changma' in South Korea, which represents the main precipitation period. [...] The ‘Changma front’ takes about 4 to 5 weeks to go through the Korea Peninsula. This slow movement results in a large, but steady, amount of summer rainfall over the entire Korea Peninsula in late June and July each year. In recent years, the ‘Changma front’ tended to move quickly, taking less than 3 weeks to go through the Korea Peninsula while pouring down heavy rain showers, along with various sizes of storms from late July to early August. It means that we are having more extreme weather and localized heavy rain occurring after ‘Changma’. The dynamics of the ‘Changma’ rains in the early summer, which derive from baroclinic disturbances that are strongly modified by latent heat release, remain poorly understood. While an increase in rainfall {{in the absence of the}} monsoonal circulation shifts is expected, relatively modest shifts or changes in timing can significantly affect East Chinese, Korean and Japanese climates.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] 4 {{remarkable}} {{example of}} gravity wave propagation over the southeastern United States on Dec. 3, 1968, is described. The wave developed within {{the cold air}} north of a <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>front</b> {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico in apparent responde to convective activity associated with a weak cyclonic disturbance on the front. The wave maintained its identity for 14 hr while propagating east-southeastward at 13 m/s in a direction nearly opposite to the low-level flow. Gravity-wave-related pressure drops exceeded 7 mb over an average period of 1 hr. Strong and gusty winds blowing perpendicularly to the isobars toward lower pressure accompanied the waverelated pressure fall. Precipitation of several hours duration ceased abruptly with the wave passage, along with increases in the ceiling and horizontal visibility.

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of climate change}} in the Korean Peninsula has been examined {{in view of the}} general increase in greenhouse gases. Analyses include changes in annual temperature and precipitation. These analyses are supple-mented with our observations regarding the apparent decrease of forest areas. It was found that there was a 0. 96 C (0. 42 C per decade) increase in annual mean temperature between 1974 and 1997. The increase in large cities was 1. 5 C but only 0. 58 C at rural and marine stations. The difference in the mean temperature between large cities and rural stations was small from 1974 to 1981. However, the difference increased from 1982 to 1997. In particular, the warming appears most significant in winter. Prior to 1982, the lowest temperatures were often ÿ 18 C in central Korea, and since then the lowest temperatures have been only ÿ 12 ÿ 14 C. Re-cently, the minimum January temperature has increased at a rate of 1. 5 C per decade. It is estimated that the increase of 1 C in annual mean temperature corresponds to about a 250 km northward shift of the subtropical zone boundary. The analysis of data from 1906 to 1997 indicates a trend of increasing annual precipitation, an increase of 182 mm during the 92 -year peirod, with large year-to-year variations. More than half of the annual mean amount, 1, 274 mm, occurred from June to September. Meteorological data and satellite observations suggest that changes have occurred in the characteristics of the <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>fronts</b> that produce summer rain. In recent years scattered local heavy showers usually occur with an inactive showery front, in comparison with the classical steady rain for more than three weeks. For instance, local heavy rainfall, on 6 August 1998 was in the range of 123 – 481 mm. The scattered convective storms resulted in flooding with a heavy toll of approx. 500 people. The northward shift of the inactive showery front over Korea, and of a convergence zone in central China, correlate with the increase in tem-perature. It has been suggested that the decrease in forest areas and the change in ground cover also contribute to the warming of the Korean Peninsula. 1...|$|R

In the present study, we have performed a two-dimensional (2 D) electromagnetic full particle simulation with a "shock-rest-frame model". The simulation domain is taken to be larger than the ion inertial length in order to include full kinetics of both electrons and ions. The present simulation result has confirmed the transition of shock structures from the cyclic self-reformation to the <b>quasi-stationary</b> shock <b>front.</b> During the transition, electrons and ions are thermalized in the direction parallel to the shock magnetic field. Ions are thermalized by low-frequency electromagnetic waves (or rippled structures) excited by strong ion temperature anisotropy at the shock foot, while electrons are thermalized by high-frequency electromagnetic waves (or whistler mode waves) excited by electron temperature anisotropy at the shock overshoot. Ion acoustic waves are also excited at the shock overshoot where the electron parallel temperature becomes higher than the ion parallel temperature. We expect that ion acoustic waves are responsible for parallel diffusion of both electrons and ions, and that a cross-scale coupling between an ion-scale mesoscopic instability and an electron-scale microscopic instability is important for structures and dynamics of a collisionless perpendicular shock.

40|$|One of {{the main}} oceanographic {{features}} in the Southwest Atlantic is the transport of cold waters of Sub-Antarctic origin along the Patagonian slope to temperate latitudes (40 - 42 ºS) by the Falkland Current. Originating from the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Drake Passage, the Current splits into two main northward streams skirting the Falkland Islands from west and east. The strongest eastern branch meanders onto the shelf {{to the south of}} Beauchêne Island and north-east of the Falkland Islands and creates four fronts with strong upwellings of the Sub-Antarctic Surface Water Mass (SASW). Extension of SASW to the shelf break and its mixture with shelf waters creates quasi-stationary areas of high productivity.

Deepwater toothfish and squid (Onykia ingens) use them as pathways to migrate from the shelf to deepwater habitats.

An 11 -yr climatology for three frequent types of frontal system–tropical convection interaction is built, and the associated day-to-day convection variability is described using satellite images, complex principal components, and wavelet transforms. Type 1 is frequent throughout the year, especially in austral summer, and {{is characterized by the}} penetration of a cold front in subtropical SA that interacts with tropical convection and moves with it into lower tropical latitudes. Type 2 is also more frequent in austral summer and is characterized by Amazon convection and enhancement of a quasi-stationary northwest–southeast-oriented band of convection extending from the Amazon basin to subtropical SA along the passage of a cold front in the subtropics. When the type 2 pattern remains longer than 4 days over SA, it often characterizes the South Atlantic convergence zone. Type 3, which is more frequent in austral winter, is represented by a <b>quasi-stationary</b> cold <b>front</b> in subtropical SA and midlatitudes without significant interaction with tropical convection.

NAM adequately simulated the general synoptic features associated with the frontal environments (e. g., patterns in the low-level wind fields) {{as well as the}} positions of the fronts. However, kinematic fields important to frontogenesis such as horizontal deformation and convergence were overpredicted. Surface-based convective available potential energy (CAPE) and precipitable water were also overpredicted, which was likely related to the overprediction of the kinematic fields through convergence of water vapor flux. In addition, a spurious coherence between forecast deformation and precipitation was found using spatial correlation coefficients. Composite precipitation forecasts featured a broad area of rainfall stretched parallel to the composite front, whereas the composite observed precipitation covered a smaller area and had aWNW–ESE orientation relative to the front, consistent with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) propagating at a slight right angle relative to the thermal gradient. Thus, deficiencies in the NAM precipitation forecasts may at least partially result from the inability to depict MCSs properly. It was observed that errors in the precipitation forecasts appeared to lag those of the kinematic fields, and so it seems likely that deficiencies in the precipitation forecasts are related to the overprediction of the kinematic fields such as deformation. However, no attempts were made to establish whether the overpredicted kinematic fields actually contributed to the errors in the precipitation forecasts or whether the overpredicted kinematic fields were simply an artifact of the precipitation errors. Regardless of the relationship between such errors, recognition of typical warm-season environments associated with these errors should be useful to operational forecasters...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the interannual variations of the East Asian summer monsoon {{and that of the}} tropical SST shows considerable variations. In this study, rainfall in the southeastern coastal area of China (SEC) during 1951 – 96 is used to composite the tropical SST, 850 -hPa wind, and 500 -hPa height. The results relative to the May–June rainfall, which represents most of the SEC summer monsoon rainfall, are compared to the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) rainfall composites. It is shown that strong interdecadal changes in the Pacific may account for the observed variations in the meridional structure of the monsoon–SST relationship. The western Pacific 500 -hPa subtropical ridge, which is influenced by the equatorial eastern Pacific SST, is crucial to these variations. During 1951 – 77 the SEC wet phase is produced by an anomalous anticyclone in the northern South China Sea, which tends to make the monsoon pre-Mei-yu and Mei-yu <b>fronts</b> <b>quasi-stationary</b> in the general area of both SEC and YRV, and also helps to warm the SST in the northern South China Sea.

40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>quasi-stationary</b> alongshore atmospheric <b>fronts</b> typically located 30 – 70 km off {{the east coast}} of Taiwan is demonstrated by analyzing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the sea surface acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellites ERS- 1 and ERS- 2. For the data interpretation, cloud images from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite GMS- 4 and the American Terra satellite, rain-rate maps from ground-based weather radars, sea surface wind data from the scatterometer on board the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite, and meteorological data from weather maps and radio-sonde ascents have also been used. It is shown that these atmospheric fronts are generated by the collisions of the two airflows from opposing directions: one is associated with a weak easterly synoptic-scale wind blowing against the high coastal mountain range at {{the east coast of}} Taiwan and the other with a local offshore wind. At the convergence zone where both airflows collide, air is forced to move upward, which often gives rise to the formation of coast-parallel cloud bands. There are two hypotheses about the origin of the offshore wind. The first one {{is that it is a}} thermally driven land breeze/katabatic wind, and the second one is that it is wind resulting from recirculated airflow from the synoptic-scale onshore wind. Air blocked by the mountain range at low Froude numbers is recirculated and flows at low levels back offshore. Arguments in favor of and against the two hypotheses are presented. It is argued that both the recirculation of airflow and land breeze/katabatic wind contribute to the formation of the offshore atmospheric front but that land breeze/katabatic wind is probably the main cause. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} a climatological investigation of different orographic precipitation enhancement processes in the Alps. On the one hand, the database consists of observations of more than 1000 weather stations in Bavaria and western Austria for the time period of 1991 - 2000. On the other hand, a MM 5 -climate-mode-simulation driven with ERA- 40 reanalysis data provides information about the environmental meteorological conditions. After a short introduction into the basics of orographic precipitation enhancement and into some simple linear models, the different station data are converted into a uniform temporal resolution of 6 hours. To estimate the relative contribution of different precipitation types, we distinguish between cold fronts, warm fronts, convection and a class carrying unclassified events. Convective precipitation in connection with fronts is attributed to the respective frontal class. Unclassified events predominantly consist of postfrontal upslope precipitation and <b>quasi-stationary</b> <b>fronts.</b> In addition, the wind direction at Alpine crest level (700 hPa) is considered. In a first step, the precipitation differences between the Alpine foreland and the northern Alps are analyzed. The investigation of the climatological importance of the 4 precipitation types in various regions shows that summertime convection and orographic lifting make the largest contribution to the precipitation gradient towards the Alps. Convective precipitation occurs predominantly in association with southwesterly flow and is more abundant in the Alps than in the adjacent forelands because convection is primarily triggered over the Alps. Orographic lifting is most active in case of northwesterly and northerly winds and intensifies both frontal and postfrontal precipitation. The climatological importance of orographic lifting is much larger in winter than in summer. A reversed precipitation gradient with systematically more precipitation in the foreland than in the Alps is found for fronts associated with a wind direction of exactly 270 ^∘. Under these circumstances, the wind blows parallel to the mountain range and lee effects related to upstream topography reduce the precipitation intensity in the Alps. The climatological precipitation maximum is shifted from westerly towards northerly winds when moving from west to east in the northern Alps. The second part of this work comprises {{an investigation of the}} climatological precipitation decrease from the northern Alps to the inner-Alpine valleys. The comparison between the precipitation distribution of 3 regions in the northern Alps and 3 regions in the central Alps shows that especially for cold fronts and unclassified events in connection with northwesterly or northerly flow, a distinctive precipitation surplus {{can be found in the}} northern Alps. For convective precipitation and southwesterly or westerly winds the inner-Alpine regions show high convective activity. For southerly wind directions the showers formed over the central Alps are advected towards the northern Alps, where they sometimes even intensify due to a convergence with the inflow from the Alpine foreland. There is a strong west-east precipitation gradient in the central Alps. The decreasing crest level of the northern Alps and the decreasing north-south-extension of the Alps together with the topographical structure of the valleys are the main reasons for the higher precipitation amounts in the eastern parts of the central Alps than in the western parts. Additionally, an investigation of the precipitation gradient in dependence on the temperature level is made. However, a classification of the precipitation events into 3 classes (snow line > 2500 m, 2500 m - 1000 m, < 1000 m) does not show any clear results. The next part investigates altitudinal precipitation differences in the Alps. The analysis is performed for four station pairs, consisting of a mountain station and a nearby valley station each. The climatological precipitation distribution shows that the mountain stations usually receive substantially more precipitation than the valley stations, especially for northwesterly and northerly ambient flow in 700 hPa. However, the differences are regionally variable and indicate a strong influence of the local topography. Moreover, precipitation enhancement over mountains tends to be substantially more effective for low temperatures than for high temperatures. A more detailed investigation of some parameters affecting orographic precipitation enhancement is conducted for stratiform precipitation events. The magnitude of orographic precipitation enhancement markedly increases with the wind speed at 700 hPa. Moreover, precipitation enhancement increases with the depth of the moist layer in the approaching flow. High resolution simulations with the MM 5 model are conducted for four climatologically representative precipitation events in the Zugspitze area. The first two wintertime cases are characterized by a strong northwesterly or northerly flow, associated with large precipitation differences between the mountain and the valley stations. For these cases the model validation shows good agreement with the observed precipitation patterns. The model results indicate a dominance of the classical seeder-feeder mechanism, with strong orographic lifting generating dense orographic clouds over the mountain ridges. The third precipitation event is also associated with a northerly flow, but in this case the low wind speeds do not cause enough orographical lifting so that the mountain-valley precipitation differences are rather small. The last case represents summertime precipitation events with northerly flow, a high snow line and almost no precipitation difference between the Zugspitze and the surrounding valley stations. The correlation between the model and the observations is not as good, because embedded convective cells are not reproduced in a deterministic sense in the MM 5. The dynamical and microphysical fields show that the snow line around the peak causes a local precipitation minimum at the Zugspitze. Because of different fall speeds of snow/graupel and rain there is a divergence of the hydrometeorological trajectories near the peak and therefore the precipitation maximum is shifted towards the lee...|$|R
40|$|Observations from a {{large number}} of seabird line-transect surveys {{conducted}} in Faroese waters are used to derive some general conclusions regarding the distribution of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) in the region using estimates of encounter rates (no. /km- 1) in different meso-scale habitats around the Faroes during the breeding season (May-September). Based on a sub-set of the data collected during calm conditions (sea states below Beaufort 3) we analysed the distribution of harbour porpoises in relation to 5 potentially important physical parameters: water depth, distance to shore, slope of the ocean floor, distance to tidal front and Beaufort sea state. These parameters were determined from data collected during the surveys, the literature {{as well as from the}} new bathymetry established for the Faroese shelf. In order to link the differently scaled physical parameters with the encounter rates and sea states recorded during the surveys we used a suite of geo-statistical and raster-based GIS techniques based on a uniform grid resolution of 1 km in UTM zone 29 N projection. After removing parameters with insignificant effects a model of main effects was produced with sea state and distance to the tidal front having a significant negative effect on the rate of encountering harbour porpoises during both sets of cruises analysed (August 1997 and other surveys). During both sets of cruises the distance to the tidal front had a larger effect on the distribution of the animals than sea state. The strong relationship between harbour porpoise distribution and the average position of the tidal front around the Faroes strongly suggests that the species concentrates near the <b>quasi-stationary</b> circular shelf <b>front</b> separating mixed from stratified waters around the Faroes. However, the importance of shelf fronts for the distribution of harbour porpoises needs to be studied in detail in order to establish the proportionof the populations associated with these structures...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{fundamental}} interaction mechanisms of laser remote fusion cutting, RFC, {{which is based}} on the formation of a <b>quasi-stationary</b> laser-induced boiling <b>front</b> that causes drop ejection, preferably downwards. Laser cutting of metals, invented in 1967, has developed from a niche to a well established high quality cutting technique in the manufacturing industry. Usually a gas jet is employed concentric to the laser beam, to eject the molten metal. One technique option, interesting though hardly applied yet because of usually low quality and speed, is remote laser cutting. Two techniques are distinguished, remote ablation cutting, grooving down through a sheet, layer-by-layer, and the here addressed remote fusion cutting, by a single pass through the sheet. For the latter, the ablation pressure from laser-induced boiling at the cutting front continuously accelerates and ejects the melt downwards. Advantages of remote laser cutting, facilitated by high brilliance lasers during the last decade, are the possibility of a larger working distance along with the avoidance of cutting gas and of a gas jet nozzle.   The review paper of the thesis surveys different laser remote cutting techniques, including their modelling, as well as the transition to keyhole welding, owing to similarities particularly from the boiling front and from root spatter ejection. The six Papers I-VI that compose the thesis address fundamental mechanisms of laser remote fusion cutting, theoretically and experimentally. In Paper I a simplified mathematical model of the RFC cutting front enables to estimate the geometrical and energetic conditions of the process. By evidence and post-modelling from high speed imaging, HSI, the simplified smooth cutting front model is developed further to a wavy topology in Paper III, for more sophisticated absorption analysis. As a systematic support, Paper II categorizes and analyses {{for the first time the}} different wavy topologies observed at the front, from HSI. The melt dynamics induced by a pulsed laser beam was studied in Paper IV, again from HSI. Apart from other interesting transient melt phenomena it was demonstrated that the ablation pressure can push the melt to a certain pending position during the laser pulse while the melt retreats by surface tension during the pulse break. To engage remote fusion cutting with additive manufacturing, Paper V introduces a novel technique where the drops ejected from RFC are transferred to a substrate, about a centimetre underneath, on which a continuous track forms. This technique can even be applied as an efficient recycling approach. In Paper VI a variant of the technique is presented, to develop a boiling front along the edge of a metal sheet from which the drop transfer takes place, in a different manner. This enables to systematically machine-off the entire sheet, which can be converted to a new shape and product.   Summarizing, the thesis provides a variety of analysis of fundamental mechanisms of a laser-induced boiling front that bear a certain simplicity and in turn controllability, of interest for established as well as for new applications, in manufacturing and in other sectors, including remote fusion cutting...|$|R
