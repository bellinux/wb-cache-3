25|$|Dirac's {{attention}} {{was drawn to}} a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had reached. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the Poisson brackets {{that occur in the}} classical dynamics of particle motion. From this thought he quickly developed a quantum theory that was based on non-commuting dynamical variables. This led him to a more profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics than was achieved by any other worker in this field. Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the <b>quantisation</b> rules in a novel and more illuminating manner. For this work, published in 1926, Dirac received a PhD from Cambridge. This formed the basis for Fermi-Dirac statistics that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the Pauli exclusion principle), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in semi-conductors.|$|E
500|$|After Wolfgang Pauli {{announced}} his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi {{responded with a}} paper [...] "On the <b>quantisation</b> of the perfect monoatomic gas" [...] (...) , in which he applied the exclusion principle to an ideal gas. The paper was especially notable for Fermi's statistical formulation, which [...] describes the distribution of particles in systems of many identical particles that obey the exclusion principle. This was independently developed soon after by the British physicist Paul Dirac, who also showed how it {{was related to the}} Bose–Einstein statistics. Accordingly, it is now known as Fermi–Dirac statistics. Following Dirac, particles that obey the exclusion principle are today called [...] "fermions", while those that do not are called [...] "bosons".|$|E
500|$|These {{experimental}} results provided confirmation of Albert Einstein's photoelectric effect and Planck's relation (E = fh) linking energy (E) and frequency (f) arising from <b>quantisation</b> of energy with Planck's constant (h). But they also provided evidence supporting {{the model of}} the atom that had been proposed the previous year by Niels Bohr. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's [...] "quantum energy levels". Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.|$|E
40|$|Given a 0 -shifted {{symplectic}} {{structure on}} a derived Artin N-stack Y, we investigate <b>quantisations</b> of line bundles L on derived Lagrangians X. These {{take the form}} of curved A_∞ deformations of O_Y mapping to the ring of differential operators on L. For each choice of formality isomorphism, we construct a map from the space of non-degenerate <b>quantisations</b> to power series in the de Rham cohomology cone. When L is a square root of the dualising line bundle, this gives an equivalence between even power series and involutive <b>quantisations,</b> ensuring that the latter always exist, and giving rise to a likely candidate for the Fukaya category of algebraic Lagrangians envisaged by Behrend and Fantechi. We sketch a generalisation to Lagrangians on higher n-shifted structures. Comment: 39 pp; v 2 minor additions and refs update...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, he applied the Hamiltonian methods he had {{developed}} to cast Einstein's general relativity in Hamiltonian form and to bring to a technical completion the <b>quantisation</b> problem of gravitation and bring it also closer {{to the rest of}} physics according to Salam and DeWitt. In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on [...] "Energy of the Gravitational Field" [...] at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society later published in 1959 Phys Rev Lett 2, 368. In 1964 he published his Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (London:Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including <b>quantisation</b> of curved spacetime.

The quantum theories are generically neither monodromy nor modular invariant, but all the modular invariant theories of Felder et. al. are contained among them. A formula for {{the transformation of the}} Sugawara expression for L 0 under conjugation with respect to non-contractible loops in LG is derived. This formula is then used to analyse the monodromy properties of the various <b>quantisations.</b> It turns out that for π 1 (G) ∼ = ZN, with N even, there are 2 monodromy invariant theories, one of which is modular invariant, and for π 1 (G) ∼ = Z 2 × Z 2 there are 8 monodromy invariant theories, two of which are modular invariant. A few specific examples are worked out in detail to illustrate the results. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{necessity}} of fermions (matter) being created and destroyed in Enrico Fermi's 1934 theory of beta decay {{led to a}} reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a [...] "classical" [...] field equation for any point particle of spin ħ/2, itself subject to <b>quantisation</b> conditions involving anti-commutators. Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by Werner Heisenberg, as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles – today quarks and leptons – this Dirac field equation is as central to theoretical physics as the Maxwell, Yang–Mills and Einstein field equations. Dirac {{is regarded as the}} founder of quantum electrodynamics, being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of vacuum polarisation in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, in particular Schwinger, Feynman, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga and Dyson in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E

On the other hand, we provide a discussion on the role of observables, focussed on the situation of a symmetry exchange, which is key to our derivation.

This structure is derived from PhA(1) ng's categorical equivalence between left and right comodules over U without the need of a (Hopf algebroid) antipode, a result which we review and extend.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} the use of medGIFT and easyIR for three of four ImageCLEF 2005 tasks. All results rely on two systems: the GNU Image Finding Tool (GIFT) for visual retrieval, and easyIR for text. For ad–hoc retrieval, two visual runs were submitted. No textual retrieval was attempted, resulting in lower scores than those using text retrieval but the best visual run. For medical retrieval, visual retrieval was performed with several configurations of Gabor filters and grey level/color <b>quantisations</b> as well as combinations of text and visual features. Due {{to a lack of}} resources no feedback runs were created, an area where medGIFT performed best in 2004. For classification, a retrieval with the target image was performed and the first N = 1; 5; 10 results used to calculate scores for classes by simply adding up the scores for each class. No machine learning was performed, so results were surprisingly good and only topped by systems with optimised learning strategies. ...|$|R
