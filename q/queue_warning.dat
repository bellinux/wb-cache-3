40|$|Queue warning’s basic {{principle}} is to inform travelers {{of the presence}} of downstream stop-and-go traffic (based on real-time traffic detection) using warning signs and flashing lights. Drivers can anticipate an upcoming situation of emergency braking and slow down, avoid erratic behavior, and reduce queuing-related collisions. Dynamic message signs (DMS) show a symbol or word when stop-and-go traffic is near. Variable speed limits and lane control signals that provide incident management capabilities can be combined with <b>queue</b> <b>warning.</b> The system can be automated or controlled by a traffic management center operator. Work zones also benefit from <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> with portable dynamic message sign units placed upstream of expected queue points...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an investigation and a state-of-the-art {{description of traffic}} effects of harmonization with variable speed limits. Expansion of the E 4 south of Stockholm {{has been carried out}} during the years 2009 - 2013. The expansion includes a rearranged lane configuration within the existing road section (25 m) and traffic management systems. Previous design with two lanes and hard shoulder has been replaced with three lanes without shoulder. In addition, the road has been equipped with variable speed limits (with red ring), <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> system with recommended speed and emergency refuge areas (ERAs). The <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> functionality was activated in 2011 and harmonization in 2013. Reduced speed variance is an important goal for the traffic management system and is considered to both reduce rear-end collisions and the risk of capacity breakdown. German experience shows that harmonization affects capacity down to about 80 kph. English experience is that the harmonization and monitoring can reduce accidents by 40 % at normal speed of 70 mph (112 kph). Germany and England decrease the speed with approximately 20 kph at the degree of saturation of 0. 7 to let the flow be harmonized before the traffic density has increased too much. A measure to describe disturbed and undisturbed traffic can be the relative change in the standard deviation of the average speed for 5 -minutes periods updated each minute, called CVS. In case of accidents, CVS may be twice as high as normal. The standard deviation of all vehicles is calculated for each minute and aggregated into five-minute periods. The harmonization settings on E 4 south of Stockholm has been iteratively designed and ultimately set to 325 vehicles/ 5 min, which has worked well. The variable speed limit is reduced to 80 kph and stabilizes the flow. The harmonization indicates a potential risk of queue for the road users, which becomes more prepared if the <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> is activated further along the road due low speed and the risk of sudden braking. The main results can be summarized as follows: • The average speed during rush hour on weekdays has increased by 2. 5 kph after the installation of the traffic control system, of which 25 % is assumed to be attributable to the traffic management system • The harmonization has delayed the onset of collapse. During the periods in which harmonization has not been activated but there has been a breakdown, it is considered that harmonisation would have passed the half period and then collapse would occurred. • The accidents have been reduced by half, of which 25 % is assumed to depend on traffic management (harmonization, <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> and VMS) The <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> has worked well, but could be improved by also exploiting the so-called CVS. The measure reveals the instabilities in the flow, sometimes tens of minutes before the AID-alarm due low speeds is enabled. In rush hour when traffic is dense (> 325 vehicles/ 5 min) and harmonization has already been activated the CVS measure gives further information, which could be exploited to improve the <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> algorithm...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research was to identify and evaluate effective ways of improving traffic operations and safety on congested freeways. There was particular interest in finding condition-responsive traffic control solutions for the following problem areas: (1) end-of-queue warning, (2) work zones with lane closure, and (3) queue spillover at exit ramps. Available techniques considered by this research include combination of static and dynamic <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> systems, dynamic merge control in advance of freeway lane closures, and various traffic control strategies, such as traffic diversion and ramp metering, to mitigate queue spillover at exit ramps. Three sets of evaluation studies were conducted: first, two <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> systems deployed on IH 610 and US 59 in Houston, Texas, were evaluated based on field observations. Second, strategies to resolve a ramp spillover problem at an exit ramp in El Paso, Texas, were analyzed using traffic simulations. Third, the Dynamic Merge work zone traffic control concept was evaluated using traffic simulations, and recommendations were developed for its potential use fo...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the traffic community about the relation between traffic data quality and the efficiency of traffic management. Data collection is expensive and if {{the same level of}} traffic performance can be reached with less data or if traffic management becomes more efficient with better data, then that is interesting for a lot of transport organisations. In this paper the problem is introduced and illustrated by presenting the results of a study into the effect of different loop detector distances and floating car data (FCD) penetration rates on a <b>queue</b> tail <b>warning</b> system. It shows that for a detector distance of more than 300 meters the performance deteriorates quickly and that the addition of only 1 % FCD increases the performance considerably.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the {{combined}} microsimulation and small scale demonstration evaluation of the freeway performance effects of a specific connected vehicle implementation of speed harmonization (The Prototype). The microsimulation testing was performed on a 10 mile stretch of freeway in San Mateo County, California. The small scale field demonstration was performed with 10 equipped vehicles on 17 miles of the I- 5 freeway in Seattle, Washington. The microsimulation analysis evaluated {{the effects of the}} Prototype speed harmonization algorithm on shockwaves, queues, throughput, speed variation, travel time, and reliability, for different response rates for vehicles on the facility. The “response rate” is defined as the combination of the percent of the vehicle fleet with connected vehicle capabilities, the percent of connected vehicles that successfully receive the speed recommendation in a timely manner, and the percent of drivers who having received the recommendation also choose to comply with the recommended speed. Results from the simulation analysis found that the Prototype is likely to significantly reduce the magnitude of the speed differences (shockwaves) between vehicles, even at the 10 -percent response rate. This is considered to benefit safety by reducing the probability of collisions where free-flowing traffic meets the back of a queue. The trade-off for the improved safety is that the Prototype increases the geographic impact of existing bottlenecks on freeway speeds by expanding the upstream distance that is affected by congestion. The small scale field demonstration evaluated the performance of a cell phone based application for communicating vehicle status and receiving recommended speeds and advanced <b>queue</b> <b>warnings</b> using a combination of the cellular network and roadside dedicated short range communication devices via a DSRC antenna installed in the vehicle. The small scale demonstration also evaluated the ability to detect queues via a combination of installed loop detectors in the road and basic safety messages transmitted by the connected vehicles. The small scale field demonstration showed the feasibility of connected vehicle data capture and dissemination functionality using both cellular communications and Dedicated Short Range (DSRC) communications. It demonstrated that the Prototype has the communication speeds, communication reliability, and computed processing speed to support speed harmonization application functionality in an operational traffic environment.

40|$|Crowdsourced GPS {{probe data}} {{has become a}} major source of {{real-time}} traffic information applications. In addition to traditional traveler advisory systems such as dynamic message signs (DMS) and 511 systems, probe data is being used for automatic incident detection, Integrated Corridor Management (ICM), end of <b>queue</b> <b>warning</b> systems, and mobility-related smartphone applications. Several private sector vendors offer minute by minute network-wide travel time and speed probe data. The quality of such data in terms of deviation of the reported travel time and speeds from ground-truth has been extensively studied in recent years, and as a result concerns over the accuracy of probe data has mostly faded away. However, the latency of probe data, defined as the lag between the time that disturbance in traffic speed is reported in the outsourced data feed, and the time that the traffic is perturbed, has become a subject of interest. The extent of latency of probe data for real-time applications is critical, so {{it is important to have}} a good understanding of the amount of latency and its influencing factors. This paper uses high-quality independent Bluetooth/Wi-Fi re-identification data collected on multiple freeway segments in three different states, to measure the latency of the vehicle probe data provided by three major vendors. The statistical distribution of the latency and its sensitivity to speed slowdown and recovery periods are discussed. Comment: This paper was submitted to TRB annual meeting 201...|$|E
40|$|Road traffic {{management}} is an umbrella term. It encompasses all measures that (re) direct traffic flows {{over the road}} network, so that the movements of people and goods are optimised for reliability, safety and environmental sustainability. The levels of road mobility continue to increase year on year. In fact, the mobility demand is increasing faster than any increases in overall road capacity. As a result, developments in {{traffic management}} become increasingly important to accommodate demand. Traffic management is generally seen as linked to main arterial roads and involves motorised traffic, but it also relates to minor roads and non-motorised traffic. Traffic management consists {{of a variety of}} measures that are applied for multiple purposes. Modern technologies make current traffic management more dynamic and flexible and hence, in theory, more effective. Four clusters of traffic management measures can be distinguished: * Dynamic speed management: e. g., dynamic speed limits, variable message signs. * Local dynamic warning or informative systems: e. g., incident warning, local <b>queue</b> <b>warning,</b> weather warnings. * Local traffic flow management: e. g., lane closures, peak hour lanes, overtaking prohibition for trucks, merging measures, ramp metering. * Network-wide traffic flow management: e. g., dynamic route information, multimodal information. Traffic management measures aim to influence traffic flows over the road network. However, traffic flow consists of numerous individual road users travelling from A to B, so traffic management aims to influence human behaviour. Consequently, the effect of a traffic management measure largely depends on the capabilities or motivations of these road users to comply with the measures. If designed and applied without accounting for human factors, effective traffic management measures may not have the intended effect. Human factors in national or international legislation Some human factor aspects are explicitly taken into account and integrated into (inter) national legislation. For example, human limitations in vision and information processing are accounted for in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Road Signs and Signals and the European Agreement on Road Markings. These acts of legislation clearly prescribe the locations, size and material of signs and markings. However, beyond accommodating visual capabilities, there is minimal integration of human factors principles (such as decision making, behavioural adaptation, distraction etc.) into road traffic legislation. As a consequence, road traffic practitioners, including traffic managers, are not always fully aware of the important role played by human factors. This booklet targets national road administrations and their traffic managers. It provides concise information about the human factors in general and the crucial role they play in traffic management. This information gives a level of insight into how human factors influence the effectiveness of traffic management measures. The booklet presents: * A human perspective on road traffic management; * An introduction to the four key human factors; * A view on individual differences and unintended side-effects of these factors; and * Consideration of these factors in-vehicle traffic management information Background and sources The booklet is based on research performed in the CEDR project METHOD.

40|$|Active Queue Management (AQM) is an {{efficient}} {{tool in the}} network to avoid saturation of the <b>queue</b> by <b>warning</b> the sender that the queue is almost full to reduce its speed before the queue is full. The buffer management schemes focus on space management, {{in the other hand}} scheduling priorities (focusing on time management) attempt to guarantee acceptable delay boundaries to applications for which it is important that delay is bounded. Combined mechanisms (time and space management) are possible and enable networks to improve the perceived quality for multimedia traffic at the end users. The key idea in this paper is to study the performance of a mechanism combining an AQM with a time-space priority scheme applied to multimedia flows transmitted to an end user in HSDPA network. The studied queue is shared by Real Time and Non Real Time packets. We propose a mathematical model using Poisson and MMPP processes to model the arrival of packets in the system. The performance parameters are analytically deducted for the Combined EB-TSP and compared to the case of Simple EB-TSP. Numerical results obtained show the positive impact of the AQM added to the EB-TSP on the performance parameters of NRT packets compared to the Simple EB-TSP...|$|R
40|$|Crash {{reduction}} {{factors are}} widely used by engineers for prioritizing safety investments. Work zones are routinely analyzed by the length and duration of <b>queues.</b> <b>Queue</b> detection <b>warning</b> technology has been growing in availability and reliability in recent years. However, there is sparse literature {{on the impact of}} freeway queueing on crash rates. This paper analyzes three years of crash data and crowdsourced probe vehicle data to classify crashes as being associated with queueing conditions or free flow conditions. In 2014, only 1. 2 % of the distanced-weighted hours of operation of Indiana interstates operated at or under 45 MPH. A three-year study on Indiana interstates indicates that commercial vehicles were involved in over 87 % of back-of-queue fatal crashes compared to 39 % of all fatal crashes during free flow conditions. A new measure of crash rate was developed to account for the presence and duration of queues: crashes per mile-hour of congestion. The congested crash rate on all Indiana interstates in 2014 was found to be 24 times greater than the uncongested crash rate. These data were also separated into both rural and urban categories. In rural areas, the congested crash rate is 23 times the uncongested crash rate. In urban areas, the congested crash rate is 21 times the uncongested crash rate. Queues are found to be present for five minutes or longer prior to approximately 90 % of congestion crashes in 2014. Longer term, this information shows the importance in the development of technology that can warn motorists of traffic queues...|$|R
