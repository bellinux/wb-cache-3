5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the Court would be unable to rule without a <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judges.</b> Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The Judges were taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} Ad hoc {{appointment}} {{in the supreme}} court made when the <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> <b>Judges</b> is not possible to complete the sitting number of justices in the court, or if it is necessary {{to increase the number of}} justices in the Supreme Court. The nomination comes directly from the Judicial Commission chiared by the Chief Justice who prepares the nomination summary as President confirms their appointments.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Dias {{also was}} the first woman to become a justice of the state highest Court of Appeals. She is the {{presiding}} justice over the Seventh Panel of Judges of the state highest Court of Appeals; the <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> assembles in Porto Alegre, the state capital. Dr. Dias' own specialty is the area of family law. She was selected and she accepted the title of embassador of the First World Outgames in 2006 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the circuit}} courts were now to consist <b>of</b> only two <b>judges,</b> the Act {{permitted}} them to certify to the Supreme Court any question of law {{on which the}} two could not agree. Also, the district judge was not permitted to hear appeals of his own decisions, so appeals from the district courts were decided by the circuit justice alone. But {{the most important part}} of the Act was the provision that a <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> only one <b>judge</b> was needed to convene a circuit court. As a result, Supreme Court justices could often rely on district court judges to convene circuit courts. With circuit riding largely optional, Supreme Court justices were no longer saddled with what they had previously felt was a tremendous burden. The Act's flexibility proved crucial to the demise of circuit riding, which essentially disappeared by 1840.|$|R

50|$|President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve (also President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles, President of the Council of Twelve Apostles, and President of the Twelve) is a {{leadership}} position {{that exists in}} some of the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement.

50|$|If the President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve {{has been}} called to be a {{counselor}} in the First Presidency, the most senior apostle not called to the First Presidency is set apart and {{referred to as the}} Acting President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles. At the death {{of the president of the}} church, the Acting President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve retains his position in the quorum's membership and the President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve takes his role as president <b>of</b> the <b>quorum.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{person is}} {{typically}} {{called to be}} a general authority or general officer {{by a member of}} the First Presidency or the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve. The president of the church and members <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve are typically called for life, although there have been more than a dozen instances when an apostle has been released from his service in the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve due to disfellowshipment, excommunication, or resignation.|$|R
50|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles (also {{known as}} the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve, the Council of the Twelve Apostles, or simply the Twelve) {{is one of the}} {{governing}} bodies in the church hierarchy.

50|$|Ashton was an Assistant to the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles from 1969 {{until his}} {{call to the}} <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve. Ashton was ordained an apostle on December 2, 1971, {{after the death of}} Richard L. Evans.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles {{claims a}} {{leadership}} role second only {{to that of the}} First Presidency. At the time of the death of Joseph Smith, the President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles was Brigham Young.|$|R
50|$|In Gbcast, {{progress}} {{will never}} resume if {{a circle of}} mutual suspicions arises, as noted above: once a <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> mutually shunning processes arises, the shunning mechanism {{makes it impossible for}} any leader to obtain a <b>quorum</b> <b>of</b> promises.|$|R

50|$|Helio da Rocha Camargo (born 1 February 1926) was {{the first}} Brazilian general {{authority}} of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

25|$|Some apostles {{have been}} ordained to that office without being {{included}} within the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve. Alvin R.

McKay, he returned to his previous position as an Assistant to the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve. Joseph Angell Young was ordained an apostle in 1864 but was never a member <b>of</b> either the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles or the First Presidency. Joseph F.

2500|$|Since the 1976 merger <b>of</b> First <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Seventy, seventies are {{the most}} usual {{candidates}} to become members <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles.

Bednar, Nelson and Oaks were ordained apostles in 1984 under church president Kimball and Bednar in 2004 under church president Gordon B. Hinckley. [...] Additionally, having served previously as members <b>of</b> the First <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Seventy, both Robert D. Hales and Gary E.

50|$|In the LDS Church, when a {{president}} of the church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved {{and the members of the}} First Presidency who were formerly members <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles rejoin it. The <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve—which may number greater than twelve with the returning members from the First Presidency—then becomes the presiding council of the church, with the senior apostle as its president. The President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve becomes the highest-ranking official in the church, and has always become the next church president. However, this appointment is only made official when the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve meets and selects the next president of the church.|$|R
50|$|President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles is a priesthood {{calling in}} The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). In general, the President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve {{is the most}} senior apostle in the church, aside from the President of the Church. When the President of the Church dies, it is the President <b>of</b> the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve who becomes the new church president. The calling of President of the Twelve has been held by 26 men (one of whom served two non-consecutive terms), 15 of whom {{have gone on to}} become President of the Church.

5000|$|The Church of Jesus Christ {{does not}} view the prophetic office as {{limited to a}} [...] "prophet" [...] or to the {{president}} of the church. Rather, members believe that it encompasses the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> Twelve Apostles together and that revelations can be given to individual members of the church. The president of the church and his two counselors are elected by the general priesthood in conference and selected from amongst the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> Twelve Apostles. The president of the church, while being an ordained apostle, functions as the chief operating officer, overseeing the general operations of the church. In contrast, the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> Twelve Apostles has its own president and officers elected amongst themselves, independent of the general priesthood. The <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> Twelve is primarily responsible for guiding the spiritual growth and development of the church in general, acting as advisers to key operating committees. Other officers of the church include the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> Seventy Evangelists.|$|R

2500|$|In 1975, under Kimball's direction, the First <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Seventy was reconstituted. The First <b>Quorum</b> was {{composed}} <b>of</b> the {{former members of}} the First Council of the Seventy as well as new individuals selected by Kimball. The reason for the change was that the growth of the church necessitated the call of more general authorities. In 1976, the First Council of the Seventy, the First <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Seventy, and the Assistants to the <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Twelve Apostles were all merged into a new First <b>Quorum</b> <b>of</b> the Seventy under a seven-member Presidency of the Seventy.
