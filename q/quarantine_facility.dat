500|$|On November 12, 1996, the Shackleford {{horses were}} rounded {{up by the}} North Carolina Department of Agriculture's Veterinary Division and tested for equine {{infectious}} anemia (EIA). EIA is a potentially lethal disease, a lentivirus transmitted by bodily fluids and insects. Seventy-six of the 184captured horses tested positive. Those that tested negative were allowed {{to remain on the}} island and those with the disease were transported to a temporary <b>quarantine</b> <b>facility.</b> Finding a permanent, isolated area for such a large number of Bankers was a challenging task for the Foundation; eight days later the state declared all proposed locations for the herd unsuitable. It ordered the euthanization of the 76infected horses. [...] Two more horses died in the process—one that was fatally injured during the roundup, and an uninfected foal that slipped into the quarantined herd to be with its mother.|$|E

2500|$|A {{flashback}} in [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] introduces Amy and Rory's {{childhood friend}} Mels (Nina Toussaint-White). As teenagers, it was Mels who {{pointed out that}} Rory had {{been in love with}} Amy for some time, which led to the two dating. In the present, Mels hijacks the TARDIS and directs it to 1939 where she is shot by Hitler (Albert Welling) and regenerates into River Song, revealing that Amy had grown up alongside her daughter, who was trained by the Silence to kill the Doctor. Amy is later persuaded by the Doctor to let her adult daughter make her own way in life. In [...] "The Girl Who Waited", Amy becomes separated from the Doctor and Rory on a planet's <b>quarantine</b> <b>facility</b> and lives on her own for 36 years before they return. The Doctor wants to go back in time to rescue the younger Amy, but the older Amy insists that they take both of her. However, the Doctor knows the TARDIS will not accept the paradox and is forced to leave the older Amy behind. In [...] "The God Complex", the Doctor breaks Amy's faith in him after he discovers that they are trapped in a prison for a being that kills by feeding on faith. At the conclusion of that episode, not wanting to risk their lives further, he parts ways with her and Rory after giving them a house and car. Amy appears briefly in [...] "Closing Time", where she is shown to have become a fashion model, noted for a perfume campaign with the slogan [...] "For The Girl Who Is Tired Of Waiting". Series finale [...] "The Wedding of River Song" [...] depicts an alternate universe created by River refusing to kill the Doctor in Utah, as previously shown. Amy leads a secret organisation which fights the Silence. She reunites the Doctor with River and later kills Madame Kovarian for kidnapping Melody and depriving her of raising her baby. After history is restored, River visits Amy and reveals that the Doctor has faked his death. At the end of the 2011 Christmas special, the Doctor returns to Amy and Rory two years later (in their time) and has Christmas dinner with them.|$|E
