25|$|If {{the theory}} that {{language}} could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the <b>question</b> <b>becomes</b> which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation, several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that it evolved {{for the purpose of}} social grooming, that it evolved to as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.|$|E
25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The <b>question</b> <b>becomes</b> how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E
500|$|The Cat and the Canary {{features}} veteran silent film stars Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, and Forrest Stanley. La Plante played {{roles in}} more than 50 films before starring in The Cat and the Canary. According to film historian Gary Don Rhodes, her part in The Cat and the Canary was typical for women in horror and mystery films: [...] "The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She has little to do, and so the <b>question</b> <b>becomes</b> 'What will be done with her?'" [...] Rhodes adds, [...] "The heroines are young and beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed—whether “stolen” by a villain or “owned” by a young hero at the films' conclusions." [...] Following The Cat and the Canary, La Plante maintained a career with Universal, but she {{is described as a}} [...] "victim of talkies." [...] She received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame before her death in 1996 from Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

500|$|Under {{the heading}} [...] "Transcendental Mediocrity", Jim Miller of Rolling Stone called Dark Horse a [...] "disastrous album" [...] {{to match the}} [...] "disastrous tour", and a [...] "shoddy piece of work". According to Miller, the musicians were [...] "merely {{competent}} studio pros" [...] and Harrison's guitar playing was [...] "rudimentary". In contrast with the praise that the same publication had lavished on Harrison for Living in the Material World the year before, Rolling Stones reviewer described Dark Horse as a [...] "chronicle of a performer out of his element, working to a deadline, enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver new 'LP product'", and stated: [...] "In plain point of fact, George Harrison {{has never been a}} great artist... the <b>question</b> <b>becomes</b> whether he will ever again become a competent entertainer." [...] The NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Harrison's songwriting, production and vocals, particularly on two tracks dealing with his troubled personal life, [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and [...] "So Sad". Woffinden concluded: [...] "I find Dark Horse the product of a complete egoist – no one, you see, is in my tree – someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru... I'll repeat that this album is totally colourless. Just stuff and nonsense." [...] Writing in The Village Voice in January 1975, Robert Christgau bemoaned the album's [...] "transubstantiations" [...] and particularly derided the lyrics to [...] "Māya Love", [...] "in which 'window-pane' becomes 'window brain.'

2500|$|By {{its very}} nature, conceptualizing a supply curve {{requires}} {{the firm to}} be a perfect competitor (i.e. to have no influence over the market price). This is true because each point on the supply curve {{is the answer to}} the question [...] "If this firm is faced with this potential price, how much output will it be able to and willing to sell?" [...] If a firm has market power, its decision of how much output to provide to the market influences the market price, therefore the firm is not [...] "faced with" [...] any price, and the <b>question</b> <b>becomes</b> less relevant.|$|E

Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima {{could be considered a}} legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of [...] "undefended".|$|E

2500|$|The idea, here, {{is that a}} truth's {{invariance}} {{makes it}} genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed {{unless there is a}} rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in <b>question</b> <b>becomes,</b> but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out in important ways in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the [...] "veridical"). While such knowledge is produced {{in the process of being}} faithful to a truth event, it should be noted that, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms [...] "democratic materialism," [...] denies the existence of truth and only recognizes [...] "bodies" [...] and [...] "languages." [...] Badiou proposes a turn towards the [...] "materialist dialectic," [...] which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, except there are also truths.|$|E
