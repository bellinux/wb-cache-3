40|$|The {{combination}} of 8 -phase shift keying (8 PSK) modulation and greater than 2 bits/sec/Hz drove {{the design of}} the Nyquist filter to one specified to have a rolloff factor of 0. 2. This filter when built and tested was found to produce too much intersymbol interference and was abandoned for a design with a rolloff factor of 0. 4. The preamble is limited to 100 bit periods of the uncoded bit period of 5 ns for a maximum preamble length of 500 ns or 40 8 PSK symbol times at 12. 5 ns per symbol. For 8 PSK modulation, the required maximum degradation of 1 dB in - 20 dB cochannel interference (CCI) drove the requirement for forward error correction coding. In this contract, the funding was not sufficient to develop the proposed codec so the codec was limited to a paper design during the preliminary design phase. The mechanization of the demodulator is digital, starting from the output of the analog to digital converters which quantize the outputs of the <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detectors.</b> This approach is amenable to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) replacement in the next phase of development...|$|R

This paper studies the performance of the <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> applied to digital communication systems. Theoretically explaining phase quantization noise of the detector, we show the performance of a PSK/FSK receiver using it.

It is demonstrated that full <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> information can be obtained using only a single <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> and that, for the commonly encountered situation where the spectral width is much less than the folding frequency, the signals from the various windows can be combined easily using standard complex Fourier transform software. An improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio equal to the square root of 3 is obtained over either standard single or <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> detection schemes.

40|$|Abstract A {{new phase}} self-calibrated scheme {{maintains}} the quadrature is {{proposed in the}} letter, which mainly in-cludes <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> (QPD), charge pump, comparator, controller and variable delay buffer (VDB) etc. The primary idea behind the scheme is that the quad-rature phase error is converted to the voltage variation on the capacitor, and then the voltage variation drives the controller to tune the VDB to the proper control word. The phase calibration is digitally controlled and considers the mismatch effect of charge pump, removing the disadvan-tage of conventional analog calibration circuit whose per-formance is sensitive to process and temperature variations and aging. It is shown that the two VDBs have an 8 quadrature phase shift tuning range, and an 8 mA current at 1. 7 HGz, and the calibration process takes less than 160 ls...|$|E

The 16 frequencies are spaced every 1 / 16 th baud rate for 2 bits/sec/Hz operation. Overall rate 3 / 4 convolutional coding is incorporated. The demodulator differs significantly from typical <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> approaches in that phase is coherently measured by processing the baseband output of a frequency discriminator. Baud rate phase samples from the baseband processor are decoded to yield the original data stream. The method of encoding onto the 16 -ary phase nodes, together with convolutional coding gain, results in near quad PSK (QPSK) performance.

40|$|The XR- 2211 is a {{monolithic}} phase-locked loop (PLL) system especially designed for data communications applications. It is particularly suited for FSK modem applications. It operates {{over a wide}} supply voltage range of 4. 5 to 20 V and a wide frequency range of 0. 01 Hz to 300 kHz. It can accommodate analog signals between 10 mV and 3 V, and can interface with conventional DTL, TTL, and ECL logic families. The circuit consists of a basic PLL for tracking an input signal within the pass band, a <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> which provides carrier detection, and an FSK voltage comparator which provides FSK demodulation.

40|$|An online delay {{estimation}} algorithm {{based upon}} an analogue <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detector</b> that {{is suitable for}} determining the subsample delay between two noisy sinusoidal signals is introduced. The new technique {{is based on the}} recently proposed discrete-time quadrature-delay estimator (QDE). The algorithm uses the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of the received signals to produce a bias-free estimate of the delay between the input signals. The technique directly minimizes the delay error estimate, which is in turn used to adapt the coefficients of a simple fractional-delay filter (FDF). The algorithm is insensitive to variations in the amplitudes of the input signals, and does not require an accurate prior estimate of the frequency of the input sinusoids. The algorithm directly updates the delay error estimate, which is in turn used directly as the coefficient input to an adaptive FDF. The technique is simple to implement and has a reduced complexity compared to other adaptive techniques. Simulations show that in the presence of system noise, the new estimator outperforms conventional FDF-based estimators...|$|E
40|$|An online, {{adaptive}} method of time delay and magnitude estimation for sinusoidal signals is presented. The method {{is based on}} an adaptive gradient descent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two noisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel quadrature carrier generator to produce the carriers for an adaptive <b>quadrature</b> <b>phase</b> <b>detector,</b> which in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed method is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal characteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the magnitudes of the two signals. It even works effectively when the signals have time-varying magnitudes. The convergence analysis of the proposed technique shows that estimate converges exponentially fast to their nominal values. In addition, if the technique is implemented in the continuous time domain, the delay estimation accuracy will not be constrained by the sampling frequency as observed in some of the classical techniques. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method provides very accurate estimates of the time delay comparable to that of the popular methods like Sinc-based estimator, Lagrange estimator, and the Quadrature estimator, as well the magnitude estimate of the input signals at lower signal to noise ratio at appreciably reduced computational cost.

The 16 frequencies are spaced every 1 / 16 th baud rate which produces a compact spectrum allowing 2 bits/sec/Hz operation. The modem is designed for 200 mb/s Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) application with 100 MHz adjacent channel spacing. Overall rate 3. 4 convolutional coding is incorporated.
