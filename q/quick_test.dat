However, a <b>quick</b> <b>test</b> of the individual's testosterone level following the diagnosis of the fracture will readily reveal whether that individual might be at risk.|$|E

A positive test is almost always an indication to do a colonoscopy. In most cases the positive result is just due to hemorrhoids; however, it can also be due to diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, [...] ulcerative colitis), colon cancer, or polyps. However polypectomy has become a routine part of colonoscopy, allowing for quick and simple removal of polyps without invasive surgery.|$|E

Comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient, <b>quick</b> <b>test</b> method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded. Traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances, {{as well as a}} large number of other compounds, can be detected. Further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range, density, permanganate number, turbidity, color index, and acid number. More comprehensive tests include water determination according to the Karl Fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts. However, the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Real-time RT-PCR {{has been}} used as {{reference}} technique for the detection of pandemic A/H 1 N 1 influenza virus infections. In addition, rapid antigen detection <b>tests</b> such as <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> have been considered in the diagnosis of pandemic A/H 1 N 1 worldwide due to their ease of use and generation of rapid results. These tests have been used by numerous institutions for the diagnosis of pandemic A/H 1 N 1 in Turkey also. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the sensitivity of <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> with the reference method. Methods: A total of 104 positive isolates by real time RT-PCR technique has been <b>tested</b> with four <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> manufactured by different companies marketed in our country. Results: The sensitivity of <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> ranged from 31. 7 % to 50 % in detecting pandemic A/H 1 N 1 infections. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> are not adequately sensitive in the detection of pandemic A/H 1 N 1 infections...|$|R

Likewise, <b>quick</b> <b>testbed</b> satellites offer companies the ability to prototype new products {{in a relatively short}} design cycle. The design of an operating system (OIS) for a <b>quick</b> <b>testbed</b> satellite is different from ordinary operating systems found on today 2 ̆ 7 s satellites. In the case of a typical satellite, the mission is specific and therefore the software on board is designed with that mission in mind. For a testbed, the satellite bus has been designed ahead of time in a few standard configurations. A researcher would select a bus that most satisfies his needs. Therefore, {{it is important to note}} that the experiments are not known up-front. Rather, interested researchers identify their experiments at a later time. Since there can be multiple researchers, the experiments may come in at various times prior to launch...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> Viscofrit, Testo 265 and Fri-check in the monitoring of used frying oil for discarding, as a substitute for the measurement of total polar compounds (TPC), indicating the advantages and disadvantages of each test. Fifty-nine frying oil samples used to fry different types of food were evaluated using <b>quick</b> <b>tests</b> and the TPC open-column conventional method. The samples presented TPC values from 6. 0  ±  1. 1 % to 39. 2  ±  1. 0 %. Testo 265 was correlated to the conventional method by the equation: y =  0. 89 x +  4. 0 (r =  0. 90), with a 5 % level of significance. A correlation factor of 0. 9 (α =  0. 05) was essential for these results, since water in the food increases the TPC values. Viscofrit provided results consistent with the open-column method for 78. 8 % of the samples, with 9. 3 % of false positive results. Testo 265 and Viscofrit showed good results for the substitution of the TPC conventional method, respecting their limitations. Viscofrit is not recommended for high melting point samples...|$|R
