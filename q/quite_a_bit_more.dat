25|$|Burnaby {{occupies}} 98.60 square kilometres (38.07 sq mi) and {{is located}} at the geographical centre of the Metro Vancouver area. Situated between the city of Vancouver on the west and Port Moody, Coquitlam, and New Westminster on the east, Burnaby is further bounded by Burrard Inlet and the Fraser River on the north and south respectively. Burnaby, Vancouver and New Westminster collectively occupy the major portion of the Burrard Peninsula. The elevation of Burnaby ranges from sea level to a maximum of 370 metres (1,200ft) atop Burnaby Mountain. Due to its elevation, the city of Burnaby experiences <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> snowfall during the winter months than nearby Vancouver or Richmond. Overall, the physical landscape of Burnaby is one of hills, ridges, valleys and an alluvial plain. The land features and their relative locations have had an influence on the location, type and form of development in the city.|$|E
25|$|Scorpions are {{opportunistic}} predators {{of small}} arthropods and insects. They use their chelae (pincers) {{to catch the}} prey initially. Depending on the toxicity of their venom and size of their claws, they will then either crush the prey or inject it with neurotoxic venom. The neurotoxins consist {{of a variety of}} small proteins as well as sodium and potassium cations, which serve to interfere with neurotransmission in the victim. Scorpions use their venom to kill or paralyze their prey {{so that it can be}} eaten; in general, it is fast acting, allowing for effective prey capture. Scorpion venoms are optimised for action on other arthropods and therefore most scorpions are relatively harmless to humans; stings produce only local effects (such as pain, numbness or swelling). A few scorpion species, however, mostly in the family Buthidae, can be dangerous to humans. The scorpion that is responsible for the most human deaths is Androctonus australis, or fat-tailed scorpion of North Africa. The toxicity of A.australiss venom is roughly half that of the deathstalker (Leiurus quinquestriatus), but since A.australis injects <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> venom into its prey, it is the most deadly to humans. Human deaths normally occur in the young, elderly, or infirm; scorpions are generally unable to deliver enough venom to kill healthy adults. Some people, however, may be allergic to the venom of some species, in which case the scorpion's sting can more likely kill. A primary symptom of a scorpion sting is numbing at the injection site, sometimes lasting for several days. It has been found that scorpions have two types of venom: a translucent, weaker venom designed to stun only, and an opaque, more potent venom designed to kill heavier threats.|$|E

[...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|R

Attempting “to convey a simple, contemporary form of beauty,”(Prada) the film recorded portions of the gnostic poem, “Thunder Perfect Mind ” over a jazzy soundtrack and images {{of a young woman}} who sees “herself coming and going at every turn in the faces of other women, some older, some <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> younger, some <b>more</b> wholesome ” (Browne) and some mirror images of herself. For Miuccia Prada, the poem was appropriate because, “It’s about the complexity of women. It’s totally contemporary ” (Prada). Her description begs the question: How is this ancient poem’s presentation of femininity “contemporary”? Ms. Prada states that “It’s fascinating how something written in ancient times can actually prove to be so illuminating”(Prada). If Prada found “Thunder Perfect Mind ” so attractive in its presentation of the “multiplicity of women ” that they chose to use it in their first television commercial ever, what is it about this ancient gnostic text that is so appealing to the contemporary culture the fashion-giant represents? (Prada) This paper will explore {{the answers to these questions}} by examining the presentation of feminine identity. First the poem “Thunder Perfect Mind ” will be considered alongside the gnostic presentation of feminine identity, which it embodies. Next, contemporary poetry and theory will be examined, primarily in the works of Denise Riley and Carol Ann Duffy to identify the most prominent ways of presenting and discussing feminine identity in those spheres. 2 Finally, this paper will attempt to explain why the current trends in poetry, theory, and culture find this two-thousand-year-old poem to be not only intriguing, but even, in Miuccia Prada’s words, “contemporary. ” Amazingly, the feminism of postmodern poetry parallels the feminism in Sethian Gnosticism as embodied in “Thunder Perfect Mind, ” making the poem at once ancient and modern...|$|R
500|$|Bungie and Microsoft first showed ODST in a playable form at E3 2009, {{where the}} game's release date and retail {{versions}} were finalized. Bungie initially marketed ODST as a title smaller in scope than previous numbered {{entries in the}} series. When the game's retail versions were announced, however, the game received a standard price of US$60, which Bungie and Microsoft attributed to the game growing beyond the planned scope. [...] "Over the course of development it got a lot bigger than we were anticipating," [...] said Bungie's Lars Bakken. [...] "We thought of it more as an expansion and then it grew well beyond that." [...] Creamer explained that since the development platform was stable, [...] "we were able to create <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>more</b> content than we originally thought we would". The game's length increased from original estimates of 3–5hours to 8–10. The discrepancy was not discussed until E3 2009 when Microsoft decided it was a full game. Unlike the post-launch support for Halo 3, ODST does not have downloadable content.|$|E

(These last two assertions require the axiom of choice in general, but not in the case of finite-dimensional spaces, or certain well-behaved infinite-dimensional spaces such as Lp spaces.) ...|$|E

Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, {{thanks to the music}} of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage....

It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all we have lived through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.|$|E
