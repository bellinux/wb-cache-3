5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated that the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection {{was better than the}} previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

The absence of this data greatly reduced the amount and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> available to subsequent investigations. Information on speed and height were derived from the position of cockpit dials in the wreckage, and the wreckage's condition. During 1994, the RAF had begun to fit these recording devices across the Chinook HC.2 fleet prior to the accident; this process was completed in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{homeless}} people grew in the 1980s, as housing and social service cuts increased. After many years of advocacy and numerous revisions, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987—this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service {{of homeless people}}. Over the past decades, the availability and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on homelessness has improved considerably. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. Homelessness in the United States increased after the Great Recession in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Leakage {{levels in}} Ireland {{currently}} stand at 41%, with considerable variation between local authorities, in part explained by corrosion of antiquated pipes. As {{part of the}} National Water Study, conducted in 2000, a water audit was undertaken for 91 water schemes outside Dublin to establish levels of non-revenue water (NRW). The report noted that the poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> and {{the low level of}} consumer metering limited the reliability of their figures. They found an average level of NRW of 47%, corresponding to 34 litres/connection/hour and 29 m3/km/day. This compares to only 10.1 m3/km/day in England, Scotland 21.3 m3/km/day, Netherlands 1.6 m3/km/day and Denmark 1.7 m3/km/day.|$|E

In this study, for 91 % of the modeled processes, the upper bound and lower bound of each process lies between +[*]/− 20 % of the average hybrid CFI, respectively, and the mean average value is recommended.|$|R
25|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{availability}} and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> on homelessness has improved considerably, due, in part, to initiatives by the United States government. Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed {{the number of individuals}} and families that were homeless, both sheltered and unsheltered. In 2009, There were about 643,000 sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people were employed.|$|E

Consequently, the management <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> associated <b>data</b> management processes has become critical for organizations. An important first step in managing data quality {{is the ability to}} measure the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> information products (derived data) based on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the source <b>data</b> and associated processes used to produce the information outputs.
