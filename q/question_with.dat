5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into a theological system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into <b>question</b> <b>with</b> hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the <b>question,</b> <b>with</b> the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped {{he would be able to}} influence Becket.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces {{the same question}} simultaneously. Contestants have their own money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult <b>question,</b> <b>with</b> an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the question to the contestants during this round. After this second question, the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex <b>question,</b> <b>with</b> the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{three types}} of <b>questions</b> <b>with</b> two wh-words in Czech. It is shown that these questions involve different syntactic constructions with different semantic representations. In <b>questions</b> <b>with</b> multiple fronting, wh-words either activate DistributiveP and ShareP projections at Logical Form, which leads to their pair-list reading, or the second one moves to ContrastP, which leads to their contrastive specific reading. In <b>questions</b> <b>with</b> fronting and conjunction, the coordinate wh-phrase occupies the Spec of ContrastP, {{which leads to a}} specific reading of conjoined wh-words. <b>Questions</b> <b>with</b> a final conjoined wh-word involve conjoined single questions...|$|R

Swedenborg wrote The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven as a detailed analysis of what he meant.|$|E

25|$|The lack of {{official}} credits {{is not a}} legal problem, given {{the age of the}} source material, but it troubled journalist Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal. Fusilli thought that this was contrary to Dylan's long track record of noting his influences, as in the liner notes of 1993's World Gone Wrong.

However, on balance, removing bracken encourages primary habitats to re-establish, which are of greater importance for wildlife. Control is a complex <b>question</b> <b>with</b> complex answers, which need to form part of a wider approach. Management can be difficult and expensive; plans may need to be about cost-effective, practical limitation and control rather than give an expectation for eradication.|$|E
25|$|Many other {{game shows}} feature a sudden-death playoff; usually, the next player {{to answer a}} {{question}} correctly wins. Often, the rules of sudden death provide that in the event a wrong answer is given, the opposing team wins (for instance, the radio quiz show Ask Me Another utilizes this format), even though wrong answers may otherwise not be penalized. Occasionally, the format is a numeric <b>question,</b> <b>with</b> the player making the closer guess winning.|$|E

On 1 October, in a regular session of the Parliament Venizelos announced the declaration of war to Turkey and accepting the Cretan deputies, thus closing the Cretan <b>Question,</b> <b>with</b> the declaration of the union of Crete with Greece.
