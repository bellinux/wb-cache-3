25|$|Ethinylestradiol (EE) is a {{more potent}} {{synthetic}} analogue of estradiol that is used widely in hormonal contraceptives. Mestranol, moxestrol, and <b>quinestrol</b> are derivatives of EE used clinically. A related drug is methylestradiol, which is also used clinically. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), such as Premarin, a commonly prescribed estrogenic drug produced from the urine of pregnant mares, include the natural steroidal estrogens equilin and equilenin, as well as, especially, estrone sulfate (which itself is inactive and becomes active upon conversion into estrone). A related and very similar product to CEEs is esterified estrogens (EEs).|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinestrol</b> (INN, USAN, BAN) (brand names Agalacto-Quilea, Basaquines, Eston, Estrovis, Estrovister, Plestrovis, Qui-Lea), {{also known}} as {{ethinylestradiol}} 3-cyclopentyl ether (EE2CPE), is a synthetic, steroidal estrogen used in hormone replacement therapy and occasionally to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer. It is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol (with cyclopentanol also being formed) with no intrinsic estrogenic activity of its own, and has a very long terminal half-life of more than 120 hours due to enhanced lipophilicity. Because of its much longer terminal half-life, <b>quinestrol</b> is {{two to three times}} as potent as ethinylestradiol. The drug was marketed as Estrovis in the United States by Parke Davis and as Qui-Lea in Argentina, but is reportedly not currently marketed. However, it does appear to be available as an oral contraceptive in combination with progestins in Argentina and China. <b>Quinestrol</b> was described in the literature in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Norsteroid {{examples}} include: 19-norpregnane (from pregnane), desogestrel, ethylestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, ethinylestradiol, gestrinone, levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone), norgestrel, norpregnatriene (from pregnatriene), <b>quinestrol,</b> 19-norprogesterone (from a progesterone), Nomegestrol acetate, 19-nortestosterone (from a testosterone), and norethisterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{derivatives}} of estradiol used as estrogens include ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, mestranol, methylestradiol, moxestrol, and <b>quinestrol,</b> all {{of which}} are 17α-substituted estradiol derivatives. Synthetic derivatives of estradiol used in scientific research include 8β-VE2 and 16α-LE2.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{derivatives}} of EE exist. These include mestranol (EE 3-methyl ether), <b>quinestrol</b> (EE 3-cyclopentyl ether), ethinylestradiol sulfonate (EE 3-isopropylsulfonate), and moxestrol (11β-methoxy-EE). The former three are prodrugs of EE, {{while the latter}} is not.|$|E

30|$|From April 2007 to September 2008, Liu et al. [15] {{executed}} field contraception experiment of plateau pika at Dawu Town, Maqin County of Qinghai Province. They selected 16 {{sample plots}} of 100 ha {{which are more}} than 0.5 km apart. Four replications of four treatments (<b>quinestrol,</b> levonorgestrel, EP- 1 (quinestrol:levonorgestrel = 3 : 6), and control) {{were randomly assigned to}} the 16 sample plots. Control ware conducted at every April. Fitting with their experimental data, they found that a = 70.4, b = 71.7, c = 58.3, and d = 17.1. They pointed out the contraception rate with <b>quinestrol</b> is about 0.78. From experience, ε = 0.24.|$|E
40|$|Rodent pest {{management}} traditionally relies on {{some form of}} lethal control. Developing effective fertility control for pest rodent species could be a major breakthrough particularly {{in the context of}} managing rodent population outbreaks. This laboratory-based study is the first to report on the effects of using fertility compounds on an outbreaking rodent pest species found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Mastomys natalensis were fed bait containing the synthetic steroid hormones <b>quinestrol</b> and levonorgestrel, both singly and in combination, at three concentrations (10, 50, 100 ppm) for seven days. Consumption of the bait and animal body mass was mostly the same between treatments when analysed by sex, day and treatment. However, a repeated measures ANOVA indicated that <b>quinestrol</b> and quinestrol+levonorgestrel treatments reduced consumption by up to 45 %, particularly at the higher concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm. Although there was no clear concentration effect on animal body mass, <b>quinestrol</b> and quinestrol+levonorgestrel lowered body mass by up to 20 % compared to the untreated and levonorgestrel treatments. <b>Quinestrol</b> and quinestrol+levonorgestrel reduced the weight of male rat testes, epididymis and seminal vesicles by 60 - 80 %, and sperm concentration and motility were reduced by more than 95 %. No weight changes were observed to uterine and ovarian tissue; however, high uterine oedema was observed among all female rats consuming treated bait at 8 days and 40 days from trial start. Trials with mate pairing showed there were significant differences in the pregnancy rate with all treatments when compared to the untreated control group of rodents...|$|E
40|$|Oestrogens {{are female}} sex hormones. Both natural and {{synthetic}} oestrogens {{have been found}} in many aquatic environments. There are three naturally occurring oestrogens – oestradiol, estriol and estrone. Oestradiol (correctly known as 17 β oestradiol or E 2) is a naturally occurring steroid hormone and is the most potent of these three. Diethylstilbestrol, dienestrol, <b>quinestrol</b> etc are synthetic oestrogens. These environmental steroidal and nonsteroidal oestrogens act as endocrine disruptors (EDs). Both types of oestrogens in the environmental samples can be quantified using several laboratory methods such as high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) etc. but they often require extensive training to perform. Arxula adeninivorans is biotechnologically significant dimorphic yeast with unusual characteristics. It can use a wide range of substrates and it is thermotolerant, osmotolerant and halotolerant. It is a non-pathogenic fungus and is therefore ideal for use in industrial settings. It is a source of many enzymes and a wide range of transformation platforms have been developed to enable the production of foreign proteins. In this project, A. adeninivorans was transformed with histidine-tagged synthetic oestrogen binding protein (EBP) gene based on the Candida albicans EBP sequence. The recombinant EBP expressed in the yeast Arxula is separated using HisTrap columns. Linear sweep voltammetry was used for the detection of EBP redox responses to oestrogen in solution. A three-electrode configuration was used for all measurements [auxiliary electrode (platinum wire), reference electrode (Ag/AgCl) and working electrodes (Pt 50 μm diameter micro-disc and 2 mm diameter glassy carbon) ]. Electron transfer from EBP to electrodes will require the use of a mediator system and TMPD, a lipophilic mediator used in this experiment. Screen printed electrodes (SPEs) were used to detect the interaction between EBP and oestrogen. To perform experiment with SPE, EBP was immobilized on SPE using the crosslinker glutaraldehyde. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was used to detect interactions of EBP and oestrogen on SPE. Immobilion N transfer membrane was impregnated with TMPD solution and electrochemistry (DPV) was performed. The purpose of using membrane is to simulate the immobilization of TMPD on SPE along with EBP for the detection of oestrogen...|$|E
