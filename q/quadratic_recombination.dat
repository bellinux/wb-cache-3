40|$|Comparative {{analysis}} of the X-ray dosimetric characteristics of CdGa₂S₄ and CdGa₂S₄ single crystals demonstrates that after copper-doping {{the persistence of the}} crystal characteristics completely disappears. The current-dose characteristics Ir E tend to linearity (α = 1) at low dose rates of X-rays. At high dose rates, α tends to 0. 5, which testifies to the mechanism of <b>quadratic</b> <b>recombination</b> of charge carriers generated by X-rays in CdGa₂S₄...|$|E
