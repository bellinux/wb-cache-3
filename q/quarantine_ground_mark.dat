60|$|Our {{ship was}} named after this noble stream. We got on board of her off Bedlow's, and dropped quietly down {{as far as the}} <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground</b> before we were met by the flood. Here we came to, to wait for a wind, more passengers, and that {{important}} personage, whom man-of-war's men term the master, and landsmen the captain. In the course of the afternoon we had all assembled, and began to reconnoitre each other, and to attend to our comforts.|$|R

60|$|I {{left the}} Plato at the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground,</b> {{going to the}} Sailor's Retreat. Here the {{physician}} told me I never could recover the use of my limb as I had possessed it before, but that the leg would gradually grow stronger, and that I might get along without crutches in the end. All this {{has turned out to}} be true. The pain had long before left me, weakness being now the great difficulty. The hip-joint is injured, and this in a way that still compels me to rely greatly on a stick in walking.|$|R
60|$|The ship {{only got}} to the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground</b> that day, but in the morning we went to sea. Our passage was long and stormy. The ship was on a bow-line most of the time, and we were {{something}} like forty days from land to land. Nothing extraordinary occurred, however, and we finally made the Bill of Portland. The weather came on thick, but we found a pilot, and ran into St. Helen's Roads and anchored. The captain got into his boat, and taking four men pulled ashore, to look for his orders at Cowes.|$|R

When ready, the brig sailed for New York, We encountered a heavy gale, about a week out, which swept away our deck-load, bulwarks, &c. At this time, the master, supercargo, mate, cook, and three of the crew, were down with the fever; leaving Mallet, Barnet and myself, {{to take care of the}} brig. We three brought the vessel up as far as Barnegat, where we procured assistance, and she arrived safe at the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{a voyage}} to Norfolk Island, Murray was {{instructed}} to continue {{the exploration of the}} southern coastline. He set out from Sydney on 12 November for the Kent Group; there he successfully navigated and charted the passage between Deal and Erith Islands, which would later be named in his honour. In December he undertook a survey of Western Port. On 4 January 1802, he sighted the entrance to Port Phillip, but decided the entrance was too dangerous, so continued to survey the east coast of King Island. On 14 February 1802 he returned and entered Port Phillip {{for the first time and}} anchored off what became the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

60|$|It was Sunday, but we {{were soon}} visited by boats from the town. Some came to carry us ashore, others {{to see that we}} carried nothing off with us. At first, the officer of the customs {{manifested}} a desire to make us all go without the smallest article of dress, or anything belonging to our most ordinary comforts; but he listened to remonstrances, and we were eventually allowed to depart with our night-bags. As the Hudson was to sail immediately for London, all our effects were sent within the hour to the custom-house. At 3 P.M. July 2nd, 1826, we put foot in Europe, after a passage of thirty-one days from the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{means of}} combating tick-fever caused by cattle-tick {{resulted}} from research by Charles Joseph Pound who began investigating [...] "redwater disease of cattle" [...] in the gulf district in 1894. He established that redwater or tick fever was confined to bovines and that the disease was readily transmissible by ticks and identified the genus of tick vector Boophilus. In the mid-1890s, Pound, as Queensland Government Bacteriologist, undertook tick fever inoculation studies. These, the first such trials in Australia, established a methodology and dosage that is still used worldwide. A cattle dip was built at the former Indooroopilly Sheep <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Grounds</b> in 1898 and until 1905 {{was used by the}} Department of Agriculture to establish a suitable dipping preparation and procedure for the destruction of cattle ticks.|$|R
40|$|In ants, {{aggregation}} {{is mainly}} {{based on the}} attraction between individuals. We confirmed the existence of <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> in Lasius niger and demonstrated its influence on the aggregative behaviour of ants: {{the place of the}} gathering is leading by the existence of a <b>ground</b> <b>marking</b> which favours clustering by increasing the rate of the process but does not change the aggregation level. This factor could {{play a role in the}} choice of a new nest site and in the spatial distribution of ants inside the nest. This marking, presuming to have a long duration, could represent an external memory which could play an important role in various situations such as the choice of new nest or the reorganisation of ants after a disturbance.
