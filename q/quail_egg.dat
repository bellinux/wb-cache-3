5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Japanese breeders began to {{selectively}} breed for increased egg production. By 1940, the <b>quail</b> <b>egg</b> industry was flourishing, but {{the events of}} World War II led to {{the complete loss of}} quail lines bred for their song type, as well as almost all of those bred for egg production. After the war, the few surviving domesticated quail were used to rebuild the industry, and all current commercial and laboratory lines are considered to have originated from this population. Modern birds can lay upward of 300 eggs a year and countries such as Japan, India, China, Italy, Russia, and the United States have established commercial Japanese quail farming industries. Japanese quail are also used in biomedical research in fields such as genetics, embryology, nutrition, physiology, pathology, and toxicity studies. These quail are closely related to the common quail, and many young hybrid birds are released into the wild each year to replenish dwindling wild populations.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the <b>quail</b> <b>egg</b> ravioli, which has been on the menu since day one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single ravioli stuffed with <b>quail</b> <b>egg</b> yolk and laced with truffle butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature organic ingredients. [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of out-of-season strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|E
500|$|After Schwa closed, {{about ten}} {{different}} Chicago restaurant owners {{offered to help}} Carlson get back on his feet. Carlson declined their help, but reopened Schwa four months later in mid-February 2008, {{thanks in part to}} a cash infusion from his father. [...] He hired an additional chef, allowing him to focus more of his attention on the dining room. The menu was redone, with only the three most popular dishes – the <b>quail</b> <b>egg</b> ravioli, the jellyfish pad Thai, and the [...] "pine cone" [...] dessert – returning. [...] The decor was also tweaked. [...] Customers with old, unfulfilled reservations were given the opportunity to try the new Schwa before new reservations were accepted.|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times {{describes}} Carlson's cooking {{style as}} [...] "New American", but Carlson himself prefers the description [...] "unstressed food." [...] "What's {{most important is}} that everyone ... has an incredible time," [...] he says. [...] One of Carlson's favorite cooking techniques is to make ingredients that people normally would not tolerate into something palatable. [...] He is known to combine ingredients in bizarre ways, such as pairing oysters with oatmeal and raisins. Despite these wild dishes, Carlson is {{perhaps best known for}} his simplistic, modern interpretations of classic Italian dishes. His <b>quail</b> <b>egg</b> ravioli is considered his signature dish. [...] The one element that ties all Carlson's dishes together is fat. [...] "Fat carries flavor really well," [...] he explains.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{was dealing}} with {{monitoring}} chosen parameters of quality of hen and <b>quail</b> <b>eggs</b> during storage. The following qualitative parameters were monitored (the decrease of egg weight, the width of albumen, the height of albumen, the width of yolk, the height of yolk, the weight of yolk, the index of albumen, the index of yolk, the Haugh units {{and the color of}} yolk. Used were eggs of Hisex Brown layer in 32 wk of age and eggs of Pharaon Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica).
