40|$|ABSTRACT: Succinylated mercerized {{cellulose}} (cell 1) {{was used to}} synthesize an anion exchange resin. Cell 1, containing carboxylic acid groups was reacted with triethylenetetramine to introduce amine functionality to this material to obtain cell 2. Cell 2 was reacted with methyl-iodide to <b>quaternize</b> the amine groups from this material to obtain cell 3. Cells 2 and 3 were characterized by mass percent gain, degree of amination and quaternization, FTIR and CHN. Cells 2 and 3 showed degrees of amination and quaternization of 2. 8 and 0. 9 mmol/g and nitrogen content of 6. 07 % and 2. 13 %, respectively. Cell 3 was used for Cr (VI) adsorption studies. Adsorption equilibrium time and optimum pH for Cr (VI) adsorption {{were found to be}} 300 min and 3. 1, respectively. The Langmuir isotherm was used to model adsorption equilibrium data. The adsorption capacity of cell 3 was found to be 0. 829 mmol/g. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of adsorption of Cr (VI) on cell 3 obeyed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to <b>quaternize</b> pine bark (PB) wood residues using green chemistry and to use the quaternized PB to remove nitrate (NO 3 −) from water. The quaternization process was achieved by reacting the wood residues with an ionic liquid analogue comprised of a choline chloride derivative and urea. Batch adsorption tests were used to delineate the NO 3 − uptake by the modified pine bark (MPB). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis and Zeta potential measurements were used to characterize the changes at the surface of the PB due to quaternization and NO 3 − uptake. RESULTS: The MPB has a maximum NO 3 − uptake capacity of 2. 91 mmol g− 1. The NO 3 − uptake kinetics indicated that diffusion through the boundary layer of the MPB was the rate limiting step. The Langmuir adsorption model provided a better fit for the uptake data than the Freundlich model, indicating monolayer adsorption. The uptake process was found dependent on concentration, pH and ionic strength, and was also spontaneous and exothermic. The desorption–regeneration experimental results indicated a 95 % efficiency after five consecutive regeneration cycles. CONCLUSIONS: The quaternization technique was found very effective for developing effective and green anion exchange resins to remove NO 3 − from water. © 2012 Society of Chemical IndustryPublishedN/...|$|E

Currently, most of the commercial H 5 N 1 vaccines are inactivated vaccines. While, in the intranasal immunization, these inactivated vaccine could not overcome the nasal mucosal barrier and usually generate relative weak immunity. Moreover, in the intramuscular immunization, these inactivated H 5 N 1 vaccines could not induce optimal immune response, even with commercial Alum adjuvant and always require large antigen dosage. Therefore, the thesis employed two biodegradable high molecular polymer, chitosan and poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA), to prepare thermal-sensitive hydrogel and uniform non-spherical PLGA particles as the intranasal and intramuscular adjuvant respectively, which could enhance the immune responses. For hydrogel adjuvant, {{the relationship between the}} physiochemical properties and immune effects and the underlying mechanism were explored. Then, toxicity and stability of the hydrogel formulation were investigated. For particle adjuvant, a simple method was developed to prepare non-spherical PLGA particles and explore their shape effects. This thesis was divided into the following parts. (1) The synthesis of quaternized chitosan (HTCC) was magnified and the thermal-sensitive HTCC hydrogel was well prepared by ionic gelation with glycerol phosphate sodium (GP). By adjusting the <b>quaternize</b> degree (QD) of HTCC, the influence of hydrogel cationic character and rheological behavior on the corresponding immune responses was investigated. Results showed there was competition between cationic character and thermal-sensitivity. As a consequence, the hydrogel with a moderate QD of 41 % had both the good cationic character and good thermal-sensitivity, resulting in the induction of the best humoral immunity. In-vivo animal experiments showed that the IgG titer induced by 41 % hydrogel was 5. 5 times higher than the pure antigen intranasal group (Ag IN) and comparable to the pure antigen intramuscular group (Ag IM). The nasal IgA titer of hydrogel group was 170 times higher than Ag IM. (2) The safety and toxicity of the hydrogel were systematically investigated. The tests of acute toxicity, repetitive dose toxicity, abnormal toxicity, allergy reaction, pyrogen and hemolysis were carried out in the animal models of mice, rats, rabbits and guinea pigs. Results showed that the HTCC hydrogel was well tolerated and had very low toxicity when used as an intranasal vaccine adjuvant. (3) Furthermore, we chose the import chitosan glutamine salt (CS-Glu) which has presented file to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prepare the CS-Glu hydrogel. Through the orthogonal experiment, the influence of CS-Glu concentration, GP concentration and antigen dose on the immune responses were investigated and optimized along with the formulation stability. Results showed that the antigen dose had a dominant effect on the immune effects and the influences of CS-Glu and GP were comparable. At last, the CS-Glu hydrogel adjuvant was optimized, which could induce the value of 120 for HI titer and IgA titer 178 times higher than Ag IM group. This hydrogel could store at 25 ± 1 °C for 6 days and 2 ~ 8 °C for more than 2 months。(4) There is lack of researches about the influence of particle shape on the biological outcomes because of the difficulty in the preparation of non-spherical particles. In order to resolve this problem, a novel method was developed based on the premix membrane emulsification technique to prepare uniform non-spherical particles. By employing an inorganic reagent, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), as the deformation initiator, non-spherical PLGA particles were prepared. The shape, morphology and size of the particles could be well controlled in this method and it is easy to scale up the production. Then, the non-spherical particles were used as H 5 N 1 vaccine adjuvants and the shape effects were studied. The preliminary results showed that the spherical particles could potentiate humoral immunity while the rod particles could promote the activation of antigen specific T cells and increase the antigen specific memory T cells. In summary, by using the high molecular polymers of chitosan and PLGA, two adjuvants of H 5 N 1 inactivated vaccine were developed. The influence of the physicochemical properties, the rheological behavior and the shape on the corresponding immune responses was deeply investigated. Moreover, the safety and formulation stability were studied and optimized, which could establish a foundation for clinical application.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Low {{degrees of}} Me iodide quaternization {{eliminates}} the LCST behavior of 2 -(Dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate- 2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate diblock copolymers (DMA-DEA) and significantly extends the pH (and temp.) range for colloidally stable micelles. Similar results were previously reported for fully <b>quaternized</b> DMA-DEA diblock copolymers, but these latter materials are poor surfactants since unfavorable electrostatic interactions lead to poor packing efficiencies at the air-water interface. In contrast, {{in the present}} study lightly <b>quaternized</b> diblock copolymers exhibit similar surface activities to the un-quaternized diblock copolymer precursor; thus, judicious control of the degree of quaternization unexpectedly allows fine-tuning and optimization of the aq. soln. properties of these new cationic polymeric surfactants. on SciFinder (R...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} large {{aquifers}} {{in various parts of}} the world have been identified with contamination by arsenic. Long-term exposure to arsenic in drinking water causes cancer of the skin, lungs, urinary bladder and kidney, as well as skin pigmentation and hyperkeratosis. Arsenic occurs in groundwater in two valence states, as trivalent arsenite [As(III) ] and pentavalent arsenate [As(V) ]. As(III) is more toxic and more difficult to remove from water by adsorption on activated alumina. In this study, immobilization (adsorption) of As(III) by <b>quaternized</b> rice husk was examined. Batch adsorption test showed that extent of adsorption was dependent on pH, As (III) concentration, contact time and rice husk dose. Maximum adsorption occurred at pH 7 - 8, and equilibrium adsorption was attained in 2 h. Equilibrium adsorption data were described by the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. According to the Langmuir isotherm, adsorption capacity of <b>quaternized</b> rice husk is 0. 775 mg As(III) /g, which is 4. 3 x higher than that (0. 180 mg As(III) /g) of activated alumina. <b>Quaternized</b> rice husk is a potentially useful adsorbent for removing arsenic from groundwater. </p...|$|R
40|$|Palm kernel shell (PKS) core fibers, an {{agricultural}} waste, were chemically modified using N-(3 -chloro- 2 -hydroxypropyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CHMAC) as a <b>quaternizing</b> agent. The potential of <b>quaternized</b> palm kernel shell (QPKS) as an adsorbent for fluoride {{in an aqueous}} solution was then studied. The <b>quaternized</b> palm kernel shell (QPKS) core fibers were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The effect of various factors on the fluoride sequestration was also investigated. The results showed that {{with an increase in}} the adsorbent amount and contact time, the efficiency of fluoride removal was improved. The maximum fluoride uptake was obtained at pH 3 and a contact time of 4 h. The adsorption behavior was further investigated using equilibrium isotherms and kinetics studies. The results from these studies fit well into Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Sips isotherm's with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 9716. The maximum fluoride removal was 63 %. For kinetics studies, the pseudo-second order was the best fit for fluoride, with an R 2 of 0. 999. These results suggest that QPKS has the potential to serve as a low-cost adsorbent for fluoride removal from aqueous solutions...|$|R
40|$|Cotton gauze fabric was {{functionalized}} with 2 -(dimethylamino) {{ethyl methacrylate}} (DMAEMA) {{with the aim}} of developing wound dressings with antibiofilm activity and tunable debriding activity. Cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes were prepared via one-step grafting (direct method) using Co- 60 gamma-rays as source to initiate the polymerization process. The effects of absorbed dose, dose rate, and monomer concentration on the degree of grafting were evaluated in detail. Some cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes were subsequently <b>quaternized</b> with methyl iodide. Grafting of DMAEMA and sequential quaternization were confirmed by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy; thermal properties were analyzed using TGA, and morphology by scanning electron microscopy. Grafting of DMAEMA gauzes enhanced blood absorption and collagenase activity, while further quaternization led to a remarkable inhibition of the proteinase activity. Their antimicrobial features were analyzed by evaluating their biofilm inhibiting and biofilm eradicating properties in an in vitro chronic wound model. Although the non-quaternized gauzes only displayed moderate biofilm inhibitory properties at best, the <b>quaternized</b> cotton-g-DMAEMA bearing the highest content of DMAEMA displayed strong biofilm inhibiting and biofilm eradicating properties. This indicates that <b>quaternized</b> cotton-g-DMAEMA gauzes are less prone to be colonized by bacteria and can notably reduce the number of colonies in an infected wound...|$|R
40|$|Two {{strategies}} {{were used for}} the preparation of hyperbranched polymer brushes with a high density of functional groups: (a) the cathodic electrografting of stainless steel by poly[2 -(2 -chloropropionate) ethyl acrylate] [poly(cPEA) ], which was used as a macroinitiator for the atom transfer radical polymerization of an inimer, 2 -(2 -bromopropionate) ethyl acrylate in {{the presence or absence of}} heptadecafluorodecyl acrylate, (b) the grafting of preformed hyperbranched poly(ethyleneimine) onto poly(N-succinimidyl acrylate) previously electrografted onto stainless steel. The hyperbranched polymer, which contained either bromides or amines, was <b>quaternized</b> because the accordingly formed quaternary ammonium or pyridinium groups are known for antibacterial properties. The structure, chemical composition, and morphology of the <b>quaternized</b> and nonquaternized hyperbranched polymer brushes were characterized by ATR-FTIR reflectance, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. The peeling test confirmed that the grafted hyperbranched polymer films adhered much more strongly to stainless steel than the nongrafted solvent-cast films. The <b>quaternized</b> hyperbranched polymer brushes were more effective in preventing both protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion than quaternary ammonium containing poly(cPEA) primary films, more likely because of the higher hydrophilicity and density of cationic groups.
