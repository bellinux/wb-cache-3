5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Cuba Court was {{the home}} of Denis Bowes Daly, who was a {{prominent}} member of the local ascendancy. Prior to his death in 1821 he had leased Cuba Court to the Army Medical Board on a 61-year lease. The building was little used as a hospital and the Medical Board was <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to give it up to the Commissioners of Education for the purpose of the Royal School, which had eventually been established {{as a result of the}} Royal Charter of 1621.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can you imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

25|$|In August 1923, the Chairman of Council, Rev. John Ferguson, retired due to ill health. Up {{until this}} stage it {{appeared}} that Council was <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> with McQueen's new ideas and organisation, however, as soon as Ferguson had retired, relations began to deteriorate between McQueen and Council.|$|E
25|$|Delivering a eulogy for a {{close friend}} and for someone who was so much admired is never a happy occasion. Though I must confess I would be <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to deliver a eulogy for a certain media {{personality}} who's tried the second Kennedy assassination of our time... and failed.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Weiss's {{wife and}} their {{families}} did not accept his guilt, especially since Weiss's parents indicated that he had seemed <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> earlier {{on the day that}} Long was killed. In fact, most of the people close to the family, and politics of the time doubted the official version of the shooting.|$|E

25|$|He was not {{enthusiastic}} about {{the ordination of women}} but regarded it as inevitable and was <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> with women priests when they were eventually ordained. He was a keen promoter of black and other ethnic minority members of the synod. He was also a key figure in the establishment of the Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe.|$|E
25|$|I am now <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to be {{breaking}} up. Things getting much {{too big and}} uncontrollable. All along we've wanted to keep our hands on everything, so nothing happened that we didn't want to. With international and multi-format/multi-territorial shit, that's proving elusive. I prefer to cut it off rather than have it turn into another Gross Rock Spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Along the Northern Norwegian coast, the Sami culture {{came under}} {{pressure}} during the Iron Age by expanding Norse settlements and taxation from powerful Norse chieftains. The {{nature of the}} Norse-Sami relationship along the North-Norwegian coast in the Iron Age is still hotly debated, but possibly the Sami were <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to ally themselves with the Norse chieftains, as they could provide protection against Finno-Ugric enemies from {{the area around the}} White Sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is happiness?" [...] quoth he, much as Pilate {{may have}} {{questioned}} what was truth. Then {{before she could}} reply he hastened to add: [...] "I have not been <b>quite</b> so <b>happy</b> these many years." ...|$|R
60|$|Not <b>quite</b> equally <b>happy</b> are the {{descriptions}} of the cruel brothers, and of Lorenzo as the young lover. There {{is a tendency to}} exaggerate both their inhumanity and his gentleness, for purposes of contrast, which weakens where it would give strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, take me off {{the list}} with him, Major. I am in wretched spirits too. You are my husband's old friend. I may {{acknowledge}} to you that our married life is just now not <b>quite</b> a <b>happy</b> one." ...|$|R
25|$|The Dukes of Normandy were <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> {{to allow}} these Danish adventurers {{to use their}} ports for raids on the English coast. The result was that the courts of England and Normandy became {{increasingly}} hostile to each other. Eventually, Æthelred sought a treaty with the Normans, and ended up marrying Emma, daughter of Richard I, Duke of Normandy in the Spring of 1002, which {{was seen as an}} attempt to break the link between the raiders and Normandy.|$|E
25|$|Another way pulps kept {{costs down}} was by paying authors less than other markets; thus many eminent authors {{started out in}} the pulps before they were {{successful}} enough to sell to better-paying markets, and similarly, well-known authors whose careers were slumping or who wanted a few quick dollars could bolster their income with sales to pulps. Additionally, some of the earlier pulps solicited stories from amateurs who were <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to see their words in print and could thus be paid token amounts.|$|E
25|$|Well {{known from}} ancient Greek and Roman writers is King Midas, the last {{king of the}} Phrygian Kingdom. The mythology of Midas {{revolves}} around his ability to turn objects to gold by mere touch, as granted by Dionysos, and his unfortunate encounter with Apollo from which his ears are turned into the ears of a donkey. The historical record of Midas shows that he lived approximately between 740 and 696 BCE, and represented Phrygia as a great king. Most historians now consider him to be King Mita of the Mushkis as noted in Assyrian accounts. The Assyrians thought of Mita as a dangerous foe, for Sargon II, their ruler at the time, was <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to negotiate a peace treaty in 709 BCE. This treaty {{had no effect on}} the advancing Cimmerians in the East, who streamed into Phrygia and led to the downfall and suicide of King Midas in 696 BCE.|$|E

25|$|The Elector Ernest Augustus {{commissioned}} Leibniz {{to write}} {{a history of the}} House of Brunswick, going back to the time of Charlemagne or earlier, hoping that the resulting book would advance his dynastic ambitions. From 1687 to 1690, Leibniz traveled extensively in Germany, Austria, and Italy, seeking and finding archival materials bearing on this project. Decades went by but no history appeared; the next Elector became quite annoyed at Leibniz's apparent dilatoriness. Leibniz never finished the project, in part because of his huge output on many other fronts, but also because he insisted on writing a meticulously researched and erudite book based on archival sources, when his patrons would have been <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> with a short popular book, one perhaps little more than a genealogy with commentary, to be completed in three years or less. They never knew that he had in fact carried out a fair part of his assigned task: when the material Leibniz had written and collected for his history of the House of Brunswick was finally published in the 19th century, it filled three volumes.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his second}} {{retirement}} from the sport, Michael Schumacher {{commented on the}} three years at Mercedes GP: [...] "I have tried that mission to end successful.

500|$|While she dislikes being {{referred}} to as [...] "Bono's wife", she has said, [...] " [...] I really don't have a big problem with my own identity, because I am a very private person, so I've always let Bono take the brunt of anything that was coming along. He is happy to do that; I am <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> {{to make my own}} way around things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Many {{have sought}} to bear her from me,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'All have failed. [...] "I never will give my hand, papa"--those were her words--"unless my heart is won." [...] She has not been <b>quite</b> so <b>happy</b> as she used to be, of late. I don't know why.' ...|$|R
6000|$|They had {{a honeymoon}} by the sea. He insisted upon it with boyish eagerness, {{and as they}} walked on the links or sat in their room he would exclaim ecstatically: [...] "How happy I am! I wonder if there were ever two people <b>quite</b> so <b>happy</b> as you and I!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am sorry, my dear, {{you have}} such an {{objection}} to the Maypole and old John, for otherways as it's a very fine morning, and Saturday's not a busy day with us, we might have all three gone to Chigwell in the chaise, and had <b>quite</b> a <b>happy</b> day of it.' ...|$|R
500|$|Although it was {{intended}} as a technology demonstration, most of the onlookers at the Festival of Britain were more interested in playing the game than in the programming and engineering logic behind it. Bennett claimed that [...] "most of the public were <b>quite</b> <b>happy</b> to gawk at the flashing lights and be impressed." [...] BBC Radio journalist Paul Jennings claimed that all of the festival attendees [...] "came to a standstill" [...] upon reaching the [...] "frightful" [...] "tremendous gray refrigerator".|$|E
500|$|Oxford boat club {{president}} Andrew Lindsay {{acknowledged the}} weight difference: [...] "We are <b>quite</b> <b>happy,</b> {{it presents a}} challenge. [...] They have got the equivalent of another cox to carry along." [...] Cambridge's president David Cassidy (who would row for Goldie) was blunt in his assessment: [...] "A powerful car will beat a less powerful car." [...] Cambridge, coached by Robin Williams, suffered a setback: their number five, Toby Wallace, was ill in the run-in to the race, and {{did not participate in}} the outings just prior to the main event. [...] Despite that, The Times reported that the Light Blue boat looked [...] "ominously powerful".|$|E
500|$|Fairbanks {{described}} Kingsley as [...] "an unusually permissive slave owner" [...] {{who wrote}} about the physical superiority of Africans to Europeans, armed his slaves for protection, and gave them padlocks for their cabins. Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's hands-off approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and [...] "encouraged {{as much as possible}} dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they were perfectly honest and obedient, and appeared <b>quite</b> <b>happy,</b> having no fear but that of offending me; and I hardly ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them." ...|$|E
60|$|Midas {{called himself}} a happy man, but {{felt that he}} was not yet <b>quite</b> so <b>happy</b> as he might be.

6000|$|... "You and I {{have had}} <b>quite</b> a <b>happy</b> time together, {{these last few}} months," [...] he went on, [...] "even though there is still that black cloud between us.
