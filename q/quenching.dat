5|$|<b>Quenching</b> {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then <b>quenching</b> it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} types of heat {{treating}} processes available to steel. The most common are annealing, <b>quenching,</b> and tempering. Heat treatment is effective on compositions above the eutectoid composition (hypereutectoid) of 0.8% carbon. Hypoeutectoid steel does not benefit from heat treatment.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon behavior for most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by <b>quenching</b> to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E

30|$|The {{superconducting magnet}} is powered {{with a power}} supply. The stored energy of the superconducting magnet is about 4.406  MJ. To protect the superconducting magnet against damage during a <b>quench,</b> the {{appropriate}} <b>quench</b> protection is required. The <b>quench</b> protection circuit needs to be designed to limit the <b>quench</b> hot spot temperature and the <b>quench</b> voltage. The two split coils are subdivided into 4 sections to limit the <b>quench</b> voltage. Each section is in parallel with a back-to-back diode and a dump resistor. To accelerate the <b>quench</b> propagation, the <b>quench</b> heater was adopted.

5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially <b>quenching</b> the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If <b>quenching</b> is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E

40|$|Liquid {{scintillation}} counting of weak 3 -emitters like tritium and 14 C, {{usually involves}} <b>quench</b> correction with a stored <b>quench</b> curve, which traditionally expresses the counting efficiency {{as a function}} of a <b>quench</b> monitor value. Generally, the <b>quench</b> curve is produced by measuring chemically <b>quenched</b> (uncolored) calibration standards; however, if the unknown samples Contain color, the computed activity will systematically be in error when a basic <b>quench</b> monitor, like the isotope mean pulse height or the external standard endpoint, is used. The errors will be even more pronounced in dual label counting, as the shapes of the spectra depend on the relative amounts of color and chemical <b>quench.</b> In this chapter, we outline an improved <b>quench</b> Correction method based on the dynamic determination of both the overall <b>quench</b> level and the amount of color <b>quench.</b> The counting efficiency is computed from a <b>quench</b> curve which in fact should be regarded as a surface. This solution was first implemented in the Wallac 1219 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter.

40|$|The chiral nonanalytic {{behavior}} of quark-flavor {{contributions to the}} magnetic moments of octet baryons is determined in full, <b>quenched</b> and partially <b>quenched</b> QCD, using an intuitive and efficient diagrammatic formulation of <b>quenched</b> and partially <b>quenched</b> chiral perturbation theory. The technique provides a separation of quark-sector magnetic-moment contributions into direct sea-quark loop, valence-quark, indirect sea-quark loop and <b>quenched</b> valence contributions, the latter being the conventional view of the <b>quenched</b> approximation. Both meson and baryon mass violations of SU(3) -flavor symmetry are accounted for. Following a comprehensive examination of the individual quark-sector contributions to octet baryon magnetic moments, numerous opportunities to observe and test the underlying structure of baryons {{and the nature of}} chiral nonanalytic behavior in QCD and its <b>quenched</b> variants are discussed. In particular, the valence u-quark contribution to the proton magnetic moment provides the optimal opportunity to directly view nonanalytic behavior associated with the meson cloud of full QCD and the <b>quenched</b> meson cloud of <b>quenched</b> QCD.
