40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an optimal {{quadrature}} error correction method for the dual-mass MEMS gyroscope, {{in order to}} reduce the long term bias drift. It is known that the coupling stiffness and demodulation error are important elements causing bias drift. The coupling stiffness in dual-mass structures is analyzed. The experiment proves that the left and right masses’ quadrature errors are different, and the <b>quadrature</b> <b>correction</b> system should be arranged independently. The process leading to quadrature error is proposed, and the Charge Injecting Correction (CIC), Quadrature Force Correction (QFC) and Coupling Stiffness Correction (CSC) methods are introduced. The correction objects of these three methods are the quadrature error signal, force and the coupling stiffness, respectively. The three methods are investigated through control theory analysis, model simulation and circuit experiments, and the results support the theoretical analysis. The bias stability results based on CIC, QFC and CSC are 48 °/h, 9. 9 °/h and 3. 7 °/h, respectively, and this value is 38 °/h before quadrature error correction. The CSC method is proved to be the better method for <b>quadrature</b> <b>correction,</b> and it improves the Angle Random Walking (ARW) value, increasing it from 0. 66 °/√h to 0. 21 °/√h. The CSC system general test results show that it works well across the full temperature range, and the bias stabilities of the six groups’ output data are 3. 8 °/h, 3. 6 °/h, 3. 4 °/h, 3. 1 °/h, 3. 0 °/h and 4. 2 °/h, respectively, which proves the system has excellent repeatability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{technology for}} {{the suppression of the}} mechanical coupling errors for an improved decoupled dual-mass micro-gyroscope (DDMG). The improved micro-gyroscope structure decreases the moment arm of the drive decoupled torque, which benefits the suppression of the non-ideal decoupled error. <b>Quadrature</b> <b>correction</b> electrodes are added to eliminate the residual quadrature error. The structure principle and the quadrature error suppression means of the DDMG are described in detail. ANSYS software is used to simulate the micro-gyroscope structure to verify the mechanical coupling error suppression effect. Compared with the former structure, simulation results demonstrate that the rotational displacements of the sense frame in the improved structure are substantially suppressed in the drive mode. The improved DDMG structure chip is fabricated by the deep dry silicon on glass (DDSOG) process. The feedback control circuits with quadrature control loops are designed to suppress the residual mechanical coupling error. Finally, the system performance of the DDMG prototype is tested. Compared with the former DDMG, the quadrature error in the improved dual-mass micro-gyroscope is decreased 9. 66 -fold, and the offset error is decreased 6. 36 -fold. Compared with the open loop sense, the feedback control circuits with quadrature control loop decrease the bias drift by 20. 59 -fold and the scale factor non-linearity by 2. 81 -fold in the ± 400 °/s range...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} design of an efficient adaptive digital baseband predistorter for modern cellular handsets that combines low power consumption, low implementation complexity, and high performance. The proposed enhancements are optimized for hardware implementation. We first present a thorough study of the optimal spacing of linearly-interpolated lookup table predistorters supported by theoretical calculations and extensive simulations. A constant-SNR compander that increases the predistorter's supported input dynamic range is derived. A corresponding low-complexity approximation that lends itself to efficient hardware design is also implemented in VHDL and synthesized with the Synopsys Design Compiler. This dissertation also proposes an LMS-based predistorter adaptation that is optimized for hardware implementation and compares {{the effectiveness of the}} direct and indirect learning architectures. A novel predistorter design with <b>quadrature</b> imbalance <b>correction</b> capability is developed and a corresponding adaptation scheme is proposed. This robust predistorter configuration is designed by combining linearization and I/Q imbalance correction into a single function with the same computational complexity as the widespread complex-gain predistorter.

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper a novel fully {{decoupled}} silicon micromachined tri-axis linear vibratory gyroscope. The proposed gyroscope structure is highly symmetrical and can be limited to an area of about 8. 5 mm × 8. 5 mm. It can differentially detect three axes’ angular velocities at the same time. By elaborately arranging different beams, anchors and sensing frames, the drive and sense modes are fully decoupled from each other. Moreover, the <b>quadrature</b> error <b>correction</b> and frequency tuning functions are taken into consideration in the structure design for all the sense modes. Since there exists an unwanted in-plane rotational mode, theoretical analysis is implemented to eliminate it. To accelerate the mode matching process, the particle swam optimization (PSO) algorithm is adopted and a frequency split of 149 Hz is first achieved by this method. Then, after two steps of manual adjustment of the springs’ dimensions, the frequency gap is further decreased to 3 Hz. With {{the help of the}} finite element method (FEM) software ANSYS, the natural frequencies of drive, yaw, and pitch/roll modes are found to be 14, 017 Hz, 14, 018 Hz and 14, 020 Hz, respectively. The cross-axis effect and scale factor of each mode are also simulated. All the simulation results are in good accordance with the theoretical analysis, which means the design is effective and worthy of further investigation on the integration of tri-axis accelerometers on the same single chip to form an inertial measurement unit...|$|R
40|$|The 3 G and 4 G systems {{make use}} of {{spectrum}} efficient modulation techniques which has variable amplitude. The variable amplitude methods usually use carrier‘s amplitude and phase to carry the message signal. As the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied continuously, they {{are sensitive to the}} disturbances affecting the information signal by introducing nonlinearities. Nonlinearities not only introduce errors in the data but also lead to spreading of signal spectrum which in turn leads to the adjacent channel interference. In transmitters, the power amplifier (PA) is the main source for introducing nonlinearities in the system, further to this, analog implementation of Quadrature modulator suffers from many distortions, at the same time receiver also suffers from Quadrature demodulator impairments, in particular, gain and phase imbalances and dc-offset from local oscillator, which all together degrades the performance of mobile communication systems. The baseband digital predistortion technique is used for compensation of the Radio Frequency (RF) impairments in transceivers as it provides significant accuracy and flexibility. The Thesis work is organized in two phases: in the first phase, a bibliography on available references is documented and later a simulation chain for compensation of RF impairments in mobile terminal is developed using Matlab software. By using the loop back features of Lime LMS 6002 D architecture, it is possible to separate the problems of the Quadrature modulator (QM) and Quadrature demodulator (QDM) errors {{from the rest of the}} RF impairments. However in the Thesis work Lime LMS 6002 D chip wasn‘t used, as the work was optional. So, in the Thesis work, algorithm is developed in Matlab software by assuming the LMS 6002 D architecture. The idea is performed by sequential compensation of all the RF impairments. At first the QM and QDM errors are compensated and later PA nonlinearities are compensated. The QM and QDM errors are compensated in a sequential way. At first the QM errors are compensated and later QDM errors are compensated. The QM errors are corrected adaptively by using a block called as <b>Quadrature</b> modulator <b>correction</b> by assuming an ideal QDM. Later, the QDM errors are compensated by using Hilbert filter with the pass band interval of 0. 2 to 0. 5. Later, the PAs nonlinearities are compensated adaptively by using a digital predistorter block. For finding the coefficients of predistorter, normalized least mean square algorithm is used. Improvement in adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of 13 dB is achieved and signal is converging after 15 k samples...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} new computational methods for two major topics. The first topic is computing the Stokes flow {{driven by an}} open immersed interface. The other topic is the simulation of the Stokes and Navier-Stokes fluid through an elastic tube driven by an internal source and sink. For the first topic, we developed two second-order accurate method. One is for accurately evaluating boundary integral solutions at a point, {{and the other is}} for computing Stokes solution values on a rectangular mesh. We first describe a method for computing singular or nearly singular integrals, evaluated at a point on or near the curve. To improve accuracy of the numerical <b>quadrature,</b> we add <b>corrections</b> for the errors arising from discretization, which are found by asymptotic analysis. When used to solve the Stokes equations with sources on an open, immersed interface, the method generates second-order approximations, for both the pressure and the velocity, and preserves the jumps in the solutions and their derivatives across the boundary. We then combine the method with a mesh-based solver to yield a hybrid method for computing Stokes solutions at N 2 grid points on a rectangular grid. Numerical results are presented which exhibit second-order accuracy. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we use the method to simulate fluid dynamics induced by the beating motion of a cilium. For the second topic, we present numerical method for simulating both Stokes and Navier Stokes fluid flow through a compliant, closed tube, driven by an internal source and sink. The governing equations are implemented in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates, which capture 3 D flow dynamics with only 2 D computations. In the Stokes fluid flow simulations, we solve the model equations using a hybrid approach: we decompose the pressure and velocity fields into parts due to the surface force and due to the source and sink, with each part handled separately by means of an appropriate method. Because the singularly-supported surface force yields an unsmooth solution, that part of the solution is computed by using the immersed interface method with the jump conditions for the axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates. The velocity due to the source and sink is calculated along the tubular surface using boundary integrals. The source and sink are prescribed in the simulation. From the convergence test and oscillating frequency-amplitude study, we can demonstrate second-order accuracy and applicability of the method. In the Navier-Stokes flow simulations, we adopt the velocity decomposition approach developed by Beale and Layton. The total velocity is decomposed into the Stokes part and the regular part. The Stokes part satisfies the Stokes equation and includes the boundary force. The regular part satisfies the modified Navier-Stokes equation that incorporate the source and sink terms, with the latter computed using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. Convergence test, oscillating frequency-amplitude study and fluid viscosity-amplitude study are presented that demonstrate the accuracy of the method. Dissertatio...|$|R
