40|$|To {{obtain an}} insight into how internists and {{residents}} use <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> and their opinions on these assessments. Questionnaire survey. All 139 internists and residents who attended a national training day on internal medicine in 2012 were invited to answer questions anonymously on the actual use of various <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> and to give their opinion on these assessments. The questionnaire consisted of closed and free text questions. The answers were analysed using descriptive statistics. The qualitative information was analysed together by the investigators. In total 123 doctors (88 % of the 139 attendants at the training day) from 45 training hospitals (74 % of all internal medicine residency training programs) participated in this study. All respondents had recently participated as an individual or {{as a member of}} a group in one or more <b>quality</b> <b>assessments.</b> Medical departments and group practices carried out <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> more often than required in many cases. Respondents recognised and acknowledged the advantages of <b>quality</b> <b>assessments.</b> The disadvantages of <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> related to the methods, the ways assessments were used and undesirable effects. Most of the medical departments and group practices developed policies on how to follow up on the assessment results. Individual performance data was also discussed in the majority of cases.

Distal <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> describe experiences potentially available to children, but do not describe actual ex-periences.

Proximal <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> describe the actual events experienced by children in day care settings. Proximal quality was defined by the National Association for the Education of Young Children's (NAEYC; Bredekamp, 1987) guidelines for developmentally appropriate practices and included caregiver goals, strategies, and guidance. The study examined (1) the efficacy of proximal and distal quality in predicting chil-dren's development after controlling for family factors, and (2) the validity of using the NAEYC guidelines {{as a measure of}} proximal quality. Correla-tions between the ECERS and proximal quality lent tentative support to the validity of the guidelines.

40|$|Background: Schools {{of nursing}} {{continue}} to be challenged because students who display unprofessional behaviour are being allowed to progress through pre-registration programs. The inclusion of a personal <b>qualities</b> <b>assessment</b> {{as part of the}} admissions process may address this issue; however, no instrument currently used for selecting nursing students measures the range of personal qualities required in a practising nurse. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a test battery known as the Personal <b>Qualities</b> <b>Assessment</b> is an appropriate instrument to measure the personal qualities of nursing students. Methods: A literature review identified studies that explored the personal qualities of a professional nurse. Thematic analysis identified recurring patterns, both in the literature and in the Australian Nursing and Midwifery professional codes and standards statements. The codes and standards statements were compared and mapped by an expert panel to the traits measured by the Personal <b>Qualities</b> <b>Assessment.</b> Inter-rater agreement analysis was used to demonstrate the experts' agreement with each other in the mapping exercise. Results: The Personal <b>Qualities</b> <b>Assessment</b> was found to map closely to the personal qualities desired in a registered nurse as expressed in the Australian Nursing and Midwifery professional codes and standards statements.

40|$|Background: This Additional file 1 {{supplements}} {{the main}} paper Hirji (2009), No short-cut in assessing trial quality: a case study. It describes the check-list based <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> {{of the paper}} Burke et al. (1991) performed in nine systematic reviews of antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. It also describes the usage of the data from this paper in the three most recent reviews. Results: Six reviews did not note any specific quality related problem, two reviews each noted one quality related problem, and one review noted two problems. In all three distinct problems were identified: lack of baseline comparability, incomplete description of dropouts, and a possibly misidentified outcome. Most reviews rated the trial as a good or high quality trial, and recent reviews continue to extensively use its outcome data. Conclusions: <b>Quality</b> <b>assessments</b> done for nine systematic reviews by {{experts in the field}} using different checklist based instruments and at times with more than one independent assessor have generally concluded that Burke et al.

40|$|Background: The rise of {{evidence-based}} medicine may {{have implications for}} the doctor–patient interaction. In recent decades, a shift towards a more task-oriented approach in general practice indicates a development towards more standardised healthcare. Objective: To examine whether this shift is accompanied by changes in perceived quality of doctor–patient communication. Design: GP observers and patient observers performed <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> of Dutch General Practice consultations on hypertension videotaped in 1982 – 1984 and 2000 – 2001. In the first cohort (1982 – 1984) 81 patients were recorded by 23 GPs {{and in the second}} cohort (2000 – 2001) 108 patients were recorded by 108 GPs. The GP observers and patient observers rated the consultations on a scale from 1 to 10 on three quality dimensions: medical technical quality, psychosocial quality and quality of interpersonal behaviour. Multilevel regression analyses were used to test whether a change occurred over time. Results: The findings showed a significant improvement over time on all three dimensions. There was no difference between the <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> of GP observers and patient observers. The three different dimensions were moderately to highly correlated and the assessments of GP observers showed less variability in the second cohort. Conclusions: hypertension consultations in general practice in the Netherlands received higher <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> by general practitioners and patients on medical technical quality, psychosocial quality and the quality of interpersonal behaviour in 2000 – 2001 as compared with the 1980 s. The shift towards a more task-oriented approach in hypertension consultations does not seem to detract from individual attention for the patient. In addition, there is less variation between general practitioners in the <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> of more recent consultations. The next step in this line of research is to unravel the factors that determine patients' <b>quality</b> <b>assessments</b> of doctor–patient communication. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
