Numerical results have demonstrated {{that this type of}} fractal feeding can provide the antenna with a two times broader bandwidth compared to that of the conventional <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformer</b> feeding as well as a good 2 nd harmonic suppression property.

40|$|If {{the real}} {{part of the}} load {{impedance}} {{is less than the}} reference impedance and the load is capacitive, then 90 ° must be added to the length computed by Eq. 45. If the real part of the load impedance is less than the reference impedance and the load is inductive, then 90 ° must be subtracted from the computed length. The Shortened <b>Quarter-Wavelength</b> <b>Transformer</b> Another less well-known but useful adaptation of the <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformer</b> is the shortened, doublesection transformer depicted in Figure 10. I will refer to this as type 13. Like the standard transformer, it is used to match real impedances. But the required length is shorter and it uses lines with characteristic impedance equal to the impedances being matched. These are both practical features in many applications. Notice that the transmission line with characteristic impedance equal to the load is adjacent to the source. Both transmission lines have the same length. The maximum line length is 30 °, and it decreases as the load impedance is much higher or lower than the source impedance. With normalized load resistance R′ L, the line length i...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this {{technical}} report, {{the design}} of a high-frequency matching circuit is presented. This circuit is a transformer comprising a cascade of multisections of quarter-wavelength transmission lines. The transformer, also referred to as matching circuit, is implemented based on microstrip technology. The matching circuit is required to perform as a transition from a 10 -Ω load to a 50 -Ω source. Moreover, this transition is specified to have a return loss more than 20 dB over the entire S-band from 2 GHz to 4 GHz. Analytical model developed and verified by full-wave simulation results indicates that {{the design of}} a <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformer</b> with four sections satisfies required design specifications. In-house prototype unit is fabricated to validate design performance. The experimental and simulation results of microwave scattering parameters are in very goo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a design approach for dual-band Wilkinson power dividers. Two pairs of parallel coupled-lines {{are used to}} replace the <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformers</b> in the conventional Wilkinson power divider to obtain dual-band operation. Using even- and odd-mode analysis, the closed-form design equations are derived for design parameters and design procedures of the proposed dual-band power divider are given. For verification purpose, a practical power divider, which operates at 1 GHz and 2. 1 GHz with 3 dB power dividing ratio, is designed, fabricated and tested. The simulated and measured results are in good agreement. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel circularly polarized sequentially rotated slot antenna array (CPSSAA) designed {{to operate at}} a frequency of 5. 5 GHz. This antenna is suitable for communication applications such as WLAN/WiMAX. Method of feeding is based on sequential rotation with seven <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformers.</b> In this case, the elements with 200 Ω impedance could be replaced by other elements with different input impedance. Reducing the elements input impedance, maximum power can {{be transferred to the}} elements. Because the lower losses in transmission line occur in presence of lower impedance, the 3 dB axial-ratio bandwidth of the CPSSAA extends to ∼ 1. 3 GHz. The CPSSAA was designed to operate over the frequency range between 4. 5 and 6. 4 GHz corresponding to an impedance bandwidth of 34. 86 % for VSWR[*]<[*] 2. Acceptable agreement between the simulation and measured results validates the proposed design...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} Wilkinson {{power divider}} operating at the millimeter wave band (28 GHz) for future 5 G mobile systems is presented. This power divider {{has the ability}} to change continuously the output power division ratio by using two varactors. Instead of connecting the two branch lines of the conventional Wilkinson power divider directly to the isolation resistor and the output ports, two varactors are inserted in the output terminals of the input T-junction to tune the equivalent impedance of these two branch lines. <b>Quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformers</b> are deployed at the input and output ports to enhance the matching in all ports across the tuning range. The simulation results indicate that the ratio of output power can be adjusted from 1 : 1 to 1 : 2. 4 across the band from 27 to 29 GHz. The return loss is more than 11 dB, while the isolation is more than 13 dB. In addition, the phase and amplitude imbalances are less than 6 ° and 0. 8 dB, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel quad-band power divider with equal power division ratio. The proposed power divider is realized using two cascaded sections of dual-band transformers based on coupled microstrip lines. Limitations of using dual-band <b>quarter-wavelength</b> <b>transformers</b> based on coupled lines are studied through parametric analysis to obtain useful design guidelines related to available fabrication facilities. General closed-form expressions are deduced to calculate design parameters. To verify analysis and design methodologies, {{a prototype of}} quad-band equal power divider is proposed. Compared to conventional quad-band power dividers using sections of transmission line transformers, the proposed power divider records a size reduction of about 20 % and reduced parasitic effects at higher frequencies according to the usage of only two resistors instead of four with much smaller ohmic values. In addition, a quad-band power divider is proposed, fabricated and measured for 3 G and 4 G applications at 2. 1, 2. 5, 3. 5, and 3. 8 GHz frequencies. Measured and simulated data are in very good agreement which validates the novel design. 1...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to design a maximally flat negative group delay (NGD) circuit based on microwave recursive filters. The proposed NGD circuit is realized by cascading N stages of <b>quarter-wavelength</b> stepped-impedance <b>transformer.</b> It is shown that the given circuit can be designed to have any prescribed group delay by changing the characteristic impedance of the quarter-wave transformers (QWTs) cascaded with each other. The proposed approach provides a systematic method to synthesize NGD of arbitrary amount without including any discrete lumped component. For various prescribed NGD, the characteristic impedance of QWT has been tabulated for two and three stages of the circuit. The widths and lengths of microstrip transmission lines {{can be obtained from}} characteristic impedance and the frequency of operation of the transmission line. The results are verified in both simulation and measurement, showing a good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to {{conformal}} capability, {{research on}} transmission lines has received much attention lately. Many {{studies have been}} reported in the last decade in which transmission lines have been analyzed extensively using various techniques. It is well known that transmission lines are used for transmission of information, but in this case the main aim is to deliver information from generator to receiver with low attenuation. To achieve this, the load should be matched to the characteristic impedance of the line, meaning that the wave coefficient should be near 1 (one). One of the most important methods for line matching is through <b>quarter-wavelength</b> line (quarter-wave <b>transformer).</b> Analysis of transmission lines using numerical methods is difficult because of any possible error that can occur. Therefore, the best solution in this case would be the use of any software package which is designed for analysis of transmission lines. In this paper we will use Sonet software which is generally used for the analysis of planar lines...|$|R
