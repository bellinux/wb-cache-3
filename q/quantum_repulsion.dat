40|$|By {{computing}} the Dirac operator spectrum {{by means}} of Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory, we aim at throwing {{some light on the}} widely accepted picture for the mechanism which is behind the Bank-Casher relation. The latter relates the chiral condensate to an accumulation of eigenvalues in {{the low end of the}} spectrum. This can be in turn ascribed to the usual mechanism of repulsion among eigenvalues which is typical of quantum interactions. First results appear to confirm that NSPT can indeed enable us to inspect a huge reshuffling of eigenvalues due to <b>quantum</b> <b>repulsion.</b> Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures; talk presented at the 27 th International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2009), Beijing, China, 26 - 31 Jul 200...|$|E
40|$|Observed active galactic nuclei at redshifts ≳ 6 {{suggest that}} supermassive black holes (SMBHs) had formed early on. Accretion of matter onto {{remnants}} of Population III stars leading to SMBHs {{is a very}} slow process, and therefore, such models encounter difficulties in explaining quasars detected at z ≳ 6. In this paper, we invoke collapse of dark bosonic halo matter, existing initially in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase, to lead to formation of SMBH. Making use of Gross-Pitaevskii equation and employing a Gaussian trial wavefunction, we determine the time dependence of its parameters and thereby, track the time evolution of the wavefunction. If the condensate, made up of identical dark bosons of mass m, collapses to form a black hole of mass M_eff {{as soon as the}} former's effective size shrinks below the corresponding Schwarzschild radius, a simple inequality m M_eff≳ 0. 64 m^ 2 _Pl can be derived, that ensues from a competition between attractive self-gravity and <b>quantum</b> <b>repulsion</b> arising due to uncertainty principle. We show that formation of SMBHs takes place on dynamical time scales ∼ 10 ^ 8 yrs. Existence of ultra-light (m ∼ 10 ^- 23 eV) dark bosons not only can lead to SMBHs of mass ∼ 10 ^ 12 M_ at z > 6 but also such particles can masquerade both as dark matter as well as dark energy. Discovery of aligned radio-jets in the ELAIS-N 1 GMRT deep field leads us to make simple estimates to demonstrate that vortices of a rotating BEC that collapse to form black holes can give rise to SMBHs with aligned spins on scales exceeding cluster size length scales, each with angular momentum J ≲ 3. 6 n_W G M^ 2 /c, where n_W and M are the winding number and mass of a vortex, respectively.

40|$|The {{continued}} down-scaling {{of electronic}} devices, {{in particular the}} commercially dominant MOSFET, will force {{a fundamental change in}} the process of new electronics technology development in the next five to ten years. The cost of developing new technology generations is soaring along with the price of new fabrication facilities, even as competitive pressure intensifies to bring this new technology to market faster than ever before. To reduce cost and time to market, device simulation must become a more fundamental, indeed dominant, part of the technology development cycle. In order to produce these benefits, simulation accuracy must improve markedly. At the same time, device physics will become more complex, with the rapid increase in various small-geometry and quantum effects. This work describes both an approach to device simulator development and a physical model which advance the effort to meet the tremendous electronic device simulation challenge described above. The device simulation approach is to specify the physical model at a high level to a general-purpose (but highly efficient) partial differential equation solver (in this case PROPHET, developed by Lucent Technologies), which then simulates the model in 1 -D, 2 -D, or 3 -D for a specified device and test regime. This approach allows for the rapid investigation {{of a wide range of}} device models and effects, which is certainly essential for device simulation to catch up with, and then stay ahead of, electronic device technology of the present and future. The physical device model used in this work is the density-gradient (DG) quantum correction to the drift-diffusion model [Ancona, Phys. Rev. B 35 (5), 7959 (1987) ]. This model adds tunneling and quantum smoothing of carrier density profiles to the drift-diffusion model. We used the DG model in 1 -D and 2 -D (for the first time) to simulate both bipolar and unipolar devices. Simulations of heavily-doped, short-base diodes indicated that the DG quantum corrections do not have a large effect on the IN characteristics of electronic devices without heteroj unction s. On the other hand, ultra-small MOSFETs certainly exhibit important quantum effects that the DG model will include: <b>quantum</b> <b>repulsion</b> of the inversion and gate charges from the oxide interfaces, and quantum tunneling through thin gate oxides. We present initial results of 2 -D DG simulations of ultra-small MOSFETs. Subtle but important issues involving the specification of the model, boundary conditions, and interface constraints for DG simulation of MOSFETs will also be illuminated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Theoretical {{results for}} {{spatially}} resolved exciton spectra of quantum wells with disorder are discussed. As {{a consequence of}} <b>quantum</b> mechanical level <b>repulsion,</b> the autocorrelation of the sharp peaks corresponding to individual quantum states yields information on their spatial extent. Level repulsion is present {{not only in the}} density of states but as well in absorption and even luminescence. More generally, the question under what conditions level repulsion can be observed in disordered systems with localized states is addressed...|$|R

Specifically, wc concentrate on a model cell which consists of five quantum dots occupied by two electrons. The mutual Coulombic <b>repulsion,</b> <b>quantum</b> confinement, and discrete nature of the electronic charge, lead to cell states which exhibit distinct charge alignments. Electrostatic coupling between neighboring cells is shown to result in bistable saturation of the cell polarization. Implications of this bistability for quantum cellular automata are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{developed}} model {{allows for}} simulations of electric field {{influence on the}} surface states. The results of slab simulations show considerable change of the energy of quantum states in the electric field, i. e. Stark Effect associated with the surface (SSSE - Surface States Stark Effect). Detailed studies of the GaN slabs demonstrate spatial variation of the conduction and valence band energy revealing real nature of SSSE phenomenon. It is shown that long range variation of the electric potential is {{in accordance with the}} change of the energy of the conduction and valence bands. However, at short distances from GaN(0001) surface, the valence band follows the potential change while the conduction states energy is increased due to <b>quantum</b> overlap <b>repulsion</b> by surface states. It is also shown that at clean GaN(0001) surface Fermi level is pinned at about 0. 34 eV below the long range projection of the conduction band bottom and varies with the field by about 0. 31 eV due to electron filling of the surface states.

40|$|Based on {{ab initio}} density {{functional}} theory, we have investigated a microscopic mechanism {{that leads to}} Fe$^{ 2 +}_{B}$/Fe$^{ 3 +}_{B}$ dimerization and consequent ferroelectricity in charge ordered Fe$_{ 3 }$O$_{ 4 }$ with $P 2 $ symmetry. In addition to the simple inter-site Coulomb <b>repulsion,</b> <b>quantum</b> hybridization effects are invoked to explain the Fe$^{ 2 +}_{B}$/Fe$^{ 3 +}_{B}$ bond dimerization. Our results, based on the generalized gradient approximation + Hubbard $U$ (GGA+$U$) method, indicate that noncentrosymmetric $P 2 $ magnetite shows a finite and sizeable ferroelectric polarization along the $b$ crystalline axis. From the $U$ dependence of polarization, we conclude that the origin of ferroelectricity in $P 2 $ Fe$_{ 3 }$O$_{ 4 }$ lies in the recently proposed "intermediate site/bond-centered charge ordering"...|$|R
40|$|The {{resonant}} Rayleigh scattering {{dynamics of}} excitons in single GaAs quantum wells is investigated. The deviation of the measured intensity from the ideal ensemble average is analyzed {{as a function}} of the speckle ensemble size. The influence of the amplitude and correlation length of the exciton disorder potential is traced using a series of samples with varying inhomogeneous broadening and interface island sizes. The experimental data are compared with theoretical predictions using exciton states of spatially uncorrelated energies, as well as full calculations of the exciton polarization dynamics using a more realistic disorder potential including the formation of monolayer islands. Deviations from the dynamics of uncorrelated states are found at early times after excitation. They are reproduced by the calculations possessing a state correlation due to <b>quantum</b> mechanical level <b>repulsion</b> and a finite correlation length for the disorder potential. Additionally, the presence of a long-range disorder potential in the micrometer range is suggested. Changing the disorder potential by varying the island size influences the observed dynamics systematically according to the different disorder correlation lengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{relaxation}} of electrons in quantum dots via phonon emission is hindered by the discrete {{nature of the}} dot levels (phonon bottleneck). In order to clarify the issue theoretically we consider a system of $N$ discrete fermionic states (dot levels) coupled to an unlimited number of bosonic modes with the same energy (dispersionless phonons). In analogy to the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure, we perform a unitary transformation into new bosonic modes. Since only $N(N+ 1) / 2 $ of them couple to the fermions, a numerically exact treatment is possible. The formalism is applied to a GaAs quantum dot with only two electronic levels. If close to resonance with the phonon energy, the electronic transition shows a splitting due to <b>quantum</b> mechanical level <b>repulsion.</b> This is driven mainly by one bosonic mode, whereas the other two provide further polaronic renormalizations. The numerically exact results for the electron spectral function compare favourably with an analytic solution based on degenerate perturbation theory in the basis of shifted oscillator states. In contrast, the widely used selfconsistent first-order Born approximation proves insufficient in describing the rich spectral features. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectral}} autocorrelation {{for a set}} of over 400 near-field photoluminescence {{spectra of}} a nar-row quantum well has been evaluated. It is compared with a microscopic model of an exciton in a disorder potential. The analysis provides strong evidence for <b>quantum</b> mechanical level <b>repulsion</b> and allows a quantitative estimate of the microscopic disorder features. The concept of participa-tion ratio is invoked to quantify the exciton center-of-mass localization lengths. These turn out to be broadly distributed and increase rapidly with energy. The connection between the spectral broadening of an exciton line in a quantum well (QW) and the presence of structural disorder has been known for two decades [1]. The center of mass (COM) of the exciton is subject to energy fluctuations originating from interface and alloy disorder present in the heterostructure. Consequently, exciton states are randomly localized with an inhomogeneous distribution of eigenenergies. Within certain approximations, the inhomogeneous exciton can be mapped onto the more gen-eral problem of a quantum mechanical particle in a disordered potential [2]. Despite this connection and the accurate existing experimental characterizations [3 – 5], however, the interpretation of experiments is mostly of qualitative and empirical nature, ofte...|$|R
40|$|We report {{real-time}} {{detection of}} the single charges that constitute a small electrical current, as they flow through a nano-electronic device. This represents a direct demonstration of charge discreteness in an electrical current. In a chain of small metallic islands connected by tunnel junctions (allowing electrons to pass by <b>quantum</b> tunnelling), Coulomb <b>repulsion</b> imposes a spatial correlation between single electrons which occupy different islands. When a current I flows through this chain, these electrons move in concert, and tunnel in a temporally correlated way at the average frequency f_e=I/e, where e is the electronic charge. We {{have been able to}} detect this time-correlated, single-electron tunnelling by combining such a chain with an ultrasensitive charge detector, a radio-frequency single-electron transistor (RF-SET). Two different ways of connecting the chain to the SET were investigated. We ultimately measured currents in the range 5 fA- 1 pA by counting the single electrons. We found that the line width of the spectral peak is nearly proportional to the frequency f_e of the oscillations, in good agreement between experimental data and numerical calculations. The tunnelling {{of the single}} electrons took place while the islands were in the superconducting state, but the inter-island Josephson coupling was low. Cooper pairs were also easily broken into quasiparticles as the magnetic field was relatively strong. Under these conditions, we have additionally observed a crossover to time-correlated, incoherent tunnelling of individual Cooper pairs as a function of decreased magnetic field and of current. Tunnelling dominated by Cooper pairs now produces a frequency f_ 2 e=I/ 2 e. We have found that the two types of tunnelling can coexist in an intermediate state, producing an average tunnelling frequency between f_e and f_ 2 e. In a similar way, we have also attempted to directly observe Bloch oscillations in a one-dimensional array of small Josephson junctions, that is, the coherent, time-correlated tunnelling of Cooper pairs. This fundamentally new way to measure small currents has the advantage of being self-calibrated, since the only parameter involved is the natural constant e. In an optimised device with higher current and better accuracy, we see a possibility to use our electron counter in metrological applications...|$|R
