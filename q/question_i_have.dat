2500|$|During much of 1820 the [...] "queen's business" [...] captivated the nation. [...] "It was {{the only}} <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever known," [...] wrote the radical critic William Hazlitt, [...] "that excited a {{thorough}} popular feeling. [...] It struck its roots {{into the heart of}} the nation; it took possession of every house or cottage in the kingdom." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972 he {{returned}} to Mussomeli from his banishment. The journalist Giampaolo Pansa [...] visited the old boss that year and described the decline in an article entitled The sunset of the mafia (in Italian: Il tramonto del mafioso) in which he depicted the old boss in rather squalid and degenerating circumstances {{after the death of}} his wife Rosalia. He did not answer the many questions and denied the existence of the Mafia: [...] "Mafia? Mafia in Sicily? Out of the <b>question!</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no knowledge, I do not know what to tell you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In cricket {{to throw}} the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no ball, but until 1960 it was {{undefined}} and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence. To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball [...] increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a [...] "chucker" [...] could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright straight arm was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said [...] "It is the most complex <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> known in cricket, because it {{is not a matter of}} fact, but a matter of opinion and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views".|$|E

6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better!" [...] she declared. [...] "Let {{me tell you}} this at once. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not come here to answer <b>questions.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to ask them. Are you content?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As to the radula of this species, it is a {{very small}} and rather obscure object, and only by teasing it to pieces, I could get an idea of the shape of the teeth. The uncini quite cover the median rows, and cross even the uncini of the {{opposite}} side. The rhachidian or median tooth has a subquadrate basal part, with rounded, convex posterior and less convex lateral margins. It has a broad, triangular cusp, with one small median denticle and about 6 smaller ones on each side. The laterals one on each side, have a transversely triangular shape, with an unarmed, arched upper and concave proximal and basal margin, with blunt points at the proximal and distal extremities of the basal margin. On each side I see at least 3, but I suppose there are 4 uncini which are long, slender and strongly curved. Though this radula has some resemblance with that of Aporrhais, like Verrill (Mollusca of the New England coast. Transact. Connecticut Acad, of arts and sciences, Vol. VI, May 1884, p. 1S6 and 188) has stated, and like his figure (I.e. pi. 31, fig. 14b) affirms, I cannot agree without doubt with his view that it should be taenioglossate, as the [...] "Siboga"-specimen has a radula with at least 9 rows of teeth and probably 11. The nacreous character of the shell agrees with the Rhipidoglossa, and so does the larger number of uncini. I should think the genus will belong to the Rhipidoglossa with a restricted number of teeth, such as Basilissa. As however only a knowledge of other anatomical particulars, the position and structure of the gills, of the heart etc. can decide the <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left the family near Trichotropis in accordance with the newest systematic arrangement of Paul Pelseneer (A treatise on Zoology, edited by Ray Lankester, Part V, Mollusca, 1906, p.156) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I simply {{mean that}} even {{you could hardly}} have asked Miss Effingham such a <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> asked her, and she has refused me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must ask}} Leadham and Loiter that <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done {{my part of}} the work. I suppose you never wrote a novel, Mr Alf?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{he is not}} suspected?" [...] I asked. This was {{the same}} <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put to Mrs. Manners. It caused the captain to flare up again.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] I {{said in his}} ear, [...] "no. Whatever {{comes of}} it, not another <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> far rather go to prison than let her suffer this inexpressible torture for a single minute longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|For my own part, I was bewildered. All the <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not asked}} before came {{crowding}} {{to my mind}} how. Whose child was this? Whence had he come? What was the meaning of it all? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the church}} in <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen; and it was erected before the war of the revolution. It was an English rather than an American church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{would think}} the fellow lived next door," [...] Ricardo growled impatiently. [...] "Hang it all, can't you {{understand}} a plain <b>question?</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> asked you the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, child, don't talk nonsense. Whether he is {{rich or poor}} is a mere {{matter of}} moonshine. The <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to settle just now is--Are you fond of him?" ...|$|E
60|$|I retired early {{so as to}} be on {{hand the}} next day. Sleep was out of the <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never been a hundred miles away from Darbyville, and the {{prospect}} of leaving filled me with excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. It {{does not}} signify what I know or what I don't. Those {{preliminary}} <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been obliged to ask as my justification {{for coming to}} you on the present occasion. Mr. Kennedy <b>has</b> <b>I</b> believe been greatly wronged." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John," [...] she said, [...] "I {{can spare}} you that <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been about as foolish and selfish {{as a girl}} could be. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done the most compromising things, and behaved in the most ridiculous way. But from the rest--you saved me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, [...] "what am I to {{understand}} by that remark? If any man calls my honor in <b>question,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> but one answer for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sam's {{account of}} the matter,' replied Perker, 'is, I will venture to say, a {{perfectly}} correct one. Well now, my dear Sir, the first <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to ask, is, whether this woman is to remain here?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} in to-morrow," [...] Laverick promised. [...] "This {{afternoon}} it is quite out of the <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{a crowd of people}} waiting to see me, and several important engagements for which I am late already." ...|$|E
60|$|The hundred <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{longed to}} ask were forgotten. A peace stole upon me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not felt since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> looked upon his face before. The wine was brought by Mr. Claude, and opened, {{and it was}} mine host who broke the silence, and the spell.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so {{wilfully}} stupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid my <b>questions.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the discretion to ask no more.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bruff {{proved to}} be too busy to give me {{more than a minute}} of his {{valuable}} time. In that minute, however, he contrived to dispose--in the most discouraging manner--of all the <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to put to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "There can be but one policy {{when the}} {{protection}} of the lives of our citizens is in <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never before felt impatience to shorten the life of man, but in this trial I can scarce brook delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "I {{preferred}} {{to keep up}} my reputation as an eccentric person. At any rate, you must remember that it was open to me at any moment to ask you the <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> asked you now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, sir," [...] I replied, [...] "that, as the {{chairman}} has told you, the whole of my public record is an answer to your <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> often expressed my views upon this matter; I {{see no reason to}} change them." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{anxiety was}} an answer, a {{sufficient}} answer, to the <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> put to him. An answer containing all {{the difficulty of}} that situation. I closed the port-hole quietly, to make sure. A louder word might have been overheard.|$|R
60|$|We were strolling in the garden, {{when some}} demon urged Ukridge, apropos of the professor's mention of Dublin, to start upon the Irish <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been expecting it momentarily, {{but my heart}} seemed to stand still when it {{actually}} arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not all}} {{arranged}} by any means, and the Duke does know it. Now, mamma, after that I must decline to answer any more <b>questions.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done this all myself, and I mean to continue {{it in the same}} way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is quite}} another <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said nothing about that either to you or to anybody else. The truth is, squire, I have never {{interfered}} in this matter {{one way or the}} other; and I have no wish to do so now." ...|$|E
60|$|And I may {{answer with}} another question. Why is a two-headed calf? And my own {{answer to this}} {{is that it is a}} freak. And so I answer your <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> this other-personality and these {{complete}} racial memories because I am a freak.|$|E
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Speaking {{with great}} firmness.] Arthur, I am very sorry, {{but the thing}} is quite out of the <b>question.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to think of Mabel’s future {{happiness}}.

60|$|That {{finished}} Shaphambury. The <b>question</b> <b>I</b> now <b>had</b> {{to debate}} was {{which of the}} remaining couples <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to pursue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! my lady,' said poor Mistress Pauncefort, looking bewildered, 'only {{to think}} of such a thing! and after all the pains <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken! <b>I</b> am sure <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not opened my lips on the subject these fifteen years; and the many <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been asked too!

5000|$|... "When we {{did talk}} about <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>had,</b> he {{essentially}} challenged me and my arguments," [...] Khalid writes. [...] "When <b>I</b> didn’t <b>have</b> any answers for him, that is when I really began to analyze my actions and thinking. He provided me with material that argued against the legality of terrorism." ...|$|R
