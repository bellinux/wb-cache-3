40|$|The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{released}} new fluid guidelines following data suggesting 20 % {{of patients}} receiving fluids suffer adversely (2013). This <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>group</b> assessed fluid prescribing in a tertiary teaching centre and {{introduced a new}} fluid-prescribing chart to align practice with NICE recommendations. Notes and corresponding fluid prescription charts were reviewed for evidence of (1) indication, (2) co-morbidities, and (3) further management as surrogate markers of safe prescribing in accordance with NICE. Overall, the data showed practice fell short and prompted a redesign of the Trust fluid prescription chart. Three different variations of the chart were issued consecutively using a PDSA method (plan, do, study, act) over a 6 -month period. They all included indication, co-morbidities and further management plans as constant design features. Suggestions from interested parties were incorporated and an educational programme was implemented to promote awareness. Prior to our intervention, an indication for fluids was documented in 26 % of notes, it took an average of 4. 6 minutes to find co-morbidities, and further management plans were rarely documented. Following the new prescription chart, an indication was recorded in 72 % of cases, co-morbidities noted on 63 % of charts with 93. 1 % accuracy, and further management documented in 100 % of cases. The new fluid prescription chart encourages prescribers to incorporate NICE recommendations when prescribing fluids. The new fluid prescription design has since been rolled out Trust wide.

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} quality improvement program and goal-oriented, multidisciplinary protocols on mortality after cardiac surgery. MethodsPatients were divided into two groups: those undergoing surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting, isolated valve surgery, or coronary artery bypass grafting and valve surgery) after establishment of the multidisciplinary quality improvement program (January 2005 –December 2006, n = 922) and those undergoing surgery before institution of the program (January 2002 –December 2003, n = 1289). Logistic regression and propensity score analysis were used to adjust for imbalances in patients' preoperative characteristics. ResultsOperative mortality was lower in the <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>group</b> (2. 6 % vs 5. 0 %, P <. 01). Unadjusted odds ratio was 0. 5 (95 % confidence interval 0. 3 – 0. 8, P <. 01); propensity score–adjusted odds ratio was 0. 6 (95 % confidence interval 0. 4 – 0. 99, P =. 04). In multivariable analysis, diabetes (P <. 01), chronic renal insufficiency (P =. 05), previous cardiovascular operation (P =. 04), congestive heart failure (P <. 01), unstable angina (P <. 01), age older than 75 years (P <. 01), prolonged pump time (P <. 01), and prolonged operation (P =. 05) emerged as independent predictors of higher mortality after cardiac surgery, whereas quality improvement program (P <. 01) and male sex (P =. 03) were associated with lower mortality.

40|$|Cet article traite des rapports entre le partenariat et la démocratie au travail. Sur la base d’une {{recherche}} longitudinale effectuée dans six usines de pâtes et papiers au Québec, nous dressons d’abord un portrait des innovations organisationnelles et de la participation syndicale à la gestion. Nous en dégageons différents cas de figure, incarnant la participation et la démocratie à des degrés très variables. La prise en compte de la dynamique des relations entre acteurs sociaux nous permet ensuite de construire une trajectoire de la participation syndicale à la gestion et de mettre en évidence deux configurations opposées au sein du partenariat, se distinguant selon le caractère de la démocratie salariale et l’évolution du pouvoir syndical. This article {{draws on}} the results of a qualitative, longitudinal study of six pulp and paper plants in Quebec conducted between 1992 and 1998 to analyse the relationship between labour-management partnerships and workplace democracy. Our central hypothesis is that participation and democracy are the key issues involved in labour-management partnerships and that the outcome of partnership depends on both the local circumstances and the dynamics of the relationships between the actors in the firm. Partnership can therefore exist with or without democracy. In the context of the same technical-productive paradigm, the social form through which organizational participation is implemented in <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>groups</b> and in work teams varies according to workers’ power. The plants that we studied can thus be divided into two groups in terms of organizational participation : at one extreme lies a cluster of plants where participation occurs without power, whereas at the other extreme lie those plants where participation with power represents a form of direct democracy. On the one hand, “consultative” <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>groups</b> (i. e., participation without power) that operate {{in the context of a}} centralized and hierarchical organizational setting go hand-in-hand with “elementary” work teams (i. e., those that are primarily based on cooperation and mutual assistance and which reproduce the previous hierarchical structure). On the other hand, “substantive” <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>groups</b> (i. e., participation with power) operating in a parity-based coordinating structure are found in those plants with work teams, thus giving workers more autonomous responsibilities. The form of union participation in management also varied among the plants studied. We observed a shift of union action at the strategic level and on local tactical issues as regards the introduction of organizational innovations and technological changes. However, this increase in participation did not necessarily bring about workplace democracy or an increase in union power. In fact, this is only one of the orientations that can be chosen by local unions that get involved in union participation in management. Union participation fosters a number of tensions around the legitimacy of the new union role and also some dissatisfaction among workers, particularly over the issues of work intensification and the day-to-day problems that occur in the wake of organizational innovations. Depending on the way in which these tensions are resolved and worker dissatisfaction is dealt with, three possible patterns emerge: (1) the union terminates its participation and opposes organizational innovations because of the seriousness of the tensions and dissatisfactions generated by its participation and by the innovations; (2) the union continues to participate on an instrumental basis, legitimized solely by the protection of jobs; or (3) the union helps to redefine participation by taking into account workers’ concerns, thereby initiating a process of workplace democratization. Unlike the second pattern, the third initiates a process through which the union is strengthened. However, this pattern is only possible if the local union is characterized by a number of features, such as enjoying access to significant external and internal resources as well as the existence of a lively climate of internal democracy. Lastly, by combining the changes in union power with worker participation in work organization and union participation in management, it is possible to construct two contrasting patterns. In the worker democracy pattern, we observe the simultaneous presence of democratic participation in management, organizational participation with power, and a strengthening of the union. On the other hand, the pseudo-democracy pattern is characterized by instrumental participation, organizational participation without power, and a weakening of the union. The dimensions that make up a pattern are closely interrelated and mutually consistent. In the case of worker democracy, union participation in management has a democratic nature, which makes it possible for the union leaders to take better account of the day-to-day problems (work overload, favouritism, pressures, etc.) that workers encounter in the context of innovations and to make sure that organizational decisions respond to these problems. In so doing, they help to redefine organizational-level participative mechanisms to give more power to workers so that they can make the mechanisms work to their advantage. In this process, the local union makes itself stronger by heightening its legitimacy. The dynamics of the pseudo-democracy pattern are entirely different. Union leaders, concerned with protecting jobs, consider that day-to-day problems are the price to be paid for saving jobs. Their involvement in joint management bodies is focused on the single question of jobs and they leave aside the area of organizational innovations and the participative mechanisms at the organizational level. These innovations and mechanisms are therefore usually introduced unilaterally by management and give little power to workers. Workers do not have the backing of the union to redefine these innovations and mechanisms by strengthening the degree of autonomy and democracy. Further, the inability of the union leaders to respond to their members’ demands contributes to a delegitimization of the union torn by deep tensions and divisions. To summarize, we reject the overly uniform and harmonious conceptions of labour-management partnerships and of “high-performance work systems” in which all possible “best practices” come together in a virtuous circle, a vision that ignores tensions, paradoxes and contradictions. Partnership, by its very name, clearly signifies that the participation and involvement of all of the partners is a requirement of the production system, but it does not imply what the actual pattern of participation and involvement will be. Depending on the circumstances and the strategies of the social actors, different and conflicting orientations are possible and have in fact been observed.

Few ACS <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> interventions have been rigorously evaluated to determine their impact on patient care and clinical outcomes. We designed a pragmatic, 2 -arm, cluster-randomized trial involving 34 clusters (Brazilian public hospitals). Clusters were randomized to receive a multifaceted <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> intervention (experimental <b>group)</b> or routine practice (control group). the 6 -month educational intervention included reminders, care algorithms, a case manager, and distribution of educational materials to health care providers. the primary end point was a composite of evidence-based post-ACS therapies within 24 hours of admission, with the secondary measure of major cardiovascular clinical events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal cardiac arrest, and nonfatal stroke). Prescription of evidence-based therapies at hospital discharge were also evaluated as part of the secondary outcomes. All analyses were performed by the intention-to-treat principle and took the cluster design into account using individual-level regression modeling (generalized estimating equations).

Objective: To {{assess the impact of}} an educational intervention on involvement of clinical department staff in the quality process. Setting: Twelve voluntary clinical departments (six experimental and six controls) in a French 2000 -bed university hospital comprising 40 clinical departments. Intervention: Three day training seminar to a group of 12 – 20 staff members from each department. Design: Quasi-experimental post-test only design study with control group conducted 12 months after the intervention with a questionnaire completed in a face-to-face interview. Subjects: 98 trained staff and 100 untrained staff from the six experimental departments and 100 staff from the six control departments. Principal measurements: Declared knowledge of the CQI methods and participation in quality management activities. Results: 286 people (96 %) were involved in the study. More of the trained staff knew the CQI methods (62. 4 %) than staff in the control departments (16. 5 %) (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 10. 6 (95 % CI 4. 97 to 22. 62)).

40|$|Introduction : There is a {{substantial}} and growing investment in <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> in healthcare internationally. In the UK context, this trend is evident in a succession of recent policy initiatives. The authors assess progress in <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> in the UK NHS after 10 years of mandated <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> activities and several waves of reform. The effectiveness of existing systems for <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> is explored {{in the context of}} the most recent round of mandated reforms. Four dimensions of effectiveness are considered: existence of direction at an organisational level, frequency of reporting arrangements to the organisation's board, extent of coverage across the organisation, and perceived effectiveness at bringing about change. Methods : A self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to all NHS trusts in the West Midlands and South West regions. Results : Notwithstanding considerable investment, existing systems for <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> are highly variable within and between trusts in both their coverage and perceived effectiveness. Discussion : UK NHS trusts exhibit wide variation in the robustness of their <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> activities, yet they share a common policy context.

40|$|Context: This {{study was}} part of the Methods of Assessing Response to <b>Quality</b> <b>Improvement</b> Strategies (MARQuIS) {{research}} project on patients crossing borders, a study to investigate <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies in healthcare systems across the European Union (EU). Aim: To explore the association between the implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies in hospitals and hospitals' success in meeting defined quality requirements that are considered intermediate outputs of the care process. Methods: Data regarding the implementation of seven <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies (accreditation, organisational quality management programmes, audit and internal assessment of clinical standards, patient safety systems, clinical practice guidelines, performance indicators and systems for obtaining patients' views) and four dimensions of outputs (clinical, safety, patient-centredness and cross-border patient-centredness) were collected from 389 acute care hospitals in eight EU countries using a web-based questionnaire. In a second phase, 89 of these hospitals participated in an on-site audit by independent surveyors. Pearson correlation and linear regression models were used to explore associations and relations between <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies and achievement of outputs. Results: Positive associations were found between six internal <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies and hospital outputs. The <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies could be reasonably subsumed under one latent index which explained about half of their variation. The analysis of outputs concluded that the outputs can also be considered part of a single construct. The findings indicate that the implementation of internal as well as external <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies in hospitals has beneficial effects on the hospital outputs studied here. Conclusion: The implementation of internal <b>quality</b> <b>improvement</b> strategies as well as external assessment systems should be promote...|$|R
