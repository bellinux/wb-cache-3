It represents a whole community of stakeholders, employees and customers. In this paper, we will examine the relations inside the corporations, we will also define the term: corporate governance and we will give the synthesis of Board directors and CEO councils around the world. A logical <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>is,</b> if the leader of a corporation has to cooperate or it makes more sense if he takes all the decisions by himself. Is today's corporate leaders a kind of heroes and in which cases? The idea of control and individualism is not a new idea but under certain factors it means responsibility, business ability and capacity to any change. Organizational change and ability to control or to guide people and corporations is a unique strategic advantage and make the difference to all kinds of leadership...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a comparison of}} the old Planning and Building act (PBA) from 1987 with the new PBA, which entered into force in May 2011. The essay consists of a descriptive part that presents the regulation of both laws. The new PBA consists of several differences compared to previous regulation. This thesis will, however, primarily be centred around the regulation regarding building permit appeals and the possibility of building permit, to gain legal force. In the old PBL, there were no regulations that result in a building permit decision could be made effective. Instead, a building permit could, long after the decision had been made, be over-challenged. This could, in extreme cases, lead to the new building had to be demolished and the rules on appeals of building permits was therefore not safe. To eliminate the problem of appealing far after the decision was made the new PBA introduced rules which made it possible for building permits to gain legal force. The Act aims is to simplify and make the planning application process more effective. By introducing a ruling which means that a building permits can gain legal force, the aims was regarded as fulfilled. The <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>is</b> whether the new rules are complete and what the consequences of the new rulings are. As mentioned above the rules, which make it possible for a decision to gain legal force, is to simplify and make the building permit process more effective but also to protect the building permit decisions to be appealed afterwards. To simplify and make the rules more effective is something positive. However, there are also some disadvantages. The municipality's costs will be higher by the increased demands on information to interested parties. The legislators believed that there was a need for a rule that allowed a building permit decision to be gain legal force. However, this rule is not considered to be complete. It may still be situations where an appeal against a planning permission decision can be handed in after a long time. This can occur when the local authority (through building committee) make an incorrect judgement, which means that the notification is not done to the people who really {{have a right to be}} heard...|$|E
40|$|Among steel-making {{techniques}} Powder Metallurgy (PM) concept utilizes unique production cycle, {{consisting of}} powder compaction and sintering steps that give high productivity with {{low energy consumption}} and high material utilization. Due {{to the presence of}} residual porosity, mechanical properties of PM components are inferior in comparison with structural components produced by other technologies. Improvement of mechanical properties at the same level of porosity can be achieved primarily by adding variety of alloying elements. Therefore modern PM technology for production of high-performance PM parts for highly stressed steel components for automotive industry, for example, rely on techniques of utilization of different alloying elements additionally to adjustment of technological process depending on alloying system used. When talking about high-strength low-alloyed structural steels, the most common alloying elements, additionally to carbon, added in order to increase mechanical performance, are chromium, manganese, silicon and some other strong carbide and carbonitride-forming elements (V, Nb, Ti etc.). In comparison with classical steelmaking practice, alloying of PM steels is much more complicated as additionally to influence of alloying elements type and content on microstructure, mechanical properties, hardenability etc., number of additional aspects influencing powder production and further component processing has to be considered. Traditionally, PM high-strength steels are alloyed with Cu, Ni, and Mo. This results in a considerable difference in price of material between conventional and PM steels, used for the same high-load application, as the price of currently employed PM alloying elements like Mo and Ni is dozens of times higher in comparison with that of Cr or Mn. This situation creates a strong economical stimulation to introduce cheaper and more efficient alloying elements to improve the competitiveness of PM structural parts. So, why the potential of most common for conventional metallurgy alloying elements as Cr, Mn and Si is not utilized in PM? First and basic <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arise</b> <b>is</b> how to introduce these elements in PM – as admixed elemental powder (or master-alloy) or by prealloying of the base steel powder. Chromium prealloyed steels are already successful introduced on the PM market. However due to peculiar properties of manganese (oxygen affinity, high vapour pressure, ferrite strengthening etc.) attempts to develop Mn sintered steels are still ongoing. Issue of appropriate alloying mode, that is the starting point of manganese introduction in PM, is the basic question that has to be answered at the beginning and is the basic topic of this chapter. The easiest way to introduce manganese is by admixing of ferromanganese powder that is cheap and widely available on the market in different grades. This approach was firstly proposes around 30 years ago and have been scrutinized thoroughly from different perspectives (Šalak, 1980; Cias et al., 1999; Šalak et al., 2001; Dudrova et al., 2004; Danninger et al., 2005; Cias&Wronski, 2008, Hryha, 2007). The first thing that has to be considered when dealing with admixed with manganese systems is high affinity of manganese to oxygen, implying possibility of considerable oxidation during component processing due to high activity of manganese in admixed elemental powder. However, the possibility of sintering of admixed with manganese powders was assumed due to so-called ‘‘self-cleaning’’ effect, discovered by Šalak (Šalak, 1980). This effect utilizes unique property of manganese to sublimate at relatively low temperature and created during heating stage manganese vapour protect specimen from further oxidation. Another advantage of admixed manganese systems is manganese homogenization in Fe–Mn powder compacts involving Mn-gaseous phase during the heating stage. Second assumption deals with alloying by different master-alloys that firstly allowed a successful introduction of high oxygen affinity elements in PM industrial production (Zapf et al., 1975; Schlieper & Thummler, 1979; Hoffmann & Dalal, 1979). First developed master-alloys containing manganese–chromium–molybdenum (MCM) and manganese–vanadium–molybdenum (MVM) had a wide range of mechanical properties depending on alloying content, sintered density and processing conditions. Nevertheless, these master-alloys faced with many problems during application (oxides formation during manufacturing process, high hardness of the particles that lead to intensive wear of compacting tools etc.) and fully disappears from manufacturing and research areas. Recent development of Fe–Cr–Mn–Mo–C master-alloys was much more successful and show promising properties for their future industrial utilization (Beiss, 2006; Sainz et al., 2006). High affinity of manganese for oxygen and Mn loss by sublimation can be minimized by lowering the manganese activity than can be done by Mn introduction in pre-alloyed state. However powder alloying by manganese faces some difficulties starting from powder production, handling and following compaction and sintering steps. This is connected with manganese selective oxidation on the powder surface during atomization and further annealing depending on processing conditions during powder production(Hryha et al., 2009 -b; Hryha et al., 2010 -a). A further negative impact of manganese utilization in pre-alloyed state is the expected lower compressibility of such pre-alloyed powders due to ferrite solid solution strengthening by manganese. This chapter is focused on the influence of alloying mode, utilizing premix systems with different ferromanganese grades and high-purity electrolytic manganese as well as fully prealloying of water atomized powder. While respecting all the benefits and problems with sintered steels alloyed with manganese some basic directions have been chosen — theoretical evaluations of required sintering atmosphere composition for preventing of manganese alloyed steels from oxidation during every stage of sintering, analyzes of sintering cycle coupling with simultaneous atmosphere monitoring and further analysis of sintered specimens using number of advanced spectroscopy and thermoanalytic techniques. Various phenomena, connected with manganese evaporation and reduction/oxidation behaviour of manganese alloyed sintered steels were theoretically evaluated and tested experimentally applying interrupted sintering experiments, when specimens where sampled at different stages of the sintering cycle for extensive study by HR SEM+EDX, XPS, TG+MS etc. Thermodynamic calculations enabled to determine a required sintering atmosphere composition (maximal permitted partial pressures of active gases CO/CO 2 /H 2 O) for preventing of Mn alloyed steels prepared by different alloying mode from oxidation during every stage of sintering. The results were verified by continual monitoring of CO/CO 2 /H 2 O profiles in sintering atmosphere and further analysis of sintered specimens...|$|E

The <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> <b>is</b> “what are the factors that influence the decision of a farmer to use pesticide”? Another major concern aside the use of pesticide is the frequency of pesticide application. The Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) recommends that for effective and sustainable control of pests and diseases, cocoa farmers need to apply pesticides on their cocoa farms four times per season (Adu-Acheampong et al. 2007). This notwithstanding, farmers do not apply pesticide on their cocoa farms at the recommended frequency. The <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>arises</b> <b>is</b> “what are the factors that influence frequency of application”? Knowing the factors that influence pesticide use and frequency of application would enable stakeholders such as Ghana COCOBOD and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA), to identify the specific issues (socio-economic characteristics) that influences cocoa farmer’s pesticide use and frequency of application in order to put up policies (such as Cocoa Disease and Pest Control (CODAPEC) programme and IPM Farmer Field Schools) that would reduce or increase pesticide use and frequency of application if necessary. In view of this, it is imperative to assess the factors that influence cocoa farmers’ decision to use pesticide and frequency of pesticide application.|$|R
