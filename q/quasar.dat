5|$|APM 08279+5255 {{is a very}} distant, broad {{absorption}} line <b>quasar</b> discovered in 1998 and initially considered the most luminous object yet found. It is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing effect of a foreground galaxy through which its light passes. It {{appears to be a}} giant elliptical galaxy with a supermassive black hole around 23 billion times as massive as the Sun and an associated accretion disk that has a diameter of 3600 light years. The galaxy possesses large regions of hot dust and molecular gas, as well as regions with starburst activity. It has a cosmological redshift of 3.911. While observing the <b>quasar</b> in 2008, astronomers using ESA's XMM Newton and the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) in Arizona discovered the huge galaxy cluster 2XMM J083026+524133.|$|E

40|$|At z approx. equals 3, {{the x-ray}} spectra of radio-loud and radio-quiet <b>quasars</b> are different. High-redshift radio-quiet <b>quasars</b> either have large {{absorbing}} columns, N(sub H), and steeper power law spectral indices, alpha(sub epsilon), than low redshift <b>quasars,</b> or no absorption and similar alpha(sub epsilon) 's. In contrast, the radio-loud <b>quasars</b> at high redshift have substantial absorption and similar alpha(sub epsilon) 's to low redshift <b>quasars.</b> Implications for {{the interpretation of}} the evolution of the luminosity function of <b>quasars</b> are discussed. If the absorption arises outside the central engine for both radio-loud and radio-quiet <b>quasars,</b> then radio-quiet <b>quasars</b> differ from the radio-loud <b>quasars</b> in that their emitted power law spectrum has evolved with redshift.

40|$|<b>Quasars</b> have reigned as {{the most}} {{luminous}} and distant objects in the Universe. These concepts {{were based on the}} hypothesis that the redshifts of <b>quasars</b> are obeying the Hubble low. This hypothesis has little serious competition today, but has met some difficulties when using it to determine the distances of <b>quasars.</b> However, the majority of the redshifts of <b>quasars</b> {{can be explained by the}} soft photon process proposed by Zheng (2013), then <b>quasars</b> are not located at the distances as that calculated from observed redshifts according to the Hubble low.

5|$|Within the constellation's borders lie NGC 2419, {{an unusually}} remote {{globular}} cluster; the galaxy NGC 2770, which has hosted three recent Type Ib supernovae; the distant <b>quasar</b> APM 08279+5255, whose light is magnified and split into multiple images by the gravitational lensing {{effect of a}} foreground galaxy; and the Lynx Supercluster, which was the most distant supercluster known {{at the time of}} its discovery in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and <b>quasar</b> distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E

40|$|We compare {{covering}} {{factors of}} circumnuclear dusty obscurers in radio-loud and radio-quiet <b>quasars.</b> The radio-loud <b>quasars</b> {{are represented by}} a sample of FR II <b>quasars</b> obtained by cross-matching a catalog of the FR II radio sources selected by van Velzen et al. with the SDSS DR 7 catalog of <b>quasars.</b> Covering factors of FR II <b>quasars</b> are compared with covering factors of the radio-quiet <b>quasars</b> matched with them in redshift, black hole mass, and Eddington-ratio.

40|$|Red <b>quasars</b> {{are thought}} to be an {{intermediate}} population between merger-driven star-forming galaxies in dust-enshrouded phase and normal <b>quasars.</b> If so, they are expected to have high accretion ratios, but their intrinsic dust extinction hampers reliable determination of Eddington ratios. Here, we compare the accretion rates of 16 red <b>quasars</b> at z ∼ 0. 7 to those of normal type 1 <b>quasars</b> at the same redshift range. The red <b>quasars</b> are selected by their red colors in optical through near-infrared (NIR) and radio detection. The accretion rates of the red <b>quasars</b> are derived from the Pβ line in NIR spectra, which is obtained by the SpeX on the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) {{in order to avoid the}} effects of dust extinction. We find that the measured Eddington ratios (L_ bol/L_ Edd≃ 0. 69) of red <b>quasars</b> are significantly higher than those of normal type 1 <b>quasars,</b> which is consistent with a scenario in which red <b>quasars</b> are the intermediate population and the black holes of red <b>quasars</b> grow very rapidly during such a stage.

5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the <b>quasar</b> pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it does have a true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, NASA and STScI convened four panels to discuss key {{projects}}. These were projects that were both scientifically important and would require significant telescope time, {{which would be}} explicitly dedicated to each project. This guaranteed that these particular projects would be completed early, in case the telescope failed sooner than expected. The panels identified three such projects: 1) {{a study of the}} nearby intergalactic medium using <b>quasar</b> absorption lines to determine the properties of the intergalactic medium and the gaseous content of galaxies and groups of galaxies; 2) a medium deep survey using the Wide Field Camera to take data whenever one of the other instruments was being used and 3) a project to determine the Hubble constant within ten percent by reducing the errors, both external and internal, in the calibration of the distance scale.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to M33, {{there are several}} NGC galaxies of visual magnitudes 12 to 14. The largest of these include the 10 arcminute long magnitude 12 NGC 925 spiral galaxy and the 5 arcminute long magnitude 11.6 NGC 672 barred spiral galaxy. The latter is close by {{and appears to be}} interacting with IC 1727. The two are 88,000 light-years apart and lie around 18 million light-years away. These two plus another four nearby dwarf irregular galaxies constitute the NGC 672 group, and all six appear to have had a burst of star formation in the last ten million years. The group is thought connected to another group of six galaxies known as the NGC 784 group, named for its principal galaxy, the barred spiral NGC 784. Together with two isolated dwarf galaxies, these fourteen appear to be moving in a common direction and constitute a group possibly located on a dark matter filament. 3C 48 was the first <b>quasar</b> ever to be observed, although its true identity was not uncovered until after that of 3C 273 in 1963. It has an apparent magnitude of 16.2 and is located about 5 degrees northwest of Alpha Trianguli.|$|E

40|$|Using {{the radio}} {{observations}} by FIRST and NVSS, we build {{a sample of}} 151 radio variable <b>quasars</b> selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 3 (SDSS DR 3). Six (probably another two) among them are classified as broad absorption line (BAL) <b>quasars,</b> with radio flux variations of a few 10 percent within 1. 5 - 5 years. Such large amplitudes of the variations imply brightness temperatures {{much higher than the}} inverse Compton limits (10 ^ 12 K) in all the BAL <b>quasars,</b> suggesting the presence of relativistic jets beaming toward the observer.

40|$|We present VLBI (EVN+MERLIN) {{observations}} {{of a sample}} of three low-redshift radio-intermediate PG <b>quasars</b> (RIQ) with flat and variable radio spectrum (III Zw 2, PG 1309 + 355, PG 2209 + 184). Their radio-to-optical flux ratio (R) is slightly lower than the average R for steep-spectrum <b>quasars,</b> but their radio spectral properties are those of core-dominated <b>quasars.</b> It was proposed previously that these sources might be relativistically boosted jets in radio-weak <b>quasars.</b> Our VLBI observations now indeed confirm {{the presence of a}} high brightness temperature core in all three of these objects — two of them have lower limits on TB well in excess of 10 10 Kelvin. Moreover, we find no “missing-flux ” which means that basically all the flux of these <b>quasars</b> is concentrated in the compact radio core. As the total radio flux is already at the low end for radio-loud <b>quasars,</b> we can place a strong limit on the presence of any extended emission. This limit is consistent with the extended emission in radio-weak <b>quasars,</b> but excludes that the flat-spectrum RIQ reside in typical radio-loud <b>quasars.</b> The observations therefore strongly support the idea that relativistic jets are present in radio-weak <b>quasars</b> and hence that radio-loud and radio-weak <b>quasars</b> have very similar central engines...|$|R
