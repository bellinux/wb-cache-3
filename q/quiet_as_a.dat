He {{preferred}} not {{to draw attention to}} himself, and was described by sportswriter Jim Murray as [...] "polite as a deacon, as <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> monk." [...] Both as a player and as a coach, he was studious, serious, and orderly; [...] "He was too straight and narrow—but a great guy, a hell of a guy," [...] former Colts teammate Art Donovan said of Berry. [...] "He was a little peculiar, to say the least." ...|$|E

In an album review for F.A.M.E., Mark Edward Nero of About.com wrote that [...] "Deuces" [...] was one of [...] "the album's best material". A reviewer for Girlfriend magazine wrote that [...] "Deuces" [...] along with [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] and [...] "Beautiful People", were the only tracks on the album [...] "worth listening to". Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press labeled [...] "Deuces" [...] as one of the [...] "best songs" [...] of 2010, while August Brown of Los Angeles Times called it his [...] "favorite single" [...] of 2010. According to Steve Jones of USA Today, the song shows that [...] "Brown is taking it to the next phase". Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post characterised [...] "Deuces" [...] as [...] "the effervescent kiss-off" [...] track. Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer was critical of the song, writing that it [...] "sounds minimally produced and <b>quiet.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, it sounds kind of boring".|$|E

500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction of}} the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2–3, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac {{that could have been}} a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them {{for the rest of the}} year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned [...] "rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac." [...] He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, [...] "Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sucking dove." [...] Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, criticized Lee's actions in the campaign and on August 8, he offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 author stated, [...] "In many {{newspapers}} of the 1890s, I {{found no}} generalizations about [...] dirty play.

2500|$|Fitz Hugh Ludlow {{was born}} September 11, 1836 in New York City, where his family made their home. His father, the Rev. Henry G. Ludlow, was an outspoken {{abolitionist}} minister {{at a time}} when anti-slavery enthusiasm was not popular, even in the urban North. Only months before his birth, Fitz Hugh later wrote, “my father, mother, and sister were driven from their house in New York by a furious mob. When they came cautiously back, their home was <b>quiet</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fortress the day after it has been blown up. The front-parlor was full of paving-stones; the carpets were cut to pieces; the pictures, the furniture, and the chandelier lay in one common wreck; and the walls were covered with inscriptions of mingled insult and glory. Over the mantel-piece had been charcoaled ‘Rascal’; over the pier-table, ‘Abolitionist.’” ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{threw up}} his head as I burst out upon him from an utterly {{unexpected}} quarter--the very thing that I had so often tried to do, in vain, in the old glorious days. [...] "Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? Well, here am I."

2500|$|In September 1996 Hot Records {{issued a}} {{compilation}} album, On the <b>Quiet,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> selection of acoustic re-workings of previously released material. It {{was produced by}} Rodney Ellis and Steedman. It came with a limited edition bonus all-electric EP of Australian covers. In November 2000 the group issued their eighth studio album, A Mid-Stream of Consciousness. Allmusic's Mark Deming applauded the release, [...] " [...] makes it clear this band has lost nothing {{in the way of}} flash, fire, or smarts during their time away from the studio. If you're looking for lean and mean rock & roll, The Celibate Rifles have still got it in spades". On 19 July 2004 the group's ninth studio album, Beyond Respect, was issued. J T Lindroos writing for Allmusic found [...] "t's no small feat that Lovelock's vocals manage to echo the distinct mannerisms of both Iggy Pop and Jim Morrison while still sounding original". On 18 August 2007 they released a 5×CD compilation box set, Ten Thousand Days, on Shock Records. In August 2011 The Celibate Rifles headlined the Big Freeze concert. Mess+Noises Max Easton described their appearance at the Golden Plains Festival in Meredtih in March 2012, as [...] "one of the festival’s most successful dips into the past. Their appearance was chaotic ... with a set of Aussie garage classics, including the blistering song that broke them, 'Johnny'".|$|E

50|$|In October 2003, NVIDIA {{released}} the GeForce FX 5700 and GeForce FX 5950.

The 5950 also featured a redesigned {{version of the}} 5800's FlowFX cooler, this time using a larger, slower fan and running much <b>quieter</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result. The 5700 provided strong competition for the Radeon 9600 XT in games limited to light use of shader model 2.
