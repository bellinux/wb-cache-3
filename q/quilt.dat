5|$|Florence Loring {{participated in}} civic affairs {{and was a}} quilter whose Crazy <b>Quilt</b> is in the {{collection}} of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. The Lorings constructed the Florence Barton Loring Shelter in 1906 to protect children, lost animals and the city's draft horses. Known at different times as the Minneapolis Humane Society, the Animal Rescue League, and the Animal Humane Society of Hennepin County, today's Animal Humane Society (AHS) was located there near Loring Park for 40 years. Florence Loring also built a home for nurses near the hospital in Riverside, California where the Lorings lived in winter.|$|E

50|$|Beginning {{with the}} Whitney Museum of American Art's 1971 exhibit, Abstract Design in American <b>Quilts,</b> <b>quilts</b> have {{frequently}} appeared on museum and gallery walls.

5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a <b>quilt</b> to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house {{because he could not}} see the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a <b>quilt</b> and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old <b>quilt</b> and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
2500|$|In American Colonial times, <b>quilts</b> were {{predominantly}} wholecloth quiltsâ€“a {{single piece of}} fabric layered with batting and backing held together with fine needlework quilting. Broderie perse <b>quilts</b> were popular during this time and the [...] majority of pierced or appliqued <b>quilts</b> made during the 1170-1800 period, were medallion-style <b>quilts</b> (<b>quilts</b> with a central ornamental panel and one or more borders.)). Patchwork quilting in America dates to the 1770s, the decade the United States gained its independence from England. These late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century patchwork <b>quilts</b> often mixed wool, silk, linen, and cotton in the same piece, as well as mixing large-scale (often chintz) and small-scale (often calico) patterns. Some antique <b>quilts</b> made in North America have worn-out blankets or older <b>quilts</b> as the internal batting layer, quilted between new layers of fabric and thereby extending the usefulness of old material.|$|R
50|$|It wasn't {{long before}} {{it was obvious that}} {{soldiers}} on both sides would need blankets and <b>quilts</b> for warmth.

5|$|Jared Leto is an American {{entertainer}} with {{an extensive}} career in film, music, and television. He made his debut with minor {{roles in the}} television shows Camp Wilder (1992) and Almost Home (1993). He achieved recognition in 1994 {{for his role as}} Jordan Catalano in the teen drama television series My So-Called Life. The show was praised for its portrayal of adolescence and gained a cult following, despite being canceled after only one season. The same year, he made his television film debut starring alongside Alicia Silverstone in Cool and the Crazy. Leto's first film role was in the 1995 drama How to Make an American <b>Quilt.</b> He later co-starred with Christina Ricci in The Last of the High Kings (1996) and received a supporting role in Switchback (1997). In 1997, Leto starred in the biopic Prefontaine in which he played the role of Olympic hopeful Steve Prefontaine. His portrayal received positive reviews from critics and is often considered his breakthrough role. The following year, Leto starred together with Alicia Witt in the horror Urban Legend. He then acted alongside Sean Penn and Adrien Brody in the war film The Thin Red Line (1998). After playing supporting roles in Black and White and Girl, Interrupted, Leto portrayed Angel Face in Fight Club (1999), which has since became a cult film.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quilt</b> design {{theory is}} disputed. The first {{published}} work documenting an oral history source was in 1999, {{and the first}} publication of this theory {{is believed to be}} a 1980 children's book. <b>Quilt</b> historians and scholars of pre-Civil-War America have disputed this legend. There is no contemporary evidence of any sort of <b>quilt</b> code, and <b>quilt</b> historians such as Pat Cummings and Barbara Brackman have raised serious questions about the idea. In addition, Underground Railroad historian Giles Wright has published a pamphlet debunking the <b>quilt</b> code.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quilt</b> {{block is}} {{traditionally}} a patterned square of fabric that is repeated with plain blocks {{to form the}} overall design of a <b>quilt.</b> There {{are a variety of}} different designs for <b>quilt</b> blocks including the Nine-Patch, Shoo Fly, Churn Dash, and the Prairie Queen.|$|E

40|$|<b>Quilts</b> and quiltmaking {{have been}} closely {{connected}} to the religious identities of Norwegian-American women and to churches in the Midwest {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. The Lutheran Church was an important institution, socially as well as religiously, for many Norwegian-American families. Through Kvindeforening, or Ladies Aid, women learned to make <b>quilts,</b> practiced English, built and maintained social relationships, and sold <b>quilts</b> and textiles to fund local, national, and global projects. Immigrant women followed the churchesâ€™ teachings to avoid ostentatiousness by making <b>quilts</b> that, in the early years, were more modestly beautiful. Some <b>quilts</b> made by devout Norwegian Americans show evidence of faith in imagery and language with embroidered scenes from the Bible and Bible verses in Norwegian. Some <b>quilts</b> are best understood within a religious context, like temperance <b>quilts</b> and fundraising <b>quilts</b> that became cherished records of church members because theological disputes were splitting congregations and communities. This presentation explores <b>quilts</b> made by Norwegian immigrants and their descendants within the framework of religion. I will focus on <b>quilts</b> made by women in the American Midwest before about 1935. Iâ€™ve used published and unpublished diaries, letters, and memoirs, as well as the histories of artifacts in collections such as Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum in Decorah, Iowa...|$|R
25|$|Binding: Long fabric strips cut on {{the bias}} that are {{attached}} to the borders of the <b>quilt.</b> Binding is typically machine sewn to the front side of the edge of the <b>quilt,</b> folded over twice, and hand sewn to {{the back side of the}} <b>quilt.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{generally}} three layers in a quilt: the <b>quilt</b> top, the middle layer of batting, and the fabric backing. The <b>quilt</b> top is the design layer. The cotton or polyester batting {{in the middle}} layer is what determines {{the warmth of the}} <b>quilt.</b> Batting comes in different thicknesses depending on the purpose of the final <b>quilt,</b> and multiple layers of batting can be combined to increase the warmth of the final product. The bottom layer is often a simple layer of solid fabric, in a neutral or complimentary color and design scheme, though some quilters use the extra or spare fabric from the <b>quilt</b> top to make a secondary design for the backing.|$|E
25|$|Before {{actually}} quilting fabrics, some quilters baste the <b>quilt.</b> Basting is {{the practice}} of making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface of}} the <b>quilt</b> to hold the layers of the <b>quilt</b> together and to prevent them from shifting during the quilting process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|E
5000|$|In the North, <b>quilts</b> {{were still}} made for fairs but now these fairs earned {{money to support}} needs that came about because of the war. In the South lovely <b>quilts</b> called [...] "gunboat" [...] <b>quilts</b> were made to pay for much-needed gunboats.|$|R
50|$|Another {{major shift}} {{was in the}} style of <b>quilts</b> made. Although a few earlier <b>quilts</b> were made in the block style, <b>quilts</b> made up of blocks were {{uncommon}} until around the 1840s.

50|$|Antique flag <b>quilts</b> fetch {{higher prices}} than applique quilts: high quality flag <b>quilts</b> may be valued at $40,000 - $60,000 while applique <b>quilts</b> sell for $9000 - $15,000.

During American pioneer days, paper quilting became popular. Paper was used as a pattern and each individual piece of cut fabric was basted around the paper pattern. Paper was a scarce commodity in the early American west so women would save letters from home, newspaper clippings, and catalogs to use as patterns. The paper not only served as a pattern but as an insulator. The paper found between the old <b>quilts</b> has become a primary source of information about pioneer life.|$|R
25|$|Since the 1980s, {{claims have}} arisen that <b>quilt</b> designs {{were used to}} signal and direct slaves to escape routes and assistance. According to advocates of the <b>quilt</b> theory, ten <b>quilt</b> {{patterns}} were used to direct slaves to take particular actions. The quilts were placed {{one at a time}} on a fence as a means of nonverbal communication to alert escaping slaves. The code had a dual meaning: first to signal slaves to prepare to escape, and second to give clues and indicate directions on the journey.|$|E
25|$|Quilts {{can have}} many {{different}} templates or patterns {{and they can}} have a large impact on the final result. There are a number of mediums that can be used and depending on the usage, size, and style they will give your <b>quilt</b> a varied look. Templates are generally considered the basis {{of the structure of the}} <b>quilt,</b> like a blueprint for a house. If used properly it can help quilters produce a <b>quilt</b> of their liking and give them a sense of satisfaction and vision for future quilts they want to make.|$|E

50|$|Even before 1830, abolitionists {{were working}} hard to end slavery.

These <b>quilts</b> were usually fine <b>quilts</b> often with beautiful appliquÃ©. Women sometimes put anti-slavery poems and sayings on the <b>quilts</b> they made for fairs {{as well as for}} friends and family. The goal was to show the terrible plight of the slaves.|$|R
