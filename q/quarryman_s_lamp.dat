In the present study, we developed a Smart Laboratory system using Raspberry Pi 2, in which the lamps and air-conditioning (AC) are as its object. To control lights is to use relay 12 VDC derived by GPIO of Raspberry Pi 2, while the AC control using a programming library LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control) is installed in the Raspberry Pi 2. To work the system in this study is based on the time delay control is based on two types of connection, i. e., Wi-Fi (1 st scenario) and PLC adapter (2 nd scenario).

40|$|In 1997, the U. S. {{government}} {{introduced an}} option of having headlamps labeled as visually/optically aimable (VOA). To be so labeled, the vertical gradient {{of the light}} output needs to meet certain minimum requirements. A concern with VOA lamps is that they might provide less light above the horizontal than conventional U. <b>S.</b> <b>lamps,</b> thus reducing the effectiveness of retroreflective signs. This study examined 36 first-generation VOA lamps, to assess the reduction of light above the horizontal. Furthermore, this study addressed the possibility of maintaining the status quo of light for sign visibility, by supplementing light from VOA lamps with light from either parking lamps or an auxiliary lamp mounted just above the driver. A comparison of the first-generation VOA lamps in our sample with marketweighted U. S. low beams from 1997 indicates that, {{on the right side}} of the beam pattern, just above the horizontal, the mean deficit from VOA lamps can reach 1, 400 cd per lamp. Two considerations lead to the conclusion that parking lamps will not be able to make up for this deficit. First, current U. S. requirements limit the output of parking lamps above the horizontal to no more than 125 cd. Second, the retroreflective geometry for parking lamps (i. e., the resultant observation angle) provides either no advantage or only a marginal advantage over headlamps. A lamp mounted on the roof just above the driver would provide a substantial advantage over headlamps in terms of retroreflective geometry, because the observation angles for such a lamp are smaller than for either headlamp. Taking into account this advantage, a single such lamp would need to have a peak intensity between 1, 500 and 2, 000 cd to make up for the deficit created by both VOA headlamps...|$|R

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to separate Streptococcus pneumoniae from the genotypically similar species Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus oralis, which are commensals of the human oral cavity. A novel nucleic acid amplification technique, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), which amplifies DNA under isothermal conditions (63 °C) with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity, was examined regarding its applicability for detecting S. pneumoniae. An <b>S.</b> pneumoniae-specific <b>LAMP</b> primer targeting the lytA gene was designed. The primer specificity was validated using 10 Streptococcus and 7 non-Streptococcus species.

40|$|Introduced to Bodie in 1893, {{electric}} power {{was an important}} innovation in the remote mining community, where an economic revival was badly needed. But, Californians had been experiencing electricity’s marvels {{for more than two}} decades. Beginning in 1871, demonstrations of arc lighting by a professor at Saint Ignatius College periodically illuminated a section of Market Street facing the San Francisco campus. In 1878 city residents gazed upon an exhibition of electric lighting at the Mechanics Pavilion, made possible by manufacturers who displayed arc lamps and generating dynamos. These early novelties were put to practical use in September 1879, when the newly organized California Electric Light Company erected a small steam-powered generating plant in San Francisco to furnish downtown subscribers with arc lighting. San Francisco’s introductory displays of electricity, like others across the country, employed arc lamps, whose glaring brilliance, smoking carbon electrodes, and hissing arcs, restricted their use to outdoor areas or spacious interiors.

These features made Pintsch gas a popular solution for illumination of buoys, beacons and unmanned lighthouses, which allowed these devices to have the capability to remain lit for several months without servicing.|$|R
40|$|Negligence is not {{a ground}} of {{liability}} unless it causes injury or damage to some interest which the law recognizes and protects. Moreover, {{it does not make}} a defendant liable for any injury or damage that {{is not a}} consequence of the negligence. The establishment of the requisite causal connection is therefore an element of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s cause of action for negligence, to be pleaded and proven by him. And where a cause of action exists, the question of causal connection will determine the scope of liability [...] the extent of the injury or damage for which defendant will have to pay.

An 850 ~ 6 <b>s</b> halogen <b>lamp</b> annealing (HLA) caused the outdiffusion of P from the poly-Si layer {{and began to}} eliminate excess Si in W silicide film. More Si atoms were eliminated as the HLA temperature was increased. A HLA at about 1200 ~ for 6 s eliminated the excess Si and formed homogeneous stoichiometric W silicide with a smooth surface. The resistivity after a high temperature anneal was about 45 ~tl-cm and it was independent of the as-deposited W sili-cide film compositions.

On warming, the yellow species (presumably chain-like sulfur diradicals characterized by an absorption at 430 nm) decomposes near 260 K and polymeric sulfur (S-infinity) is formed; the sample color changes gradually to the very similar color of an S 8 -S-infinity mixture, resulting in no visually detectable color change with temperatures from 77 K to 260 K. This is consistent with the lack of posteclipse brightening on Io. Other sulfur forms also turn intense yellow (S 7, S 10), grayish yellow (S 12, S 20, S-infinity), or brownish yellow (S 6) on irradiation at 77 K, and these colors also change to the normal colors of the starting materials on warming to 298 K.

40|$|The Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) will {{be placed}} in an orbit that will subject it to {{constant}} solar radiation during its planned 10 -year mission. A sunshield {{will be necessary to}} passively cool the telescope, protecting it from the Sun s energy and assuring proper operating temperatures for the telescope s instruments. This sunshield will be composed of metalized polymer multilayer insulation with an outer polymer membrane (12 to 25 mm in thickness) that will be metalized on the back to assure maximum reflectance of sunlight. The sunshield must maintain mechanical integrity and optical properties for the full 10 years. This durability requirement is most challenging for the outermost, constantly solar-facing polymer membrane of the sunshield. One of the potential threats to the membrane material s durability is from vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation in wavelengths below 200 nm. Such radiation can be absorbed in the bulk of these thin polymer membrane materials and degrade the polymer s optical and mechanical properties. So that a suitable membrane material can be selected that demonstrates durability to solar VUV radiation, ground-based testing of candidate materials must be conducted to simulate the total 10 - year VUV exposure expected during the Next Generation Space Telescope mission. The Steady State Vacuum Ultraviolet exposure facility was designed and fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field to provide unattended 24 -hr exposure of candidate materials to VUV radiation of 3 to 5 times the Sun s intensity in the wavelength range of 115 to 200 nm. The facility s chamber, which maintains a pressure of approximately 5 10 (exp - 6) torr, is divided into three individual exposure cells, each with a separate VUV source and sample-positioning mechanism. The three test cells are separated by a water-cooled copper shield plate assembly to minimize thermal effects from adjacent test cells. Part of the interior sample positioning mechanism of one test cell is shown in the illustration. Of primary concern in VUV exposure is the maintenance of constant measured radiation intensity so that the sample s total exposure can be determined in equivalent Sun hours. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} a VUV <b>lamp</b> <b>s</b> intensity degrades over time, necessitating a decrease in the distance between the test samples and the lamp. The facility overcomes this challenge by periodically measuring the <b>lamp</b> <b>s</b> intensity with a cesium-iodide phototube and adjusting the sample distance as required to maintain constant exposure intensity. Sample positioning and periodic phototube location under the lamp are both achieved by a single lead-screw assembly.

Taking up various cultural productions such as novels, world’s fairs, advertisements, and museum exhibitions, this project contends that the idea of home has been an important site for negotiating these anxieties at particular moments in U. S. cultural history. Located in the fields of literary and material culture studies, this project examines how objects, both fictional and real, reveal hidden fantasies and untold stories of the national past and present. With examples ranging from a log cabin on display at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exhibition and a China figurine in L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), to early home television sets (1950 <b>s),</b> an electric <b>lamp</b> in a contemporary Ikea advertisement (2003), or an assortment of domestic commodities on display in the National Building Museum’s 2012 House & Home exhibition in Washington D.

As each of these categories are always inflected with particular notions of gender, race, class, and citizenship, I argue that it is through various deployments of “home” that these major themes and debates within American cultural studies continue to be played out and performed. In bringing these texts, sites, and objects together to outline a complex affective economy of home, this research opens up an important area of inquiry that acknowledges both the material and symbolic geographies that inform diverse formations of individual and national identity...|$|R

Empirically, we have determined that after 8 hours at an ambient temperature of 25 C, the average light output of an incandescent cap lamp can decrease to about 69 % of its initial value when powered by a lead-acid battery and it can decrease to about 65 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. An LED-based cap lamp using a constant current drive circuit can maintain about 96 % of its initial value when powered by a nickel-hydride battery. Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and airflow on the light output of an LED and incandescent cap lamp were conducted in the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM). The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improvement of approximately 9. 5 % and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation o f approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and incandescent cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the incandescent cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -hour driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the incandescent light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35 % decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, especially given that the light output will decrease an additional 30 % to 45 % over the period of a 10 -hour shift. The implications of the differences between LED and incandescent sources are discussed.

Real-world tests addressing the effects of ambient temperature and air flow on the light output of an LED and INC cap lamp were conducted in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Safety Research Coal Mine. The LED cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance improve ment of approximately 9. 5 %, and the INC cap lamp yielded a vertical average illuminance degradation of approximately 4 %. The differences between LED and INC cap lamps were further quantified by the calculation of mesopic luminance data that indicated for the same photopic luminance (i. e., as measured using a conventional light meter) the LED cap lamp could be up to 38 % more efficient than the INC cap lamp with a lead-acid battery {{at the end of the}} 10 -h driving cycle. Lastly, accelerated life tests were used to empirically determine light output depreciation as the INC light source age approached its useful life. There was about a 35 % decrease in light output. This is quite considerable, particularly given that the light output will decrease an additional 30 % to 45 % over the period of a 10 -h shift. The implications of the differences between LED and INC sources are discussed. This information is crucial in determining how visual performance could be affected for real-world conditions where batteries discharge during the work shift and as the light source ages. To date, only idealized conditions have been used for LED and INC cap lamp visual performance research...|$|R
