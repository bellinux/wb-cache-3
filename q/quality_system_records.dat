40|$|Abstract: Traceability is a {{prerequisite}} for developing high <b>quality</b> (software) <b>systems.</b> <b>Recording</b> and maintaining all available information is too labor intensive and thus by far too expensive. A project-specific definition of the trace information to be recorded and the method fragments (so called trace fragments) to be executed for recording the information provides a solution for this problem. But the amount of traces to be recorded does not only vary from project to project. It also varies between project phases and even within a project phase. As a consequence project-specific trace fragments need to be adapted according to the actual project phase. In this paper we propose a model-based filter mechanism to significantly reduce the required effort to adapt trace fragments. By defining appropriate filters the project manager is able to (dynamically) adapt the project-specific trace fragments to the actual needs. We present an example to highlight the benefits of the approach and discuss possible extensions...|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to empirically explore the {{organisational}} characteristics of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of hospital departments, to develop and empirically test models for the organisation and implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>systems,</b> and to discuss the clinical implications of the findings. Data were collected from hospital departments through interviews (n= 19) and a nation-wide survey (n= 386). The interviews were analysed thematically and organisational models were developed. Relationships among aspects of organisation and implementation were hypothesised and analysed with structural equation modelling. The result was a new framework with three organisational aspects of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> each with two sub-aspects: structure (resources and administration), process (culture and cooperation), and outcome (evaluation of goal achievement and development of competence). Strong positive relationships were confirmed among structure, process, and outcome. <b>Quality</b> <b>systems</b> could therefore be classified into three organisational degrees. For instance, <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of high organisational degree often had adequate resources and administration as well as positive organisational cultures and high cooperation among different professions. Advanced designs required <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of high organisational degrees. Examples of such designs were coordination between departments, random check ups, and accreditation. The organisationally demanding <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> had been implemented through cooperative implementation, that is, directed by managers {{while at the same}} time giving opportunities for staff to participate in planning and designing. The results can be useful to managers, quality coordinators, and clinicians when they describe, develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> in hospital departments...|$|R

40|$|Context: <b>Quality</b> <b>systems</b> were {{implemented}} in healthcare institutions to assure {{and improve the}} quality of care. Despite the fact that all Dutch hospitals have implemented a <b>quality</b> <b>system,</b> incidents persist to surface. How could this be explained? The current research was set out to gain thorough insights in the working mechanisms underlying the structure-process-outcome relationships of quality improvement within hospital <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> and to understand the conditions under which a <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> lead to higher quality of care. The main research question of this research was: ‘What are working mechanisms of hospital <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> that lead to high quality of care?' Methods: This research was based on a combination of several research methods. Quantitative as well as qualitative data were used to address the research question. We have used triangulation of data sources such as longitudinal survey data on <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> in hospitals between 1995 and 2011, data of the evaluation of a national Patient Safety Program, two measurements with a questionnaire that maps elements of organizational process control, observations of compliance with a surgical checklist and interview data on the attitudes of healthcare professionals towards quality protocols. Data were measured at the structure, process and outcome level in order to get insight in all the levels that are involved in quality improvement. Advanced multilevel statistical techniques were used to analyze the results. Results: Results of this research showed that 45 % of Dutch hospitals reached a stage of development of their <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> in which all the elements of a <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> are in place and this is used for continuous improvement. Results showed that a higher stage of development of a <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> is related to higher perceived organizational outcomes and that the outcomes are used to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>system.</b> A higher stage of development of a <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> was not associated with higher scores on process indicators measured at the hospital department level. Analysis of risk assesment at department level showed large differences between hospital departments on the perceived risks in several organizational domains. Especially in the domain ‘procedures', and a further investigation of attitudes of healthcare professionals towards procedures showed low compliance, general acceptance of deviations and a wide variety of strategies to communicate about deviations. Discussion: The results of this research show the complexity of the relation between hospital <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> and high <b>quality</b> of care. In order to obtain the desired high quality of care and a cycle of continuous improvement, hospitals will need to use the data and results from the system to improve their <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> as well as their processes. It is not only important to focus on the effect of the <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> on the organizational outcomes but also to focus on the effect of the system on the processes. When processes are being neglected in quality improvement, {{it is unlikely that the}} effects of the <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> will reach its intended effects: improvement of the quality of patient care.

By discussing with the research team, three companies in southern Sweden set up design teams to establish principles for visualisations of their <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> on their intranets. Together with one of the researchers, the design teams created and evaluated computer supported prototypes and exchanged ideas between the teams via the Internet. The results show that <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> can be adequately visualised and that the companies preferred descriptions of the physical plant layout containing symbols that connect to further information by hyperlinks. A <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> based on computer supported visualisation will make the <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> more understandable and have better possibilities to engage personnel in the quality work; it will be faster, easier, and more interesting to use than systems with only paper documents. The use of design teams with access to each other's prototypes via the Internet supported the design process by stimulating generation of ideas and solutions to visualise a <b>quality</b> <b>system.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of this {{research}} was to create new <b>quality</b> control <b>system.</b> Design/methodology/approach: For the purpose of new <b>quality</b> control <b>system,</b> the base of technological parameters of the process of continuous casting of steel (CCS) has been programmed; it consists of 53 parameters. The optimal values for the technological parameters are necessary to proper functioning of databases and are essential element of <b>quality</b> control <b>system.</b> For each parameter, some target values have been empirically defined i. e. upper and lower bound, which assured proper functioning of a new process <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> for CCS. Findings: The author has modernized the loss function {{in such a way that}} it includes the whole range of technological parameters of CCS process. Practical implications: Having such an investigation material the scope and concept of a new <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> have been designed. The essentials component of the new <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> are the mathematical basis on which a modernized Taguchi’s loss function have been developed. Originality/value: On the basis of the performed investigations, a new <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> for concast slab of carbon steel which functions in industrial conditions has been developed...|$|R
