5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were inherited from her maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of sensors that detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

5|$|The {{piezoelectric}} {{properties of}} crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> oscillator {{was built by}} Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada. The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production {{has resulted in the}} subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches.|$|E
25|$|Quartz clocks {{employ a}} crystal {{oscillator}} {{made from a}} <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> that uses {{a combination of both}} direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> (like any elastic material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to oscillate, and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.|$|E

25|$|Some {{types of}} quartz {{crystals}} have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon {{the application of}} mechanical stress. An early use of this property of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One {{of the most common}} piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. The resonant frequency of a <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.|$|E
25|$|In early MEMS {{resonator}} development, researchers {{tried to}} build resonators at the target application frequencies and to maintain those frequencies over temperature.

25|$|The quartz {{clock is}} a clock that keeps time {{by using an}} {{electronic}} oscillator regulated by a <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal.</b> This allows for significantly better accuracy than mechanical clocks.

5000|$|A {{crystal filter}} is an {{electronic}} filter that uses <b>quartz</b> <b>crystals</b> for resonators. <b>Quartz</b> <b>crystals</b> are piezoelectric, so their mechanical characteristics can affect electronic circuits. (see mechanical filter) In particular, <b>quartz</b> <b>crystals</b> can exhibit mechanical resonances {{with a very}} high Q factor (from 10,000 to 100,000 and greater [...] - [...] far higher than conventional resonators built from inductors and capacitors). The crystal's stability and its high Q factor allow crystal filters to have precise center frequencies and steep band-pass characteristics. Typical crystal filter attenuation in the band-pass is approximately 2-3dB. Crystal filters are commonly used in communication devices such as radio receivers.|$|R

25|$|The IF stage {{includes}} a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits {{in order to}} achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a flat response across the desired signal spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.|$|E

25|$|Tuners {{are used}} by guitar {{technicians}} who are hired by rock and pop bands {{to ensure that all}} of the band's instruments are ready to play at all times. Guitar technicians (often called guitar techs) tune all of the instruments (electric guitars, electric basses, acoustic guitars, mandolins, etc.) before the show, after they are played, and before they are used onstage. Guitar techs also retune instruments throughout the show. Whereas amateur musicians typically use a relatively inexpensive quartz tuner, guitar technicians typically use expensive, high-end tuners such as strobe tuners. Most strobe tuners, counter-intuitively, also use <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> oscillators as time references, although the responses are processed differently by the different units.|$|E
25|$|Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) {{oscillators}} are timing {{devices that}} generate highly stable reference frequencies, which can measure time.

The core technologies used in MEMS oscillators have been in development since the mid-1960s, but have only been sufficiently advanced for commercial applications since 2006. MEMS oscillators incorporate MEMS resonators, which are microelectromechanical structures that define stable frequencies. MEMS clock generators are MEMS timing devices with multiple outputs for systems that need more than a single reference frequency. MEMS oscillators are a valid alternative to older, more established <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> oscillators, offering better resilience against vibration and mechanical shock, and reliability with respect to temperature variation.|$|E
