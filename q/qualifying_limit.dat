50|$|The {{statutory}} counties {{formed the}} basis for the so-called “administrative counties”. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 “counties in themselves”, or “county boroughs”, were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties. The <b>qualifying</b> <b>limit</b> for county borough status was a population of 50,000, although some historic county towns were given county borough status despite lower populations (e.g., Canterbury, Oxford). Each county borough and administrative county would then become governed by an elected county or borough council, providing services specifically for those areas. The act also created a (metropolitan) County of London from the urban areas (“metropolis”) of London, which was a full statutory county by itself. This county absorbed the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had been established in 1855 specifically to maintain the infrastructure of London.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} off-season, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile {{introduced}} new rules restricting {{the use of}} the Drag Reduction System during free practice and <b>qualifying,</b> <b>limiting</b> its use to the circuit's designated DRS zones. However, during Friday practice, the race stewards encountered a technical glitch in the telemetry system that controlled the availability of DRS, meaning that the system would be completely unrestricted. This forced the stewards to rely on drivers to use the system honestly, threatening penalties to any driver caught using DRS outside the designated areas. The same error meant that the stewards would be unable to notify drivers via telemetry of warning flags, instead relying on marshalls around the circuit to display them and teams to warn drivers up upcoming flags during the race.|$|R

50|$|Canadian Jacques Villeneuve {{took his}} fourth career pole {{position}} after a stunning lap of 1:29.369, while Heinz-Harald Frentzen could only manage a 1:31.121 {{to fill the}} remaining spot on the front row. Only 6 drivers managed to qualify within 3 seconds of the pole position time. The session was red flagged with just over two minutes remaining after a collision between Gerhard Berger and Nicola Larini on the straight between turns 10 and 11. This resulted {{in many of the}} cars effectively having to complete a one-lap sprint to post a lap time {{before the end of the}} session. Damon Hill struggled during the session, only just qualifying inside of the 107% limit due to an oil leak which hampered the lap times. Both of the Lola cars failed to make the <b>qualifying</b> <b>limit</b> and were over ten seconds slower than Villeneuve in their first and only F1 qualifying session, as the team had to withdraw from the next race due to a lack of funds. Pedro Diniz was also outside of the 107% time, however he was permitted to race, having set a time in practice within the 107% time.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the inauguration}} of the charity the {{monetary}} limits have increased to reflect financial inflation. From the original 6 shillings a week paid to the first occupants the yearly pension had risen to £40 per year (15 shillings a week) in 1833, and the <b>qualifying</b> <b>limit</b> of income for residency had risen to £20 per year. At this time the number of applicants for residence in the almshouse was [...] "not numerous". There was a change in administration of the college in 1869 whereby the number of matrons was reduced to eight, but could be increased to ten {{at the discretion of}} the governors. At this time the annual allowance was increased to no more than £60 per year, with a qualifying income of £50. The qualifying conditions were also extended to include unmarried daughters of clergy ordained in the Salisbury or Exeter dioceses. There were eight matrons resident in 1907, the majority having their own income and some employing servants. In the 1930s and 1940s a scheme to raise the personal income limit was suggested but was declined by the Charity Commissioners as there were sufficient candidates within the £50 limit. In 1955 the personal limit to qualify as a resident was raised to £200.|$|E

That doctor put Nate on hormone replacement therapy, and when Nate applied for a Therapeutic Use Exemption with the New Jersey state commission, they allowed it but declared that he must go off the therapy for ten weeks, then have his levels retested by a specialist to determine if he {{really needs to be}} on the therapy or not. At the end of that period, both the specialist and Nate's primary doctor agreed his levels really were low and he was a candidate for replacement therapy. Nate's primary doctor injected him with testosterone to quickly get his levels back up in time for his scheduled fight against Story. The Pennsylvania commission had set standards for what his testosterone levels could be at fight time and Nate's levels, though trending down over the last week before the fight, still failed to fall to within the range required in time for him to be cleared to fight.

30|$|What is {{the effect}} of class size on student achievement?) due to methodological {{considerations}} and data limitations. Under the best conditions, even when using methods that focus on making causal claims, answers to most researchers’ questions are <b>qualified</b> and <b>limited</b> in scope. The need to <b>qualify</b> findings and/or <b>limit</b> their scope can be attributed to measurement problems, selection bias, and the lack of ability to control for all relevant variables. When, and if, we are able to attend to the majority of these threats, especially with ILSA data, resulting claims are often limited in scope and not often suitable to address larger policy-focused questions. For example, simply creating a policy that mandates closer alignment to TIMSS will probably not improve test scores if the teachers do not teach the material or if the curriculum becomes too vast to be covered in 1  year. The necessarily narrow focus of most research aimed at causal inferences, especially with ILSA data, unfortunately creates a landscape where learning and achievement are presented as a highly simplified problem. In other words, findings that are overly narrow and do not account for the known complexity of our educational systems can misguide policymakers by ignoring complex interactions just {{as much as they can}} inform them about educational systems.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} stages of the Hawke government, Australias {{taxation}} system has been modified with a view to attracting additional capital into the domestic venture capital market. In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at <b>qualifying</b> <b>limited</b> partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as fiscally transparent for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax ("CGT") or otherwise assessable as ordinary income. The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership ("VCLP"), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the "VCLP Concessions". This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors. The efficacy and appropriateness of the VCLP Concessions from a policy perspective is also examined. Recommendations are provided which, if enacted, would address regions of structural inconsistency and improve the functioning of this concessional regime...|$|R
