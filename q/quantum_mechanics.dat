In this formalism of <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics,</b> observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.|$|E

5|$|Wigner {{received}} {{a request from}} Arnold Sommerfeld {{to work at the}} University of Göttingen as an assistant to the great mathematician David Hilbert. This proved a disappointment, as the aged Hilbert's abilities were failing, and his interests had shifted to logic. Wigner nonetheless studied independently. He laid the foundation for the theory of symmetries in <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> and in 1927 introduced what is now known as the Wigner D-matrix. Wigner and Hermann Weyl were responsible for introducing group theory into <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics.</b> The latter had written a standard text, Group Theory and <b>Quantum</b> <b>Mechanics</b> (1928), but it was not easy to understand, especially for younger physicists.

5|$|The AdS/CFT {{correspondence}} resolves {{the black}} hole information paradox, {{at least to some}} extent, because it shows how a black hole can evolve {{in a manner consistent with}} <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> in some contexts.

5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon.

The representation of a symmetry group on a Hilbert space is either an ordinary representation or a projective representation.|$|E
