5000|$|KENT Systems is {{a plastic}} {{injection}} molding company in Loveland, Colorado. KENT Systems has {{a line of}} patented plastic quick coupling, plastic fittings, media bags, and tubing. KENT Systems was designed, created, and developed by Kent Sampson. Kent Sampson [...] along with his wife, Gloria, founded Value Plastics in Fort Collins, Colorado. While owning Value Plastics, Kent Sampson invented the KENT Systems line of <b>quick</b> <b>couplings.</b> In 1998 Kent and Gloria were the first business owners to win the prestigious Bravo! Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the Northern Colorado Business Report. In 2001 Kent and Gloria Sampson decided spin off the KENT Systems product line and create a separate company from Value Plastics, the newly formed company was named Kent Systems. In 2007 Kent and Gloria Sampson sold KENT Systems to their youngest son, Lyle, and daughter in-law, Linda.|$|E
5000|$|The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 is {{very compact}} {{as it is}} {{designed}} to operate in the Swiss Air Force's aircraft caverns (or underground hangars). It runs on diesel fuel to lower the risk of fire. For precise maneuvering around the caverns, pilot tunnels and shelters it is equipped with special downward-shining floor lighting headlights to help the driver to follow floor markings.It is also used to provide a power supply to aircraft whitout an Auxiliary power unit. It is used as well as tractors for about 1-4 engine start units or for ad hoc transport of mechanics and tools (e.g. spare wheel and jack by a flat tire of a landed aircraft). JuAir at Dübendorf Air Base is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type. The aircraft tractors are equipped with four <b>quick</b> <b>couplings</b> as standard. This allows them to be loaded with a crane, in a short time, on every flatbed truck of the Swiss military. The Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 are street-legal, but with their 80km range and permitted maximum speed of 25 km/h, however, are not independently suitable for ad-hoc transfers. An ad-hoc capability was achieved with the 4 crane couplings. Such ad-hoc transfers were part of the concept of the Swiss Air Force in the Cold War. It was anticipated to use various motorway sections of the Motorways of Switzerland as air force bases. This was also done several times in exercises. In these exercises the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 was involved. For example, the [...] "U TAUTO" [...] exercise on March 24, 1982, the Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 were stationed at the Rest area [...] "Windrose" [...] near Münsingen. JuAir at Dübendorf AFB is the only civil user of this aircraft tug type.|$|E

5000|$|Liquid cooling {{techniques}} {{are increasingly being}} used for the thermal management of electronic components. This type of cooling is a solution to ensure the optimisation of energy efficiency while simultaneously minimising noise and space requirements. Especially useful in supercomputers or Data Centers as maintenance of the racks is quick and easy. After disassembly of the rack, advanced technology <b>quick</b> release <b>couplings</b> eliminate spillage {{for the safety of}} operators and protects the integrity of fluids (no impurities in the circuits). These couplings are also capable of being locked (Panel mounted?) to allow blind connection in difficult to access areas.It is important in electronics technology to analyse the connection systems to ensure: ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quick</b> Connect-Disconnect <b>Couplings</b> (QCDCs) {{provide a}} means of rapidly {{disconnecting}} a fluid line without loss of hydraulic fluid or entrance of air into the system. They are most commonly used for hydraulic systems in aerospace applications like space stations, launch vehicles, etc. Information regarding the design of QCDCs is not available in open literature. This paper details the preliminary design and optimization of QCDCs for indigenization of the technology, and the general configuration arrived at. A QCDC consists of two halves – a male half and a female half. The sealing action is achieved by using poppet valve in the male half and a moveable sleeve in the female half. O-rings are used {{to ensure that the}} design is leak-proof. Changes in pressure and velocity of the fluid flowing through the QCDC have been kept to a minimum by ensuring gradual changes in cross-section wherever possible...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents the}} design and function verification of additional filtration. It is intended for the common transmission and hydraulic oil filling of tractors. The main role of this filtration concept is to ensure {{a high level of}} oil cleanness as a condition for the application of ecologic fluids in tractors. The next one is to decrease the wear of lubricated tractor components, the degradation of oil and eventually to extend the interval of oil change. The designed additional filtering is characterized by ease installation through the use of <b>quick</b> <b>couplings</b> and hoses to the external hydraulic circuit. Therefore, the filtration is suitable for various tractor types. Filter element has been designed with the filter ability 1 micron and the ability to separate to 0. 5 [*]dm 3 of water from oil. Function of additional filtration was verified during the 150 engine hours of tractor operation. During this time period the oil contamination was evaluated on the basis of chemical elements content such as Fe, Cu, Si, Al, Ni, Mo and Cr. The additive concentration was evaluated on the basis of chemical elements content such as Ca, P and Zn. During the test operation of tractor the concentration decrease of chemical elements reached the values 25. 53 [*]% (Fe), 23. 53 [*]% (Si), 25 [*]% (Al) and 5. 5 [*]% (Cu). The decrease of additive concentration reached only medium level (6. 6 %). Therefore, the designed additional filtration doesn’t remove additives from oil. Based on the evaluation of the content of chemical elements (that representing contamination and additives), we can say that the designed filtering method is suitable for use in agricultural tractors...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the fatigue life of two components in different hydraulic <b>quick</b> <b>couplings.</b> The crack which initiates the fatigue failure usually occurs {{in the bottom of}} one of the threads. Thus, the threads in the coupling are carefully investigated. A few different approaches for determining the fatigue life are studied for each component. CAD (Computer Aided Design) models for both components are created and analyzed with FEM (Finite Element Method). By analyzing these components with FEM the stresses and the strains are calculated. These values for stress and strain are used to determine the fatigue life for the different components. The first component is suffering from high cycle fatigue. Four different approaches for high cycle fatigue are investigated. These four are Wöhler-curve, Haigh-diagram, von Mises fatigue criterion and Mises-Sines fatigue criterion. It was found that all of them but the von Mises fatigue criterion give a good approximation of the fatigue life. von Mises fatigue criterion does not consider the midstress, which can be a reason for this. The three other approaches indicate that the component will be suffering from fatigue, but will be relatively close to infinite life. The Wöhler-curve indicates that the component will withstand about 470 000 loading cycles. Compared to the experimental tests where the component withstands about 700 000 loading cycles, {{it can be said that}} the approach is a good estimation of the fatigue life. Approximated material data are used. For further work it is essential to obtain experimental material data for better approximation of the fatigue life. The second component is suffering from low cycle fatigue, which means that different approaches are needed. The approaches are originally from Coffin-Manson and Morrow. A total of four low cycle fatigue criterion have been studied. The first one is made by CoffinManson and takes the plastic strain in to account, the second is made by Morrow and takes both the elastic and the plastic strain in to account.  The third is a modification of Morrow’s criterion, and will consider the midstresses as well. The fourth is a simplification of Morrow’s criterion where more common material parameters are used. These four have been compared and it can be seen that the CoffinManson criterion gives the best approximation of the reality. The Coffin-Manson criterion gives an approximation of 50 000 loading cycles to fatigue failure which, compared to that the experimental tests suffered from fatigue failure after about 40 000 loading cycles, is a good estimation of the fatigue life...|$|E
