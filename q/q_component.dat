The me-chanical angular {{speed of the}} rotor is considered as a time-varying parameter. A self-scheduled controller is then designed for the inner current loop in order to guarantee decoupling of torque and power factor, and to achieve high robust dynamic performance for all admissible trajectories of the rotor speed in the operating range. The closed loop system performance with the proposed controller is compared with a conventional control scheme. Performance and robustness of the controlled system are demonstrated via simulations.

40|$|Quadrature {{sampling}} {{has been}} widely applied in coherent radar systems to extract in-phase and quadrature (I and <b>Q)</b> <b>components</b> in the received radar signal. However, the sampling is inefficient because the received signal contains {{only a small number}} of significant target signals. This paper incorporates the compressive sampling (CS) theory into the design of the quadrature sampling system, and develops a quadrature compressive sampling (QuadCS) system to acquire the I and <b>Q</b> <b>components</b> with low sampling rate. The QuadCS system first randomly projects the received signal into a compressive bandpass signal and then utilizes the quadrature sampling to output compressive I and <b>Q</b> <b>components.</b> The compressive outputs are used to reconstruct the I and <b>Q</b> <b>components.</b> To understand the system performance, we establish the frequency domain representation of the QuadCS system. With the waveform-matched dictionary, we prove that the QuadCS system satisfies the restricted isometry property with overwhelming probability. For K target signals in the observation interval T, simulations show that the QuadCS requires just O(Klog(BT/K)) samples to stably reconstruct the signal, where B is the signal bandwidth. The reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio decreases by 3 dB for every octave increase in the target number K and increases by 3 dB for every octave increase in the compressive bandwidth. Theoretical analyses and simulations verify that the proposed QuadCS is a valid system to acquire the I and <b>Q</b> <b>components</b> in the received radar signals.

The work presented in this thesis is an application of Harr wavelet transform to monochrome and color image compression. In this thesis, wavelet basis functions, Harr wavelet transform and its fast computational algorithm are introduced. Furthermore, the schemes for efficient monochrome and color image compression using Harr Wavelet Transform (HWT) are proposed and described. Based on these schemes, the monochrome and color image compression algorithms are developed and implemented on the existing image processing system. In each algorithm, two kinds of coefficient sampling strategies are applied: zonal sampling and adaptive threshold sampling. The color image compression method is the extension of a monochrome image compression technique on the three monochrome components called Y, I, and Q.
