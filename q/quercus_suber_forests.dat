40|$|We {{provide new}} chorological, demographic, phenological, phytosociological, {{ecological}} and environmental management data of Simethis mattiazzi in Catalonia, a threatened vascular {{plant in the}} Mediterranean region. We have located 27 stands {{in the region of}} la Selva which counting give us an estimation of 176, 052 individuals (22 stands). The area of occupancy is 43, 594 m 2 which are distributed in 10 UTM squares of 1 km per side. Simethis is a characteristic species of Lavandulo stoechadis-Ericetum scopariae association and can be found in three different habitats (32 k Erica scoparia heaths, 45 b <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> <b>forests</b> with undergrowth of acidophilous scrub and 45 i Mixed forest of Q. suber and Pinus spp.), clearly preferring the 32 k. However, it produces more flowers per individual in environments that are less favourable (45 b and 45 i). By all appearances, the predominant distribution factor in Europe and Africa is climate, which always has to be Atlantic or Submediterranean with oceanic trend. Likewise, we give conservation proposals and confirm the current IUCN status “endangered” (EN) of Simethis in Catalonia...|$|E
40|$|Cork oak (<b>Quercus</b> <b>suber)</b> <b>forests</b> are {{acknowledged}} {{for their}} biodiversity and economic (mainly cork production) values. WildWres {{are one of}} the main threats contributing to cork oak decline in the Mediterranean Basin, and one major question that managers face after Wre in cork oak stands is whether the burned trees should be coppiced or not. This decision can be based on the degree of expected crown regeneration assessed immediately after Wre. In this study we carried out a post-Wre assessment of the degree of crown recovery in 858 trees being exploited for cork production in southern Portugal, 1. 5 years after a wildWre. Using logistic regression, we modelled good or poor crown recovery probability as a function of tree and stand variables. The main variables inXuencing the likelihood of good or poor crown regeneration were bark thickness, charring height, aspect and tree diameter. We also developed management models, including simpler but easier to measure variables, which had a lower predictive power but can be used to help managers to identify, immediately after Wre, trees that will likely show good crown regeneration, and trees that will likely die or show poor regeneration (and thus, potential candidates for trunk coppicin...|$|E
40|$|Cork oak (<b>Quercus</b> <b>suber)</b> <b>forests</b> {{are unique}} in being largely anthropogenic, and {{representing}} both {{an important source}} of income and a great reservoir of biodiversity. Because of changes in the Mediterranean climate and developments in the way farming is conducted, the semi-natural cork-oak forests have become ecologically fragile and more susceptible to pathogens. There is evidence that climate is selecting for thermophilic or thermotolerant pathogen strains that produce a larger biomass. A high infectivity (massive propagule pressure) is a major determinant in the spread of pathogens to as yet uncontaminated areas. We describe the role and effect of these pathogens with the aim to identify strategies for curtailing diseases and safeguarding the forests. This report gives an overview of the most harmful pathogens of cork-oak and provides a critical evaluation of how cork-oak stands are currently managed, suggesting new ways of management and also outlining future research necessary to keep the disease agents under control. A knowledge of the effect of climate change on the growth and survival of pathogens, and on tree-parasite interactions as a result, has become fundamental for making informed decisions and managing cork oak forests properly...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the diversity and}} identity of the rhizobial populations nodulating an invasive Australian legume tree Acacia mearnsii in a natural <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> <b>forest</b> in the El Kala National Park, Algeria. Soils from three different forest plots corresponding to non invaded original Q. suber stand, partially invaded by A. mearnsii, and totally invaded (monodominant) A. mearnsii stand were used to trap nodulating bacteria with the same tree species. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from root nodules and characterized by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, then submitted to phylogenetic analyses. A total of 67 isolates was obtained, representing the 3 different forest plots, all renodulating A. mearnsii in monoxenic conditions. Phylogenetic analyses showed that all isolates belong to different Bradyrhizobium lineages, according {{to each of the}} three locations with little intermixing between forest plots. These results illustrate the adaptation of nodulating Bradyrhizobium populations to the new soil conditions induced by invasion.

40|$|Aim: For tree species, adult {{survival}} and seedling and sapling recruitment dynamics {{are the main}} processes that determine forest structure and composition. Thus, studying how these two life stages may be affected by climate change {{in the context of}} other abiotic and biotic variables is critical to understand future population trends. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the sustainability of cork oak (<b>Quercus</b> <b>suber)</b> <b>forests</b> at the core of its distributional range under future climatic conditions.   Location: Southern Spain. Methods: Using forest inventory data collected at two periods 10 years apart, we performed a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the role of different abiotic and biotic factors on adult {{survival and}} recruitment patterns.   Results: We found that both life stages were influenced by climatic conditions, but in different ways. Adult tree survival was negatively impacted by warmer spring temperatures, while recruitment was positively affected by warmer winter temperatures. Our results also revealed the importance of soil texture as a modulator of winter precipitation effects on adult survival. With higher winter precipitation, adult survival increased in sandy soils and decreased in clayish soils. Therefore, under predicted future climate scenarios of wetter winters and warmer temperatures, the presence of cork oaks is more likely to occur in sandy soils vs. clayish soils. Biotic conditions also affected these life stages. We found a negative effect of heterospecific but not conspecific trees on both adult survival and seedling recruitment.   Main conclusions: Overall, the sustainability of the studied forests will be highly dependent not only on future climatic trends, but also on their interaction with other key factors – soil properties in particular – that modulate the effects of climate on demographic rates...|$|E
40|$|Comunicação em painelThe {{cork oak}} (<b>Quercus</b> <b>suber)</b> <b>forest</b> (the “montado”) {{is a unique}} and emblematic {{resource}} for Portugal, due to its ecological, socio-economic significance, and the commercial value of cork. Plant abiotic stresses, particularly reduced water availability and extreme temperatures, are substantial constraints to agricultural and agro-forestry production. In the particular case of cork oak, the damaging land-use policies, the climate change, and imposition of abiotic stresses related with high light intensities have been threatening the cork oak forests. The adaptation to abiotic stresses comprises a series of morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes controlled by complex molecular networks. Recent advances in increasing plant tolerance were achieved after the identification of specific genes suited for plant genetic engineering. However, as abiotic stress is commonly present in the field as a combination of different stresses, the complex plant response mechanisms are far from being elucidated. This work {{is part of a}} coordinated effort to uncover the transcriptome of Q. suber and attention was paid to the identification of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) involved in responses to distinct abiotic stress challenges, namely drought, salt and oxidative stresses.

40|$|Mestrado em Gestão de Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{increased}} {{usage of}} mechanical understorey clearing in Mediterranean forests to reduce fire risk has consequences on biological {{communities that are}} poorly known. This issue was addressed using a chronosequence of 48 <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> <b>forest</b> stands in southern Portugal, to estimate how vegetation and bird assemblages attributes change following clearing over about 70 years. This study showed that understorey clearing has long-lasting effects on vegetation structure and composition, {{as well as on}} bird assemblages, that lasted for at least 40 - 50 years. Recovery of tree richness lasted about 50 years. Shrubs started recovering immediately after clearing, with pioneer seeder species dominating understorey vegetation for about 20 years. Resprouter species recovered slowly for about 40 - 50 years. Both breeding and wintering bird assemblages were affected by clearing, with particularly strong effects on insectivorous and frugivorous species, mostly those associated with shrubs and trees. Results were stronger during winter when frugivores distribution appeared influenced by fruit tracking in old understorey forests. Vertical heterogeneity in old understorey stands was likely to be the key factor affecting bird distribution during spring. Management strategies for reducing fire risk should strive to maintain some stands with understorey older than about 50 years in order to conserve biodiversity repositories...|$|R
40|$|The {{forest biomass}} {{has had a}} growing {{importance}} in the global economy, by applications in bioenergy, development of bioproducts and issues related to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. Forest biomass is a global strategic reserve that must be inventoried and monitored.

Considering these facts, it is urgent to develop reliable techniques, low costs, to obtain this kind of information.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of inter-disciplinary work drawing on archaeobotanical and archaeometric studies to trace the agroforestry landscape and the supply economy at the vicus of Thamusida in north-west Morocco at the border of the Roman Empire. The available data indicate the self-sufficiency of the settlement in both forestry and agricultural products throughout the period investigated {{from the end of the}} 1 st century BC to the beginning of the 4 th century AD. Charcoal data testify to the presence of a <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> <b>forest</b> in the close surroundings of the site and its exploitation for a variety of forestry products such as timber, fuelwood, cork, and probably also leaves and acorns to feed livestock. The overwhelming presence of Q. suber in the archaeological layer investigated clearly indicates that this forest was under human influence prior to Roman occupation and was already partially degraded. Charred seed and fruit remains suggest that the diet of both troops and civilians was mainly based on locally grown products and that all the inhabitants of the site had access to good cereals such as barley, naked wheats and pulses with large seeds such as horse bean and pea; quality fruits, such as olive and grape, were also produced locally for fresh consumption. Organic residue analyses of the contents of ceramic vessels and plastered vats allowed archaeobotanical data to be complemented, thereby shedding light on some of the imports at Thamusida. Despite the remote location of this settlement, imported goods such as oil and wine were transported here in amphorae from different parts of the Empire...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fire {{management}} {{activities can}} greatly {{benefit from the}} description of wildland fuel as a fire behaviour predictor. A forest typology developed from the Portuguese National Forest Inventory that combines cover type (the dominant overstorey species) and forest structure defined as a combination of generic stand density (closed or open) and height (low or tall) was translated into fuel models. Fire behaviour simulations that accounted for the fire environment modification induced by stand structure resulted in an objective and quantitative fire hazard classification for 19 forest types. We found that potential fire behaviour is primarily driven by stand structure, rather than by cover type. The results reveal four basic fire hazard groups. Surface fire spread rate is low to moderate, surface fire intensity is low and the crown fire hazard is insignificant in the open and tall forest types, {{as well as in}} dense and tall <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> and diverse <b>forests.</b> Moderate surface fire potential and high to very high crowning potential characterizes dense and low woodland of deciduous oaks, <b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> and diverse <b>forests,</b> closed and tall Pinus pinaster stands, and open and low eucalypt stands.

30|$|Cork oak (<b>Quercus</b> <b>suber</b> L.) <b>forests</b> {{are part}} of Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} of Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Morocco that, besides their high socio-economic value resulting from the exploitation of cork, play a significant ecological role. They are a permanent component of the landscape, a significant barrier against forest fires, {{and a source of}} a remarkable biodiversity due to the high habitat heterogeneity (Natividade 1950; Pausas et al. 2009). Especially in Iberian Peninsula that accounts for near 90 % of cork world production and where most studies have been done this ecosystem has been under the threat of a progressive decline for which the main biological contributing factor was shown to be the root parasite Phytophthora cinnamomi, one of the most destructive Phytophthora species (Brasier et al. 1993; Caetano 2007; Moreira-Marcelino 2001). Despite the ecological and economic importance of cork oak, the pathosystem Quercus-P. cinnamomi has not received sufficient attention and molecular interaction studies are scarce. Also, rising concerns about the expected spread of P. cinnamomi to Northern and Eastern regions in Europe, as a consequence of climatic changes (Brasier 2003; Jung 2009) justify the investment in increasing the knowledge of this pathosystem.|$|R
