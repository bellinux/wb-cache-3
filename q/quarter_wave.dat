5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer.

25|$|To {{come up with}} a fast {{boat for}} IMS racing (or PHRF) Rob Ball aimed for maximum {{all-around}} speed relative to sailing length by providing a large rig, low center of gravity, narrow waterline beam, and weight concentrated amidships (to minimize pitching). Gentle handling characteristics result in a boat that is easy to sail, and make a boat sail faster in practice, so a big, stall-resistant keel and rudder were an important part of this design. The keel is large and deep, with an elliptical profile and narrow chord length where it joins the hull.

25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate. This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E

500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all in-band frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> impedance transformer action.|$|E
2500|$|A {{full-range}} {{driver is}} a speaker {{designed to be}} used alone to reproduce an audio channel {{without the help of}} other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically [...] in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some computer speakers, etc. In hi-fi speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low cost <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.|$|E

40|$|Narrow {{bandpass}} filters {{have historically}} been designs of <b>quarter</b> <b>waves</b> at the passband wavelength, and have been monitored at the turning points using the passband wavelength. By direct monitoring at the passband wavelength, errors {{have been shown to}} be primarily self compensated, and have allowed much better performance than could otherwise be expected. The turning points are difficult to detect precisely and accurately because the change in transmittance with thickness becomes zero at the desired termination point. By proper design with non-quarter-wave layers, essentially the same spectral performance can be achieved by layer terminations that are far enough from turning points to be significantly more sensitive termination points. The design approach is to maintain the optical thickness of the reflector layer pairs at one half-wave of the passband wavelength, but change the ratio of the optical thicknesses of the high and low index layers. These can be adjusted enough so that the thicker layers contain two turning points and the last turning point in the layer can be more accurately and precisely determined. The error compensation benefit from the historic method should be maintained. This leads to potentially improved control during deposition and monitoring of narrow bandpass filters...|$|R

40|$|The current effort {{investigates the}} {{nonlinear}} dynamic behaviour of ships on the horizontal plane, under {{the effect of}} strong wind and steep following/ <b>quartering</b> <b>waves.</b> As a first task, a mathematical model in 6 -DOF that contains modules for the effect of wind, waves, hull reaction including hydrodynamic memory, propeller and rudder has been developed. This mathematical model is the offspring of a manoeuvring perspective {{and it has been}} brought into such a form that can be utilised for bifurcation analysis and ship course stability assessment. A continuation analysis algorithm has then been interfaced effectively with the developed mathematical model. It {{is the first time that}} continuation analysis has been implemented in a multi-degree of freedom (6 -DOF) ship dynamics mathematical model that accounts also for fluid’s memory. Novel is also the investigation of the periodic ship motions through continuation analysis and in particular, the monitoring of their interactions with coexisting stationary states. The loci in parameters’ space of some of the system’s bifurcations points have also been traced. In this way the system’s stability boundaries can automatically be identified. The developed approach has been applied successfully to real ships in order to investigate their dynamic behaviour under environmental excitations. A ro-pax ship operating in strong wind and a fishing vessel operating in steep waves encountered from astern, have been examined and several response, bifurcation and stability diagrams have been produced. Comparisons with earlier existing response data of the second ship supported the validity of the current mathematical model. The identified bifurcations with focus on those originating from the horizontal plane, have been discussed in-depth and their role for generating instability has been clarified. Possibilities for alleviating the occurrence of these instabilities, mainly by employing operational practices, have been discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Tidally driven {{residual}} {{circulation in}} estuaries with lateral depth variation {{has been studied}} using-several 2 -D and 3 -D analytic models {{as well as a}} numerical model. Exchange flow is found to be correlated with the topography. The magnitude of this exchange flow mainly depends on four parameters: the ratio between the length of the estuary and the tidal wave-length, the ratio between the minimum depth on the shoal and the maximum depth in the channel, the ratio between the tidal amplitude at the mouth and the mean depth, and the ratio between the tidal time scale and the decay time scale due to friction. Generally, a net landward flow occurs over the shoals and is balanced by a return flow in the channel. The mean elevation shows a setup at the head. This produces a pressure gradient that drives the outward residual flow which is larger in the channel than on the shoals. The residual velocity is highly dependent on the length of the estuary. When the length of the estuary is about a <b>quarter</b> of the <b>wave</b> length, the magnitude of the residual velocity reaches its maximum. When the length of the estuary is much larger than a <b>quarter</b> of the <b>wave</b> length, the residual circulation approaches to a pattern in an infinite length estuary. For an estuary that is much shorter than a <b>quarter</b> of the <b>wave</b> length, the motion in the estuary is close to an inviscid standing wave in which the phase difference between the elevation and the longitudinal velocity is about 90 ∘. As a result, the surface Stokes transport is close to zero. The advective transport of vorticity is then dominant and the argument of Zimmerman (1981) applies. The resulting residual exchange flow is then landward in the channel and seaward on the shoal. ^ Results indicate that the magnitude of the tidally induced residual velocity in typical coastal plain estuaries with shallow shoals and deep channels can be comparable to the density driven flows. The present solutions can be used for development of numerical models and guidance for future field and laboratory studies. ...|$|R
