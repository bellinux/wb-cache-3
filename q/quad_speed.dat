50|$|In 1992, Crested Butte {{entered the}} high speed lift market, {{replacing}} the Silver Queen bubble double {{with a high}} <b>speed</b> <b>quad.</b> The quad services the same terrain as the old lift, but is aligned slightly differently so as to provide better access to the High Lift. It also provides access to terrain on all {{other parts of the}} mountain as well. Two years later, the Paradise double was replaced with another high <b>speed</b> <b>quad.</b> This quad provides access to intermediate trails in the Paradise Bowl, as well as access to the North Face.

The High Noon Express (#5) replaced a Doppelmayr triple chairlift {{that had}} been in use since 1979 and was the resort's 17th high <b>speed</b> <b>quad</b> to be built. The new quad improved capacity to the Sun Down and Sun Up Bowls, and reduced lengthy lines that the lift often received, especially on powder days. With the construction of the High Noon Express lift, all of Vail's terrain {{with the exception of the}} eastern edge of the Mongolia Bowl (only accessible by platter) was accessible from high <b>speed</b> <b>quads.</b> The High Noon Express lift was also meant to alleviate lines at the Northwoods Express lift by providing an alternative route for advanced and expert skiers finishing their time in Blue Sky Basin and the China Bowl to return to the Front Side.|$|R

50|$|The {{mountain}} is separated into three faces. The front side is primarily serviced by the Chair One high <b>speed</b> <b>quad</b> {{and has the}} most skiable terrain.

50|$|In 1985, Breckenridge {{expanded}} to Peak 10, {{with the opening}} of Lift F, a Poma fixed grip quad.

Runs on Peak 10 were named by mountain manager Jim Gill after World War II planes, like Crystal, Cimarron, Doublejack and Mustang. Also in 1986, the Colorado SuperChair was built on Peak 8, replacing Lift 1. The replacement lift ran a different alignment from its predecessor, running up the south side of Spruce and ending at the Vista Haus. With the addition of both the Colorado SuperChair and the Falcon SuperChair, each open peak had one high <b>speed</b> <b>quad</b> on it.
