2500|$|The [...] {{furnishings}} of the Contessa 32 cabin {{are typical}} of boats of her size and vintage. There is a V-shaped berth in the bow, followed by a small head (toilet) to port opposite a wet-locker and shower. The saloon (main cabin area) includes a folding table, with sofas that double as berths, the table lowering to convert the port berth to a double. At the aft end of the saloon next to the companionway, and to port, is a small U-shaped galley, consisting of a stove, sink (fed by an 18-gallon freshwater tank), and a counter. To starboard, there is a chart table, with a <b>quarter</b> <b>berth</b> extending aft of the navigators seat. An inboard marine diesel engine of 15 to 25 horsepower is mounted beneath the cockpit, fed by a 12-gallon fuel tank. Modern boats have a Beta Marine 20 or 25 horsepower engine with folding or feathering propellor, in conventional or hybrid configuration.|$|E
2500|$|These were in turn {{replaced}} by double-ended, screw-driven ferries in 1904. Both passenger and vehicle ferries operated on the Devonport run until {{the opening of}} the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959. Immediately after {{the opening of the}} bridge, passenger ferry services to other North Shore destinations (such as Northcote and Birkenhead) were cancelled, as were all vehicular ferries. The Devonport passenger ferry was retained on a much reduced timetable. The majority of the ferries were scrapped, only a handful being retained until being {{replaced by}} more modern vessels. The last of the old-style double-ended ferries, the diesel-engined Kestrel (built in 1905), was retired from the commuter run in 1988 and was then operated for cruises and sightseeing. In 2002 the Kestrel was moved to Tauranga to serve as a floating restaurant. The Kestrel changed hands again in 2010 and moved back to Auckland. [...] On 8 March 2016 the Kestrel broke up and sank while tethered in its Wynyard <b>Quarter</b> <b>berth.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} interior layouts were produced at the factory, with an even greater variety produced by home builders of the 400 kit boats sold. A typical layout will feature a galley and sizeable navigation station with a <b>quarter</b> <b>berth</b> aft, with two sofas or a sofa and dinette, a head and hanging locker, and a V-berth forwards. A common layout had pilot berths behind the settees. The quality of finish in the kit boats varies enormously, with some being well above factory standards.|$|E
50|$|Accommodation {{consists}} of a main saloon (two <b>quarter</b> <b>berths</b> and two settee berths) and a forward cabin containing a V-berth and (typically) a chemical toilet. A table {{on the port side}} dropped to form a single berth, making it possible, although crowded, to accommodate six overnight.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 1&2 {{which are}} almost {{identical}} - different builders, lower cabin, semi-enclosed cockpit, twin <b>quarter</b> <b>berths,</b> and a rudder that is located through the cockpit floor.

5000|$|Qualifying round {{held from}} 4 to 10 November at the venues [...] Chandrasekharan Nair Stadium, Thiruvananthapuram [...] and Municipal Corporation Stadium, Kozhikode. 28 teams participated in {{qualifying}} rounds for <b>Quarter</b> final <b>berth.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MK3 {{appeared}} in 1976 and was usually characterised {{by a single}} sleek tinted acrylic glass window {{on either side of}} the cabin. However the traditional windows of three per side was still available and could be specified if required.Two interior designs were available. The A is the racing version with the head between the forward bunks and a hanging locker in the main saloon for wet weather gear etc.The B is a full lock-up toilet version with a smallish but manageable compartment with toilet, hand basin etc., aimed at the small family cruising market. A single deep cockpit locker was provided on the port side which allowed for a good sized <b>quarter</b> <b>berth</b> on the starboard side.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} layout has {{two separate}} cabins plus a separate toilet compartment. The forward cabin contains a full-length V-berth. The main salon has a full-length settee on {{the starboard side}} with deep lockers above, below the deck. A <b>quarter</b> <b>berth</b> extends beneath the cockpit on the same side. On the port side is the galley with built-in two-burner spirit stove, a sink and a deep icebox beside the companionway. A folding table can be hinged from the centre board case with a short settee on the port side. An alternative layout would allow for two full-length settees and two quarter berths with the galley above the port side {{and the use of}} a portable icebox.|$|E

5000|$|Hirondelle Family - The Hirondelle Family {{was born}} {{as a result}} of a Hirondelle Mk III owner, David Trotter, and the {{original}} designer Chris Hammond, modifying the Mk III moulds. The most important differences were a wider beam (about 600mm extra), more freeboard (allowing more comfort in the cabin), the starboard forward berth was removed and replaced by a larger functional galley, the heads became much bigger and even able to sport a shower, the rudders were underslung (enabling [...] "sugar scoop" [...] transoms to be used), and windows were installed over the <b>quarter</b> <b>berths.</b> A major improvement in space was also achieved by the new bridge deck nacelle, which allowed more foot room at the central table.|$|R

5000|$|The T-10 is a sloop {{design with}} 7/8th {{fractional}} rig, symmetrical spinnaker, lead keel, aluminum mast and boom, and balsawood-cored fibreglass hull. It can sleep six (2 in V-berth, 2 in midship berths, and 2 in aft <b>quarter</b> <b>berths),</b> {{has a small}} sink, and a portable toilet. The Tartan Ten has a flush deck to facilitate deck movement during a race, and this is normally {{an easy way to}} identify the boat. The T-10 was designed primarily for racing in a local area (aka [...] "Daysailing"), but that doesn't stop sailors from racing the boat on long races as well. In 2006 twenty-five T-10s participated in the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, a popular 333-mile race along the length of Lake Michigan from Chicago, IL to Mackinac Island, MI. Heavily modified T10s have also competed in the Victoria to Maui and the Bermuda 1-2. Such races are beyond the design parameters of the craft.|$|R

50|$|From the {{companionway}} {{the galley}} is immediately to starboard, while a chart table over a drawer stack is to port. A wall separates the aft {{end of the}} galley from the cockpit sail locker. The galley is separated on its forward side from the main cabin by a low wall. Aft of the chart table is a <b>quarter</b> <b>berth.</b> Forward of the chart table and galley are two settees; the port settee is able to unfold into a double sleeping berth. Forward is a hanging locker to the starboard side and a head to the port side. The mast passes through the cabin roof at the aft-most point of the head. At the most forward section of the main cabin is door to the v-berth, master stateroom. This sleeping area contains a second hanging locker, plus an anchor locker door at the narrow end of the v-berth. The head has a door, sink with storage underneath, shower, and toilet. The galley has a sink, refrigerator or icebox, and a combined stove/oven.|$|E
50|$|The larger Phantom is a Bermudan rigged sloop, a cruiser racer {{designed}} by Nick Shein and built by Phantom Yachts in Sydney, Australia. Production commenced in 1979, ending {{in the mid}} 90's. Around about 100 phantoms were made, mostly 32 feet in length, however there were 33's 34's and around 6 40's made. The first four 32 foot hulls were manufactured by a spray gun laminator. Subsequent hulls were hand laid under the direct supervision of Nick Shein. Around 1989 the mould was altered to 33 feet in length, the 33 had slightly more beam, a sugar scoop stern and a wider aft <b>quarter</b> <b>berth.</b> The hulls were all manufactured to exceed standards laid down by Lloyds and USL code for GRP yachts. Phantom 32's had single or double inline spreaders, depending on customers preference. Draft was 1.6 Metres with a displacement of 4.25 t. The phantoms are capable of cicumnavigating (Mr Walker, a Phantom 32 did so in the late 80's) and can be sailed short handed.|$|E
25|$|Cooke {{featured}} {{in five of}} the Eastern Province Kings' seven matches in the 2015 Vodacom Cup. His side only won three of their matches to finish the season in fifth spot on the Southern Section log to miss out on a <b>quarter</b> final <b>berth.</b> He also played in four matches in the 2015 Currie Cup Premier Division as the EP Kings marginally improved on their 2014 showing, finishing in seventh position, having won two matches.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 he {{had surgery}} on his knee and {{finished}} the year strongly, following a <b>quarter</b> final <b>berth</b> in the Hawaiian pro with a runner-up spot to Triple Crown rival Joel Parkinson in the O'Neill World Cup. However his attempt to clinch a seventh Triple Crown was denied when he lost his Pipemasters place after arriving late for his heat. Some consolation would have come from his standout performance at the 'Quiksilver in memory of Eddie Aikau' big wave contest ("The Eddie"), in which he finished third.|$|R
50|$|Cowlishaw {{has been}} {{manager of the}} Kickers since 2000, during which time he coached the team to a Central Conference title in his debut year, two USL2 regular season titles in 2006 and 2007, three US Open Cup <b>quarter</b> final <b>berths</b> in 2001, 2004 and 2007, and two USL Second {{division}} championships, in 2006 and 2009. He is a two-time USL2 Coach of the Year nominee, helped guide the organization to four USL Organization of the Year awards (1995, 2000, 2006 and 2007), the Fair Play Award in 2004, and was named FieldTurf USL2 Coach of the Year in 2006.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Baba contains a lot of custom teak work. Some versions of the boat have the entire interior staved with teak. The cabin sole is made from teak planking separated with holly strips. It has a very spacious-feeling 6'4" [...] of headroom.Sleeping berths consist of a spacious V berth with good storage below {{and access to the}} chain locker via louvred doors, a full length berth in the main cabin {{on either side of the}} boat and on many models, a <b>quarter</b> <b>berth</b> on the aft starboard quarter, however in some models this was replaced by extra stowage.A small galley is built on the port aft side and opposite is a spacious chart table. Forward on the starboard side are the heads.The engine is mounted below the cabin companionway and is boxed in with a substantial teak housing. There are lockers and stowage areas all over the boat.The Baba 30 typically came with two separate water tanks which reside under the port and starboard berths, each holding about 100 ltrs (25 US Gal). However many variants of this tankage have been discovered on different Babas.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{included}} in the Falcons' senior squad for the 2013 Vodacom Cup and made his first class debut by starting their Round One 0-62 defeat to the [...] in Nelspruit. He also started their next match - as they bounced back to beat the [...] 27-22 in Kempton Park - and their Round Three match against the [...] in Potchefstroom, which saw Olivier score his first senior try halfway through the first half in a 16-47 defeat. He appeared as a replacement in their remaining four matches of the competition as they finished in seventh position on the Northern Section log to miss out on a <b>quarter</b> final <b>berth.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hirondelle Mk I - In {{general the}} Mk I's had a tall rig, with a mast {{in excess of}} 30 ft, and a high {{percentage}} of the boats were home completed. The interior layout usually comprises two generous single <b>quarter</b> <b>berths,</b> a large convertible double (cum table) on the bridgedeck and a single berth forward on the starboard side. To port in the bow is the heads - most boats were fitted with sea toilets and a small stowaway wash basin. The Mk I boat has twin daggerboards and lifting rudders, and the sail area was 250 sq ft or 330sq ft with the widely used 150% genoa. Hirondelle Mk II - The important difference between the Hirondelle Mk I and the Mk II was in the rig, with the Mk2 mast being a little under a metre shorter. Some minor interior changes appeared, and the cabin windows became slightly larger with a different shape. In the main the design remained as a safe comfortable family cruiser, with longer distance capability. Hirondelle Mk III - The major change in the Hirondelle Mk III was the introduction of fixed keels and rudders in place of daggerboards and lifting rudders. Although a greater draught made for less ability to ditch crawl the boat gained in strength and many believe it to be much stiffer under sail. More space was also a good point, and a hinged full size chart table was possible, as was a better galley layout. Water tanks could also be sited in the keels.|$|R
50|$|In September 1979, Sierra cruised one day behind Hurricane Frederic {{on her way}} to a {{shipyard}} in Mobile, Alabama, for an overhaul. The overhaul {{included the}} addition of female <b>berthing</b> <b>quarters</b> for the first female officers that began serving on the ship. During the first several months in drydock, her crew assisted the City of Mobile to help in cleanup and relief efforts after Hurricane Frederic.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Suzuki {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} at the Australian Open qualifying tournament in a match against Paul Capdeville and sat out most of the season as a result. He briefly returned to competitive tennis in May in a challenger tournament in South Korea and lost in the quarter finals. In October 2006, Suzuki played in his first International Series event of the year, the Japan Open Tennis Championships held in Tokyo, having received a wildcard into the main draw. Suzuki, ranked World No. 1078 at the time, won surprise victories over 8th seed Paradorn Srichaphan and World No. 126 Alexander Waske en route to his <b>quarter</b> finals <b>berth</b> against Federer. Suzuki once again lost to Federer in three tight sets, 6-4, 5-7, 6-7(3).|$|R
60|$|The {{officer who}} had {{previously}} taken them in charge now came forward and assigned them to their various sleeping places. This matter was readily arranged, {{for one of the}} main features of the cruiser Brooklyn is her commodious <b>berthing</b> <b>quarters,</b> there being two complete decks, running from end to end of the ship, for this purpose, also an extra forecastle, so that the vessel can accommodate a thousand men if required--a number nearly double that of her usual crew.|$|R
25|$|While in Staten Island, Intrepid {{underwent}} {{the next}} phase of her refurbishment, and received an $8million interior renovation. Never-before-seen areas of the ship including the forecastle (fo'c'sle, commonly known as the anchor chain room), general <b>berthing</b> <b>quarters</b> and the ship's machine shop were opened to the public for the first time. The hangar deck features a new layout and design including new interactive exhibits. Around 1,200 tons of her original weight in steel were removed and 339 epoxy-coated steel pilings ranging in length from 60 to 183 feet were installed. Intrepid also received a new coat of paint, using almost 7,000 gallons to re-paint the interior, hull, towers, and decks. Total cost of the renovation was $120million — $55million for the ship and $65million for Pier86.|$|R

5000|$|At {{approximately}} 0728 hours, as Oriskany {{was preparing}} to begin flight operations and stowing ordnance from night operations, an alarm was sounded for a fire in compartment A-107-M, a flare locker, containing over 250 MK-24 magnesium flares and 2.75 inch rocket warheads, located just off the forward hangar deck, adjacent to the Starboard sponson. A flare had inadvertently ignited, and the sailor handling the flare threw it into the locker and dogged the door shut. General quarters was sounded, and firefighting teams began to attempt to cool the area near the burning locker; because the high pressure within the locker {{made it impossible to}} open the locker door, fighting the fire directly was impossible. About 10 minutes into the fire, the pressure became so great that the doors blew out, igniting a helicopter located on the port side forward of the hangar deck. With the ship headed into the wind, getting ready to launch aircraft, the heat and smoke were drawn forward into the <b>berthing</b> <b>quarters</b> located forward of the hangar bay. Other sailors in the area worked to move aircraft, many of which were bomb and fuel laden, from the hangar to the flight deck to prevent them from catching fire. On deck six, in a pump room servicing the forward elevator, the sailor on duty attempted to close the large air vents servicing the compartment, which were starting to blow smoke in; unable to do so, he used wet rags to protect himself. Closer to the fire, sailors began attempting to evacuate [...] "officers' country", a series of staterooms occupied largely by pilots assigned to Oriskany's air wing.|$|R
