5|$|He {{articulated}} {{the principle of}} relativity. This was understood by Hermann Minkowski to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the principle of equivalence, general covariance and the principle of adiabatic invariance of the <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the quark model; for example, when the fifth quark was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth quark, which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E

5|$|The {{energy flux}} from Vega has been {{precisely}} measured against standard light sources. At 5480Å, the flux is 3,650Jy with an error margin of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega {{is dominated by}} absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal <b>quantum</b> <b>number.</b> The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted {{along the line of}} sight.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} the 2nd <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> (azimuthal <b>quantum</b> <b>number)</b> and the 4th <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> (spin <b>quantum</b> <b>number).</b> He also {{introduced the}} fine-structure constant and pioneered X-ray wave theory.|$|E
50|$|By convention, {{the flavor}} <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> (strangeness, charm, bottomness, and topness) carry the same sign as the {{electric}} {{charge of the}} particle. So, since the strange and bottom quarks have a negative charge, they have flavor <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> equal to −1. And since the charm and top quarks have positive electric charge, their flavor <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are +1.|$|R

25|$|The old {{quantum theory}} was {{formulated}} by equating the <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> {{of a system}} with its classical adiabatic invariant. This determined {{the form of the}} Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule: the <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> is the area in phase space of the classical orbit.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the {{electrons}} are arranged into {{a sequence of}} groups in order of increasing principal <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> n, and for equal n in order of increasing azimuthal <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> l, except that s- and p- orbitals are kept together.|$|E

50|$|Glueballs are {{predicted}} by quantum chromodynamics to be massive, notwithstanding {{the fact that}} gluons themselves have zero rest mass in the Standard Model. Glueballs with all four possible combinations of <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> P (parity) and C (c-parity) for every possible total angular momentum have been considered, producing at least fifteen possible glueball states including excited glueball states that share the same <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> but have differing masses with the lightest states having masses as low as 1.4 GeV/c2 (for a glueball with <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> J=0, P=+, C=+), and the heaviest states having masses as great as almost 5 GeV/c2 (for a glueball with <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> J=0, P=+, C=-).|$|R
25|$|Quantum {{states that}} give unitary {{representations}} of time reversal, i.e., have T2=1, {{are characterized by}} a multiplicative <b>quantum</b> <b>number,</b> sometimes called the T-parity.|$|E
25|$|Each {{electron}} {{also has}} a spin <b>quantum</b> <b>number,</b> s, which describes the spin of each electron (spin up or spin down). The number s can be + or −.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, an {{adiabatic}} {{change is}} one that occurs at a rate much slower than the difference in frequency between energy eigenstates. In this case, the energy states of the system do not make transitions, so that the <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> is an adiabatic invariant.|$|E
50|$|A minor {{but often}} {{confusing}} point is as follows: most conserved <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are additive, so in an elementary particle reaction, {{the sum of}} the <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> should be the same before and after the reaction. However, some, usually called a parity, are multiplicative; i.e., their product is conserved. All multiplicative <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> belong to a symmetry (like parity) in which applying the symmetry transformation twice is equivalent to doing nothing (involution).|$|R
5000|$|For {{internal}} <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers,</b> see Flavour (particle physics).Quantum numbers describe {{values of}} conserved quantities in {{the dynamics of}} a quantum system. In the case of electrons, the <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> {{can be defined as}} [...] "the sets of numerical values which give acceptable solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen atom". An important aspect of quantum mechanics is the quantization of observable quantities, since <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are discrete sets of integers or half-integers, although they could approach infinity in some cases. This distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics where the values that characterize the system such as mass, charge, or momentum, range continuously. <b>Quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> often describe specifically the energy levels of electrons in atoms, but other possibilities include angular momentum, spin, etc. Any quantum system can have one or more quantum numbers; it is thus difficult to list all possible <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The photon is {{the gauge}} boson for electromagnetism, and {{therefore}} all other <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> of the photon (such as lepton number, baryon <b>number,</b> and flavour <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers)</b> are zero. Also, the photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|R
25|$|A kaon is {{any one of}} a {{group of}} four mesons {{distinguished}} by the fact that they carry a <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> called strangeness. It was first discovered by Leon Lederman and a group of scientists from Columbia University at Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{note that}} the winding number is closely related with the (2+1)-dimensional {{continuous}} Heisenberg ferromagnet equations and its integrable extensions: the Ishimori equation etc. Solutions of the last equations are classified by the winding number or topological charge (topological invariant and/or topological <b>quantum</b> <b>number).</b>|$|E
25|$|Because the lepton number {{conservation}} law {{in fact is}} {{violated by}} chiral anomalies, there are problems applying this symmetry universally over all energy scales. However, the <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> B − L {{is much more likely}} to work and is seen in different models such as the Pati–Salam model.|$|E
5000|$|... j and mj, {{together}} with the parity of the quantum state, replace the three <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> ℓ, mℓ and ms (the projection of the spin along the specified axis). The former <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> {{can be related to}} the latter.|$|R
5000|$|If P = (−1)J, then {{it follows}} that S = 1, thus PC= 1. States with these <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are called natural parity states; while all other <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are thus called exotic (for example the state JPC [...] 0−−).|$|R
40|$|Topological <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> are {{distinguished}} from <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> based on symmetry {{because they are}} insensitive to the imperfections of the systems {{in which they are}} observed. They have become very important in precision measurements in recent years, and provide the best measurements of voltage and electrical resistance. This book describes the theory of such <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers,</b> starting with Dirac's argument for the quantization of electric charge, and continuing with discussions on the helium superfluids, flux quantization and the Josephson effect in superconductors, the quantum Hall effect...|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} important or fundamental IR bands arise from the excitations of normal modes, the simplest distortions of the molecule, from the ground state with vibrational <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> v = 0 to the first excited state with vibrational <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> v = 1. In some cases, overtone bands are observed. An overtone band arises from the absorption of a photon leading to a direct transition from the ground state to the second excited vibrational state (v = 2). Such a band appears at approximately twice {{the energy of the}} fundamental band for the same normal mode. Some excitations, so-called combination modes, involve simultaneous excitation of more than one normal mode. The phenomenon of Fermi resonance can arise when two modes are similar in energy; Fermi resonance results in an unexpected shift in energy and intensity of the bands etc.|$|E
25|$|As a consequence, {{the quantum}} state of a {{particle}} with spin {{is described by}} a vector-valued wave function with values in C2S+1. Equivalently, it is represented by a complex-valued function of four variables: one discrete <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> variable (for the spin) {{is added to the}} usual three continuous variables (for the position in space).|$|E
25|$|In {{nuclear physics}} and {{particle}} physics, isospin (isotopic spin, isobaric spin) is a <b>quantum</b> <b>number</b> {{related to the}} strong interaction. Particles that are affected equally by the strong force but have different charges (e.g. protons and neutrons) can be treated as being different states of the same particle with isospin values related {{to the number of}} charge states.|$|E
50|$|Spin <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> {{may take}} half-integer values.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} are flavor <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers</b> {{such as the}} isospin, strangeness, charm, and so on. The strong interactions binding the quarks {{together are}} insensitive to these <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers,</b> so variation of them leads to systematic mass and coupling relationships among the hadrons in the same flavor multiplet.|$|R
25|$|The Pauli {{exclusion}} principle states that no two electrons in an atom {{can have the}} same values of all four <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers.</b> If there are two electrons in an orbital with given values for three <b>quantum</b> <b>numbers,</b> (n, l, m), these two electrons must differ in their spin.|$|R
