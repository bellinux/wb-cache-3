5|$|It was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> a glass {{dispersive}} prism was {{not suitable}} {{for use in the}} ultraviolet spectrum. Glass absorbed electromagnetic radiation below 400 millimicrons rather than dispersing it. In the Model B, a quartz prism was substituted for the earlier glass.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|The final major {{campaign}} {{in which the}} PanzerI formed {{a large portion of}} the armoured strength was Operation Barbarossa, 22June 1941. The 3,300 German tanks included about 410 PanzerI's. By the end of the month, {{a large portion of the}} Red Army found itself trapped in the Minsk pocket, and by 21September Kiev had fallen, thereby allowing the Germans to concentrate on their ultimate objective, Moscow. Despite the success of Germany's armour in the Soviet Union, between June and September most German officers were shocked to find their tanks were inferior to newer Soviet models, the T-34 and KV series. Army Group North <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> none of the tank guns currently in use by German armor could penetrate the thick armour of the KV-1. The performance of the Red Army during the Battle of Moscow and the growing numbers of new Soviet tanks made it obvious the PanzerI was not suitable for this front. Some less battle-worthy PanzerIs were tasked with towing lorries through mud to alleviate logistics problems at the front.|$|E

After his initial disappointment from his Frobisher rejection Dixon, with the encouragement of his father, enrolled in the Greensboro Law School in Greensboro, North Carolina. An excellent student, Dixon received his law degree in 1885.|$|E
25|$|In Moscow, {{experimental}} transmissions {{of electronic}} television {{took place on}} March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by RCA. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940.|$|E
25|$|Taken utterly by surprise, Callao's crew {{at first}} mistook the American ships for Montojo's {{squadron}} and the gunfire for target practice by Montojo's ships, but <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{they were under}} attack and hopelessly outgunned. They struck their colors and surrendered to Raleigh. They were quickly paroled ashore at Cavite, and it was later rumored that the commanding officer of Callao {{was sentenced to death}} by Spanish authorities for not fighting back against the American ships.|$|E

25|$|The {{aforementioned}} submarines were {{an attempt}} to gain an edge over the Greek navy (which had only one Nordenfelt submarine, a smaller and older version). However, it was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> – like the other Nordenfelt submarines ordered by Russia – they suffered from stability problems and were too easy to swamp on the surface. The Turks {{could not find a}} crew that was willing to serve on the primitive submarines. Abdül Hamid ended up rotting at dock, while Abdül Mecid was never fully completed.|$|E
25|$|FitzRoy <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he did {{not have}} the {{resources}} to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy's Governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then Governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied.|$|E

25|$|In December 1979, In-Sakhan, {{another former}} officer from FANK {{who had been}} living on the border since 1975, {{declared}} himself leader of Nong Samet. He <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{the size of the}} camp's civilian population would determine his power base, and encouraged a thriving border marketplace from which smugglers brought high-demand commodities into deprived Kampuchea. Within a short time Nong Samet's market attracted thousands of traders and black marketeers, and the guides and guards needed to transport goods and cash in this nearly lawless region. Gold and precious stones often substituted for currency on the border, and In-Sakhan's soldiers frequently served as security escorts.|$|E
25|$|The Bank of Toronto and Dominion Bank {{emerged from}} the war in 1945 {{stronger}} than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position {{to take advantage of the}} opportunities of the post-war economy.|$|E
25|$|With {{the energy}} sector {{employing}} {{a huge number of}} Calgarians, the fallout from the economic slump of the early 1980s was significant, and the unemployment rate soared. By the end of the decade, however, the economy was in recovery. Calgary <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> it could not afford to put so much emphasis on oil and gas, and the city has since become much more diverse, both economically and culturally. The period during this recession marked Calgary's transition from a mid-sized and relatively nondescript prairie city into a major cosmopolitan and diverse centre. This transition culminated in the city hosting Canada's first Winter Olympics in 1988. The success of these Games essentially put the city on the world stage.|$|E

25|$|In a {{three-way}} conversation, Tafoya talked and translated between Parker and Nolan. The goals {{of all parties}} were different. Tafoya's and Parker's goal {{were the most important}} to them. And despite a history of hostility between them, Tafoya apparently agreed to mislead the soldiers for the return of his stock plus interest. He deliberately translated parts of the conversation wrong to Nolan. Somehow through the three-way conversation and translations, Nolan <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> some type of deal was made between Parker and the half-breed Tafoya. At that point Nolan began to lose critical trust in his primary trail guide. And later his trust in the hunters faltered. And maybe, the men who witnessed Nolan's tirade faltered in their own trust of their commander.|$|E
25|$|Temple {{had already}} {{appeared}} in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson {{was signed by}} 20th Century Fox, {{it was decided that}} he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching her practice his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.|$|E
25|$|The years {{leading up}} to, during, {{and after the}} 1988 Seoul Olympics {{played a major role}} in the {{development}} of North Korea. In 1981, Seoul was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea. This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the International Olympic Committee to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and Pyongyang. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.|$|E

This characteristic may come from the background that Koreans traditionally kept their pet dogs outside their houses.|$|R
25|$|Canada {{was later}} in {{granting}} this permission {{than the rest}} of the Commonwealth. The British Mechanized Transport Corps had begun to see the women of Canada as a great asset to the war effort, and began to look into the recruitment of these women for their purposes. In June 1941, they were officially given permission to recruit women in Canada for overseas duty. It quickly became apparent that it would look very odd for the British to be recruiting in Canada when, no there was no corresponding Canadian service. However, many of the women who were active in the various volunteer corps did not meet the requirements to be enlisted women. The majority of these women were older than the accepted age, would not pass the fitness test, or had physical or medical impairments. It was <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the women needed had jobs and were not free to join.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{electrons}} were {{understood to}} be charged particles of matter; the wave nature of electrons was not fully realized until {{the publication of the}} De Broglie hypothesis in 1927. The research group was unaware of this publication until 1932, when they <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the De Broglie wavelength of electrons was many orders of magnitude smaller than that for light, theoretically allowing for imaging at atomic scales. In April 1932, Ruska suggested {{the construction of a new}} electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful diffraction and normal imaging of an aluminium sheet was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy. Magnifications higher than those available with a light microscope were achieved in September 1933 with images of cotton fibers quickly acquired before being damaged by the electron beam.|$|E
25|$|When the Spanish War Memorial Committee's Committee on Estimates and Designs {{considered}} {{the nature of}} the memorial, it <b>quickly</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the number of dead was too numerous to list their names on a tablet. A memorial book listing the names of the dead was more appropriate, so the Spanish War Memorial Committee established a second subcommittee, the Record Book Committee, to produce this volume. Esther Gill Jackson of Maryland was appointed chair of this subcommittee. Rosa Wright Smith of Washington, D.C., the society's Assistant National Secretary, was assigned to aid her. Jackson sent hundreds of letters to state militia commanders, requesting complete lists of the name, rank, and home towns of those in state militia and volunteer regiments who died in the war. Complete lists of U.S. Army and U.S. Navy dead were obtained from General Henry Clarke Corbin, Adjutant General of the Army, and Rear Admiral Presley Marion Rixey, Surgeon General of the Navy.|$|E
