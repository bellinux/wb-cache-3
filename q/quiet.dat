50|$|Acoustic <b>quieting</b> is {{the process}} of making {{machinery}} <b>quieter</b> by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. Machinery vibrates, causing sound waves in air, hydroacoustic waves in water, and mechanical stresses in solid matter. <b>Quieting</b> is achieved by absorbing the vibrational energy or minimizing the source of the vibration. It may also be redirected away from the observer.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel <b>quiet</b> hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving <b>quiet</b> hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, since {{aviation}} noise {{became a}} public {{issue in the}} late 1960s, governments have enacted legislative controls. Aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators have developed <b>quieter</b> aircraft and better operating procedures. Modern high-bypass turbofan engines, for example, are <b>quieter</b> than the turbojets and low-bypass turbofans of the 1960s. First, FAA Aircraft Certification achieved noise reductions classified as [...] "Stage 3" [...] aircraft; which has been upgraded to [...] "Stage 4" [...] noise certification resulting in <b>quieter</b> aircraft. This has resulted in lower noise exposures in spite of increased traffic growth and popularity.|$|R
