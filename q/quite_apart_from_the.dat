500|$|According to Nicholson, Agharta {{and other}} jazz-rock {{recordings}} such as Emergency! (1970) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward [...] "a whole new musical language... a wholly independent genre <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sound and conventions {{of anything that}} had gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, he said, although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It {{became one of the}} favorite albums for English musician Richard Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. [...] "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told The Quietus. Along with On the Corner, it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication. In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences [...] "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the [...] "fringes of jazz" [...] and a place most other music has not explored since. In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album to be inarguably the [...] "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" [...] and declared [...] "there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{recurrent}} accusation levelled {{against the}} Irish throughout the Middle Ages {{is that they}} were Judaizers, {{which is to say that}} they observed certain religious rites after the manner of the Jews. The belief that Irish Christians were Judaizers can be observed in three main areas: the Easter Controversy, the notion that the Irish practiced obsolete laws from the Old Testament and (not unrelated to this) the view that they adhered too closely to the Old Testament. <b>Quite</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> intricate theological concerns that underpinned the debate over Easter in early 7th-century Gaul, Columbanus also found himself accused of Quartodecimanism, a heresy whose central tenet was observing Easter on the same date as the eve of the Jewish Passover, namely the fourteenth day of the Jewish lunar month of Nisan. Although this false accusation was raised at a time of heightened political tensions between Columbanus and the Gallic bishops, some historians have cautioned that it ought not be dismissed as a mere ruse because the Gauls may have been genuinely worried about blurring the boundaries between Gallic Christians and their Jewish neighbours. That the Irish practiced obsolete Old Testament laws is another accusation that repeats itself a number of times in the early Middle Ages, most famously in the case of the 8th-century Irish charismatic preacher, Clement Scotus I (fl. 745), who was condemned as a heretic, in part for urging followers to follow Old Testament law in such controversial matters as obliging a man to marry his widowed sister-in-law upon his brotherâ€™s death. And finally, a good example for the Irish tendency to adhere closely to the Old Testament is the Hibernensis, a late 7th- or early 8th-century Irish canon law collection which was the first text of church law to draw heavily on the bible, and in particular the Old Testament, at a time when Christians were meant to be [...] "dead to the old law" [...] (...)

[...] However, the British authorities, overnight, imprisoned the entire senior leadership of the Congress, retaining them in prison for nearly two years. [...] Without its leadership, the movement evolved into a grassroots one which took to sabotaging factories, bridges, telegraph- and railway lines, and government property, including post-offices and police stations, and otherwise threatening the British Raj's machinery of control over India, as well as its war enterprise. [...] In response, the Rajâ€”deploying 52 army battalions, most of which were composed of British nationals or Gurkhasâ€”forcefully and rapidly suppressed the movement, arresting tens of thousands of Indians, killing some 2,500, publicly flogging many and occasionally torturing some, torching entire villages, and patrolling some affected areas with air force bombers. [...] The centers of major conflagrations were Bihar, eastern UP, and Bombay. In some other regions of India, such as Bengal, Orissa, and Gujarat, the movement was less intense but more prolonged. [...] For a short time, disruption of communications in Bihar had the effect of isolating Assam and Bengal from the rest of India. [...] In Great Britain, the Labour Party, a supporter of decolonization in India, turned against the Quit India movement, as the latter was seen impeding the war against fascism; the Conservatives, according to historian D.

Accretions within syphons could drastically reduce flow rates, due to the already narrow diameter of their pipes.
