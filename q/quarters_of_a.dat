5|$|Although St. Gatien {{was entered}} in the Cambridgeshire Handicap at the next Newmarket meeting, {{he would have been}} {{required}} to carry 139 pounds, and his connections decided not to run, instead targeting the ten furlong Free Handicap at the same meeting on October 22. He started odds-on favourite and successfully conceded three pounds to Duke of Richmond, winning comfortably by three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> length. On his final start of the year he won at Newmarket for the third time when taking the Jockey Club Cup.|$|E
5|$|In August Fantastic Light {{recorded}} his first win at Group Two level {{as he led}} three furlongs out and ran on to win a strongly contested Great Voltigeur Stakes from Bienamado (Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes, San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap) and the future St Leger winner Mutafaweq. A month later, he won a third important race by holding off the 1998 Epsom Derby winner High-Rise by three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> length in the Listed Arc Trial at Newbury.|$|E
5|$|La Cotte de St Brelade is a Palaeolithic site {{inhabited}} before {{rising sea}} levels transformed Jersey into an island. Jersey was a centre of Neolithic activity, {{as demonstrated by}} the concentration of dolmens. Evidence of Bronze Age and early Iron Age settlements can be found in many locations around the island. In June 2012 it was announced what could be Europe's largest hoard of Iron Age coins had been found in Grouville by two persons using metal detectors. The hoard may be worth up to £10 M. People had been searching for this treasure for 30 years. It was reported that the hoard weighed about three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tonne and could contain up to 50,000 Roman and Celtic coins. In 2012 the same two men had found 60 Iron Age coins in the same area.|$|E

5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second choice on 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on April 22, 1910. The production was a split reel, containing both Her Battle for Existence and Sand Man's Cure, with an estimated length of 1000 feet. The American Film Institute refers more specifically to the entire reel being 998 feet in length, but does not distinguish between the lengths of the productions. A Thanhouser Filmography Analysis, provided by Thanhouser Company Film Preservation, lists the film as comprising three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reel - approximately 750 feet. The reasoning is not provided, but the previous release and the next to follow were split reels of similar lengths. Billboard would not identify the film as a split release or give the length for this and the other Thanhouser split reel that followed.|$|E
5|$|Porter ran Orme {{in a trial}} {{four days}} before the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park as preparation. He raced against his five-year-old {{half-brother}} Blue Green and the six-year-old Ormuz. Despite conceding weight to both of them, he won by the trial by two lengths from Ormuz. In the Eclipse he faced six rivals and started the 5/4 favourite, with Sussex Stakes winner Orvieto next in the betting at 11/4. During the race Orme was ridden {{in the middle of the}} field. As they turned into the finishing straight, Orme and Orvieto were close behind the two leaders; the two then took over the lead in the straight. As they neared the finish, Orvieto had a slight advantage, but as Barrett asked Orme for an effort, he responded and got in front to win by a neck from Orvieto, with St. Damien finishing only three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> length behind Orvieto. The race was worth over £9000. Twelve days later Orme lined up as the 1/5 favourite for the Sussex Stakes. In the last few furlongs he battled with Watercress, and it was not until 50 yards from the finish that he came out on top, going on to win by a head from Watercress.|$|E

5|$|The {{sixth and}} first killer tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 3:10a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30ft {{down the driveway}} of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} he faced Sir Hugo, Orvieto, El Diablo and Frank Marsh in the Limekiln Stakes at the Newmarket Houghton meeting. Orme started the 4/5 favourite, and with two furlongs to run he {{strode into the}} lead. Without even being asked for an effort, he won easily by three lengths from El Diablo, with Sir Hugo in third. The next day he won the Subscription Stakes easily from Porridge, after leading from the start and never being caught. He raced again the next day, his third race in as many days, in a Free Handicap Sweepstakes over ten furlongs where he faced five opponents. Orme started as the 4/6 favourite, Bushey Park was at 5/1. Next in the betting came El Diablo, The Lover and Therapia all priced at 100/12. Bushey Park led {{in the early stages}} until Orme went into the lead with about two furlongs left to run. El Diablo overtook Orme in the final 100 yards and beat him by one and a half lengths. The Lover {{finished}} in third place, three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> length behind Orme. Orme had to carry 16 pounds more weight than El Diablo and 22 pounds more than The Lover.|$|E

25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wavelength.|$|R

25|$|Oxygen {{is unusual}} {{in terms of its}} return to ground state: it can take three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or {{molecules}} absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.|$|E
