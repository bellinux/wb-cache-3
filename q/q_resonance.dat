30|$|Photonic {{integrated}} circuits (PICs) have made remarkable {{progress in the}} past few decades with the development of applications in the fields of optical communication, sensing, and imaging [1, 2]. Currently, considerable attention is being paid to downscale and reduce the power consumption of photonic devices to produce advanced PICs. Si photonics is deemed to be a promising solution for future high-speed on/off-chip optical interconnections. Typical Si waveguide modulators leverage electrically altering either the refractive or the absorptive properties of a material to modulate the transmission of light through a device. Due to the weak plasma dispersion effect of Si and the diffraction limit of the Si waveguides, the Si MZI modulators suffer from large footprints of ~[*] 103 – 104  μm 2. The ring modulators with high <b>Q</b> <b>resonance</b> typically have more compact footprints of ~[*] 102 – 103  μm 2 but lower optical bandwidth and tend to be more sensitive to temperature variation.

Alternatively, fully CMOS-compatible slot modulators or plasmonic modulators using Si as an active material are demonstrated recently [4, 5], and the high localization of a light field in the modulator can be achieved. However, the performance of the Si-based plasmonic modulator is still limited due to the small free carrier dispersion effect in Si layer (waveguide/structure).|$|E

Also, the structure has higher Q-factor resonances in the wavelength range between 600 - 1200 nm. Within this range, strong light emission from a-SiOx defect-related radiative centers and emission from the Er 3 + optical transition 4 I 11 / 2 - 4 I 15 / 2 (980 nm) are observed. A two-fold improvement in photoluminescence (PL) intensity is achieved in the wavelength range between 800 - 1000 nm. The PL intensity in the wavelength range between 1400 - 1700 nm (region of Er 3 + 4 I 13 / 2 - 4 I 15 / 2 transition) is increased four times. This later higher intensity enhancement is apparently caused by optical pumping at 980 nm, higher Q-factor, with subsequent emission from the 4 I 13 / 2 level in the low <b>Q</b> <b>resonance</b> at 1540 nm. Further five times emission enhancement is obtained after optimized temperature annealing.

40|$|We {{study the}} manifestly exotic tetraquark D ++ s 0 (cu ¯s ¯ d) and the scalar tetraquark f 0 (udū ¯ d) in SU(3) c {{anisotropic}} quenched lattice QCD. We adopt the O(a) -improved Wilson (clover) fermion at β = 5. 75 on 12 3 × 96 with renormalized anisotropy as/at = 4, and investigate the correlator of the four-quark (4 Q) system, cu ¯s ¯ d, with various quark masses including the idealized SU(4) f case. For f 0 (udū ¯ d) etc., we only consider connected diagrams at the quenched level, i. e., the tetraquark f 0 (udūd) ¯ is identical with D ++ s 0 (cu ¯s d) ¯ in the idealized SU(4) f case. First, for comparison, we study the lowest q ¯q scalar meson, {{and find that}} it has a large mass of about 1. 37 GeV after chiral extrapolation, which corresponds to f 0 (1370). Second, we investigate the lowest 4 Q state in the spatial periodic boundary condition, and find that it is just a scattering state of two pseudoscalar mesons, as is expected. Third, to extract spatially-localized 4 <b>Q</b> <b>resonances,</b> we use the Hybrid Boundary Condition (HBC) method, where anti-periodic and periodic boundary conditions are imposed on quarks (c,u) and antiquarks (¯s, ¯ d), respectively. By applying the HBC on a finitevolume lattice, the threshold of the two-meson scattering state is raised up, while the mass of...|$|R
