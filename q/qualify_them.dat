5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century German {{immigrants}} brought with them Riesling vines, named Johannisberg Riesling to <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> as “legitimate” German Riesling. New York, particularly in the Finger Lakes region, was one of the earliest U.S. producers of Riesling. Plantings started to appear in California by 1857 and followed in Washington State in 1871.|$|E
5|$|The mid-season, non-conference {{game was}} the first meeting between the two teams; both came into the game with highly rated offenses and poorly rated defenses. Before the game the Midshipmen had a 5–4 record, most {{recently}} defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish to break a streak of 43 consecutive losses to that team. Another win would <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for a bowl game. The Mean Green held a 1–7 record, and could not become bowl eligible by winning its remaining games, but the team's offense had improved {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

5|$|In two warm-up matches {{ahead of}} the World Cup in Australia, Poulton made 24 and 49 against England and Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, she was {{left out of the}} team for the opening match against New Zealand, which Australia lost. Poulton was {{recalled}} for the two remaining group matches against South Africa and the West Indies. The hosts won both matches to reach the next round, but Poulton struggled. Playing out of position in the middle-order, she made nine from 21 balls against South Africa in her home town of Newcastle; restored {{to the top of the}} order, she made a duck against the West Indies. Poulton was then dropped for Australia's first match of the next phase against India, which they lost. She was recalled for the next match and scored 47 against Pakistan, putting on 100 for the first wicket with Shelley Nitschke before the latter was bowled. Poulton was then bowled herself, the third time in as many ODIs that she had been dismissed in such a manner. Australia reached 6/229 in their 50 overs, and Poulton then took 2/9, claiming the lower-order wickets of Javeria Khan and Qanita Jalil as the hosts won by 107 runs. She then hit 38 from 47 balls, including a six, in the final Super Six match against England. This helped set up Australia's successful run-chase but it was not enough to rank them among the top two nations and <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for the final. They faced India in the playoff for third place and Poulton was bowled by Jhulan Goswami for a duck. The hosts were all out for 142 and India reached the target with three wickets in hand. Poulton ended her campaign with 94 runs at 18.80 and took a total of 2/17 from five overs.|$|E

25|$|HMS Active was a Royal Navy fifth-rate frigate {{launched}} on 14 December 1799 at Chatham Dockyard. Sir John Henslow designed {{her as an}} improvement on the Artois-class frigates. She served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, capturing numerous enemy vessels. Her crews participated in one campaign and three actions that would later <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for the Naval General Service Medal. She returned to service after the wars and finally was broken up in 1860.|$|E
25|$|In a {{class of}} algebras defined as all the models {{of a set of}} {{equations}}, it is usually the case that some algebras of the class satisfy more equations than just those needed to <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for the class. The class of Boolean algebras is unusual in that, with a single exception, every Boolean algebra satisfies exactly the Boolean identities and no more. The exception is the one-element Boolean algebra, which necessarily satisfies every equation, even x= y, and is therefore sometimes referred to as the inconsistent Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|The Cayman Islands gained {{associate}} {{membership of}} the ICC in 2002, {{a year in which}} they finished third in the Americas Championship in Buenos Aires, Argentina after recording wins against Argentina, the Bahamas and Bermuda. The 2004 Americas Championship served as a qualifying competition for the 2005 ICC Trophy, and a repeat of their third-place finish from 2002 would have qualified them for that tournament. Wins against Argentina and the Bahamas meant they could only finish fourth however. This did <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for a place in a repêchage tournament in early 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They finished fifth in that tournament after beating Kuwait in a play-off match.|$|E

The opening game of the 2015–16 Danish Superliga ended in a 2–1 away win for FCK against Esbjerg fB through goals from Marvin Pourié and Nicolai Jørgensen. Despite a 0–1 away win over Baumit Jablonec, Copenhagen lost its home game 2–3, resulting in a 3–3 aggregate loss on the away goals rule. This {{marked the first time}} in ten years that Copenhagen failed to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League.

25|$|In the 1986–87 NBA season, Jordan {{continued}} his {{assault on the}} record books, leading the league in scoring with 37.1 points per game and becoming the first Bull named to the All-NBA First Team. The Bulls finished 40–42, which {{was good enough to}} <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for the playoffs. However, they were again swept by the Celtics in the playoffs. In the 1987 draft, to address their lack of depth, Krause selected center Olden Polynice eighth overall and power forward Horace Grant 10th overall, then sent Polynice to Seattle in a draft-day trade for the fifth selection, small forward Scottie Pippen. With Paxson and Jordan in the backcourt, Brad Sellers and Oakley at the forward spots, Corzine anchoring center, and rookies Pippen and Grant coming off the bench, the Bulls won 50 games and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, where they were beaten by the eventual Eastern Conference Champions Detroit Pistons in five games. For his efforts, Jordan was named NBA Most Valuable Player, an award he would win four more times over his career. The 1987–88 season would also mark the start of the Pistons-Bulls rivalry which was formed from 1988 to 1991.|$|E

25|$|Nitschke {{started the}} 2007–08 WNCL season by taking two wickets and being run out {{in each of}} the two matches against New South Wales. She then went wicketless in both matches against Queensland while conceding 2.64 runs per over. Up to this point Nitschke had made only 71 runs and South Australia had only won one of their four matches. In the next match, Nitschke took 2/17 from six overs and top-scored with 61 in a seven-wicket win over Western Australia. In the {{penultimate}} round-robin match, she hit 74 and took 2/31 in a 140-run win over Victoria. Although South Australia succumbed to the same team the next day, they had won four of their eight matches, and this was enough to <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> in second place for the final against New South Wales. However, inclement weather washed out the final entirely and New South Wales were awarded the WNCL for placing first in the round-robin phase. Nitschke ended the series with 250 runs at 31.25 and took ten wickets at 25.20 at an economy rate of 3.64. In two T20 matches for her state, Nitschke made 24 runs at 12.00 and totalled 2/34 from six overs.|$|E

Following on from the heartbreak of losing the Grand final in 2016, the club went from strength to strength recruiting well in the off season and dominated the 2017 NRL season to finish in first place earning them their third legitimate minor premiership. The Storm won 20 and lost 4 games throughout the season making it their most dominant season in 10 years. Cameron Smith also broke a number of league, club and personal records throughout the 2017 season including the NRL games record for the most games played, league record for the most wins as a captain, a personal best for the most points in a game and also scored his 2000th career point and 1000th career goal, the first time any player has achieved this. The Storm continued their success into the 2017 NRL finals and won their first two, a home Qualifying final against the Parramatta Eels 18-16 and a home Preliminary Final against Brisbane Broncos 30-0 to <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> for their second consecutive Grand Final. The 2017 NRL Grand Final was played against the North Queensland Cowboys, which Melbourne Storm dominated to earn them their 3rd official Premiership 34 - 6.

500|$|The {{stories in}} Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories, {{but they were}} only {{occasionally}} science fiction, as {{in many cases the}} science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, [...] "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by Arthur B. Reeve, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. [...] The murderer in [...] "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is [...] "The Perfect Counterfeit" [...] by Captain S.P. Meek, in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money. [...] Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, The Bishop Murder Case, began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since the hardcover edition of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. [...] It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would <b>qualify</b> <b>them</b> as science fiction. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science: most of Scientific Detective Monthlys contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. [...] The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.|$|E
