METHODS: Contrast was injected twice during each of 10 provocations to 30 patients screened for PFO. Injections were given during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration,</b> early Valsalva (starting 3 - 5 seconds before injection), late Valsalva (starting 3 - 5 seconds after injection), Mueller maneuver, coughing, bed tilt during early Valsalva, after nitroglycerin spray during both <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration,</b> and early Valsalva. RESULTS: The number of detected PFOs increased {{as the number of}} injections increased (r = 0. 79, P <. 01). Five injections per patient detected all 11 large PFOs. To eventually detect all 14 PFOs among the 30 study patients required a total of 11 injections per patient. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity for PFO detection increased when additional contrast injections were given. At least 5 injections are required to safely detect or rule out the presence of a PFO...|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{attention}} {{has recently been}} fo-cused on the mechanical factors in respiration of normal adults and of those with respiratory ab-normalities. This report presents observations on the mechanics of respiration in 23 normal newborn infants and 2 infants critically ill with-neonatal respiratory distress. The data are derived from simultaneous measurements of tidal volume and intraesophageal pressure changes. MATERIAL AND METHODS The infants, {{all of whom were}} born at the Boston Lying-in Hospital, weighed from 2. 4 to 3. 8 Kg. at birth and were from 1 hour to 7 days old at the time of study. History, physical examination and, in most cases, chest x-rays were used to determine presence or absence of respiratory distress. On the basis of observation and previously established criteria (1), 18 of the normal infants were considered to have been studied during periods of <b>quiet,</b> resting <b>respiration.</b> In all, 47 studies were made on 28 5 newborn infants ranging from the 18 infants breathing quietly to those who were sick or disturbed by the procedure. The respiratory rates varied from 24 to 136 per minute. The two infants studied when critically ill and during recovery were diagnosed as having the neonatal respira-tory distress syndrome. This syndrome, which is also called the hyaline membrane syndrome or resorption atelectasis, is characterized by a history of premature birth, cesarean section, fetal distress, or maternal dia...|$|R
30|$|Standardizing {{the imaging}} {{methodology}} of IVC measurements could help improve {{the utility of}} this technique for determining fluid responsiveness. As a first step, we propose {{an analysis of the}} magnitude of movement of the IVC relative to the transducer during respirophasic imaging. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify movements of the IVC relative to the axis of the transducer during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> with comparison of the movement in mediolateral and craniocaudal directions. We additionally sought to measure the vessel's axis of respiratory collapse during ultrasound imaging.|$|E
30|$|Our {{measurements}} {{were taken in}} patients without acute distress during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> It is possible that IVC movement in these cases {{does not reflect the}} movement that might be expected in patients with respiratory difficulty or other compromise. The generalizability of our findings to other sonographers is limited by the relatively few numbers of sonographers that obtained images for this study. Determining the movement of the IVC during ultrasound imaging is effected by individual sonographer technique as movement of the IVC is multifactorial, influenced not only by patient factors (caudal displacement of the IVC with movement of the diaphragm), but also by sonographer factors (compensatory movements by the sonographer to compensate for the abdominal or chest wall movement).|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was the {{analysis}} of the rapid changes in the size and shape of the peripheral vein and the associated changes in blood flow velocities and the estimation of their effect on the reliability of the ultrasound scan volume flow (VF) measurements. Methods: Ten patients with primary chronic venous insufficiency and 10 healthy volunteers were studied. Two duplex scanners were used simultaneously: one for the velocity measurements in longitudinal plane and another for the cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements in transverse plane during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration,</b> Valsalva's maneuver (VM), pneumatic cuff compression-decompression, and active dorsiflexion. The patients underwent examination in standing and 15 -degrees reverse Trendelenburg's (RT) positions. VF was calculated on the basis of real-time CSA and velocity values. Results: Rapid changes in the CSA as much as 130 % for 0. 2 seconds were observed. In most cases, the changes in CSA and the flow velocity were inversely related, which resulted in near constant VF. With the exception of VM in the RT position, the difference between real-time VF and mean VF was not significant (P >. 05). In the RT position, significant changes in CSA were observed during and immediately after VM. These changes resulted in 23 % ± 15 % changes in outflow (both groups) and in 24 % ± 13 % changes in reflux (chronic venous insufficiency group). Conclusion: The CSA of the peripheral vein and the flow velocities undergo rapid changes during time intervals of a fraction of a second. The vein can have a noncircular cross-section. To minimize the potential error, VF measurements should be performed during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> or with cuff compression-decompression. With these conditions, the rapid changes in velocities and CSA do not significantly affect the accuracy of VF measurements because of their inverse relation. CSA should be measured planimetrically, or the site of the measurements should be where the vein is close to a circular shape. (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 522 - 6. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{oesophageal}} vestibule lies immediately {{above the}} stomach and during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> is located partly in the thorax, partly in the hiatus in the diaphragm, and partly in the abdomen. An analysis of some aspects of function of the vestibule in infants and children who have a non-contractile gullet above the vestibule is presented. Opening of the vestibule is related to deglutition and is independent of the oesophagus above. In its opening and closing the vestibule is shown to have {{the characteristics of a}} `muscle throttle'. The rapidity of the event of either opening or closing is accounted for. The important relationship of calibre of lumen of the vestibule to flow through it is analysed. The effect of the indentations of mucosa into the lumen when the vestibule is partially open is analysed from a theoretical standpoint, and it is inferred that the vestibule when only partially open has the characteristics of a highly efficient choke...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of respiratory {{activity of the}} abdominal muscles on their reaction time in a postural task was evaluated. The electromyographic (EMG) onsets of the abdominal muscles and deltoid were evaluated in response to shoulder flexion initiated by a visual stimulus occurring at random throughout the respiratory cycle. Increased activity of the abdominal muscles was produced by inspiratory loading, forced expiration below functional residual capacity, and a static glottis-closed expulsive maneuver. During quiet breathing, the latency between activation of the abdominal muscles and deltoid was not influenced by the respiratory cycle. When respiratory activity of the abdominal muscles increased, the EMG onset of transversus abdominis and internal oblique, relative to deltoid, was significantly earlier for movements beginning in expiration, compared with inspiration [by 97 - 107 ms (P < 0. 01) and 64 - 90 ms (P < 0. 01), respectively]. However, the onset of transversus abdominis EMG was delayed by 31 - 54 ms (P < 0. 01) when movement was performed during a static expulsive effort, compared with <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> Thus changes occur in early anticipatory contraction of transversus abdominis during respiratory tasks but they cannot be explained simply by existing activation of the motoneuron pool...|$|E
30|$|Patients {{presenting}} to {{the emergency}} department {{with a variety of}} complaints were approached for inclusion in the study. Each ultrasound examination was performed by a single operator from a group of five emergency physician sonographers (senior resident, fellow, and attending level) all with experience in IVC ultrasound (> 50 ultrasounds). All physicians involved in enrolling patients in this study underwent a minimum of 30 -min didactic and 1 -h structured hands-on dedicated to IVC imaging. Exclusion criteria included tachypnea, respiratory distress, and inability to fully visualize IVC from the right atrium to its bifurcation into right and left iliac veins. Sonographic images of the IVC were obtained using a standardized protocol consisting of B-mode images of the IVC in long axis and short axis obtained from an anterior transabdominal approach. Images were obtained using a 3.5 -Mhz curved array transducer (Zonare Medical System, Mountain View, CA, USA) and recorded digitally. The long-axis view of the IVC consisted of images centered on the confluence of the hepatic veins and the IVC. Transverse views of the IVC consisted of views of the IVC immediately inferior to the hepatic veins. Recorded images included still images of both long-axis and short-axis as well as 10 -seconds video clips recorded throughout a complete respiratory cycle of <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> The orientation of the ultrasound transducer relative to true horizontal was standardized using a leveling device attached to the ultrasound probe. The probe was held stationary 90 ° to horizontal throughout image acquisition.|$|E
40|$|Birdsong, {{like human}} speech, {{involves}} rapid, repetitive, or episodic motor patterns requiring precise coordination between respiratory, vocal organ, and vocal tract muscles. The song units or syllables of most adult songbirds exhibit {{a high degree}} of acoustic stereotypy that persists for days or months after the elimination of auditory feedback by deafening. Adult song is assumed to depend on central motor programs operating independently from immediate sensory feedback. Nothing is known, however, about the possible role of mechanoreceptive or other somatosensory feedback in the motor control of birdsong. Even in the case of human speech, the question of “how and when sensory information is used in normal speaking conditions…[*]remains unanswered” and controversial [Smith, A. (1992) Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 3, 233 – 267]. We report here evidence for somatosensory modulation of ongoing song motor patterns. These patterns include the respiratory muscles that, in both birdsong and speech, provide the power for vocalization. Perturbing respiratory pressure by a brief, irregularly timed injection of air into the cranial thoracic air sac during song elicited a compensatory reduction in the electrical activity of the abdominal expiratory muscles, both in hearing and deafened adult northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis). This muscle response was absent or reduced during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration,</b> suggesting it is specifically linked to phonation. Our findings indicate that somatosensory feedback to expiratory muscles elicits compensatory adjustments that help stabilize, in real time, the subsyringeal pressure against fluctuations caused by changes in posture or physical activity...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the literature indicates that changes occurring in the calibre of the bronchi during the normal respiratory movements have never been demonstrated. In {{a review of the}} subject by von Skramlik (1925) it is remarked that one would anticipate a widening during inspiration, a narrowing during expiration, but that in <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> these differences are obviously too small to record. In forced respiratory movements as in cough it is known (Briinings, 1912) that a narrowing in the bronchi occurs just at the instant that the vocal chords are forced apart. METHODS Within the past few years lipiodol has permitted the outlining of the bronchial tree in the living subject with great accuracy and detail (Forestier, 1926). It was therefore decided to investigate the possibility of using this substance to demonstrate any changes {{in the size of the}} bronchi which might occur during normal respiration. For the observations on living subjects, one cat, two dogs, and five human subjects were employed. The animals were anesthetized with urethane and the oil administered by tracheal puncture. In man the films were taken in the course of diagnostic procedures. No anesthetic was required, the technique described by Singer (1926) being employed. After injection of the oil, x-ray films were taken in man during the actual process of breathing and also while holding the breath at the end of inspiration and at the end of expiration...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of respiration on muscle sympathetic and cardiac vagal activities in twenty conscious, healthy young adult subjects. Efferent post-ganglionic muscle sympathetic activity was measured directly with electrodes inserted percutaneously into a peroneal nerve, and vagal cardiac activity was measured indirectly from electrocardiographic changes of heart period. Muscle sympathetic activity waxed and waned with respiration; maximum activity occurred at end-expiration and minimum activity occurred at end-inspiration. Voluntary control of breathing did not alter the time course or magnitude of muscle sympathetic outflow. Spectral analyses showed that respiratory periodicities were present in sympathetic and vagal records. Average power at frequencies below respiratory frequencies exceeded or equalled that at respiratory frequencies in both muscle sympathetic and vagal cardiac records. A cardiac periodicity was present and conspicuous in muscle sympathetic recordings {{in all but one}} subject. Diastolic arterial pressure increased during inspiration and decreased during expiration. Heart period and muscle sympathetic activity paralleled each other and were related reciprocally to changes of diastolic pressure. Brief reductions of carotid baroreceptor afferent traffic provoked by neck pressure were more effective in increasing sympathetic activity in expiration than inspiration. We conclude that <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> is associated with parallel phasic changes in activity of medullary vagal cardiac and spinal muscle sympathetic motonuclei in man; spontaneous activity and susceptibility to excitation or inhibition by autonomic inputs are greater in expiration than inspiration. Substantial power is present in both muscle sympathetic and cardiac vagal recordings at frequencies below respiratory frequencies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Assessment of {{circulating}} {{volume and}} {{the requirement for}} fluid replacement are fundamental to resuscitation but remain largely empirical. Passive leg raise (PLR) may determine fluid responders while avoiding potential fluid overload. We hypothesised that inferior vena cava collapse index (IVCCI) and carotid artery blood flow would change predictably in response to PLR, potentially providing a non-invasive tool to assess circulating volume and identifying fluid responsive patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective proof of concept pilot study on fasted healthy volunteers. One operator measured IVC diameter during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration</b> and sniff, and carotid artery flow. Stroke volume (SV) was also measured using suprasternal Doppler. Our primary endpoint was change in IVCCI after PLR. We also studied changes in IVCCI after “sniff”, and correlation between carotid artery flow and SV. Results: Passive leg raise was associated with significant reduction in the mean inferior vena cava collapsibility index from 0. 24 to 0. 17 (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Mean stroke volume increased from 56. 0 to 69. 2 mL (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). There was no significant change in common carotid artery blood flow. Changes in physiology consequent upon passive leg raise normalised rapidly. Discussion: Passive leg raise {{is associated with a}} decrease of IVCCI and increase in stroke volume. However, the wide range of values observed suggests that factors other than circulating volume predominate in determining the proportion of collapse with respiration. Conclusion: In contrast to other studies, we did not find that carotid blood flow increased with passive leg raise. Rapid normalisation of post-PLR physiology may account for this...|$|E
40|$|The {{laryngeal}} adductor response (LAR) is {{a protective}} reflex that prevents aspiration {{and can be}} elicited either by electrical stimulation of afferents in the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) or by deflection of mechanoreceptors in the laryngeal mucosa. We hypothesized that because this reflex is life-sustaining, laryngeal muscle responses to sensory stimuli would not be suppressed during volitional laryngeal tasks when compared to <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> Unilateral electrical superior laryngeal nerve stimulation was used to elicit early (R 1) and late (R 2) responses in the ipsilateral thyroarytenoid muscle in 10 healthy subjects. The baseline levels of muscle activity before stimulation, R 1 and R 2 response occurrence and the integrals of responses were measured during each task: quiet inspiration, prolonged vowels, humming, forced inhalation and effort closure. We tested whether R 1 response integrals during tasks were equal to either: (1) baseline muscle activity during the task added to the response integral at rest; (2) the response integral at rest minus the baseline muscle activity during the task; or (3) the response integral at rest. R 1 response occurrence was not altered by task from rest while fewer R 2 responses occurred only during effort closure and humming compared to rest. Because the R 1 response integrals did not change from rest, task increases in motor neuron firing did not alter the LAR. These findings demonstrate that laryngeal motor neuron responses to sensory inputs are not gated during volitional tasks confirming the robust life-sustaining protective mechanisms provided by this airway reflex...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{identify}} the patients of bronchial asthma (suspected or proven), not responding to optimal therapy, {{for the presence}} of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) and to compare the diagnostic ability of flow volume (FV) loop and impulse oscillometry (IOS). Materials and Methods: Fifty one patients of suspected/proven bronchial asthma not responding to optimal therapy were included for the study. Each patient was subjected to both FV loop and IOS studies. Direct visualization of the vocal cords with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope {{for the presence of}} inspiratory vocal cord adduction during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration,</b> with speech, and while performing provocative maneuvers was carried out. All patients were subjected to simple pulmonary function tests and recording of FV loop. IOS was performed on each patient to look for the site of obstruction and upper airway influence. The observations of both FV loop and IO studies were compared. Results: Among 51 patients participated, 12 (23. 53 &#x 0025;) had bronchoscopical evidence of VCD and were labeled as VCD-positive group and rest 39 were designated VCD negative. No statistically significant difference in pulmonary function test (prereversibility) results between the VCD-positive and VCD-negative patients was found. Reversible airway obstruction was observed in 75 &#x 0025; of the patients of VCD-positive group and 67. 65 &#x 0025; of the patients in the VCD-negative group. Only one patient in the VCD-positive and none in VCD-negative group had inspiratory limb flattening of FV loop. Upper airway influence was evident by IOS in 58. 3 &#x 0025; of patients in the VCD-positive group and in 15. 4 &#x 0025; of patients in the VCD-negative group. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0. 005). Conclusion: VCD was a common finding in patients with symptoms suggestive of asthma and frequently coexists with asthma. IOS was found to be a useful screening test for VCD and was more sensitive than FV loop...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background 4 -dimensional CT (4 DCT) scans are {{increasingly}} used {{to account for}} mobility during radiotherapy planning. As variations in respiratory patterns can alter observed motion, with consequent changes in the generated target volumes, we evaluated the reproducibility of 4 D target volumes generated during repeat uncoached <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on two successive scans (4 DCT 1 and 4 DCT 2) generated at the same scanning session for 26 patients with peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The volume and position of planning target volumes (PTV 4 DCT 1 and PTV 4 DCT 2) contoured on both scans were compared, and a dosimetric analysis performed. A SRT plan optimized for each PTV was sequentially applied to the other PTV, and coverage by the 80 % isodose was evaluated. Color intensity projections (CIP) were used to evaluate regions of underdosage. Results No significant volumetric differences were observed between the two PTVs (t -Test p = 0. 60). The average displacement {{of the center of}} mass between corresponding PTVs was 1. 4 ± 1. 0 mm, but differences in position were 2. 0 mm or greater in 5 cases (19 %). Coverage of both PTVs by the 80 % prescription isodose exceeded 90 % for all but one patient. For the latter, the prescription isodose covered only 82. 5 % of PTV 4 DCT 1. CIP analysis revealed that the region of underdosage was an end-inspiratory position occupied by the tumor for only 10 – 20 % of the respiratory cycle. Conclusion In nearly all patients with stage I lung cancer, the PTV derived from a single uncoached 4 DCT achieves dosimetric coverage that is similar to that achieved using two such consecutive scans. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to quantitatively characterize and predict lung tissue motion {{with the goal of}} improving the local control of lung cancer. This is accomplished by producing a biomechanical model of lung tissue motion during <b>quiet</b> <b>respiration.</b> This dissertation proposes the development of algorithms and protocols for the analysis of motion information in 4 DCT images. Methods: A cohort of 50 patients was acquired with a 16 -slice CT scanner. This data was used throughout the dissertation. Based on the law of volume conservation, a relationship between the tidal volume and the geometric expansion of the torso was devised and used to improve breathing motion studies. The breathing patterns of these patients were used to characterize breathing patterns based on the measured external surrogate information with the aim of improving the efficiency of linear accelerator gating windows. A characteristic breath was defined as an average breath for use in generating patterns representative of realistic motion for breathing motion studies. A prospective gating algorithm was developed to allow the acquisition of user specified breathing phases with a relatively simple model to accurately predict respiratory phase occurrence {{in order to reduce the}} number of scans necessary to obtain sufficient data for breathing motion modeling. A new term to the breathing motion model to account for cardiac induced lung tissue motion was developed to improve the accuracy of the model. Results: Breathing studies can be optimized by placing the surrogate device between the third and fourth lumbar vertebra. Three types of breathing patterns were observed in the patient cohort. The hysteresis component of lung tissue trajectories was shown to be between 8 - 18 % of the volume filling component of motion. A simple prediction algorithm was shown to be a significant improvement over commercially available software. An additional term was devised to account for cardiac-induced lung motion and was shown to be accurate. Conclusion: This dissertation has demonstrated new quantitative methods to characterize lung tissue motion. Future work includes incorporating the work described in this dissertation into a new fast helical CT image acquisition protocol for breathing motion modeling...|$|E
