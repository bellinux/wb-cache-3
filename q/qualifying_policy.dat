The main purpose in word acquisition is to provide bi-lingual students with basic communication skills without any difficulties. Frequency studies are among the most important sources to determine the words that the student needs. Therefore it is an important issue, whether frequency studies are considered while choosing the words in the text used for the bi-lingual students’ education, or not. In this study, it is analyzed whether “Dictionary of the Frequency of Turkish Written Words” is considered or not, while choosing the text used in language training. This study, which aims to analyze the words that create the texts, is a descriptive research. In this study is used the document scanning method.

The Model Financial Statement Insurance Act uses the architecture of the U. S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939. It authorizes issuer application for qualification, in connection with annual proxy statement filings, of policies of financial statement insurance. The Model FSI Act deems a series of provisions necessary to achieve securities law objectives to be part of all financial statement insurance policies so proposed, and requires insurers to possess characteristics relating to financial capacity, independence from issuers and adequate regulatory supervision. It empowers the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue stop orders against such applications in cases where insurers lack such qualifications. <b>Qualifying</b> <b>policies</b> are put to security holder vote and become effective when a registered public accounting firm engaged by the insurer issues an unqualified opinion that the financial statements provide a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

50|$|Qualifying {{status is}} {{determined}} {{at the outset}} of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10 years plus) tend to be <b>qualifying</b> <b>policies</b> and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called top-slicing based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (unit trusts, investment trusts and OEICs). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the '5% cumulative allowance' - the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the deferred tax liability will not result in tax being due.|$|R

40|$|This study {{takes on}} the issue of {{political}} and socio-economic conditions for the hydrogen economy as part of a future low carbon society in Europe. It is subdivided into two parts. A first part reviews the current EU policy framework in view of its impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development. In the second part an analysis of the regional dynamics and possible hydrogen and fuel cell clusters is carried out. The current EU policy framework does not hinder hydrogen development. Yet it does not constitute a strong push factor either. EU energy policies have the strongest impact on hydrogen and fuel cell development even though their potential is still underexploited. Regulatory policies have a weak but positive impact on hydrogen. EU spending policies show some inconsistencies. Regions with a high activity level in HFC also are generally innovative regions. Moreover, the article points out certain industrial clusters that favours some regions' conditions for taking part in the HFC development. However, existing hydrogen infrastructure seems to play a minor role for region's engagement. An overall well-functioning regional innovation system is important in the formative phase of an HFC innovation system, but that further research is needed before <b>qualified</b> <b>policy</b> implications can be drawn. Looking ahead the current policy framework at EU level does not set clear long term signals and lacks incentives that are strong enough to facilitate high investment in and deployment of sustainable energy technologies. The likely overall effect thus seems to be too weak to enable the EU hydrogen and fuel cell deployment strategy. According to our analysis an enhanced EU policy framework pushing for sustainability in general and the development of hydrogen and fuel cells in particular requires the following: 1) A strong EU energy policy with credible long term targets; 2) better coordination of EU policies: Europe needs a common understanding of key taxation concepts (green taxation, internalisation of externalities) and a common approach for the market introduction of new energy technologies; 3) an EU cluster policy as an attempt to better coordinate and support of European regions in their efforts to further develop HFC and to set up the respective infrastructure. ...|$|R

40|$|Employment {{is crucial}} for people’s {{well-being}} and economic growth. Promoting job creation and tackling {{the economic and social}} consequences of unemployment, underemployment and preventing social exclusion are a priority for all our countries. Although G 20 countries are at different stages of development and there is no “one size fits all” labour market policy, G 20 countries will benefit from well-designed, integrated and consistent public policies. (G 20 Labour and Employment Ministers’ Declaration, 18 – 19 July 2013) Since 2008, the global economic and financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures are estimated to have resulted in the loss of 10 million jobs across Europe. Moreover, fiscal consolidation measures have led to reductions in funding for social security and related labour market measures across most European welfare settings. Within these constraints, innovative social security and labour market measures have been developed to enable inclusivity whilst also promoting the structural resilience of labour markets to economic recession. Structural issues of underemployment and wage depression have significantly intensified this challenge. For the purposes of this themed issue, a pragmatic definition of innovation where “mainstream” policies within specific national contexts serve as the point of reference for <b>qualifying</b> <b>policies</b> as “new” or innovative is adopted. Critically addressing the underlying rationale, scope and impacts of specific social security and employment measures across a number of European countries, this themed issue aims to assess the characteristics and impact of innovative social security and employment policies in promoting key labour market objectives. These key objectives include the use of short-term policy instruments to counteract the impact of economic crises on the employability and labour market access of vulnerable groups and those aimed at improving the long-term capacity and resilience of distinct European societies and labour markets to cope with economic crises and labour market restructuring. This set of themed papers has been chosen to be published by the International Social Security Review because the subject matter coincides and is supportive of the topical priorities of the International Social Security Association for the triennium 2014 – 2016; namely, i) they investigate a number of proposed innovative responses as regards to how social security programmes may better support social cohesion and economic growth and ii) address issues related to how social security programmes may better adapt their current practices to cater to the needs of “atypical” population groups. Within this issue, “atypical” groups are defined as vulnerable groups within the labour market including young people (younger than age 25), migrants and disabled workers. Employment figures reveal that the unemployment rate in these groups is significantly higher than the average unemployment rate in all European countries...|$|R

It describes two complementary forecasting exercises, whereby a stock-flow model is used to produce UK-wide estimates and, then, a multi-logit equation is used to disaggregate these forecasts by region. The result is a set of estimates of the likely developments in the pattern of qualification attainment across the different parts of the United Kingdom, running through to 2014. It focuses upon the numbers of individuals broken down by level of qualification, gender, age and region. These forecasts suggest that, based on past trends (and consistent with meeting government targets), there will be substantial increases in the numbers and proportions of more qualified individuals and corresponding reductions among the less <b>qualified.</b> Further <b>policy</b> initiatives that may result from the Leitch Review are likely to further accentuate these changes. qualifications, skills, forecasts,...|$|R
