40|$|This {{occasional}} paper {{is the first}} in a series on the National Quality Framework (NQF). This paper offers detailed insights into education and care service quality ratings for <b>Quality</b> <b>Area</b> 1 – Educational Program and Practice, which focuses on ensuring that educational program and practice is stimulating and engaging, enhances children’s learning and development, and meets children’s individual learning and development needs. ACECQA has chosen to focus this first {{occasional paper}} on <b>Quality</b> <b>Area</b> 1 because of its vital contribution to child outcomes and because the evidence indicates that services are less likely to meet the National Quality Standard (NQS) in this Area. Additionally, the paper is timely given ACECQA’s work in period 2014 / 15 with Regulatory Authorities and Professional Support Coordinators to deliver national workshops to educators to help them better understand and meet the requirements of <b>Quality</b> <b>Area</b> 1. The paper provides a brief overview of the NQS, its rating system, quality areas and overall ratings to date. It then examines <b>Quality</b> <b>Area</b> 1 looking at differences across jurisdictions, management types, service sub-types, and socioeconomic and remoteness classifications. Of particular interest are elements 1. 2. 1 and 1. 2. 3, which analysis reveals are the least likely of all the 58 elements to be assessed as met. Here, the discussion includes de-identified excerpts from authorised officers’ reports to highlight what can differentiate performance against these elements. The paper culminates by examining patterns in the distribution of <b>Quality</b> <b>Area</b> 1 ratings and discusses possible explanations for these variations, as well as implications of the report findings and future directions. The paper is intended to be of interest to people who deliver education and care services, people who provide training and professional development services to the sector, and to officers in the Regulatory Authorities that conduct quality rating. Unless otherwise stated, the paper draws on data from the National Quality Agenda Information Technology System (NQA ITS) as at 31 December 2015.

30|$|Pertaining to Hypothesis 3, {{there was}} {{inconclusive}} feedback given by early education school educators involving the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) initiatives {{regulated by the}} Massachusetts Department of Education (DOE) that time spent on these systems derails other quality initiatives. However, {{there is a clear}} need for school leadership and government agencies to dedicate resources and time to the ICT initiatives with consideration of the average educator’s lifestyle, hours worked, and remaining cognizant of the number of hours in a work week. Otherwise, educators are taking time away from one <b>quality</b> <b>area</b> (classroom management or behavior management planning) to take on another <b>quality</b> <b>area</b> (such as self-documentation of profile and training).

However, in the QIAS only two <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> (i.e., staff relationships with children and peers & children’s experiences and learning) out of seven are focused on actual day-to-day experiences between teachers and children. Yet the <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> are weighted equally, so proportionally, the QIAS provides significantly less emphasis on process quality than structural quality. Furthermore, with QIAS there are insufficient mechanisms for assessing the quality of pedagogy, so process quality is further diminished.|$|R

Through an examination of pertinent literature, it was decided that an operational definition of residential quality could be provided by the construction of an index based on housing value and condition data from the U. S. Census. The index is used to identify five categories of residential quality: (1) low quality, (2) low-middle quality, (3) middle quality, (4) high-middle quality, and (5) high <b>quality</b> <b>areas.</b> The results of this index are plotted at city block and census tract levels of generalization for Long Bench, California. The city block level proved to be superior to the tract level because it allowed for maximum detail and identification of residential transition zones in unplanned <b>areas.</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>areas</b> are examined by testing hypotheses dealing with: (1) distribution of population, (2) mobility of population, (3) occupations, (4) head of household income, (5) ethnic composition; (6) age of population, (7) structural age, and (8) nonresidential land use. Comments on these hypotheses are arrived at through an analysis made from maps and simple correlations. It is sho 1 m that residential areas can be differentiated areally, and that a value and condition index provides a reasonably objective and comparable method. Testing the index through the use of hypotheses adds insight into residential quality; for example, it was discovered that nonwhite areas are practically all lower-middle or lower I <b>quality</b> <b>areas,</b> that high <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> are nearly totally occupied by whites, and that the poorest area of the city, that surrounding the central business district, is dominated by elderly persons. ?...|$|R

40|$|Firstly, {{the paper}} aims to present basic {{analytical}} concepts in researching social aspects of urban neighborhoods: community, social cohesion, social capital, {{as well as}} relationship between physical and social structures within the neighborhood. Secondly, the paper presents empirical research that explores {{if there is a}} process of differentiation in the perception of neighborhood among professionals living in the neighborhoods exposed to significant changes in social and urban structures. By employing a qualitative methodology, based on interviews with 40 professionals in two types of neighborhoods (one exposed to social filtration and the other to the process of gentrification), the study reveals that neighborhood as a community prevails in all localities, that the neighborhood as a commodity develops more distinctively in better quality neighborhoods while the perception of neighborhood as a negative context (social and physical) emerges in lower quality neighborhoods. The importance of network support and reciprocity appeared equally developed in both residential areas enhancing the sense of belonging to the neighborhood. The greatest difference was documented in respondents' safety perception primarily due to differences in neighborhoods' social context (crime, drug abuse and people from the margins in the lower <b>quality</b> <b>area).</b> Spatial characteristics influenced the perceived level of safety too (better equipment and security of buildings in the higher <b>quality</b> <b>area).</b> Social capital understood as potential resource that can be mobilized through intermediate institutions is generally low, without differences between the observed areas. It is visible in the tendency among all respondents to employ primarily the private sector in solving neighborhood problems instead of demanding institutional support, as well as in preferring the payment of services to participation in neighborhood activities...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{paper is}} part of a larger study with a focus on {{management}} within a preschool. The principal was interviewed and three teachers at the preschool responded to a questionnaire, using a case study methodology. There have been few studies in Malaysia that examined the management aspects of principal’s work especially in preschool. The study adopted the Social Systems Model to support the notion that preschools cannot strive on its own without sharing and exchanging information between the principal and the teachers. The Australia Quality Improvement and Accreditation System (QIAS) was used in gauging the level of quality practices at the school. Objective: The aim of this study was to gauge the level of seven quality practices in a preschool. In addition it attempts to uncover the principal’s role as manager and in the effort to improve the services at the school, teachers’ feedback were needed to determine to what extent the principal’s effort were internalised in the daily operation of the preschool. Results: The findings revealed that the teachers rated the overall <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> in the kindergarten as being average. Three <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> were rated high whereas four others were average. According to the interview with the principal, she had emphasised the importance of the seven <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> to the teachers. However, the principal’s efforts in ensuring quality practices were not reflected in the level of the <b>quality</b> <b>areas</b> reported by the teachers. There seemed to be an inconsistency in the findings from the teachers and principal. Conclusion: The Social Systems Model explained that in order for information to be disseminated and perceived correctly there need to be a clear understanding on sharing and exchanging of the information between the principal and the teachers. Factors such as participatory management style, employee involvement in decision-making and teachers’ autonomy need to be taken into consideration when trying to implement changes in the school...|$|R

Main directions of researches are concentrated around Cohen’s class of transformation which gives some possibilities of adaptation for analysed signal by choosing appropriate kernel function. Additionally, novel approach delivered by S-transform is also introduced. In order to investigate the methods several experiments were performed using simulated phenomena of switching on the capacitor banks in distribution system. Firstly some aspect of S-transform application were present. Then the influence of different kernel functions were investigated when Wigner-Ville, Choi-Williams and Zhao-Atlas-Marks distributions were applied. Obtained results were supplemented by comparison to classical spectrogram. Proposed methods allowed to track instantaneous frequency as well as energy with better time-frequency precision than classical spectrogram.
