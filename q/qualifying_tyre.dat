50|$|The {{performance}} in qualifying by the Minardis, Dallaras and Brabhams showed what {{most in the}} F1 paddock already knew, that the Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to the Goodyears with all three teams using the Italian tyres. However, while Pirelli had produced better qualifying rubber, the Goodyears were still acknowledged as having superior race tyres.|$|R
50|$|What {{made the}} {{qualifying}} laps of Brundle, Modena and Caffi {{all the more}} impressive was that each driver {{had to go through}} pre-qualifying to get there. And Brundle had only just scraped through pre-qualifying by 0.021 seconds. It was at this race that many in the paddock started noticing that the Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to Goodyear's (the Brabhams and Caffi's Dallara ran on Pirelli rubber).|$|R
50|$|Ayrton Senna shocked no-one {{by taking}} pole position, but second {{place was a}} {{surprise}} with Stefano Modena taking {{full advantage of the}} superior Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> to be second followed by Patrese, Piquet, a disappointed Mansell, Berger, Prost, Moreno, Alesi, and de Cesaris. Alex Caffi had a huge accident in practice and would not participate in the race. Elsewhere Martin Brundle was disqualified for missing a weight check.|$|R
5000|$|For 1989, BMS Scuderia Italia {{expanded}} to a two car team. Alex Caffi {{remained on the}} roster, joined by the very experienced Andrea de Cesaris. As Caffi scored no points in , and de Cesaris had scored three points for Rial, this actually meant that Caffi was bumped into pre-qualifying {{for the first half}} of the season, though with a good car and Pirelli's generally strong <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> this normally wasn't much of a problem for the young Italian.|$|R
50|$|As {{announced}} during 2008, MotoGP class {{switched to}} a single-tyre manufacturer. The move was made to try to improve safety by reducing cornering speeds, and in a marginal way for cost reasons; the winner was decided by bid. Michelin, {{one of the two}} tyre suppliers in 2008, decided not to bid for the supply, effectively declaring Bridgestone the winner, which was confirmed on 18 October 2008. Bridgestone will be the sole tyre supplier from 2009 to 2011. Only race spec tyres will be provided to the teams, eliminating <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres,</b> in use until 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Ayrton Senna blasted {{around the}} 4.218 km (2.6209 mi) Jerez circuit in 1:20.291 {{to take his}} pole {{position}} record to 40. Gerhard Berger was second in his Ferrari 640, only 0.274 seconds behind {{the man who would}} be his [...] team mate at McLaren. Over a second behind Senna in third was world championship leader Alain Prost in his McLaren, with the surprise of late season qualifying, Pierluigi Martini, fourth in his Minardi, the Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> once again coming to the fore. Martini had been an incredible second fastest after Friday qualifying, only 0.388 slower than Senna.|$|R
50|$|During {{qualifying}} for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Keke Rosberg lapped the 4.719 km (2.932 mi) circuit in his Honda powered FW10 {{in a time}} of 1:05.591 for an average speed of 160.9 mph (258.9 km/h), the first time a Formula One car had broken the 160 mph barrier for a qualifying lap. This record would stand until Williams driver Juan Pablo Montoya lapped Monza in his V10 BMW powered Williams FW24 at 161.449 mph (259.827 km/h) during {{qualifying for}} the 2002 Italian Grand Prix. Rosberg's lap at Silverstone was all the more impressive given that he was on slick <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> {{at a time when the}} track was damp from light rain, and that he also had a deflating tyre for most of the lap.|$|R
50|$|Part of the BT58's initial {{advantage}} was its Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres,</b> although {{like other}} teams using the Italian rubber, the race tyres were {{not of the}} same quality. However, during {{the last half of}} the season as Formula One moved to faster circuits such as Silverstone, Hockenheim and Monza, the BT58's lack of straight line speed, and Pirelli's less than competitive race tyres, saw that results were harder to come by, though Brundle did defy the odds by finishing 6th at Monza after Modena was excluded during qualifying when his car weighed in under the legal limit. After scoring 5 points in Monaco, the team would only score another 3 for the rest of the season, with Brundle finishing 6th in the Italian Grand Prix, and 5th in Japan.|$|R
50|$|The {{power output}} of the engines was {{controlled}} in racing conditions {{by means of a}} strict fuel limit; however, in qualifying trim teams were commonly able to increase the boost of their engines for optimum power while the use of special <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> also saw speeds increase. This fuel economy was key to successful race strategy in 1985; Nigel Mansell recalled the added interest of planning his fuel use in his autobiography. It also proved costly for Ayrton Senna, who lost victory just four laps from home at Imola when he ran out of fuel. After Prost was disqualified for an underweight McLaren (2 kg), victory fell to Senna's Lotus team mate Elio de Angelis in what would prove to be his second and last Grand Prix win.|$|R
50|$|Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve {{was killed}} in an {{accident}} during the final qualifying session. At the time of the crash, his teammate Didier Pironi had set a time 0.1s faster than Villeneuve for sixth place. Contemporary and more recent writers say that he was attempting to improve his time on his final lap. Some suggest that he was specifically aiming to beat Pironi due to bitterness at being passed by him two weeks earlier in the closing stages of San Marino, when Villeneuve believed Pironi had been ordered to remain behind him. Villeneuve's biographer Gerald Donaldson quotes Ferrari race engineer Mauro Forghieri as saying that the Canadian, although pressing on in his usual fashion, was returning to the pits on his last set of <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> when the accident occurred. If so, he would not have set a time on that lap.|$|R
50|$|With {{the return}} of the {{naturally}} aspirated engines, and the aforementioned turbo ban in mind, the FIA introduced new rules for 1987 in an effort to reduce costs and slow down the cars with a resultant increase in safety, as well as to increase competitiveness between the two engine types. Turbo-powered cars now had to feature a pop-off valve which restricted boost to 4.0 bar, thus limiting engine power. However, advances in engine development, aerodynamics, tyres and suspension meant that the leading teams such as Williams, McLaren and Ferrari nonetheless frequently recorded faster times than they had in 1986, when turbo boost was unrestricted. The FIA also banned super-soft (and sticky) <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> for 1987, thus eliminating the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989 saw Brabham reform after {{a sabbatical}} in 1988, {{now owned by}} Swiss {{businessman}} Joachim Luthi (who had brought the team from Walter Brun, the owner of EuroBrun), but featuring {{a lot of the}} same staff as in 1987. Modena was offered one of the seats, driving alongside Martin Brundle. Equipped with Pirelli <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> Modena frequently <b>qualified</b> well, starting inside the top 10 on eight occasions despite using the Judd V8 engine. However, the car wasn't reliable - though Modena's sole points finish would come with his 3rd place at the Monaco Grand Prix, his first of two F1 podiums. Before the 1990 season Luthi would be imprisoned for fraud and Brabham endured a difficult year with ownership problems. Modena raised the team's spirits by finishing 5th at the season-opening United States Grand Prix but after that results were rare.|$|R
25|$|Tyre {{selection}} is critical, usually {{done by the}} individual rider based on bike 'feel' during practice, qualifying and the pre-race warm-up laps {{on the morning of}} the race, as well as the predicted weather. The typical compromise is between grip and longevity—softer compound tyres have more traction, but wear out more quickly; harder compound tyres have less traction, but are more likely to last the entire race. Conserving rubber throughout a race is a specific skill winning riders acquire. Special 'Q' or <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> of extreme softness and grip were typically used during grid-qualifying sessions until their use was discontinued at the end of the 2008 season, but they lasted typically no longer than one or two laps, though they could deliver higher qualifying speeds. In wet conditions, special tires ('wets') with full treads are used, but they suffer extreme wear if the track dries out.|$|R
50|$|Gibernau {{returned}} to action on 17 June 2008, testing the Desmosedici GP9 at the Mugello Circuit, in a three-day test session alongside official test rider Vittoriano Guareschi. There was speculation {{that he could}} replace the uncompetitive Marco Melandri aboard the second Factory Ducati for the later races in the 2008 season. Despite positive results, Ducati MotoGP Project Director Livio Suppo was unwilling to confirm any definite future for Gibernau with the team. Sete again tested the Desmosedici GP8 and GP9 on a three-day test beginning on 1 July 2008 at the Mugello circuit. He recorded a best time of 1´50.5 on board the GP8 on race tyres, just a few tenths off this year's race record at Mugello set by Casey Stoner. He clocked a 1´48.9 on 30 July at Mugello on <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> which would have placed him 7th on the starting grid for the 2008 Italian Grand Prix.|$|R

50|$|The 1989 season saw much improvement. The all-new, Cosworth DFR-powered Osella FA1M was a {{big step}} ahead, and ultra-sticky <b>{{qualifying}}</b> <b>tyres</b> from Pirelli brought some success, {{at least in the}} qualifying sessions (most notably in the Japanese Grand Prix, where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance brought no results in the races; the Osella cars almost never saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most tragic race was the Canadian Grand Prix in which Larini was third before the FA1M's electrics failed due to water ingress. Piercarlo Ghinzani re-joined the team for 1989 with limited success, often failing to qualify. He announced his retirement at the season ending Australian Grand Prix. While Larini failed to start the very wet race when his electrics were water-logged on the grid, Ghinzani's race and career came to a violent end when a high-speed collision with the Lotus of Nelson Piquet left Ghinzani with an injured ankle.|$|R
2500|$|Alboreto soon {{lost his}} Marlboro {{sponsorship}} as well after {{they refused to}} find him another drive {{for the rest of}} the 1989 season. He was, however, soon hired by the French Larrousse team, incidentally co-sponsored by Camel, for the German Grand Prix and the rest of the season. Despite his new team mate Philippe Alliot showing that the Lola LC89 with its [...] Lamborghini V12 engine could be a competitive car with high grid positions and challenging for points in various races, Alboreto couldn't come to grips with the LC89 and failed to score a single point {{for the rest of the}} season, and twice he actually failed to pre-qualify (though it must be said that pre-qualifying in [...] was generally dominated by those using Pirelli's superior <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres,</b> whereas Larrousse used Goodyear rubber). During qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix the Italian cut one of the chicanes and broke two of his ribs in the process. After competing the year for two teams, Alboreto finished the year eleventh in the Drivers' Championship with six points.|$|R
50|$|At the 1985 Bathurst 1000, Francevic {{teamed with}} John Bowe in the Volvo and {{qualified}} fifth, his attempt at pole {{position in the}} Hardies Heroes top 10 run-off was thwarted by a flat tyre on his second run while trying to improve on his first run. With a very quick car and a strong diver pairing (Bowe, who like Francevic was on {{his first visit to}} Mount Panorama, was matching the Kiwi's times and it was only a late charge on <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> that saw Francevic post the quicker time), the pair considered one of the pre-race favourites along with the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Jaguar XJS', as it was thought the turbocharged Volvo was the only car capable of matching the speed of the V12 powered Jaguars. After a strong early showing in the race in which Francevic had held second for some time behind early leader Tom Walkinshaw, a failed alternator diode put them many laps down. The car finally retired on lap 122 when it ran out of fuel on the run up Mountain Straight.|$|R

5000|$|The {{new rules}} for the season {{included}} {{an increase in the}} number of cars permitted to enter a Grand Prix from 30 to 34, and the number of starters from 24 to 26. To avoid having all 34 cars on the track at one time, a pre-qualifying session was introduced in which the three teams with the poorest record in the previous year would compete to be allowed into qualification proper. Three companies, Goodyear, Michelin and Avon supplied <b>tyres,</b> including special <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres,</b> which provided much increased levels of grip during the qualification sessions that determined the starting order for the race. For the first time the number of tyres permitted for qualification was limited, creating a situation which Villeneuve thought [...] "...unnecessarily dangerous. If I have only two chances to set a time, I need a clear track, OK? If it isn't clear, if there's someone in my way, I just have to hope he's looking in his mirrors — I mean, I can't lift, because this is my last chance." ...|$|R
50|$|However, in {{the next}} races, his form dropped and he {{struggled}} with the bike, moving him down to 5th place in the MotoGP standings. His poor performance continued at Estoril. After a promising start, he briefly ran 2nd before being passed by Colin Edwards and then championship leader and teammate Hayden. On lap 5, he and Hayden {{were involved in a}} crash. Pedrosa made a mistake whilst trying to overtake Hayden, slid and crashed out of the race, taking out Hayden on the way. This crash ended his slim chances of winning the championship and also caused Hayden to lose his lead in the championship standings, as Rossi managed to finish 2nd. However, two weeks later, Hayden recovered to win the championship while Pedrosa managed to finish in 4th place. This result clinched his 5th place in overall standings in his debut season, thus taking the title as Rookie of the Year, beating former 250cc rival Casey Stoner. At the end of season three-day test of 2006 at Jerez, Pedrosa put his 800 cc RC212V {{at the top of the}} timesheets (on <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres)</b> edging out Rossi, who had been fastest on the first two days, by 0.214 seconds.|$|R
500|$|The 2005 United States Grand Prix was {{run with}} only six cars, after the Michelin tyres {{used by the}} other 14 cars proved unsafe for the circuit. A {{proposal}} involving {{the addition of a}} temporary chicane to slow cars through the fastest corner of the circuit was suggested but rejected by Mosley. He stated his reasons for not agreeing to the chicane: [...] "Formula One is a dangerous activity and it would be most unwise to make fundamental changes to a circuit without following tried and tested procedures. What happened was bad but can be put right. This is not true of a fatality." [...] He continued, [...] "Formula One is a sport which entertains. It is not entertainment disguised as sport." [...] Mosley gave three possible solutions for the Michelin runners: to use <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> but change them whenever necessary on safety grounds, to use a different tyre to be provided by Michelin or to run at reduced speed. These were all rejected by the Michelin-shod teams. Paul Stoddart, the then-owner of the Minardi team who ran on Bridgestone tyres, was prepared to compromise to accommodate Michelin teams—even though a reduced field would guarantee his team much needed points—and was particularly vocal in his criticism and renewed his calls for Mosley to resign.|$|R
5000|$|Despite several {{continuity}} hiccups, {{the game}} offered {{a completely new}} experience for players at the time. The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling {{depending on how you}} entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually [...] "feel" [...] whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> are an extreme example of this: players could not drive {{more than a couple of}} laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. Together with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made F1GP a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.|$|R
50|$|Bowe's two CAMS Gold Stars in 1984 and 1985 saw him {{finally get}} the {{attention}} of the Australian touring car establishment. In mid-1985 he was contacted by New Zealander Mark Petch to join the Mark Petch Motorsport Volvo 240 Turbo team during the 1985 Australian Endurance Championship. Bowe co-drove with the teams lead driver Robbie Francevic at the Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000. They were a DNF at Sandown after the differential in the Volvo locked solid underneath Bowe {{at the entrance to the}} pits on lap 60 (the car had to be pushed into the pits with the rear end supported by a trolley jack). At Bathurst the turbocharged Volvo was considered the only car capable of matching the speed of the three V12 Jaguar XJS' run by Tom Walkinshaw Racing. The Volvo qualified fifth fastest after Hardie's Heroes (set by Francevic), and after running second and third in the early laps, was destined to spend time in the pits having the alternator replaced, losing many laps. The car failed to finish after running out of fuel on lap 122. Despite it being only the second time he had driven the Volvo, and not having previously driven at the Mount Panorama Circuit, Bowe proved to be as quick in the car at Bathurst as Francevic until late in the final qualifying session when the team put on a set of <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> and Francevic set the third fastest time.|$|R
50|$|The forty-minute {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held on Friday afternoon. It decided positions eleven through to twenty-nine on the grid, with the top ten drivers advancing to the Top 10 Shootout, to be held on the Saturday afternoon. During the Friday session, drivers were free to complete as much running as necessary to set a competitive lap time, but {{with the knowledge that}} their tyre allocation for the weekend was limited and {{that they would have to}} <b>qualify</b> on <b>tyres</b> that they would later use the race, the drivers had to balance their desire to set a fast time against the need to preserve as many tyres as possible for Sunday's race.|$|R
5000|$|Following these {{incidents}} {{the race was}} a gingerly affair, with those behind the leading trio not driving to win but {{to stay on the}} circuit. The last retirement of the race was Eddie Cheever (who as it turned out was driving in his 143rd and last Grand Prix) when he spun his Arrows down the East Terrace escape road and stalled his engine on lap 42. Cheever, who earlier in his career had gained a reputation for being a good wet weather driver, had driven much of his race was a piece of another car's front wing lodged in one of the Arrows sidepods. The only major action was Satoru Nakajima, in the best drive of his career which drew praise even from those who had regularly been critical of him such as [...] World Champion James Hunt. Nakajima set the fastest lap of the race, making his way through the field and almost catching Patrese for third, but finally settling for fourth (Nakajima had spun at the chicane on the first lap of the restart and was dead last by a long way {{at the end of the}} first lap). His drive surprised and delighted many as he had always been known to dislike street circuits and also had no like for racing in the rain. The other interest was third placed qualifier Martini who went steadily backwards to finally finish in sixth place, three laps down on Boutsen. Martini's race generally confirmed the view that while Pirelli's <b>qualifying</b> <b>tyres</b> were superior to the Goodyears, it was the opposite for both dry and wet weather race tyres with Goodyear holding a distinct advantage.|$|R
50|$|To {{compound}} {{the problems associated}} with heavy graining, overnight rain washed away whatever rubber had been laid down on the circuit during the Friday practice sessions, further reducing grip. With ambient temperatures being no higher than on Friday and the forecast predicting more of the same for the race, Bridgestone projected that a one-stop strategy in the race would be impossible with the harder prime compound losing up to seven seconds over half race distance, and the super-soft option tyres losing over sixteen seconds in the same window. With the rules dictating that drivers must start the race on the tyres they set their best <b>qualifying</b> time on, <b>tyre</b> selection for <b>qualifying</b> was therefore crucial.|$|R
50|$|Sergio Pérez {{opted not}} {{to go out in}} the third part of <b>qualifying,</b> to save <b>tyres</b> and started tenth, {{alongside}} the Mercedes of Michael Schumacher, who was again beaten by teammate Nico Rosberg, who qualified seventh. Adrian Sutil continued his improved form to start eighth. Only the 3 big teams chose to do two timed runs and they occupied the top six places. Lewis Hamilton had a good lap, breaking the 1 minute, 20 seconds barrier for the first time that weekend. After they had all done their first stint, Hamilton was fastest with reigning world champion and championship leader Sebastian Vettel only slightly slower. Vettel improved his lap time on his second run, and took his eighth pole of the season. Hamilton joined him on the front row, ahead of Button, Massa, Alonso and Webber.|$|R
5000|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to start by 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA). In June 2004, Mosley announced that he would step down from his position in October of that year, one year early, saying [...] "I no longer find it either satisfying or interesting to sit in long meetings ... I have achieved in this job everything I set out to ...". One month later, he rescinded his decision after the FIA Senate called for him to stay on. [...] According to a BBC Sport profile, many insiders considered that the announcement, and Mosley's public disagreements with Ecclestone, were [...] "just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport"; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, suggested that it arose because Mosley's proposals for Formula One met opposition. In 2004, Mosley said he felt Ferrari's then team principal Jean Todt should succeed him {{as president of the}} FIA when he stepped down. The 2005 United States Grand Prix was run with only six cars, after the Michelin tyres used by the other 14 cars proved unsafe for the circuit. A proposal involving the addition of a temporary chicane to slow cars through the fastest corner of the circuit was suggested but rejected by Mosley.

50|$|The Camaro {{was coming}} {{towards the end}} of its {{development}} in 1982. He finished equal third on points with Allan Moffat in the 1982 Australian Touring Car Championship, winning his final ATCC race at Sydney's Oran Park in Round 4. He then enlisted the services of Colin Bond to be his co-driver in the Australian Endurance Championship. Bond drove the Camaro in the 250 km Perrier Gold Cup at Oran Park where the car was competitive but suffered tyre problems. They then went to the James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst as a strong contender for their third straight pole position, but suffered a set back in <b>qualifying</b> when a <b>tyre</b> blew on top of The Mountain, sending bond into the guardrail. Despite this Bartlett qualified the car in 4th place. KB then had an early race duel for third place with the Falcon of Dick Johnson and the second Dealer Team Commodore of John Harvey which went on for a number of laps. Bartlett's race ended on lap 27 when the Camaro blew its left rear tyre at Reid Park, sending him into the fence and causing the car to roll onto its roof and slide across the track with a close following Johnson only just missing him.|$|R
5000|$|Dual World Champion Nelson Piquet {{confirmed}} the drivers' positive {{view on the}} circuit when he said early in race week [...] "After Dallas and Las Vegas, we all expected another bad street circuit", while his Brabham team boss {{and head of the}} Formula One Constructors Association (FOCA) Bernie Ecclestone told the assembled media that he believed that the standard of the organisation and the circuit itself was bad news for Formula One, explaining that Adelaide had raised the standards of what would be expected in the future and that several tracks in Europe already on the calendar, or hoping to be, would have to lift their own games in order to match it. Over the course of the weekend, the only complaint from the drivers was of a lack of grip on the newly laid surface (along with the new road built inside the Victoria Park Racecourse which is where the pits were located, the entire circuit other than the Brabham Straight had been re-laid a few months prior to the race to prevent the problems often faced on American street circuits where the road surface broke up badly under the strain of the high powered cars). The new surface was causing graining in both <b>qualifying</b> and race <b>tyres.</b> Other than a bump in the road {{at the end of the}} Brabham Straight, the circuit itself was generally given the thumbs up by those that really mattered, the teams and their often highly paid drivers.|$|R
