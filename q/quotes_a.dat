5|$|At 7.10.3, Eusebius <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> {{letter from}} Dionysius to the otherwise-unknown Hermammon {{on the early}} years of Valerian's (r. 253–260) rule. In this period the emperor implicitly tolerated Christianity; Eusebius would {{contrast}} his early reputation with his later policy of persecution.|$|E
5|$|At 6.41, Eusebius <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> {{letter from}} Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, to Fabius, bishop of Antioch, on the {{persecution}} at Alexandria under Decius. He begins (at 6.41.1) by describing the pogroms which began {{a year before}} Decius' decree of 250; that is, in 249, under Philip. At 6.41.9, Dionysius narrates the transition from Philip to Decius.|$|E

5|$|Here Sheng Ruozi <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> written {{selection}} about windmills {{from the}} 'Placid Retired Scholar', who is actually Yelü Chucai (1190–1244), a prominent Jin and Yuan statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the Mongols). The passage refers to Yelü's journey to Turkestan (modern Xinjiang) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan). Afterwards, the Chinese applied the 'fore-and-aft' sail riggings of typical Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills. These windmills {{were used to}} operate the square-pallet chain pumps used in Chinese irrigation since the ancient Han dynasty. Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in Tianjin and along the Yangtze River. The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in Jiangsu while traveling along the Grand Canal in 1656, {{as part of the}} Dutch embassy to Beijing. The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of East Anglia in 1191, who competed with the mills of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|Schubert {{composed}} {{his three}} last sonatas in close succession; furthermore, {{he intended to}} publish them together as a set, as evident by the sonatas' titles. In support of this view that the sonatas are a single unity, pianist and scholar Alfred Brendel has found profound musical links between the sonatas. He {{has argued that the}} sonatas complement each other in their different characters, and demonstrated that the entire sonata trilogy is based on the same basic group of intervallic motifs. Moreover, each of the sonatas contains a complex network of inner harmonic and motivic connections linking together all movements, and passages from one movement often reappear, usually transformed, in later movements. Most of these connections are too subtle to be detected during casual listening. In some cases, however, Schubert <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> theme or passage from an earlier movement with little alteration, inserting it in structurally significant locations, creating an immediately audible allusion. Such explicit connections are related to the cyclic form, one of the musical forms associated with the Romantic period in music.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{results were}} favorable, and a {{full-scale}} mockup was formally reviewed in March 1949. The prototype {{was completed by}} August 1949, but an incident involving the rival swept-wing Tupolev Tu-82 that broke an engine mount during a low-altitude flight led to delays as additional tests were demanded to determine {{the strength of the}} wings before the first flight was made. By the following year, the Il-30 program had lost momentum as the Ilyushin OKB was ordered to concentrate its resources on facilitating the service introduction of the Il-28. It was formally terminated by government order on 20 August 1950, and the prototype was eventually scrapped {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s. Aviation historian Bill Gunston <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> maiden flight date of 9 September 1949, but Vaclav Nemecek says 1951.|$|E

5|$|Sources give differing {{reports of}} what {{happened}} next. Wiesenthal's autobiographies contradict each other on many points; he also over-dramatised and mythologised events. One version has Wiesenthal opening an architectural office and finally being admitted to the Lwów Polytechnic for an advanced degree. He designed a tuberculosis sanatorium, along with some residential buildings {{during the course of}} his studies and was active in a student Zionist organisation. He wrote for the Omnibus, a satirical student newspaper, and graduated in 1939. Author Guy Walters states that Wiesenthal's earliest autobiography does not mention studies at Lwów. Walters <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> curriculum vitae Wiesenthal prepared after World War II as stating he worked as a supervisor at a factory until 1939 and then worked as a mechanic in a different factory until the Nazis invaded in 1941. Wiesenthal's 1961 book Ich Jagte Eichmann ("I Hunted Eichmann") states that he worked in Odessa as an engineer from 1940 to 1941. Walters says that there is no record of Wiesenthal attending the university at Lwów, and that he does not appear in the Katalog Architektów i Budowniczych (Catalogue of Architects and Builders) for the appropriate period.|$|E
5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

25|$|Repairs were {{initially}} estimated at 15 billion rubles ($610 million) but engineers {{found that more}} than 75% of the structure was unstable, and as a result the cost estimate jumped to 25.5 billion rubles (app. $850 million).

According to The Moscow Times, the true cost may have been double that, and Der Spiegel <b>quotes</b> <b>a</b> figure of $1.1 billion.
