25|$|After the day {{required}} to make the tank safe by purging remaining hydrogen gas with helium gas, NASA engineers prepared for disconnection of the vent arm and the significant number of lines prior to taking their {{first look at the}} GUCP. On the night of 9 November, technicians began disconnecting the GUCP by unhooking and lowering the hydrogen vent line. Teams performed an initial inspection of the flight seal and <b>quick</b> <b>disconnect</b> prior to sending them to labs for a thorough engineering analysis. Engineers reported an unevenly (asymmetrically) compressed internal seal and the <b>quick</b> <b>disconnect</b> hardware also seemed have a less concentric fit than pre-fueling measurements indicated.

Technicians took extra measurements to ensure the best possible alignment of the newly installed GUCP. Teams began installing the flight seal and <b>quick</b> <b>disconnect</b> on 15 November.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, thermal blankets to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive vent valve (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a <b>quick</b> <b>disconnect</b> valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a contamination test in the airlock.

Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and computer cables and configuring racks. They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} {{whether there is a}} particle impact ignition hazard in the <b>quick</b> <b>disconnects</b> (QDs) in the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) on the International Space Station (ISS), NASA Johnson Space Center requested White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) to perform particle impact testing.

This report summarizes the particle impact tests completed at WSTF.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to develop connectors (<b>quick</b> <b>disconnects</b> and umbilical systems) that can be repetitively and reliably mated and de-mated during Lunar surface extra-vehicular activities. These standardized interfaces will be required for structural integrity and commodities transfer between linked surface elements. QD's fittings are needed for EVA spacesuit Primary Life Support Systems as well as liquid cooled garment circulation and suit heat rejection. Umbilical electro-mechanical systems (connectors) are needed between discrete surface systems for transfer of air, power, fluid (water), and data must be capable of being operated by extra vehicular astronaut crew members and/or robotic assistants. There exists an urgent need to prevent electro-statically charged dust and debris from clogging and degrading the interface seals and causing leakage and spills of hazardous commodities, contaminating the flowstream, and degrading the mechanisms needed for umbilical connection. Other challenges include modularity, standardization, autonomous operation, and lifetime sealing issues...|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} domestic power installations the {{short-circuit current}} {{available on the}} electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high short circuit current is discussed in the previous paragraph. The short circuit current should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit protection clears a fault quickly. <b>Quick</b> <b>disconnecting</b> is needed, because in live-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise compared to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) during short circuit to a dangerous voltage, which needs {{to be shut down}} quickly for safety. If the short circuit current is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken {{to make sure that the}} system is safe; those usually include using a residual current device (sometimes called a ground fault interrupter) for extra protection.|$|R

40|$|Discovery of leakage {{on several}} International Space Station U. S.

The method was validated through extensive developmental testing. Test results showed the method was viable, accurate and repeatable {{for a wide range of}} leak rates. The accumulation method has been accepted by NASA and is currently being used by Boeing Huntsville, Boeing Kennedy Space Center and Boeing Johnson Space Center to test welds and valves and will be used by Alenia to test the Cupola.

40|$|With over 500, 000 {{gallons of}} liquid {{hydrogen}} and liquid oxygen, {{it is of}} vital importance to monitor the space shuttle vehicle (SSV) from external tank (ET) load through launch. The Hazardous Gas Detection System (HGDS) was installed as the primary system responsible for monitoring fuel leaks within the orbiter and ET. The HGDS was designed to obtain the lowest possible detection limits with the best resolution while monitoring the SSV for any hydrogen, helium, oxygen, or argon as the main requirement. The HGDS is a redundant mass spectrometer used for real-time monitoring during Power Reactant Storage and Distribution (PRSD) load and ET load through launch or scrub.

The original aqueous IATCS coolant used in Node 1, the Laboratory Module, and the Airlock consisted of water, borate (pH buffer), phosphate (corrosion control), and silver sulfate (microbiological control) at a pH of 9. 5 +/- 0. 5. Chemical changes occurred after on-orbit implementation including a decrease to pH 8. 4 due to the diffusion of carbon dioxide through the Teflon hoses, an increase in nickel ions due to general corrosion of heat exchanger braze coatings, a decrease in phosphate concentration due to precipitation of nickel phosphate, and the rapid disappearance of silver ions due to deposition on hardware surfaces. Also associated with the coolant chemistry changes {{was an increase in}} planktonic microorganisms from less than 100 colony forming units (CFU) per 100 ml to approximately 1 million CFU per 100 ml. Attachment and growth of microorganisms to the system surfaces (biofilm) was suspected due to the levels of planktonic microorganisms in the coolant.
