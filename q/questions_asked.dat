5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny having said such things, but argued that he had only been responding to <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few <b>questions</b> <b>asked.</b> The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million dollars per ship every year.|$|E

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

40|$|We {{supplement}} broad {{definitions of}} leadership behaviour {{with the concept}} of micro-level leadership behaviour, leaders’ verbal and non-verbal visible conduct and interaction. For the context of team decision-making, we identify two potentially beneficial micro-level leadership behaviours, <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and behavioural mimicry. Specifically, we propose that under conditions of informational complexity and unshared information, participative leadership is most appropriate for team decision-making, that its effects are mediated by inquiring and empathy, and that <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and mimicry are the behavioural micro-level manifestations of inquiring and empathy. We thus hypothesize that the effect of participative leadership on team decision quality and leader evaluation is mediated by <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and mimicry. We conduct a laboratory experiment with student teams working on a hidden profile decision-making task and measure <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> through behavioural coding and mimicry with motion sensors. Results show that the effect of participative leadership on decision quality is mediated by <b>question</b> <b>asking,</b> and that the effect of participative leadership on leader evaluation as transformational is mediated by leaders’ behavioural mimicry and <b>question</b> <b>asking.</b> Under control of these micro-level behaviours, team decision quality and leader evaluations were unrelated...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This review {{examines}} {{the use and}} effectiveness of Question Prompt Lists (QPL) as communication aids to enhance patient <b>question</b> <b>asking,</b> information provision to patients and patient participation in health and medical consultations. Methods: A systematic search was undertaken to identify relevant literature concerning QPLs including academic databases, Google-based and snowball searching. Forty-two relevant studies reporting 50 interventions were identified. Results: Although findings varied there was some evidence that a QPL endorsed by the physician increased total <b>question</b> <b>asking.</b> Using a QPL increased <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> concerning specific content areas (e. g. prognosis). There was some evidence that physicians provided more information during consultations. There were no consistent findings concerning effects on patient knowledge recall, anxiety and satisfaction or consultation time. Some interventions that increased <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> had longer consultation times. Conclusion: There is evidence that an appropriate QPL, endorsed by the physician and provided immediately before the consultation, may increase patient <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and lead to more information being provided by the physician. Practice implications: There is increasing evidence to support QPL use in routine practice. Further trials might address the issues identified including an assessment of QPL optimal length and QPL adaptation for cultural and special needs groups...|$|R

25|$|Though neither {{program was}} {{developed}} as a narrative work, the software programs ELIZA (1964–1966) and SHRDLU (1968–1970) can formally be considered early examples of interactive fiction, as both programs used natural language processing to take input from their user and respond in a virtual and conversational manner. ELIZA simulated a psychotherapist that appeared to provide human-like responses to the user's input, while SHRDLU employed an artificial intelligence that could move virtual objects around an environment and respond to <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> about the environment's shape.

30|$|To summarize, in Study ‐ I, three {{different}} kinds of questions are used with varying difficulty level. Specifically, Type ‐ 1 <b>question</b> <b>asks</b> users to identify the locations visited for a given day. Type ‐ 2 <b>question</b> <b>asks</b> users to identify the locations and the order of visits for a given day. Finally, Type ‐ 3 <b>question</b> <b>asks</b> users to identify the locations and the time window when the places are visited for a given day. In each case, possible answers to challenge questions are presented {{in the form of}} multiple choices to facilitate recall. In contrast, in Study ‐ II, Type ‐ 4 <b>question</b> <b>asks</b> where a user was at a certain time.

40|$|People use {{questions}} to elicit information {{from other people}} in their everyday lives and yet the most common method of obtaining information from a search engine is by posing keywords.

This paper focuses on improving document retrieval for the subset of natural language <b>questions</b> <b>asking</b> about how something is done. We classify <b>questions</b> as <b>asking</b> either for a description of a process or asking for a statement of fact, with better than 90 % accuracy. Further we identify non-content features of documents relevant to <b>questions</b> <b>asking</b> about a process. Finally we demonstrate that we can use these features to significantly improve the precision of document retrieval results for <b>questions</b> <b>asking</b> about a process. Our approach, based on exploiting the structure of documents, shows a significant improvement in precision at rank one for <b>questions</b> <b>asking</b> about how something is done...|$|R
