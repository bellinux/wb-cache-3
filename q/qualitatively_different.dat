Predators (birds) and humans (fishers) compete for prey (shellfish). The behavior of the system is studied and conditions for optimal control are deduced. Various optimal harvest rates are identified for particular ecosystem and economic parameters. We discuss optimal harvest rates, focusing on system characteristics that lead to the survival of birds. The approach path towards an optimal regime is shown <b>qualitatively</b> for <b>different</b> types of optimal harvest regimes...|$|R

Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the Elements: the first 28 propositions he presents are those that can be proved without it.|$|E
25|$|Some {{contemporary}} Orthodox Jews {{writers are}} concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then {{it could lead to}} the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that Darwinism is a problem for Judaism, since Darwinism makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> from other animals.|$|E
25|$|Many Kabbalistic sources, {{notably the}} Tanya, contain {{statements}} {{to the effect that}} the Jewish soul is <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> from the non-Jewish soul. Some prominent Kabbalists rejected this idea; they believed in the essential equality of all human souls. Menahem Azariah da Fano, in his book Reincarnations of souls, provides many examples of non-Jewish Biblical figures being reincarnated as Jews, and vice versa. Abraham Cohen de Herrera, another Kabbalist of the same school, quotes Greek, Christian and various Oriental mystics and philosophers without hesitation, and does not mention anything specific about the Jewish souls.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} expressing correctness guarantees of model-checking algorithms. The framework allows us to <b>qualitatively</b> compare <b>different</b> solution techniques for probabilistic model checking, both techniques based on statistical sampling and numerical computation of probability estimates. We provide several {{new insights into the}} relative merits of the different approaches. In addition, we present a new statistical solution method that can bound the probability of error under any circumstances by sometimes reporting undecided results. Previous statistical solution methods could only bound the probability of error outside of an “indifference region. ”...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses novel growth models {{composed}} of clusters of heterogeneous agents, and shows that limiting behavior of one-andtwo-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet models are <b>qualitatively</b> very <b>different.</b> As model sizes grow unboundedly, the coefficients of variations of extensive variables, {{such as the}} number of total clusters, and the numbers of clusters of specified sizes all approach zero in the one-parameter models, but not in the two-parameter models.

We first show that, in economies with preference shocks, governmental interventions {{subject to the same}} information requirements as those imposed on financial intermediaries, lead to stock market allocations that are not inferior to those attained under financial intermediation. Second, we argue that the necessary interventions are <b>qualitatively</b> no <b>different</b> from those required to implement stationary optimal allocations in OLG models without shocks to agents' intertemporal consumption preferences...|$|R
25|$|Working with {{experimental}} data, R. Dolen, D. Horn and C. Schmid {{developed some}} sum rules for hadron exchange. When a particle and antiparticle scatter, virtual particles can be exchanged in two <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> ways. In the s-channel, the two particles annihilate to make temporary intermediate states that fall apart {{into the final}} state particles. In the t-channel, the particles exchange intermediate states by emission and absorption. In field theory, the two contributions add together, one giving a continuous background contribution, the other giving peaks at certain energies. In the data, {{it was clear that}} the peaks were stealing from the background—the authors interpreted this as saying that the t-channel contribution was dual to the s-channel one, meaning both described the whole amplitude and included the other.|$|E
25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers {{that are consistent with}} our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods has shown that the hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Brown dwarfs of {{spectral}} classY are {{cooler than}} those of spectral classT and have <b>qualitatively</b> <b>different</b> spectra from them. A total of 17objects {{have been placed in}} classY as of August 2013. Although such dwarfs have been modelled and detected within forty light years by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) there is no well-defined spectral sequence yet with prototypes. Nevertheless, several objects have been assigned spectral classes Y0, Y1, and Y2. The spectra of these objects display absorption around 1.55 micrometers. Delorme et al. has suggested that this feature is due to absorption from ammonia and that this should be taken as indicating the T–Y transition, making these objects of type Y0. In fact, this ammonia-absorption feature is the main criterion that has been adopted to define this class. However, this feature is difficult to distinguish from absorption by water and methane, and other authors have stated that the assignment of class Y0 is premature.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the quantitative {{step of the}} medical imaging modality Thermo-acoustic Tomography (TAT). We model the radiation propagation by a system of Maxwell's equations. We show that the index of refraction of light and the absorption coefficient (conductivity) can be uniquely and stably reconstructed from a sufficiently large number of TAT measurements. Our method is based on verifying that the linearization of the inverse problem forms a redundant elliptic system of equations. We also observe that the reconstructions are <b>qualitatively</b> quite <b>different</b> from the setting where radiation is modeled by a scalar Helmholtz equation as in [10]. Comment: 23 page...|$|R
