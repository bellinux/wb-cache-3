It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (<b>qtd.</b> <b>in</b> Singh 1991).|$|E

2500|$|New Criticism {{was accused}} by critics {{of having a}} {{contradictory}} nature. Brooks writes, on the one hand, [...] "the resistance which any good poem sets up against all attempts to paraphrase it" [...] (<b>qtd.</b> <b>in</b> Leitch 2001) {{is the result of}} the poet manipulating and warping language to create new meaning. On the other hand, he admonishes the unity and harmony in a poem's aesthetics. These seemingly contradictory forces in a poem create tension and paradoxical irony according to Brooks, but critics questioned whether irony leads to a poem's unity or undermines it (Leitch 2001). Poststructuralists in particular saw a poem's resistance and warped language as competing with its harmony and balance that Brooks celebrates (Leitch 2001).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to arguing against historical, biographical, and didactic readings of a poem, Brooks {{believed that a}} poem should not be criticized {{on the basis of}} its effect on the reader. In an essay called [...] "The Formalist Critics," [...] he says that [...] "the formalist critic assumes an ideal reader: that is, instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, he attempts to find a central point of reference from which he can focus upon the structure of the poem or novel" [...] (<b>qtd.</b> <b>in</b> Rivkin, 24). While he admits that it is problematic to assume such a reference point, he sees it as the only viable option. Since the other options would be either to give any reading equal status with any other reading, or to establish a group of [...] "'qualified' readers" [...] and use those as a range of standard interpretations. In the first case, a correct or [...] "standard" [...] reading would become impossible; in the second case, an ideal reader has still been assumed under the guise of multiple ideal readers (Rivkin 24). Thus, Brooks does not accept the idea of considering critics' emotional responses to works of literature as a legitimate approach to criticism. He says that [...] "a detailed description of my emotional state on reading certain works has little to do with indicating to an interested reader what the work is and how the parts of it are related" [...] (Rivkin 24). For Brooks, nearly everything a critic evaluates must come from within the text itself. This opinion is similar to that expressed by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley in their famous essay [...] "The Affective Fallacy," [...] in which they argue that a critic is [...] "a teacher or explicator of meanings," [...] not a reporter of [...] "physiological experience" [...] in the reader (<b>qtd.</b> <b>in</b> Adams, 1029, 1027).|$|E

40|$|Objective – Studies {{have shown}} that therapy with beta-blockers reduces {{mortality}} in patients with heart fai-lure. However, there are no studies describing the effects of propranolol on the <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>in</b> this population. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the electrophysiologi-cal profile, mainly QT dispersion, of patients with heart fai-lure regularly using propranolol. Methods – Fifteen patients with heart failure and using propranolol were assessed over a period of 12 months. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were re-corded prior to the onset of beta-blocker therapy and after 3 months of drug use. Results – A significant reduction in heart rate, <b>in</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion and <b>in</b> QTc dispersion was observed, as was also an increase in the PR interval and <b>in</b> the <b>QT</b> interval, after the use of propranolol in an average dosage of 100 mg/day. Conclusion – Reduction <b>in</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion <b>in</b> patients with heart failure using propranolol may explain the re-duction in the risk of sudden cardiac death with beta-blo-cker therapy, in this specific group of patients.
