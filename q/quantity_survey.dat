In the first stage, the use of computers in architecture focused on the development of Computer Aided Design (CAD), that is, systems that simulated the use of drafting tools, and research was mainly concerned with the satisfaction of designers'ergonomic needs. In the second stage, there were efforts to use computer tools in non-graphical aspects of designing, {{such as the use of}} Data Base Management Systems (DBMS) in the <b>quantity</b> <b>survey</b> of buildings. The concern was to satisfy the cognitive needs of designers by focusing on the way information and knowledge were perceived, acquired, stored, and processed. In the third stage, the focus shifted to the development of realistic models of buildings to permit the assessment of design proposals. In the fourth stage, the focus was on studies concerned with the encoding of architectural knowledge into design tools (KBMS), and the discussion was whether to go towards design automation or design supporting tools. In the fifth stage, with the advent of the Internet and the development of communication tools, research became focused on the collaborative and social aspects of design activity.

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{pressure}} <b>quantity</b> <b>survey</b> is usually brought about {{by a lack of}} knowledge of the actual value of various roadway, branch and infrastructure resistances around the mine. If resistances are not known or are suspected to be erroneous then it is difficult or impossible to accurately replicate the circuit performance, on a ventilation modelling software program. The challenge for mine operators is to carefully decide what level of survey detail is required so that the appropriate adjustments can be made to an existing model or the appropriate data collected so a model can be built in the first instance. The level of survey detail required is totally dependent on the end use of the data and the criticality of the accuracy of the dataset, to the safety and viability of the business. Mine technical personnel should think clearly about the report outputs required that will help them better understand their mines and better prepare them to manage their own ventilation circuits, on an ongoing basis.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{assesses the}} {{implementation}} of value management (VM) in the South African construction industry, {{in the case of}} the Gauteng Province of South Africa. The data used in this study was derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data was collected via a detailed review of related literature. The primary data was collected through questionnaires which were distributed to construction professionals. The analysis was based on 103 completed questionnaires out of 200 that were sent out. This reflected a 52 per cent response rate. The study revealed the awareness levels of value management amongst construction professionals. It was found that the respondents first heard about the term ‘value management’ in an academic institution, from friends, colleagues, courses or the Internet. The extent to which VM is being employed was also revealed. In addition, the competency of the quantity surveyor in implementing VM was also examined. The study also assessed the future role of the quantity surveyor in VM and finally, the challenges affecting the adoption of VM in the construction industry were highlighted. It is therefore recommended that construction organisations in South Africa invest in value management on a larger scale in order to develop the South African construction industry. In this study valuable contributions are made to the body of knowledge on the subject of value management in the construction industry. The value of the study is to add new information on the position of VM implementation in the South African construction industry. M. Tech. (<b>Quantity</b> <b>Survey...</b>|$|E

40|$|To keep {{good and}} non-conflict {{relationships}} between {{doctors and nurses}} {{is not an easy}} task their stressful working environment. Despite the fact that both doctors and nurses have a common goal, and that is to provide the best care of their patients, there are situations leading to conflicts between doctors and nurses. Good relationships between nurses and doctors are a guarantee of a harmonized cooperation in the entire medical team. That is why it is important to avoid conflicts and, if any conflict has already occurred, it is important to use it {{for the benefit of the}} whole team. The goal of our work was to define the most frequented conflicts in hospitals from a point of nurse's view in a cooperation with doctors, and what impact these conflicts have on nurses' work. To process the data in the first part of my thesis, the quality method for a research survey was used. The data collection was implemented by interviews. The research sample group was composed of eight nurses working in bed departments of different hospitals. On the grounds of the quality survey I set four hypotheses which I tried to verify in the <b>quantity</b> <b>survey.</b> To collect the data in the quantity part a questionnaire survey was used and the research sample group was also composed of nurses working in bed departments. The data were being collected in the period of March through May. To assess the results 175 questionnaires were used. The hypothesis 1 - The most frequented conflicts between nurses and doctors root in a wrong communication, has been proven on the grounds of our findings. The hypothesis 2 - Conflicts between nurses and doctors result from increasing competences for nurses has been proven, too, as well as the hypothesis 3 - Conflicts between nurses and doctors result from misunderstanding nurses' and doctors' roles. The hypothesis 4 - Conflicts between nurses and doctors have a negative impact on nurses' work was proven, too. The results have also revealed that the second most frequented reasons for conflict situations represent personal qualities of doctors, which was not included in the hypotheses. In the summary of the thesis I incorporated some recommendations how to handle conflict situations effectively. This work should be a foundation for a potential follow- up research not only in this field, but it can also serve management teams in medical institutions.

(<b>Quantity</b> <b>Survey)</b> Abstract: South Africa’s {{education}} sector comprises various individuals, {{all with}} different backgrounds, and this sometimes creates challenges {{when it comes}} to the teaching and learning processes. The present research assessed the impact of culture on construction education in South Africa. The objectives of the study were to identify how culture affects construction education, to evaluate how culture affects the construction lecturers’ pedagogy, to determine how the lecturers’ culture affects students’ buy-in to studying construction-related degrees and also to determine the impact that culture has on gender aspects in construction education. The data used in this paper were derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data were collected through a detailed assessment of related literature. The primary data were likewise collected via a structured questionnaire aimed at 130 respondents who were students registered for Construction Management (CM), Quantity Surveying (QS), Civil Engineering and Building Science at a South African higher education institution. Out of the collected 130 questionnaires, only 101 were usable, representing a response rate of 78 per cent that was deemed viable for statistical analysis for this study. Data received from the questionnaires were analysed using descriptive statistics procedures. The higher education institution used for the study has a variety of students and lecturers: through this study it is evident that the cultural background of the students shapes their attitudes and values, knowledge base as well as the skill set and these, in turn, influencing classroom behaviours, their study habits, their writing styles and faculty student interactions. This research study revealed that culture is an important concept {{when it comes to}} education. Moreover, the study findings further revealed that {{when it comes to the}} construction industry, it is better to acknowledge that people are different, and that they come from different environments where people are used to doing things in different ways. It must also be acknowledged that in order to work effectively and efficiently, the needs of different individuals must be addressed and met. Also, the study found that in order to ensure students’ academic success, there should always be successful management of cultural differences, and people should learn more about the management of cultural differences. The study also revealed that the issue of career sexism still exists and this is an important issue that should be dealt with by government, industry, employers, higher education institutions and individuals. It is recommended that in order to manage cultural differences, students need to be aware of the cultural backgrounds of those with whom they work and interact since failure to manage cultural differences in a [...] ...|$|E
