5|$|The singers are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} the singers, the <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E

The <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> due to a statement of Jesus’ {{that there is no}} marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven as a detailed analysis of what he meant.|$|E

25|$|A natural <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to the}} {{relationship}} of the one-line and the canonical cycle notation. For example, considering the permutation (2)(31), which is in canonical cycle notation, if we erase its cycle parentheses, we obtain a different permutation in one-line notation, namely 231. (The permutation (2)(31) is actually 321 in one-line notation.) Foata's transition lemma establishes the nature of this correspondence as a bijection on the set of n-permutations (to itself). Richard P. Stanley calls this correspondence the fundamental bijection.|$|E
25|$|The <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to what}} {{motivated}} the socii to rebel after over a century of integration and seeming contentment.

As explained above, the political power conferred by the vote was mostly illusory and, in any event, the Latin colonists, who also did not have voting rights, did not rebel.|$|E

Evidently {{the lesson of}} the Packard One-Twenty had been weighing on the minds of the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively.

500|$|The <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> {{as to why}} the 4th-century army needed forts with {{enhanced}} defensive features {{whereas the}} 2nd-century army apparently did not. Luttwak argues that defensible forts were an integral feature of a 4th-century defence-in-depth [...] "grand strategy", while in the 2nd century [...] "preclusive defence" [...] rendered such forts unnecessary [...] But the existence of such a [...] "strategy" [...] is strongly disputed by several scholars, as many elements of the late Roman army's posture were consistent with continued forward defence. An alternative explanation is that preclusive defence was still in effect but was not working as well as previously and barbarian raids were penetrating the empire more frequently.(see Strategy, below) ...|$|E
500|$|Non-reductionist {{philosophers}} hold {{firmly to}} two essential convictions {{with regard to}} mind–body relations: 1) Physicalism is true and mental states must be physical states, but 2) All reductionist proposals are unsatisfactory: mental states cannot be reduced to behavior, brain states or functional states. Hence, the <b>question</b> <b>arises</b> whether there can still be a non-reductive physicalism. Donald Davidson's anomalous monism {{is an attempt to}} formulate such a physicalism. He [...] "thinks that when one runs across what are traditionally seen as absurdities of Reason, such as akrasia or self-deception, the personal psychology framework is not to be given up in favor of the subpersonal one, but rather must be enlarged or extended so that the rationality set out by the principle of charity can be found elsewhere." ...|$|E

In general, a symmetric operators could have many self-adjoint extensions or none at all. Thus, we would like a classification of its self-adjoint extensions.|$|E

[...] The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be short the dividend.|$|E

2500|$|Although the U.S. Supreme Court never {{ruled on}} the {{constitutionality}} of the state's creation, decisions such as those in Virginia v. West Virginia led to a de facto recognition of the state which is now considered unassailable. West Virginia's first constitution explicitly agreed to pay a portion of Virginia's debt in helping build roads, canals, railroads, and other public improvements in the new state. But these debts were never paid, and Virginia sued to recover them. In the case, Virginia v.
