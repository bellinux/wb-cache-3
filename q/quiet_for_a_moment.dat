60|$|He was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, then he {{took his}} pipe {{out of his mouth}} again, and chuckled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{the pain}} any easier, my darling?" [...] asked Mrs. Minot, {{leaning over the}} pillow, where the golden head lay <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Blunt kept <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> then: “You see,” he {{addressed}} me {{in a most}} refined tone, “a mere man may suddenly find himself being kicked down the stairs.” ...|$|E
60|$|Laura was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{and then}} with an effort looked up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we are {{certainly}} having {{a night of}} it," [...] remarked Dave, after the fun had <b>quieted</b> down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> He spoke to Roger.|$|R
6000|$|Olivia {{gave him}} a keen glance and was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> Then she said, [...] "It's possible! You feel you ought to thank her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When Marston {{had gone}} Flora {{sat down on}} the bench. She was pale and trembled. Wyndham, looking very grim, leaned against the wall. They were <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, and then he asked: ...|$|E
60|$|Carrie stood <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{with the}} jewels in her hand, while her color came and went. For all that, she looked calm and rather proud. She remembered that Bernard {{had not given}} the {{necklace}} to Evelyn.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Marvel {{by way of}} reply {{struggled}} to his feet, and was immediately rolled over again. He lay <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> [...] "If you struggle any more," [...] said the Voice, [...] "I shall throw the flint at your head." ...|$|E
60|$|She was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> and Mrs. Austin saw her shot {{had reached}} its mark. Her mood changed {{and she was}} sorry for the girl; Betty had pluck and was very frank.|$|R
60|$|The animal had <b>quieted</b> down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and was grazing on some grass {{between the}} automobiles. But, as the lads approached, {{he raised his}} head, pawed with his hoof, and gave a vicious snort.|$|R
6000|$|Betty was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> She {{looked tired}} and Kit {{imagined}} she knew {{all he knew}} about the pressure of the crowd. Then she said, [...] "If only we didn't push! Perhaps there's room enough, and we might make things better." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{others were}} <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. They {{felt they had}} got a hint, but the hint was vague. Somebody must take the hounds and they could not. They {{resolved}} to leave the thing to Herries; {{he was young and}} his remarks would not carry so much weight. Besides, he knew Mordaunt well.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie {{gave him}} a quick glance. His face was {{thoughtful}} and he frowned. She was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, and then smiled. [...] "I do not know him well. He was at the Woolsworth Store, but his was a better post than mine, and we didn't often meet. In fact, I don't think I liked him much." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, but Mrs. Austin {{waited and}} he went on: [...] "Well, I have done what I undertook, and Don Arturo {{has given me a}} better post. Perhaps the post is not very good, but I am going to ask Olivia if, when I have made some progress, she will marry me." ...|$|E
60|$|He was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> {{and looked}} about, {{knitting}} his brows. The surf was louder, {{the sky was}} red, and the mists glimmered, as if a glow shone through. Betty waited and said nothing. She had waited long, but Kit had returned to her.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin drew <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> little breath. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> his haggard {{face seemed}} almost ghastly. He {{recovered}} himself, however, with an effort.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind,' said Mr Meagles. 'If I am grave about it, I am {{not at all}} sorrowful. It <b>quiets</b> me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{but does}} not make me unhappy. Pet had a twin sister who died when we could just see her eyes--exactly like Pet's--above the table, as she stood on tiptoe holding by it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man's smart enough, as a rule; but we {{all have}} our weak moments. This, however, {{is not the kind of}} thing that's likely to lead to his advancement." [...] He lay <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two; and then went on: [...] "I'm {{grateful}} to you. Had you much trouble in persuading Bland to let you have the letter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Chisholm was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, {{and then}} resumed: [...] "That is not {{altogether}} what I meant; in fact, it's hard to state frankly what I do mean. I like Harry Wyndham. He's clever, resolute, {{and a good}} sportsman, but {{when he wanted to}} marry Flora I hesitated. Well, your story has given me some comfort. You have been with Wyndham and are satisfied. One can trust you." ...|$|E
60|$|Mabel simply acquainted {{him with}} the spot where {{and the manner in}} which she had found the bit of cloth. While she was speaking, the eye of the Quartermaster was not <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> glancing from the rag to the face of our heroine, then back again to the rag. That his suspicions were awakened was easy to be seen, nor was he long in letting it be known what {{direction}} they had taken.|$|E
60|$|There {{came that}} kind of pause that happens when a subject is {{broached}} too big and difficult for the gathering. Margaret's blue eyes regarded the speaker with <b>quiet</b> disapproval <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and then {{came to me in}} the not too confident hope that I would snub him out of existence with some prompt rhetorical stroke. A voice spoke out of the big armchair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor child!" [...] said Bernardo, {{looking at}} her with <b>quiet</b> {{penetration}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. Then he said: [...] "Go, Romola--go home and rest. These fears may be only big ugly shadows of something very little and harmless. Even traitors must see their interest in betraying; the rats will run where they smell the cheese, {{and there is no}} knowing yet which way the scent will come." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped abruptly, and Jake heard a step. They were <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{and then}} Tom Shanks came round {{a corner of}} the bank and stood looking at them. Jim's face was cut and rather white, but the stains on his clothes {{indicated}} that he had been working among wet soil. Jake gave Shanks a keen glance and thought he looked surprised, as if he had not expected to see Jim there.|$|R
60|$|Flora was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. She {{had heard}} her friends talk about Wyndhams' and it was plain that they thought {{the new head of}} the house {{something}} of an adventurer. For all that, she was moved. She liked his frankness and his resolution. Looking about, she saw Marston and a girl she knew cross the lawn, and was tempted to join them. Had {{it not been for the}} glamour of the moonlight and sparkling sea, she might have gone.|$|E
6000|$|Macallister was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two. Then he said. [...] "We {{have half}} a gallon o' smelling water, {{and there are}} eight o' us! As a rule, I ha' no' much use for water, but I mind when we broke the {{condensing}} plant on a coolie pilgrim boat. Ye could not fill your tanks at every coaling station then. I got some water from the hot well; tasting o' copper and grease. We fed the boilers from the sea and drove her, with funnel flaming and tubes caked wi' salt. Iron burns, ye ken, unless it's clean, and I thought the softening furnaces would blow down. She was crowded fore an' aft wi' sweating, gasping coolies, and we let her gang. When we made port I swallowed maist a gallon o' lemonade, claret and ice. Man, I hear the ice tinkling against the pail!" ...|$|E
60|$|She drew {{herself up}} suddenly, and {{by dint of}} a fierce brief effort of will {{repressed}} for awhile the mad dance that overmastered her. The spirit within her, if spirit it were, kept <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> awed and subdued by her proud determination. Then it began once more and led her resistlessly forward. She moved over to the chest of drawers still rhythmically and with set steps, but to the phantom strain of some unheard low music. The music was running vaguely through her head all the time--wild Aeolian music--it sounded like a rude tune on a harp or zither. And surely the cymbals clashed now and again overhead; and the timbrel rang clear; and the castanets tinkled, keeping time with the measure. She stood still and listened. No, no, not a sound save the rain on the roof. It was the music of her own heart, beating irregularly and fiercely to an intermittent lilt, like a Hungarian waltz or a Roumanian tarantella.|$|E
6000|$|Kit {{said he did}} not; he had no money, but if the {{men were}} not released, it was {{possible}} the Spanish government would send soldiers to look for them. The headman let this go and asked what his and Macallister's occupation was. Simon replied, {{and the other was}} <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b> Then he said: [...] "I have a better gun than yours, but sometimes it does not shoot. If this man knows machines, let him mend it." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{remaining}} thus <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> {{suddenly it}} would give a gasp, and immediately afterwards there would burst forth a thundering explosion, which seemed to come up from a great depth below, and threw into the air a shower of stones and scraps of molten lava, which, after ascending to a great height, came down again, and fell, with a dripping sound, upon and around the cone. Similar explosions occurred at intervals of a few minutes, {{all the time that}} the party remained.|$|R
60|$|I <b>quieted</b> that anxiety. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{there was}} even {{the shadow of a}} smile on his face, as I told him of the effort that Penrose had vainly made to be the {{companion}} of my journey. He asked me, by another gesture, to bend my ear to him once more.|$|R
60|$|He {{then mounted}} his horse, and lifting his hat, rode towards {{the back of}} the mountain, {{descending}} at the same time, and was soon hid by the trees. Frances sprang forward with a lightened heart, and taking the first path that led downwards, in a few minutes she reached the plain in safety. While busied in stealing through the meadows towards the house, the noise of horse approaching startled her, and she felt how much more was to be apprehended from man, in some situations, than from solitude. Hiding her form in the angle of a fence near the road, she remained <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and watched their passage. A small party of dragoons, whose dress was different from the Virginians, passed at a brisk trot. They were followed by a gentleman, enveloped in a large cloak, whom she at once knew to be Harper. Behind him rode a black in livery, and two youths in uniform brought up the rear. Instead of taking the road that led by the encampment, they turned short to the left and entered the hills.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hang {{the vastness}} of the sum! Try to keep <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and see how it would seem; a body can't get in a word edgeways, you talk so much. You ought to cure that, Marco; it isn't good form, you know, and it will grow on you if you don't check it. Yes, we'll step in here now and price this man's stuff--and don't forget to {{remember}} to not let on to Jones that you know he {{had anything to do with}} it. You can't think how curiously sensitive and proud he is. He's a farmer--pretty fairly well-to-do farmer --and I'm his bailiff; but--the imagination of that man! Why, sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you'd think he was one of the swells of the earth; and you might listen to him a hundred years and never take him for a farmer--especially if he talked agriculture. He thinks he's a Sheol of a farmer; thinks he's old Grayback from Wayback; but between you and me privately he don't know as much about farming as he does about running a kingdom--still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop your underjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard such incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid you might die before you got enough of it. That will please Jones." ...|$|E
60|$|We were a {{mile from}} shore; a little steam-tug put out from the land; she was an object of thrilling interest; she would climb to the summit of a billow, reel drunkenly there a moment, dim and gray in the driving storm of spindrift, then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sight until one had given her up, then up she would dart again, on a steep slant toward the sky, {{shedding}} Niagaras of water from her forecastle--and this she kept up, {{all the way out}} to us. She brought twenty-five passengers in her stomach--men and women--mainly a traveling dramatic company. In sight on deck were the crew, in sou'westers, yellow waterproof canvas suits, and boots to the thigh. The deck was never <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and seldom nearer level than a ladder, and noble were the seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft. We rove a long line to the yard-arm, hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it out into the spacious air of heaven, and there it swayed, pendulum-fashion, waiting for its chance--then down it shot, skillfully aimed, and was grabbed by the two men on the forecastle. A young fellow belonging to our crew was in the chair, to be a protection to the lady-comers. At once a couple of ladies appeared from below, took seats in his lap, we hoisted them into the sky, waited a moment till the roll of the ship brought them in overhead, then we lowered suddenly away, and seized the chair as it struck the deck. We took the twenty-five aboard, and delivered twenty-five into the tug--among them several aged ladies, and one blind one--and all without accident. It was a fine piece of work.|$|E
60|$|After {{measuring}} the distance, Jim sank down and crawled {{to the top}} of the wall. Since the other had an ax, surprise would be a useful, and perhaps necessary, advantage in the attack. Jim meant to attack; there was no use in talking before the fellow was in his power. As he crept forward a few stones rolled down the hill. He wondered what had disturbed them, but thought it imprudent to turn round, and lay <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> when the chopping stopped. He could not see the man now, because he was hidden by the top of the wall.|$|R
60|$|The {{narrative}} {{lost something}} of its force after {{she came to}} the finding of the broken range. She saw she had been franker than she thought, and the change in Thirlwell could not be talked about. It was dark now, the red and green had faded above the trees, and she was grateful for the gloom. She was not afraid of George and Farnam, but did not want Mabel to study her. Only the latter noted that she paused awkwardly now and then and added a rather involved explanation. The men were engrossed by Thirlwell's efforts to find the ore. When she stopped they were <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mordaunt {{stopped in}} the gloom where a nut-bush hung over the gate of a ride. Somebody had {{disturbed}} the birds; one could trust the pigeons to give the alarm when an enemy was about. Mordaunt was a sportsman and a good shot, but he waited {{because he wanted to}} find some relief from his tormenting thoughts. He was just inside the Langrigg boundary and imagined the gamekeeper began his round {{at the other end of}} the estate. By and by dry underbrush rustled and there was a noise like a briar dragging across somebody's clothes. Afterwards all was <b>quiet</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments,</b> until <b>a</b> dark figure came out of the gloom close to the gate.|$|R
