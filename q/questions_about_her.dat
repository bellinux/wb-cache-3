25|$|Allegedly paid 100,000 francs (some sources state 500 pounds), Renée Garry's {{actions have}} been {{attributed}} by some, at least partially to Garry's suspicion she had lost the affections of SOE agent France Antelme to Inayat Khan. After the war, she was tried, but escaped conviction by one vote. On or around 13 October 1943, Inayat Khan was arrested and interrogated at the SD Headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris.

500|$|During production, Menzel and Jonathan Groff, who portrays Kristoff, {{went to the}} {{animation}} studio {{to explain to the}} animators how they were approaching their characters. Animators asked Menzel <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> singing, observed how she breathed as she sang live, and made videorecordings of her recording sessions; they then animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing, for further realism. [...] Her voice supplied inspiration for Elsa's most prominent song, [...] "Let It Go".

Menzel commented that it was [...] "an honor" [...] to have the song and that she enjoyed recording it. [...] "It's a collision of a bunch of forces that are all coming together in the right way," [...] she explained. [...] "The character, what she is singing and what she is experiencing; beautiful lyrics, beautiful melody {{and a little bit of}} me."
