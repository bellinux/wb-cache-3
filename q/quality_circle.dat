40|$|<b>Quality</b> <b>circles</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} interesting employee participation initiatives of the I 980 s. According to their advocates they improve industrial relations, increase productivity and improve product <b>quality.</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>circles</b> were developed in Japan and embody some fundamental principles of Japanese management. Outside Japan, however, <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> have had a consistently high failure rate, leading some commentators to suggest that they have a distinct life cycle. This article examines this contention by comparing the operation of <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> in two divisions of a large manufacturing company in Australia and noting the factors that contributed to success and failure. It concludes that <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> were used strategically in both cases to help introduce a more participative management style. The impact of <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> on the existing pattern of industrial relations is assessed, particularly the changes in relations between the major groups in the organization, the response of the unions to the programmes and their effect on the supervisors. Of all the recent innovations in employee participation practices perhaps the most notable has been the introduction of <b>quality</b> <b>circles.</b> In Australia durin...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: <b>Quality</b> <b>circles</b> {{comprise}} {{small group}} sessions {{of doctors and}} written feedback on their individual practice patterns. Although 50 % of German primary care doctors participate in <b>quality</b> <b>circles,</b> their effectiveness has hardly been evaluated in Germany. This study determined {{the impact of a}} large-scale programme of <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> on <b>quality</b> and costs of prescribing. METHOD: A controlled before-after study was performed, in which primary care doctors were allocated to a <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> group or a control group. Subjects were 100, 000 patients in 1996 and in 1998, who had visited one of 177 doctors in the 3 month registration periods in one region in Germany. The intervention comprised a <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> programme, comprising 11 sessions and repeated feedback on prescribing. Main outcome measures were proportion of patients who received a prescription, mean prescription costs per patient and proportion of generic prescriptions. RESULTS: The absolute numbers of prescriptions decreased in both groups, but the mean prescription costs per patient increased. The <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> reduced the proportion of patients who received a prescription (OR = 0. 86) and the mean prescription costs per patient (B = - 3. 99 euro), while it increased the proportion of generic drugs (OR = 1. 10). The intervention had intended effects on four of the 15 secondary indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale application of <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> had intended effects on prescribing decisions in primary care in Germany. The effects found in this study may reflect better what improvements can be achieved than randomized trials of similar interventions...|$|R

The data-collection techniques were individual semi-structured interviews and field notes. The sample was drawn from a population of 425 Xhosa-speaking professional nurses employed in this institution. The sample comprised eight (8) professional nurses all of whom volunteered for in-depth individual semi-structured interviews. All the respondents answered one question "How do you perceive the implementation of the <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> programme in your hospital?" During data collection and analysis only one theme emerged, namely the perception of <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> as a forum for discussing patient care problems and future plans. There were four broad categories in this theme, namely &# 61558; Staff empowerment &# 61558; Teambuilding in the nursing discipline &# 61558; Maintenance of standards by nurses &# 61558; Challenges to the momentum of a <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> programme It is recommended that all three tiers of nursing management be involved in the <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> programme to improve interpersonal, interdepartmental and intradepartmental communication and concomitantly the nursing care.

The first circles started at the Nippon Wireless and Telegraph Company; the idea then spread to more than 35 other companies in the first year.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect on}} antibiotic prescribing of an intervention in existing local <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> promoting an evidence-based guideline for acute rhinosinusitis. Design: A pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing standard dissemination of the guideline by mail with an additional strategy using <b>quality</b> <b>circles.</b> Setting: General practice in Flanders, Belgium. Participants: General practitioners (GPs) in 18 local <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> were randomly allocated to two study arms. All GPs received the guideline by mail. GPs in the nine <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> allocated to the intervention arm received an additional group intervention, which consisted of one self-led meeting using material introduced to the group moderator {{by a member of}} the research team. Main outcome measures: Adherence to the guideline was measured as differences in the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions, including the choice of antibiotic, between the two study arms after the intervention period. GPs registered their encounters with patients presenting with signs and symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis in a booklet designed for the study. Results: A total of 75 doctors (29 % of GPs in the participating <b>quality</b> <b>circles)</b> registered 408 consultations. In the intervention group, 56. 9 % of patients received an antibiotic compared with 58. 3 % in the control group. First-choice antibiotics were issued in 34. 5 % of antibiotic prescriptions in the intervention group compared with 29. 4 % in the control group. After adjusting for patient and GP characteristics, the ORadi for antibiotics prescribed in the intervention arm compared with the control arm was 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 29 to 1. 37). There was I no effect on the choice of antibiotic (ORadi 1. 07, 95 % CI 0. 34 to 3. 37). Conclusion: A single intervention in <b>quality</b> <b>circles</b> of GPs integrated in the group's normal working procedure did not have a significant effect on the quality of antibiotic prescribing. More attention to the context and structure of primary care practice, and insight into the process of self-reflective learning may provide clues to optimise the effectiveness of <b>quality</b> <b>circles...</b>|$|R
