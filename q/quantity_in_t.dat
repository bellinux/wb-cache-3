Para representa????o das unidades de mapeamento foram caracterizados a campo e coletados 9 perfis de solo, representando as classes dos Argissolos, Cambissolos, Chernossolos, Luvissolos e Neossolos. Em rela????o aos nutrientes, a classe de solo que apresentou uma maior quantidade de nutrientes dispon??veis em t. ha- 1, na microbacia, foi o Cambissolo, seguido do Luvissolo, do Chernossolo, do Neossolo e dos Argissolos. Em rela????o aos nutrientes totais, a classe de solo que apresentou uma maior quantidade em t. ha- 1, na microbacia, foi o Argissolo, seguido do Neossolo, do Luvissolo, do Chernossolo e do Cambissolo.

That way, the water and nutrient availability to the plants become of great importance and may be evaluated by means of physical, chemical and mineralogical analysis and its interpretation of local conditions. This study had the objective of surveying and mapping the soils of a hydrographic microbasin used in the culture of eucalyptus, relating its physico-hydrical and chemical characteristics with the culture development. The study area has 63, 53 hectares and belongs to VPC Florestal, located in the Alamos Farm in the city of Pinheiro Machado, where the culture of eucalyptus saligna is being cultivated. To represent the mapping units were characterized in field and collected 9 soil profiles, representing the classes of Argisoils, Cambisoils, Chernosoils, Luvisoils and Neosoils. In relation to total nutrients, the class of soil that presented the greater quantity of available nutrients in t. ha- 1 in the microbasin was the Cambisoil, followed by Luvisoil, Chernosoil, Neosoil and Argisoil. Relating to total nutrients, the class of soil that showed a greater <b>quantity</b> <b>in</b> <b>t</b> in the microbasin was the Argisoil, followed by the Neosoil, Luvisoil, Chernosoil and Cambisoil. The soils present in the hydrographic microbasin of the Alamos Farm have a total of 1300 basic available cations and a total of 15770 basic cations. As for the water availability, the Alamos Farm has a storing capacity in its soil of 121245 m?? of water, of those 20778 m?? available to the plants.

The native T. pallidum antigen was purified to homogeneity from the mixture of Triton X- 114 detergent-phase proteins by chromatofocusing.

Southern hybridization with a 1. 1 -kilobase fragment of DNA encoding the 15 -kDa-antigen gene indicated that the gene is probably present in a single copy within the genomes of both T. pallidum and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (the agent of yaws), while it is absent from the genome of the nonpathogenic Treponema phagedenis biotype Reiter.

40|$|AbstractRecently, we have {{developed}} several techniques in order to accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) molec- ular simulations. For that purpose, two strategies were followed. In the first, new algorithms were proposed {{as a set of}} early rejection schemes performing faster than the conventional al- gorithm while preserving the accuracy of the method. On the other hand, a reweighting and reconstruction scheme was introduced that is capable of retrieving primary quantities and sec- ond derivative properties at several thermodynamic conditions from a single MC Markov chain. The latter scheme, was first developed to extrapolate <b>quantities</b> <b>in</b> NV <b>T</b> ensemble for struc- tureless Lennard-Jones particles. However, it is evident that for most real life applications the NpT ensemble is more convenient, as pressure and temperature are usually known. Therefore, in this paper we present an extension to the reweighting and reconstruction method to solve NpT problems utilizing the same Markov chains generated by the NV T ensemble simulations. Eventually, the new approach allows elegant switching between the two ensembles for several quantities at a wide range of neighboring thermodynamic conditions...|$|R

We find that the butterfly velocities can be expressed by a universal formula v_ B^ 2 = TS/(2 V_ th P).

We also show that the volume formula implies that the conjectured reverse isoperimetric inequality follows straightforwardly from the null-energy condition, for static AdS black holes. The inequality is thus related to an upper bound of the butterfly velocities. Comment: Latex, 25 pages, typos corrected and references added.
