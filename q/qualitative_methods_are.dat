To enforce his point, he gives the example of research that was recently conducted about the National Television Channel of Greece. Moreover, through the theoretical review, he asserts that the application of all <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>is</b> a way to transfer ourselves from observation to focusing and depth interviews. He believes that such an application can be really effective while collecting data as well as while analyzing and presenting the results of the research. Finally, it is his firm conviction that this shift to qualitative multi-methods can be also achieved in other scientific fields, apart from that of mass media...|$|R

At that time, good qualitative references were scarce and most qualitative people seldom spoke with quantitative people and vice versa. In addition, most of the material on <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>was</b> from disciplines that were foreign {{to me at the}} time.

50|$|Some {{distinctive}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> the use {{of focus}} groups and key informant interviews, the latter often identified through sophisticated and sometimes, elitist, snowballing techniques. The focus group technique (e.g., Morgan, 1988) involves a moderator facilitating a small group discussion between selected individuals on a particular topic, with video and handscribed data recorded, and is useful in a coordinated research approach studying phenomenon in diverse ways in different environments with distinct stakeholders often excluded from traditional processes. This method is a particularly popular in market research and testing new initiatives with users/workers.|$|E
5000|$|The ease of {{quantification}} {{is one of}} {{the features}} used to distinguish hard and soft sciences from each other. Scientists often consider hard sciences to be more scientific or rigorous, but this is disputed by social scientists who maintain that appropriate rigor includes the qualitative evaluation of the broader contexts of qualitative data. In some social sciences such as sociology, quantitative data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable. Thus in these cases <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> preferred.|$|E
50|$|Incompatibilists {{maintain}} that problems arise {{not so much}} {{at the level of}} practice, but at the level of epistemological paradigms.

HOWE 1998, argues that a principle implicit in the incompatibilist's argument ‘that abstract paradigms should determine research methods in a one-way fashion—is untenable’. That paradigms must demonstrate their worth in terms of how they inform, and are informed by, research methods that are successfully employed. Given such a two-way relationship between methods and paradigms, paradigms are evaluated in terms of how well they square with the demands of research practice and incompatibilism vanishes.|$|E

Within the study of interpersonal communication, some of the concepts explored include the following: personality, knowledge structures and social interaction, language, nonverbal signals, emotion experience and expression, supportive communication, social networks and the life of relationships, influence, conflict, computer-mediated communication, interpersonal skills, interpersonal communication in the workplace, intercultural perspectives on interpersonal communication, escalation and de-escalation of romantic relationships, interpersonal communication and healthcare, family relationships, and communication across the life span.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the start}} of the 20th century, Enlightenment {{philosophy}} was challenged in various quarters. After the use of classical theories {{since the end of the}} scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure. The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science. Increasingly, quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences. In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics. Statistical methods were used confidently.|$|E

In this communication, {{we intend to}} present the principles of this methodological approach in human and social sciences.

The main operations of the systemic <b>qualitative</b> <b>method</b> <b>are</b> the iterative definition of the framework, the identification of the recurrences and circular causalities, and the modelling of relations/social exchanges.

5000|$|Research {{methods are}} [...] "technique(s) for ... {{gathering}} data" [...] and are either quantitative or qualitative. It {{has been argued}} that methodology has been gendered (Oakley 1997; 1998), with quantitative methods traditionally being associated with words such as positivism, scientific, objectivity, statistics and masculinity, while qualitative methods have generally been associated with interpretivism, non-scientific, subjectivity and femininity. These associations have led some feminist researchers to criticise or even reject the quantitative approach, arguing that it is in direct conflict with the aims of feminist research, though other have argued that this rejection is merely because those feminist writers did not like the results of the quantitative analysis. It {{has been argued that}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> more appropriate for feminist research by allowing subjective knowledge (read untestable facts and assertions based on 'common knowledge'), and a more equal relationship between the researcher and the researched (Westmarland: 2001).

5000|$|The rise of industrialism {{had created}} a series of social, economic, and {{political}} problems, particularly in managing supply and demand in their political economy, the management of resources for military and developmental use, the creation of mass education systems to train individuals in symbolic reasoning and problems in managing the effects of industrialization itself. The perceived senselessness of the [...] "Great War" [...] {{as it was then}} called, of 1914-18, now called World War I, based in what were perceived to be [...] "emotional" [...] and [...] "irrational" [...] decisions, provided an immediate impetus for a form of decision making that was more [...] "scientific" [...] and easier to manage. Simply put, to manage the new multi-national enterprises, private and governmental, required more data. More data required a means of reducing it to information upon which to make decisions. Numbers and charts could be interpreted more quickly and moved more efficiently than long texts. Conversely, the interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behavior and social and environmental factors affecting it have made many of the so-called hard sciences dependent on social science methodology. Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social studies of medicine, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science.

5000|$|One of {{the major}} sources of methods and {{approaches}} to writing center assessment comes from writing assessment at large, and programmatic assessment. James Bell argues that directors of writing centers should [...] "turn to educational program evaluation and select general types of evaluations most appropriate for writing centers". Writing center assessment methods can largely {{be divided into two}} major forms of methods: qualitative and quantitative. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>methods</b> <b>are</b> predicated on the desire to understand teaching and learning from the actions and perspectives of teachers and learners, and has largely dominated knowledge making in composition studies, particularly in the last twenty years. Quantitative methods, meanwhile, stem from the belief that the world works in predictable patterns, ones that might be isolated in terms of their causes and effects or the strengths of their relationships (i.e., correlation). The use of quantitative methods in writing center contexts leaves room for issues to arise, however, such as data being interpreted incorrectly to support the work of the writing center, or not choosing appropriate data to measure student success like ACT writing test scores or course grades in first-year composition courses. Some writing scholars endorse quantitative methods more thoroughly than others, and see them as most helpful when reframed in a postmodern epistemology since most writing center directors subscribe to a theory of epistemology that sees knowledge as constructed, tenuous, and relative. Writing center scholars such as Stephen North group these methodologies into three larger approaches: Reflections on Experience, or looking back of writing center events to help others out in similar situations; Speculation, or a theory of how writing centers should work; and Surveys, or what he champions as enumeration. Fitting into and blending these methods, several writing studies scholars have published articles on methods used in assessing different elements of writing centers which {{can be seen in the}} sections below.|$|E
30|$|Since {{one of the}} {{objectives}} {{of this study is}} to develop a practical framework for environmental NGOs to bring change on corporate environmental responsibility practices, <b>qualitative</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> more appropriate for this research. Another reason for selecting <b>qualitative</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> that this area of research is very limited. As a result, an in-depth investigation as to how the environmental NGOs bring a desired difference on corporate environmental responsibility practice and what strategies should they use to this end is important. We use both primary and secondary data. In collecting the primary data, we conducted extensive interviews, for an average time of about 45 min, with four directors of environmental NGOs and one government official. The primary motivation for an in-depth structured interview is to have access to the relevant experiences and knowledge of NGOs’ leaders as well as to have detailed information as much as possible.|$|R

Moreover, <b>qualitative</b> <b>method</b> <b>was</b> also used to support the results from questionnaires. Conclusion: The research attempts to examine the different factors that influence consumers' purchasing intentions of private label brands among Thai undergraduate students. Five important factors were identified; there are collectivist culture, perceived risk, price, quality and store loyalty. Collectivist culture and perceived risk were found out to be important background factors which affect the other three factors. Furthermore, the result shows that price and quality of private label brands are highly related {{as most of the}} target consumers tend to associate expensiveness with high quality and vice-versa. However, the effect of store loyalty on consumers' (Thai undergraduate students) purchasing intention was found out to be insignificant...|$|R
