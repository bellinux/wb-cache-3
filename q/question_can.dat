40|$|People {{working in}} service {{agencies}} constantly ask questions. During an intake process, questions may assess need and eligibility; in a counseling session, questions may focus on strengths and diagnoses; in an advocacy or organizing setting, the <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> be about root causes, power and strategy. While some <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> seem intrusive and coercive, other <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> "open {{the door to}} dialogue and discovery" and invite "creativity and breakthrough thinking. " <b>Questions</b> <b>can</b> illuminate new opportunities and build a stronger foundation for relationships. Tapping into the power of questions to generate new possibilities and ignite change is an important tool for service providers working to help people and communities.

25|$|The {{gentamicin}} protection assay {{is commonly}} used in pathogen research. The contribution of specific genes or proteins to the bacteria's ability to invade cells can be easily assayed using this method. The gene in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be knocked out, and the bacteria's invasiveness {{compared with that of}} normal, wild type bacteria. Environmental conditions, such as pH level and temperature, can also be assayed for their effect on invasiveness.|$|E
25|$|When {{the benefit}} does justify the procedure, then the {{radiation}} exposure (the amount of radiation {{given to the}} patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image {{and make it more}} photographically appealing, but if the clinical <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|That is to say, the <b>question</b> <b>can</b> only be {{answered}} {{in terms of}} the broader goals of the program, which are not known to the general-purpose library function. Nonetheless, exiting with an error message is only rarely the right answer. So instead of simply exiting with an error, the function may establish restarts offering various ways to continue—for instance, to skip the log entry, to supply default or null values for the unreadable fields, to ask the user for the missing values, or to unwind the stack and abort processing with an error message. The restarts offered constitute the mechanisms available for recovering from error; the selection of restart by the condition handler supplies the policy.|$|E

25|$|The growth speed {{relevant}} to this <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be independently measured by researching the bone structure. In 1998 Zhang determined that growth was fast, leading to fibrolamellar bone. Comparison with the bone structure of an alligator indicated that Confuciusornis had a high metabolism {{comparable to that of}} modern birds. The growth speed of Confuciusornis would have been similar to that of Beipiaosaurus. A study by Armand de Ricqlès in 2003 indicated that growth was essentially modern, Confuciusornis reaching its maximum size in at most twenty weeks, perhaps as few as thirteen. Basal birds would have limited their size, not by slowing growth but by limiting the period of growth. A 2013 study found medullary bone in a short tailed specimen, confirming that it was female.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of this conclusion {{is that it allows}} Davidson to draw on the work of Alfred Tarski in giving the nature of a theory of meaning. Tarski showed how we can give a compositional theory of truth for artificial languages. Thus, Davidson takes three questions to be central to radical interpretation. Firstly, can a theory of truth be given for a natural language? Secondly, given the evidence plausibly available for the radical interpreter, can they construct and verify a theory of truth for the language they wish to interpret? Thirdly, will having a theory of truth suffice for allowing the radical interpreter to understand the language? Davidson has shown, using the work of Tarski, that the first <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be answered affirmatively.|$|E
25|$|One may ask {{analytic}} {{questions about}} algebraic numbers, and use analytic means to answer such questions; {{it is thus}} that algebraic and analytic number theory intersect. For example, one may define prime ideals (generalizations of prime numbers {{in the field of}} algebraic numbers) and ask how many prime ideals there are up to a certain size. This <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be answered by means of an examination of Dedekind zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, a key analytic object at the roots of the subject. This {{is an example of a}} general procedure in analytic number theory: deriving information about the distribution of a sequence (here, prime ideals or prime numbers) from the analytic behavior of an appropriately constructed complex-valued function.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in Austria, {{there is}} no law in effect in Germany {{requiring}} the return of Nazi-looted art, as long as the items in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be proven to have been, at any point in time, legally acquired. As signatories of the 1998 Washington Agreement, Germany agreed that all of its public institutions would check their inventories for Nazi-looted goods and return them if found. However, this is on a strictly voluntary basis and, 15 years later, very few museums and libraries have done so. Individuals are under no legal requirement whatsoever to return Nazi-looted art. Any failure {{on the part of the}} German government to return the rightful possessions of Cornelius Gurlitt might very well prove to be a violation of his property rights as guaranteed in the German constitution.|$|E
25|$|A {{regional}} technical commission harmonizes {{mechanisms for}} accreditation across member nations, and resolves any situation not {{be covered by}} the equivalency table. This commission includes delegations from the ministries of education of each member nation, and meets whenever at least two member states think it necessary. Meeting sites are established on a rotating basis. Any disputes among member states as a result of application, construction, or noncompliance regarding provisions related to education are initially resolved by direct diplomatic negotiations. Should the countries not reach an accord or only partially resolve the dispute, they resort to procedures set out in the dispute resolution system. Should the member nations enter into a bilateral convention or accord with provisions more favorable to their students, the member states in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> apply whichever provisions they consider most advantageous.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2009, a Manhattan {{district}} attorney charged a financier with the suspected misuse of Manhattan banks employed to transfer money between China and Iran {{by way of}} Europe and the United States.

25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all {{discrimination based on}} price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can do to change it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
25|$|PMI {{estimation}} is used {{to figure}} out how much time has elapsed since a person died by using insects to help estimate this interval. It depends on the species of insect, as some are attracted to fresh corpses while others are only attracted to the putrid and advanced stages of decomposition. This means the insects go through waves of succession. Using this information as well as the lifecycle of the insect in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> help to estimate the PMI. The judgment depends on what stage of development the insect is in, as well as the weather in recent months among other factors. Specifically with C. cadaverina, they tend to be attracted to fairly advanced stages of decomposition, while rarely being found on fresh carrion. They also tend to be in the second wave of succession, usually showing up after Lucilia spp. and Calliphora spp.|$|E
25|$|Closed mode systems, by definition, {{are closed}} without a vent. When making {{measurement}}s, closed systems take a CO2 measurement of ambient air {{just after the}} soil sample chamber is sealed. This becomes the CO2 reference. The system continues to take measurements at regular intervals {{over the next few}} minutes until a final CO2 concentration is recorded at a predetermined end time over time. Closed systems have the advantages that they are used by more researchers, and they provide wind proof results. Since there is no vent, wind is not an issue. When using a closed mode system, {{it is important that the}} experimental design include a maximum measuring time for two reasons: First; if the measuring time is too long, an unacceptable positive partial CO2 pressure can build up in the chamber limiting the amount of additional CO2 from entering the chamber, causing a measuring artifact. The second reason is that if a chamber that is closed for too long, it can modify ambient conditions and cause measuring artifacts. Finding the optimal measuring time range is important. Tests on the soil in <b>question</b> <b>can</b> confirm the best time solution, and eliminate the partial CO2 pressure buildup from being a significant issue.|$|E

25|$|The tale told in Sverre's saga is the {{official}} version. Historians have questioned the veracity of it, {{especially with regard to}} Sverre's alleged paternity. Some historians have considered his claim to be King Sigurd's son to be false, as did many of his contemporaries. Others have believed the paternal claim to be true, while most historians have found that the paternal <b>question</b> <b>can</b> not be given a definite answer. Although the fact that kings fathered illegitimate sons was taken for granted, other facts indicate that Sverre was in his early thirties when he came to Norway, such as the age of his own sons and nephews. It has been cited against Sverre's claim that according to Canon law, one had to be at least 30 years old to be eligible for the priesthood. If Sverre was 30 years old when he became a priest, this would place his birth no later than 1145, making his paternal claim impossible, as Sigurd Munn was born in 1133. This particular objection has lost credence as it has become clear that this age limit was routinely ignored in Scandinavia at the time. However, other objections remain, such as the fact that Sverre consistently refused to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove his claims. At the time, such a trial was routine for new claimants to the throne, and belief in its efficacy seems to have been universal; yet Sverre refused to undergo it. If Sverre's claim was false, however, he would lack royal legitimacy, dooming his plans to failure. Regardless, his motivation is clear: to capture the throne of Norway, whether he could prove royal blood or not. After all, Norway had seen other claimants, since Harald Gille, whose paternity was equally questionable.|$|E
