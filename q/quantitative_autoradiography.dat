In the normal colon a low concentration of SP receptor binding sites is expressed by submucosal arterioles and venules and a moderate concentration is expressed by the external circular muscle, whereas SK receptor binding sites are expressed in low concentrations by the external circular and longitudinal muscle. In contrast, specific NK binding sites were not observed in any area of the human colon. In colon tissue obtained from ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease patients, however, very high concentrations of SP receptor binding sites are expressed by arterioles and venules located in the submucosa, muscularis mucosa, external circular muscle, external longitudinal muscle, and serosa. In addition, very high concentrations of SP receptor binding sites are expressed within the germinal center of lymph nodules, whereas the concentrations of SP and SK binding sites expressed by the external muscle layers are not altered significantly. These results demonstrate that receptor binding sites for SP, but not SK or NK, are ectopically expressed in high concentrations (1000 - 2000 times normal) by cells involved in mediating inflammatory and immune responses.

Although the mouse is widely used in {{pharmacological}} studies of opioid action, little has been done to characterize opioid systems in this species. In the present study the distribution of p and 6 opioid binding sites in the mouse CNS was examined using a <b>quantitative</b> in vitro <b>autoradiography</b> procedure. Tritiated dihydromorphine was used to visualize p sites and [“H-d-Ala 2 -d-Leu 5]enkephalin with a low concentration of morphine was used to visualize 6 sites. p and 6 site localizations in the mouse are very similar to those previously described in the ra...|$|R
