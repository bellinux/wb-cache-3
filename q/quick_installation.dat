There are configuration options to reduce compilation times by enabling [...] parallel compilation and using pipes instead of temporary files; package compilation may also be distributed over multiple computers. In addition, the user {{may be able to}} mount a large filesystem in RAM to greatly speed up the process of building packages. Some of these approaches have drawbacks and so are not enabled by default.

40|$|The mining {{industry}} desires {{to cut costs}} and to operate in more dangerous mines, which is why companies such as Atlas Copco are developing autonomous vehicles. The problem to navigate autonomously is however complex, so the vehicles have in the recent years become more intelligent; the number of computers, actuators and sensors are increasing. For example, an autonomous LHD (Loading â Hauling â Dump) vehicle has sensors including: inertial measurement unit (IMU), odometer, hinge angle sensor, laser range finders and cameras. The parameters for the sensors needs to be calibrated before the vehicle {{can be used in a}} mine. There are also a number of electrical currents which needs to be calibrated for the actuators. The calibration of parameters has traditionally been made manually, but Atlas Copco realizes that manual calibration is not feasible once the sales of intelligent mine vehicles increases. Effort is therefore put into automation of the calibration procedures. Interviews with employees were carried out at Atlas Copco to identify the most time consuming procedures during calibration and installation of autonomous mine vehicles. The calibration of steering currents was not only identified as the most time consuming procedure, but also as one of the most complex procedures. The goal of this thesis is to enable easier and <b>quicker</b> <b>installation</b> of mine vehicles. This is done through investigation of methods for automatic calibration of steering currents. The problem is approached from two angles: a grey box model using system identification and a black box model using neural network with resilient backpropagation. The models are compared to a search algorithm, used for simulation of the manual calibration method. In the end, the models are evaluated with regard to performance and ease of implementation. The hypothesis was that the more complex grey box or black box model would have higher accuracy than a simple search algorithm. However, the search algorithm proves to outperform the other models both with regard to accuracy and calibration time, and is also easier to implement. The search algorithm is thus suggested to be implemented instead of a complex model. Moreover, it is suggested that a straightforward mapping of 20 currents may outperform even the search calibration. It is also concluded that calibration of steering currents can be done when the vehicle is standing still...|$|R
30|$|The ShinhungÂ® Luna system fixture used in {{this study}} is an {{internal}} submerged type, and its tapered body can obtain firm and stable early fixation in any bone quality. Three helical cutting edges allow self-tapping that can ease implant installation and minimize the resistance of the bone. Gradually enlarging thread exerts pressure on the bone and makes it favorable for stable insertion and by decreasing bone damage. Its upper open-type part enables less resistant installation without any additional drilling. Double thread with 35 Â° spiral helix empowers <b>quick</b> and firm <b>installation.</b> An SLA surface showing an average roughness of over Ra 2.5 Â Î¼m improved bone healing period and cell response by more than 20 Â %, respectively. In addition, outstanding early fixation was achieved in soft bones.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the relative costs of excavation retention by two systems: conventional soldier pile-wale-tieback support, and support by soil nailing. The investigation included design of excavation supports by the two aforementioned systems for fifteen actual excavations, the majority of which were accomplished in the Louisville, Kentucky area. The design was optimized to arrive at minimum cost solutions. In all cases, the soil nailing system was much less costly than the conventional system. Several factors appeared to make soil nailing more economical than conventional retention systems, if deformations and settlement of soil nailing systems can be tolerated: lower cost for construction materials; <b>quicker</b> mobilization of <b>installation</b> equipment; faster construction time; smaller construction space requirements; and less need for heavy equipment...|$|R
40|$|Solar panels {{have been}} used to {{generate}} and supply electricity in various applications such as residential and commercial buildings.
