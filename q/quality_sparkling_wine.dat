25|$|Sparkling wines {{produced}} in the United States {{can be made in}} both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost sparkling wines, such as André, Cook's, and Tott's, often employ the latter method with more premium sparkling wines utilizing the former. The history of producing <b>quality</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> in California {{can be traced to the}} Russian River Valley of Sonoma County where, in 1892, the Korbel brothers (emigrated from Bohemia in 1852) began producing sparkling wine according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, Muscatel, Traminer and Chasselas grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence, the overall quality of Californian sparkling wine increased with the introduction of the more traditional sparkling wine grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US AVA requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and sweetness of wine though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the sparkling wine industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted Champagne houses came to set up wineries in the area. These include Moët et Chandon's , Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate, and Taittinger's Domaine Carneros.|$|E

The release of the products of autolysis during this aging step is fundamental for the <b>quality</b> of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> made by the traditional method. These cells undergo an autolysis process characterized by self‐digestion of yeast intracellular and cell‐wall macromolecules, and the release of the degradation products to the wine. Autolysis is the source of several molecules responsible for the <b>quality</b> of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> as well as still wines aged on lees (yeast cells). Autolysis is a slow process under <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production conditions, and there is interest, from the industrial side, in the design of strategies for rapid development of autolysis. Some years ago our research group hypothesized that, during the process of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production, autophagy would take place.
