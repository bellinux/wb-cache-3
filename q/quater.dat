40|$|For a {{long time}} a crystal {{structure}} of high-pressure epsilon-phase of solid oxygen was a mistery. Basing {{on the results of}} recent experiments that have solved this riddle we show that the magnetic and crystal structure of epsilon-phase can be explained by strong exchange interactions of antiferromagnetic nature. The singlet state implemented on <b>quaters</b> of O 2 molecules has the minimal exchange energy if compared to other possible singlet states (dimers, trimers). Magnetoelastic forces that arise from the spatial dependence of the exchange integral give rise to transformation of 4 (O 2) rhombuses into the almost regular quadrates. Antiferromagnetic character of the exchange interactions stabilizes distortion of crystal lattice in epsilon-phase and impedes such a distortion in long-range alpha- and delta-phases.

We have found high degree of enamel hypoplasia (25. 89 %), frequent signs of the severe forms of periodontal disease (18. 55 %), very high percent of antemortem tooth loss (31. 48 %), and evidence of edentate jaws in an early age of individuals. Amalgam was predominant material for tooth fillings; implants and non-metal ceramic crowns were not found, and three <b>quaters</b> of edentate individuals were found with full prostetic dentures. Despite the detailed postmortem dental analysis, antemortem dental charts were not collected. These individuals were identified by other forensic methods...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} effects of tutors' comments {{with a particular}} focus on students' learning at OUT. Objectives of the study were: to assess the nature of comments tutors provide on students' assignments and determine how these comments are able to guide students in their learning. The study also examined the functions of tutors' comments and determined their usefulness and limitations in facilitating effective distance learning. Lastly, the study examined challenges experienced by tutors in providing comments to students' assignments. The research was mainly qualitative in nature whereby it used in depth interviews, and documentary review techniques for data collection. The sample for the study constituted 39 respondents (25 students, 10 tutors, 3 Head <b>quaters</b> management officials and 1 Regional Director). During data analysis, the researcher sorted and examined data, which were assembled under specific categories of main themes. Data under each category were read carefully and any thing, which was found inappropriate was discarded. The study indicates that tutors provide comments of different nature: marks with no words, brief, detailed comments. However, some comments were perceived by students to pose difficult to identify areas of improvement, interpretation, {{and the way to}} act upon appeared comments. Perceived usefulness of comments include drawing students' attention on their strengths and shortcomings, arouse of motivation in learning, provision of information and eliciting communication. Some limitations of correspondence tuition that were found out were demoralization of students' interests and engagements, dropping out, exceeding of course completion time and arouse of heightened emotion. Tutors encountered challenges included invisible learners, limited amount of time, lack of accessible communication channels and students' deficiency in communication skills. The study recommends that tutors should provide detailed, supportive and constructive comments to assist student learning.
