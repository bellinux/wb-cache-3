5000|$|Quasi-peak {{detectors}} play {{an important}} role in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing of electronic equipment, where allowed levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio frequency interference (RFI), are given with reference to measurement by a specified <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector.</b> This was originally done because the <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> was believed to better indicate the subjective annoyance level experienced by a listener hearing impulsive interference to an AM radio station. Over time standards incorporating quasi-peak detectors as the measurement device were extended to frequencies up to 1 GHz, although there may not be any justification beyond previous practice for using the <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> to measure interference to signals other than AM radio. The <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> parameters to be used for EMC testing vary with frequency [...] Both CISPR and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limit EMI at frequencies above 1 GHz with reference to an average-power detector, rather than <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E
50|$|The CISPR <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>{{detector}}</b> {{is used in}} EMC {{testing and}} is defined in Publication 16 of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The CISPR <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> is a peak detector with an attack time of 1 ms, a decay time of 500 ms and an IF filter setting of 100 kHz.|$|E
50|$|A <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> {{is a type}} of {{electronic}} detector or rectifier. Quasi-peak detectors for specific purposes have usually been standardized with mathematically precisely defined dynamic characteristics of attack time, integration time, and decay time or fall-back time.|$|E
50|$|Conceptually, a <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>{{detector}}</b> for EMC testing {{works like}} a peak detector followed by a lossy integrator.A voltage impulse entering a narrow-band receiver produces a short-duration burst oscillating at the receiver center frequency. The peak detector is a rectifier followed by a low-pass filter to extract a baseband signal consisting of the slowly (relative to the receiver center frequency) time-varying amplitude of the impulsive oscillation. The following lossy integrator has a rapid rise time and longer fall time, so the measured output for a sequence of impulses is higher when the pulse repetition rate is higher. The <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> is calibrated to produce the same output level as a peak-power detector when the input is a continuous wave tone.|$|E
5000|$|While not {{intended}} for this application, the 468 curve {{has also been}} used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as [...] "M weighting" [...] in standards such as ISO 21727 intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve {{does not include the}} <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> specified in the ITU standard.|$|E
50|$|The ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} curve, originally proposed in CCIR recommendation 468, but later adopted by numerous standards bodies (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) {{was based on}} the research, and incorporates a special <b>Quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> to account for our reduced sensitivity to short bursts and clicks. It is widely used by Broadcasters and audio professionals when they measure noise on broadcast paths and audio equipment, so they can subjectively compare equipment types with different noise spectra and characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Experiments in the BBC led to BBC Research Department Report EL-17, The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits, {{in which}} {{experiments}} on numerous test subjects were reported, {{using a variety}} of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to pink noise. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1 kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German DIN standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and quasi-peak rectifier.|$|E
50|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI/) and, , is maintained by the ITU. Noise measurements using this weighting typically also use a <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> law rather than slow averaging. This also helps to quantify the audibility of bursty noise, ticks and pops that might go undetected with a slow rms measurement.|$|E
50|$|Measurements {{based on}} psychoacoustics, {{such as the}} {{measurement}} of noise, often use a weighting filter. It is well established that human hearing is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by equal-loudness contours, {{but it is not}} well appreciated that these contours vary {{depending on the type of}} sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds such that a <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems. For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, IEC, EBU and ITU standards. These methods of audio quality measurement are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older A-weighting standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} spread {{spectrum}} clock generator for EMI reduction, where the modulating signal {{is generated by}} a suitably designed chaotic map. With respect to past solutions, the map {{has been designed to}} achieve a specific short-term behavior of the generated sequences, which allows to optimize the electromagnetic interference peak reduction not only for the theoretical spectrum, but also in the measurement setting prescibed by CISPR norms. In the latter case, we are able to achieve a 3. 8 dB improvement in EMI reduction with respect to the triangular modulation when using the peak detector, which increases to 6. 9 dB when switching to the <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector.</b> Results are measured on a prototype which has been designed and fabricated in a 0. 18 μm CMOS technology...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—For a {{three-phase}} buck-type pulsewidth modulation {{rectifier input}} {{stage of a}} high-power telecommunications power supply module, a differential-mode (DM) electromagnetic com-patibility (EMC) filter is designed for compliance to CISPR 22 Class B in the frequency range of 150 kHz– 30 MHz. The design {{is based on a}} harmonic analysis of the rectifier input current and a mathematical model of the measurement procedure including the line impedance stabilization network (LISN) and the test receiver. Guidelines for a successful filter design are given, and components for a 5 -kW rectifier prototype are selected. Furthermore, formulas for the estimation of the <b>quasi-peak</b> <b>detector</b> output based on the LISN output voltage spectrum are provided. The damping of filter resonances is optimized for a given attenuation in order to facilitate a higher stability margin for system control. Further-more, the dependence of the filter input and output impedances and the attenuation characteristic on the inner mains impedance are discussed. As experimentally verified by using a three-phase common-/Differential-Mode separator, this procedure allows ac-curate prediction of the converter DM conducted emission levels and therefore could be employed in the design process of the rectifier system to ensure compliance to relevant EMC standards.
