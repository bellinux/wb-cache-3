A recent experiment has carried out the two-slit protocol with helium atoms. The basic physics of <b>quantal</b> momentum transfer considered here was originally pointed out in 1923, by William Duane, before quantum mechanics was invented.

If the diffracting slits are considered as classical objects, theoretically ideally seamless, then a wave interpretation seems necessary, but if the diffracting slits are considered physically, as <b>quantal</b> objects exhibiting collective <b>quantal</b> motions, then the particle-only and wave-only interpretations seem perhaps equally valid.|$|E

25|$|A {{good example}} of this contradiction {{can be seen in the}} {{literature}} regarding the R192Q mutation. The first investigation of this mutation, using the rabbit isoform of the channel expressed in oocytes, found that it did not alter any measured channel properties. A subsequent report, using human channels expressed in HEK293 Cells, found a small hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint for activation, a result common among FHM1 mutants. This shift results in channels that open at more negative potentials and, thus, have a higher open probability than wild-type channels at most potentials. This report also found that the R192Q mutant produced almost twice as much whole-cell current compared to wild-type channels. This is not due to a change in single channel conductance but to an equivalent increase in channel density. A subsequent group noticed that this mutation is in a region important for modulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCR activation leads to inhibition of wild-type CaV2.1 currents. R192Q mutant channel currents are also decreased by GPCR activation, but by a smaller amount. A more recent group has confirmed some of these results by creating a R192Q knock-in mouse. They confirmed that the R192Q mutant activates at more negative potentials and that neurons producing these channels have much larger whole-cell current. This resulted in a much larger <b>quantal</b> content (the number of neurotransmitter packets released per action potential) and generally enhanced neurotransmitter release in R192Q expressing neurons versus wild-type. Consequently, these mutant mice were more susceptible to cortical-spreading-depression than their wild-type counterparts. The most recent experiments on this mutant, however, have contradicted some of these results. In CaV2.1 knockout neurons transfected with human channels, P/Q-type currents from mutant channels are actually smaller than their wild-type counterpart. They also found a significant decrease in calcium influx during depolarization, leading to decreased <b>quantal</b> content, in mutant versus wild-type expressing neurons. Neurons expressing mutant channels were also less able to mediate inhibitory input and have smaller inhibitory postsynaptic currents through P/Q-type channels. Further testing with this and other mutants is required to determine their end affect on human physiology.|$|E

2500|$|A logit equilibrium, the Gibbs measure from {{statistical}} mechanics, {{was shown}} to be the equilibrium of a finite-player potential game, where players {{are assumed to be}} bounded-rational in one of two ways. [...] Dynamically, players follow the gradient of the potential on pure strategy space, perturbed by a random variable (motivated by the inherent behavior strategy randomness used to justify a classical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium). Alternately, a static notion of equilibrium can be used, based on agents arbitraging information out of the system to adapt and improve, as gauged by (Shannon) information entropy. [...] The dynamics are a variation of those that result in a <b>quantal</b> response equilibrium, the difference being instantaneous utility functions are used instead of expected values of utilities to accommodate markets with repeatedly interacting agents. [...] Specifically, the <b>quantal</b> response equilibrium is a mean-field version of the Gibbs measure.|$|E

2500|$|According to Thomas Kuhn, it was {{not till}} 1908 that Planck more or less {{accepted}} part of Einstein's arguments for physical as distinct from abstract mathematical discreteness in thermal radiation physics. Still in 1908, considering Einstein's proposal of <b>quantal</b> propagation, Planck opined that such a revolutionary step was perhaps unnecessary. Until then, Planck had been consistent in thinking that discreteness of action quanta was to be found neither in his resonant oscillators nor in the propagation of thermal radiation. Kuhn wrote that, in Planck's earlier papers and in his 1906 monograph, there is no [...] "mention of discontinuity, [...] of talk of a restriction on oscillator energy, [...] any formula like [...]" [...] Kuhn pointed out that his study of Planck's papers of 1900 and 1901, and of his monograph of 1906, had led him to [...] "heretical" [...] conclusions, contrary to the widespread assumptions of others who saw Planck's writing only {{from the perspective of}} later, anachronistic, viewpoints. Kuhn's conclusions, finding a period till 1908, when Planck consistently held his 'first theory', have been accepted by other historians.|$|E
2500|$|The human tongue has {{an unusual}} shape. In most mammals, it's a long, flat {{structure}} contained largely within the mouth. It is attached {{at the rear}} to the hyoid bone, situated below oral level in the pharynx. In humans, the tongue has an almost circular sagittal (midline) contour, much of it lying vertically down an extended pharynx, where it {{is attached to a}} hyoid bone in a lowered position. Partly as a result of this, the horizontal (inside-the-mouth) and vertical (down-the-throat) tubes forming the supralaryngeal vocal tract (SVT) are almost equal in length (whereas in other species, the vertical section is shorter). As we move our jaws up and down, the tongue can vary the cross-sectional area of each tube independently by about 10:1, altering formant frequencies accordingly. That the tubes are joined at a right angle permits pronunciation of the vowels , [...] and , which nonhuman primates cannot do.

50|$|The {{release of}} {{neurotransmitter}} vesicles from the presynaptic cell is probabilistic.

Bernard Katz pioneered the study of these mEPSPs at the neuromuscular junction (often called miniature end-plate potentials) in 1951, revealing the <b>quantal</b> nature of synaptic transmission. <b>Quantal</b> size can then {{be defined as the}} synaptic response to the release of neurotransmitter from a single vesicle, while <b>quantal</b> content is the number of effective vesicles released in response to a nerve impulse. <b>Quantal</b> analysis refers to the methods used to deduce, for a particular synapse, how many quanta of transmitter are released and what the average effect of each quantum is on the target cell, measured in terms of amount of ions flowing (charge) or change in the membrane potential.|$|E
