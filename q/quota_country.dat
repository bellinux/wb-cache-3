40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of trade {{liberalization}} on environmental policies in a strategic setting when there is transboundary pollution. Trade liberalization {{can result in a}} race to the bottom in environmental taxes, which makes both countries worse off. This is not due to the terms of trade motive, but rather the incentive, in a strategic setting, to reduce the incidence of transboundary pollution. With command and control policies (emission <b>quotas),</b> <b>countries</b> are unable to influence foreign emissions by strategic choice of domestic policy; hence, there is no race to the bottom. However, with internationally tradable quotas, unless pollution is a pure global public bad, there is a race to the bottom in environmental policy. Under free trade, internationally nontradable quotas result in the lowest pollution level and strictly welfare-dominate taxes. The ordering of internationally tradable quotas and pollution taxes depends, among other things, on the degree of international pollution spillover...|$|R

We consider both prices and quantities as the strategic variables and study competition both in the domestic and the foreign market taken individually, and in the two markets taken together. ...|$|R
2500|$|The CFP sets quotas for {{how much}} of each species can be caught in a certain [...] or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis. Each country is given a quota based upon the total {{available}} (Total Allowable Catch, TAC) and their traditional share (percentage). TACs are fixed annually by the Council of Ministers. They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own <b>quota.</b> <b>Countries</b> distribute their <b>quotas</b> among fishermen using different systems.|$|R

40|$|The Uruguay Round Agreement on Safeguards {{represents}} {{an effort to}} improve the GATT safeguards (SG) process and thereby encourage countries to choose this option over antidumping and “gray-area ” measures such as bilaterally negotiated export restraints. This paper offers a first {{detailed analysis of the}} way safeguards initiated under the agreement have been implemented in practice. We examine the actual trade effects of 14 safeguard actions, covering 85 different 6 -digit Harmonized System product categories, implemented by WTO signatories between 1995 and 2000. Our main focus {{is the extent to which}} safeguard actions conform to the GATT/WTO most-favored-nation (MFN) principle. We identify two types of discrimination that arise in the application of safeguards: explicit departures from MFN treatment through formal exclusion of some exporters, and implicit departures from MFN as reflected by systematic differences in impact across trading partners. Our results indicate that the impact of SG action on a given exporter depends on the specific form of the safeguard policy. A SG implemented as a quota tends to preserve historical market shares more than a SG implemented as a tariff. When a SG is implemented as a <b>quota,</b> <b>countries</b> that have recently increased market share face reductions i...|$|R

30|$|However, the {{matching}} mechanism {{does not need}} to limit the choices of the receiving countries. EU hosting countries could also express their preferences, this time vis-à-vis the “type” of refugees they would like to host. For example, countries could express preferences according to the skill or education level of the refugees, their nationality, family status, or legal status (e.g., asylum-seekers vs. refugees applying for resettlement). This is done by “bidding” for certain types as part of the <b>country’s</b> <b>quota.</b> If all <b>countries</b> have the same preferences, the result will be equivalent to a case where they are indifferent with respect to refugee type. If countries have diverging preferences, then allowing them to express these preferences will reduce the expected cost of the system.|$|R
40|$|Countries that wish {{to erect}} trade {{barriers}} {{have a variety}} of instruments at their disposal. In addition to tariffs and <b>quotas,</b> <b>countries</b> can offer tax relief, low interest financing, reduced regulation,and other subsidies to domestic industries facing foreign competition. In a trade agreement, countries typically agree to reduce not only tariffs, but also subsidies. We consider the effect of a trade agreement on pollution emissions. We show that while reducing tariffs may indeed increase pollution intensive production in a country, reductions in some subsidies required by the trade agreement reduce pollution in general equilibrium for reasonable parameter values. The reduction results from two effects. First, a reduction in subsidies to firms reduces pollution-causing capital accumulation. Second, if subsidized firms, industries, and/or state owned enterprises are sufficiently more pollution intensive, then reducing subsidies moves capital and labor from more to less pollution intensive firms. We calibrate the model to the case of China and show that pollution emissions after China's accession to the WTO are up to 22. 9 percent lower than a baseline in which China does not enter the WTO, without any pollution abatement policy changes or environmental side agreements. trade agreements, domestic subsidies, pollution emissions, dynamic general equilibrium...|$|R

50|$|One {{historical}} speciality of the New Zealand Parliament was the <b>country</b> <b>quota,</b> {{which gave}} greater representation to rural politics. From 1889 on (and even earlier in more informal forms), districts were weighted {{according to their}} urban/rural split (with any locality of less than 2,000 people considered rural). Those districts which had large rural proportions received {{a greater number of}} nominal votes than they actually contained voters - as an example, in 1927, Waipawa, a district without any urban population at all, received an additional 4,153 nominal votes to its actual 14,838 - having the maximum factor of 28% extra representation. The <b>country</b> <b>quota</b> was in effect until it was abolished in 1945 by a mostly urban-elected Labour government, which went back to a one man, one vote system.|$|R
