50|$|A Fresnel rhomb is a prism {{designed}} in 1817 by Augustin-Jean Fresnel for converting linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light. While the device performs the same {{function as a}} <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate,</b> the rhomb {{does not depend on}} a material's birefringence. Rather, the relative phase shift between the s and p polarizations is a result of total internal reflection, two of which each contribute a nominal retardance of 45°. This achieves a wide spectral bandwidth, which is difficult using birefringent waveplates. The precision of the 90° phase shift is compromised only due to changes in the refractive index of the material due to dispersion; this change can be very small over a wide spectral range. The material (typically glass) is itself specifically not birefringent.|$|E

50|$|The {{dimensions}} of the rhomb (usually a parallelepiped) are such that light entering {{one of the small}} faces undergoes two internal reflections, as seen in the figure, before exiting through the other small face. The angle of each internal reflection is designed to produce a 45° (π/4 radians) phase delay between the two linearly polarized components of the light. Hence a linearly polarized beam at 45° becomes elliptically polarized after the first reflection, but emerges as circularly polarized after the second reflection. For other input polarizations, the net effect of the rhomb is identical to that of a <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate.</b> Two Fresnel rhombs can be used in tandem (usually cemented to avoid reflections at their interface) in order to achieve the function of a halfwave plate. The latter arrangement, unlike a single Fresnel rhomb used as a quarter-wave retarder, has the additional feature that the exiting beam can be collinear with the original incident beam.|$|E

50|$|The {{light source}} needs to produce high {{intensity}} light, {{as a lot}} of light will be lost by the beam splitter and the sample itself. Different wavelengths result in different IRM images; Bereiter-Hahn and colleagues showed that for their PtK 2 cells, light with a wavelength of 546 nm resulted in better contrast than blue light with a wavelength of 436 nm. There have been many refinements to the basic theory of IRM, most of which increase the efficiency and yield of the image formation. By placing polarizers and a <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> between the beam splitter and the specimen, the linear polarized light can be converted into circular polarized light and afterwards be converted back to linear polarized light, which increases the efficiency of the system. The circular polarizer article discusses this process in detail. Furthermore, by including a second polarizer, which is rotated 90° compared to the first polarizer, stray light can be prevented from reaching the detector, increasing the signal to noise ratio (see Figure 2 of Verschueren).|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{results on the}} use of a thick aligned Si crystal acting as a <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> to induce a degree of circular polarisation in a high energy linearly polarised photon beam. The linearly polarised photon beam is produced from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation by 178 GeV unpolarised electrons incident on an aligned Si crystal, acting as a radiator. The linear polarisation of the photon beam is characterised by measuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production in a Ge crystal, for different crystal orientations. The Ge crystal therefore acts as an analyser. The birefringence phenomenon, which converts the linear polarisation to circular polarisation, is observed by letting the linearly polarised photons beam pass through a thick Si <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> crystal, and then measuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production again for a selection of relative angles between the crystallographic planes of the radiator, analyser and <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate.</b> The systematics of the difference between the measured asymmetries with and without the <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> are predicted by theory to reveal an evolution in the Stokes parameters from which the appearance of a circularly polarised component in the photon beam can be demonstrated. The measured magnitude of the circularly polarised component was consistent with the theoretical predictions, and therefore is in indication of the existence of the birefringence effect.

25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first quarter-wave plate, one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> <b>plates</b> is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second quarter-wave plate then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous quarter-wave plate.

The method has been also proposed for the determination of the isochromatic fringe order. This paper concerns the general characteristics of phase shifting photoelasticity in the colour domain.

Generally, the TN-LCD placed between two linear polarizers (P) produces coupled intensity and phase modulation.
