60|$|But {{with his}} {{children}} it was different. They had not been born in the slave pen, and by the special ruling of the Chief Oligarch of that time, John Morrison, they were elevated to the master class. And {{it was then that}} the name of Vange disappears from the page of history. It becomes Vanderwater, and Jason Vange, the son of Bloody Vange, becomes Jason Vanderwater, the founder of the Vanderwater line. But that was three hundred years ago, and the Vanderwaters of to-day forget their beginnings and imagine that somehow the clay of their bodies is different stuff from the clay in your body and mine and in the bodies of all slaves. And I ask you, Why should a slave become the master of another slave? And why should the son of a slave become the master of many slaves? I leave these <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to answer for yourselves, but do not forget that in the beginning the Vanderwaters were slaves.|$|E

"Now, then," [...] said Miss Port, {{whispering}} as if {{she were}} sticking needles into the frightened girl, [...] "I'm goin' away, and don't you ask no <b>questions,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> won't get no answers. You just go to bed, and let them people stay in the parlor all night. They'll be {{able to take care of}} the house, I guess, and if they don't I'll make 'em suffer. In the morning you can see Mrs. Faulkner--for she's the ringleader--and tell her that you're goin' home to your mother, and that Miss Port expects her to pull down all the blinds in this house, and shut and bolt the doors. She is to see that the eatables is put away proper or else give to the poor--which will be you, I guess--and then she is to lock all the doors and take the front-door key to Squire Allen, and tell him I'll write to him. And what's more, you can say to the nasty thing that if I find anything wrong in my house, or anything missin', I 'll hold her and her husband responsible for it, and that I'm mighty glad I don't belong to their church." ...|$|E
60|$|By the way, in what {{consists}} {{the special}} sacredness of a State? I speak {{not of the}} position assigned to a State in the Union by the Constitution, for that is a bond we all recognize. That position, however, a State cannot carry out of the Union with it. I speak of that assumed primary right of a State to rule all which is less than itself, and to ruin all which is larger than itself. If a State and a county, in a given case, should be equal in number of inhabitants, in what, {{as a matter of}} principle, is the State better than the county? Would an exchange of name be an exchange of rights? Upon what principle, upon what rightful principle, may a State, being no more than one fiftieth part of the nation in soil and population, break up the nation, and then coerce a proportionably large subdivision of itself in the most arbitrary way? What mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country, with its people, by merely calling it a State? Fellow-citizens, I am not asserting anything. I am merely asking <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to consider. And now allow me to bid you farewell.|$|E

And {{how in the}} world did I find my way to this house? My dear girl, I have been occupied, since we last saw each other, in {{slightly}} modifying my old professional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical Agriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on the public stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach--look them both fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty, and you will agree with me that they come to much the same thing. However that may be, here I am--incredible as it may appear--a man with an income, at last. The founders of my fortune are three in number. Their names are Aloes, Scammony, and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am now living--on a Pill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my friendly connection with you. I made a little more by the happy decease (Requiescat in Pace!) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge's from whom, as I told you, my wife had expectations. Very good. What do you think I did? I invested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in advertisements, and purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The result is now before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am, with my clothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker's; with my servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent, flourishing, popular--and all on a Pill." ...|$|E

40|$|In this Chapter we {{describe}} {{some of our}} insights and experiences with young children {{in their search for}} meaning, as they imagine, create, interpret and represent mathematical and scientific phenomena in their world. We draw upon selected examples from research and from experiences in preschools as well as the early school years. Some examples of inquiry-based experiences and themes that embed generic learning processes, such as investigating and problem-solving, finding patterns and relationships, and exploring data are also highlighted. We discuss the role of technology in young children's quantitative learning by examining the influence of technology-integrated toys, the use of technology in teaching and learning, the Internet, and handheld calculators. The chapter concludes with some implications of this review for early childhood mathematics and science curricula and some <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to reflect upon...|$|E

40|$|Medicine {{today has}} entered its B- 17 phase. Substantial parts of what {{hospitals}} (do) [...] . are now too complex for clinicians {{to carry them}} out reliably from memory alone. " In January 2007 the World Health Organization (WHO) began a programme aimed at improving the safety of surgical care globally. The initiative, called "Safe Surgery Saves Lives" aimed to identify minimum standards of surgical care that could be universally applied across countries and settings. One component of the initiative was {{the introduction of a}} peri-operative checklist. In February 2009 the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued an alert requiring all hospitals in England and Wales to implement the peri-operative checklist by February 2010. The main reason for the checklist is to improve patient care by making the operative environment a safer place. But why the need for this checklist and how can it help? What evidence exists that it makes any difference to patient care? What are the essential component parts to the checklist and how can is it introduced? We hope to answer these <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> in the following text. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In this module you are {{introduced}} {{to a number of}} ideas related to adult and community education, and especially to the link between community education and community development. The presentation of this module is different to what you may be used to from other modules on this course. The core of the module consists of a three units, four academic papers on topics related to adult and community education written by theorists and practitioners in the field, two units related to rural literary writers, and the assignment. The papers cover a range of ideas related to the development and practice of adult and community education. The papers were written originally either as articles for academic journals or as presentations at academic conferences. You may find some of the content challenging. For this reason, a “companion” text is provided for each paper to set the context and to give you some guidance. This companion includes the following: • A brief introduction to each paper. • An outline of some of the ideas raised. • <b>Questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to consider when reading the paper. • Links to additional web-available resources to supplement information in the papers...|$|E

40|$|It was {{the poet}} Alexander Pope who first wrote ‘fools rush in where angels fear to tread’. The aphorism was later used by E. M. Forster {{as the title}} of a novel. In the novel the English heroine imposes an English {{interpretation}} on an Italian domestic problem, with tragic consequences. She foolishly rushed in when it would have been wiser to wait. So while I’m going to suggest that you don’t rush to embrace increased school-based training without a lot of careful thinking, I’m also reminding myself that only a fool would think that the experiences from England would apply directly to Holland. My purpose is to hold up the English experience of a strong role for schools in the initial training of teachers, in order to illuminate the choices {{to be made in the}} Netherlands. The illumination will reveal some quite fundamental <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to consider. One should always return to fundamental questions at times of change to avoid offering instrumental respon-ses to instrumental questions. The fundamental questions include the following:- What kinds of teachers do you want for what kind of society?- How can the increased involvement of schools in training help to produce the kinds of teachers needed?- What are the implications for schools?- What are the implications for higher education? I’ll start with an advance organiser. What my own research reveals, is that stronger school involvement in teacher training:- is a serious shift in training- relationships will change;- has the potential to be beneficial for student teachers, for schools and also for higher education;- will mean that the benefit isn’t easily achieved and some of the compromises are actually detrimental to the quality of training...|$|E
