At the top of the hill, there were three baskets, one for each competing team. The aim was to fill a team's basket using the rocks. When the rocks reached the marked yellow line, the respective team is out and the last team standing wins. One person from each team competed in the challenge. As Hamish was {{the only member of the}} Blue Team, he ended up representing Blue.

At first, both the Red and Black Teams targeted Hamish, while his focus was on the Red basket. Throughout the challenge, tension started to build between Red and Black as Simon initially nominated Lisa in the beginning, targeting her lack of muscular strength, annoying Margie in the process. Hamish was the first to be out of the challenge, and the Red and Black teams now started to focus on each other's baskets.

40|$|Master project report. The {{hydraulic}} {{efficiency of the}} river Araranguá will be increased by the construction of jetties {{at the mouth of}} the river. The river tends to migrate from south to north which decreases the {{hydraulic efficiency}} and causes flooding upstream during events of high discharge. To stop the migration the construction of jetties at the mouth of river Araranguá is proposed. A design for a jetty system is available (INHP, 1993), but should be updated. Due to the construction of a jetty system longshore sediment transport will be interrupted and this will cause morphological changes. At Araranguá river a large and highly varying longshore sediment transport is present with a high energy wave climate and micro tidal range. These conditions cause increased morphological changes when constructing a jetty system. The objective of this research is to design a jetty system that prevents flooding upstream and induces as less morphological changes as possible. The jetty should be designed at the specified location, using available datasets from previous research and according to modern design standards. Also navigation through the channel should be possible. The channel width and depth are determined by navigational and morphological purposes and are 120 m and 6 m respectively. A weir jetty, which has been implemented in the SW arm of the design, was considered the best sediment bypass system after a multi criteria analysis. Because of the placing of the deposition basin waves could penetrate much further in the jetty channel and lengthening the NE arm to 630 m and a depth of 6, 6 m was necessary. The length of the SW arm of the jetty from the previous is kept at 650 meter to a depth of 7, 2 meter. The final result of the structural design is a statically stable rubble mound breakwater with granite as construction material. Rock has been applied in the range of 0, 4 m (170 kg) to 1, 0 m (2, 7 tons) in diameter, with a core of <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> material. In sections where the required rock mass exceeded the threshold value for economical construction (2, 7 t), tetrapods have been applied to stabilize the slope. Tetrapods have been applied of 6, 6 and 9, 7 tons. The total use of material is about 42. 000 tons of tetrapods and 490. 000 tons of granite rocks. Overtopping requirements determine the crest freeboard and 0, 3 meter is added for post construction settlement. The crest width depends on construction considerations. All other dimensions are directly related to the stone size and weight, which are dependent on the design wave heights. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|During the {{construction}} of breakwaters contractors often encounter undesired reshaping of exposed core material. This reshaping {{is comparable to the}} deformation process of berm breakwaters in which the outer profile reshapes into a more stable s-curve. In the case of oblique waves this deformation is enhanced by a longshore transport of stones leading to even more loss of material and damage. Throughout the years few formulas were derived for both processes which describe the behaviour of berm breakwaters as well as gravel beaches reasonably well. These formulas however turned out to be inadequate when it comes to describing the behaviour of core material. In particular the influence of the wide grading of <b>quarry</b> <b>run,</b> commonly used as core material, is to a large extent unknown and generally not described in the available relations. To investigate this influence of the stone grading on both the two-dimensional deformation and longshore transport new physical model tests were carried out in the wave basin at Delft University of Technology. In total 12 tests were executed in which two different gradings, three different angles of wave attack and two different wave spectra were tested. Data collected from the tests included wave and profile measurements together with the displacements of stones, originating from two colour beams which were applied {{in the middle of the}} trunk. These data along with visual observations eventually led to a conceptual model describing stone movements in both transverse and longshore direction. Using Matlab three-dimensional profile and erosion models were generated from which the different profile parameters were determined. With respect to the distance from origin, for each test an exponential relation was derived to describe the stone displacements. After determination of the area of uniform transport these exponential relations were used to calculate the total longshore transport by means of extrapolation and multiple integrations. Subsequently all parameters found were compared to the formulas currently available for both processes. Regarding the deformation parameters the test results produced the best fit with the formulas derived in [MERLI 2009]. Still on several occasions a deviant relation was found concerning the influence of wave obliquity. In addition, the formulas became less accurate for the narrow grading used in the tests, which fell outside the range tested by Merli. However, for the crest height of the deformed profile test results deviated completely from the available formula as no influence was found whatsoever for all tested parameters. Here the deviation was contributed to a higher instability of the part above the initial deformation, partly due to the steepness of the slope. On the subject of the longshore transport clear trends were found describing the influence of the varying parameters. Both a higher wave load and wider grading lead to an increase of the longshore transport. For the wider grading, however, this increase gave a rather distorted image, as not all fractions in the mixture were transported evenly. Due to segregation the coarsest fractions were mostly transported in the transverse direction while the finer fractions were transported further away in the longitudinal direction. Alternatively, computation of the longshore volume transport proved to be more representative. Regarding the effect of wave obliquity an increase in angle of wave attack of 30 to 45 degrees was accompanied by a decrease in longshore transport; though this decrease was less than already available formulas indicated. However despite the fact that it describes a completely different trend concerning this particular influence, the best fit was found after multiplying the relation derived by [ALIKHANI 1996] with a factor 100.

40|$|Tokyo Bay {{is an area}} {{exposed to}} storm surges {{generated}} by typhoons. Consequently lowlands along its coastline are subject to flood risk. Dike walls, levees and barriers have been developed by the Japanese to protect these coastal areas. In the coming decades {{it is expected that}} a rise in sea level will occur. Also, climate change is expected to induce an increase in intensity of typhoons and therefore larger storm surges. These two circumstances would cause a need for the coast to be protected from higher water levels. The question arises whether the coastal defences of Tokyo Bay will be able to resist these future conditions in a satisfactory manner. In case {{there is a need for}} taking measures, a storm surge barrier could be an alternative course of action instead of dikes. The aim of this project has been to determine whether a storm surge barrier is a good solution for the flood protection of Tokyo Bay in the future. Moreover, a proposal for a conceptual design has been developed. The design addresses the challenges that this barrier would bring, mainly the large depths and the high seismicity of the area. Previous studies have analyzed the cost of upgrading coastal defences, considering conditions for the year 2100 and a typhoon of approximated return period of 100 years. In this report, this cost is compared to the cost of building a storm surge barrier, for the same scenario. Different locations have been studied for the barrier and the optimal one has been found to be close to the bay mouth, near cape Futtsu. The report also analyzes the convenience of using certain design conditions (sea level rise, typhoon return period). As a result, it is advised to consider as a safety standard larger return periods than the ones the Japanese have used up till now (100 - 200 years). Besides the cost calculation, a multi-criteria analysis is performed in order to compare all the considered options. The result is that barriers do not surpass coastal defences upgrading, if a return period of 100 years is considered. However, in case larger design return periods are applied, as recommended here, the barrier is supposed to increase its advantages, compared to the upgrading of coastal defences. The result of these considerations is a proposal for a barrier close to the bay mouth and built for a return period of 500 years. Once the overall design conditions are set for the hypothetical barrier, a layout is defined in order to satisfy the contemplated requirements and functions. The main requirements are flood protection (control water levels inside the bay during typhoons), navigational (allow shipping) and environmental (allow sufficient water exchange to protect the ecosystem inside the bay). The proposed barrier that fulfills these requirements is composed of a dam, a movable barrier part and a permanent opening. Finally, a conceptual design is developed. Part of the barrier is a dam, which would cross a long and deep section of the bay. The aim is to present an innovative design that offers advantages compared to standard solutions (rubble mound section, use of geocontainers). This thesis proposes a sand-filled geotextile structure for the dam core. This design offers a good performance during the dam lifetime, at a price that makes it competitive. The geotextile structure is composed of vertical cells and is expected to offer interesting advantages, like cost savings compared to a <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> standard solution. Also, the expected performance during its lifetime improves with respect to other geotextile technologies, such as geocontainers. The proposed design allows for compacting the filling and avoiding gaps in the core of the structure, which is expected to help the stability of the dam and reduce the damage in case an earthquake happens.

40|$|The {{reshaping}} {{of temporary}} rubble mounds like {{the core of}} breakwaters or reclamation bunds is often a concern for contractorsi n the construction stages of marine structures. The formulas found in literature for the prediction of such behavior are few, {{and they do not}} provide clear insight on the influence of relevant parameters, in particular the small dimensions and wide stone-size gradation of the material involved, usually consisting of <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> or resulting from dredging. The previous research in the field of dynamic stability focused on berm breakwaters and gravel beaches. These two typologies of structures define the range to which the rubble mounds considered in this study generally belong. An overview on the design tools provided by the technical literature shows that, whenever the grading was included as a governing parameter, some influence was recognized in the characteristics of the structure (e. g. the permeability) and in the dynamism of the different fractions of stone sizes. However, very wide ranges of the parameter grading were never investigated and a specific analysis in this direction constitutes the main significance of this study. The Delft University of Technology provided the laboratory facilities to carry out physical model tests on a wide graded rubble mound structure representative of the core of a breakwater. The parameter D 85 /D 15, describing the stone-size gradation of the construction material, was varied between the values 2. 71 and 17. 7, and two different seaward slopes of the model structure were also tested. The reshaped cross-shore profiles measured during the tests showed how if the grading increases the stability of the structure is reduced. This is not always in accordance with the findings of previous researchers, showing how the extrapolation of existing empirical formulas to structures with high values of the ratio D 85 /D 15 do not give reliable results. Instead, the formulas given by van de Meer (1992) to estimate the whole reshaped profile of a dynamic slope predict with good agreement the shape of the measured profiles, although the physical model shows a larger horizontal extension of the displacements. This difference is governed by the grading, being more noticeable as this parameter increases. This result leads to the definition of new formulas, some of them being modifications of the ones given by van der Meer, to describe the geometry of a reshaped profile. The formulas, all including the parameter grading, are derived through curve fitting of the measured data. Also a formula for the direct estimation of the crest recession is given. As a final step, a simple numerical model is proposed in which the new formulas are implemented, constituting a quick way to assess the shape of a slope after a wave attack. As a suggestion for further utilization of the results of physical modeling, a brief comparison is also carried out between the output of the tests and the prediction of the numerical model XBeach (developed mainly at UNESCO-IHE). In conclusion, this research points out how the formulas provided by the technical literature are not reliable in representing the effects of a very wide stone-size gradation in the stability of a rubble mound structure. Physical model tests proved to be a suited way to investigate these effects, as the nature of the phenomena who {{play a role in the}} stability does not allow a simple analytical representation. The tests carried out within the present study lead to the implementation of a numerical model of practical use for engineers and contractors: further investigations through laboratory tests are recommended to validate and extend the findings of this study. Another proposed direction for further research is the comparison between the results of physical model tests and the output of numerical models.

40|$|In {{this report}} the beach erosion {{problem at the}} Village of Mayabeque, located 60 km south of Havana at the South coast of Cuba will be investigated. Mayabeque is a small local holiday village. 20 houses are {{permanently}} inhabited and in the summer the population goes up to 3000, mostly Cuban people all spending there holidays here. Mayabeque suffers from an average coast regression of 1. 1 meter per year. The main objective of this project is the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque Beach. Therefore an investigation to the causes of erosion {{needs to be made}} and after that solutions will be proposed. The first step in the research was gathering relevant information. Information on bathymetry, wind, waves etc. was collected. Furthermore the influence of nearby rivers, the neighbouring mangrove coasts and the Coral reefs in the gulf of Batabano has been investigated. With all this data a qualitative analyses was made to identify the probable causes of erosion. The following circumstances were identified as possible causes of erosion: An increase in the frequency and intensity of storms (thus an increase of offshore transport), global sea level rise, a dominant long shore transport and the construction of houses on the dune. All these possible causes have been integrated in a complete erosion theory. The principal idea is that sand from the beach and dune is transported to the foreshore and then moved out of the area by long shore transport. Both long shore and cross-shore transport have been calculated, using the CERC formula and Unibest CL+ for long shore transport and the convolution method and Sbeach in combination with BMAP for cross-shore transport. It appeared to be difficult to combine the results from both gradients in order to simulate the history of erosion. Mainly qualitative insights were gained. The results though do prove that the developed theory is a good description of the history of erosion at Mayabeque Beach. With this theory in mind three concepts are presented for the rehabilitation of the Mayabeque beach. These concepts are: nourishment, nourishment with groins and nourishment with offshore breakwaters. Every concept contains several alternatives. With the help of a Multi Criteria Analysis one alternative from every concept was chosen to be designed. These alternatives are: Beach nourishment, groin field with nourishment and multiple offshore breakwaters in combination with nourishment. After designing these alternatives a multi criteria analysis was performed again and {{it was found that the}} groin field with nourishment was the best solution. After an optimization a cost reduction of 30 % was achieved and this alternative ultimately arrived to the following dimensions: The groin field exists of four groins with a distance of 500 m between them and with a length of 133 meters each, with a crest height of 1, 5 meter above mean sea level and a crest width of 5, 04 meter. Each groin has an armour layer, filter layer and care. At both sides at the toe a filter is placed. The armour layer exist of quarry stone with a Dn 50 of 0, 63 m, the filter layer of armour stone with a Dn 50 of 0, 32 m and the core exists of <b>quarry</b> <b>run</b> with a Dn 50 of 0, 16 m. The filters at the toe are made up of three layers. Each layer has a width of 20 cm. In downward direction these layers have a Dn 50 of respectively 108 mm, 18 mm and 3 mm. The slope of the groin is 1 : 1 and of the head 1 : 23. The average width of the beach nourishment is 30. 2 meter with a total volume of 428800 m 3. The construction of the whole alternative will claim about 24 weeks and the costs of this project are calculated at 1. 4 million dollar. Due to the groin field with nourishment the beach will be stable and after a storm accretion will return to equilibrium situation. Erosion is present at the down drift side (at the mangroves) of the groin in the west but due to the initial placement of the nourishment in the form of the equilibrium profile the erosion will be less. It is realized this solution still is expensive and that it will take time for Melena del Sur to raise funds. Therefore a cheap initial solution is presented, which can be used to cover the time until sufficient funds for the definitive solution have been found. This cheap initial solution involves a redistribution of the available stones presently situated in seawalls and groins in an orderly sequence of berm breakwaters.

On 31 March 1963, a fire {{destroyed}} Tynycaeau Junction signal box and BR decided not to rebuild it, and hence the Penrhos Branch section from the Walnut Tree tunnel southwards to Tynycaeau junction was maintained as its original double track but given 'long siding' status and as Steetley Doloma workings had always necessitated a run-round by the steam locomotive, which could not be performed at the Walnut Tree West rail connection due to the permanent way layout, the loco' had to travel 'light engine' for a round trip of 7¼ miles by running to Tynycaeau and crossing over from down to up line near the former junction with the Cadoxton-Wenvoe-Pontypridd line. With the signal box out of action at Tynycaeau, the crossover was modified to sprung points from down to up line. Eventually even that section was curtailed and sleeper stops placed on both lines at the Walnut Tree tunnel north portal. The double track was not lifted until the decommissioning of the whole line in 1969. The remaining branch was later worked as a single-track long siding from Penrhos to the Steetley Doloma limestone quarry, just south of the viaduct, the permanent way layout having been modified. The last train to the <b>quarry</b> <b>ran</b> over the viaduct in 1967. By the late 1990s the tunnel was gated and by the year 2000 the quarry had breached the tunnel lining, leaving a 50 yd air gap in its structure.|$|R
