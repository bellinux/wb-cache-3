25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, for {{a closed}} system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer {{associated with a}} disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in {{the values of the}} energy levels themselves. It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of <b>quasi-static</b> adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.|$|E
25|$|Woman with a Horse was {{conceived}} {{in such a}} way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, piecing together the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the temporal evolution resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during the painting process). Only then do the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something <b>quasi-static</b> to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the work}} of Bryan (1907), the most {{accepted}} {{way to deal with}} it nowadays, followed by Carathéodory, is to rely on the previously established concept of <b>quasi-static</b> processes, as follows. Actual physical processes of transfer of energy as work are always at least to some degree irreversible. The irreversibility is often due to mechanisms known as dissipative, that transform bulk kinetic energy into internal energy. Examples are friction and viscosity. If the process is performed more slowly, the frictional or viscous dissipation is less. In the limit of infinitely slow performance, the dissipation tends to zero and then the limiting process, though fictional rather than actual, is notionally reversible, and is called <b>quasi-static.</b> Throughout the course of the fictional limiting <b>quasi-static</b> process, the internal intensive variables of the system are equal to the external intensive variables, those that describe the reactive forces exerted by the surroundings. This can be taken to justify the formula ...|$|E

2500|$|One early theory {{proposed}} for the acceleration of auroral electrons {{is based on an}} assumed static, or <b>quasi-static,</b> electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop. No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, Poisson's equation indicates {{that there can be no}} configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop. [...] Inexplicably though, some authors still invoke <b>quasi-static</b> parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact. [...] In another example, there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the ion beam energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of auroral particle acceleration'.|$|E

2500|$|Hu and Bush {{conclude}} that meniscus climbing {{is an unusual}} means of propulsion in that the insect propels itself in a <b>quasi-static</b> configuration, without moving its appendages. [...] Biolocomotion is generally characterized by the transfer of muscular strain energy to the kinetic and gravitational potential energy of the creature, and the kinetic energy of the suspending fluid. [...] In contrast, meniscus climbing has a different energy pathway: by deforming the free surface, the insect converts muscular strain to the surface energy that powers its ascent.|$|E
2500|$|According to Münster (1970), [...] "A {{somewhat}} unsatisfactory {{aspect of}} Carathéodory's {{theory is that}} {{a consequence of the}} Second Law must be considered at this point , i.e. that it is not always possible to reach any state 2 from any other state 1 by means of an adiabatic process." [...] Münster instances that no adiabatic process can reduce the internal energy of a system at constant volume. Carathéodory's paper asserts that its statement of the first law corresponds exactly to Joule's experimental arrangement, regarded as an instance of adiabatic work. It does not point out that Joule's experimental arrangement performed essentially irreversible work, through friction of paddles in a liquid, or passage of electric current through a resistance inside the system, driven by motion of a coil and inductive heating, or by an external current source, which can access the system only by the passage of electrons, and so is not strictly adiabatic, because electrons are a form of matter, which cannot penetrate adiabatic walls. The paper goes on to base its main argument on the possibility of <b>quasi-static</b> adiabatic work, which is essentially reversible. The paper asserts that it will avoid reference to Carnot cycles, and then proceeds to base its argument on cycles of forward and backward <b>quasi-static</b> adiabatic stages, with isothermal stages of zero magnitude.|$|E
2500|$|At large {{relative}} distance, the near-field {{components of}} electric and magnetic fields are approximately <b>quasi-static</b> oscillating dipole fields. [...] These fields decrease with the cube of distance: (Drange/Dant)−3 [...] Since power {{is proportional to}} the square of the field strength, the power transferred decreases as (Drange/Dant)−6. or 60dB per decade. [...] In other words, if far apart, doubling the distance between the two antennas causes the power received to decrease by a factor of 26 = 64. As a result, inductive and capacitive coupling can only be used for short-range power transfer, within a few times the diameter of the antenna device Dant. [...] Unlike in a radiative system where the maximum radiation occurs when the dipole antennas are oriented transverse to the direction of propagation, with dipole fields the maximum coupling occurs when the dipoles are oriented longitudinally.|$|E
2500|$|Field {{electron}} emission (also known as field emission (FE) and electron field emission) is emission of electrons induced by an electrostatic field. The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into vacuum. However, field emission {{can take place}} from solid or liquid surfaces, into vacuum, air, a fluid, or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the Zener effect) can also {{be regarded as a}} form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, thermionic emission (or Richardson–Dushman effect) and [...] "cold electronic emission", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or <b>quasi-static)</b> electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When field emission is used without qualifiers it typically means [...] "cold emission".|$|E
2500|$|The {{scope of}} the NIST {{investigation}} was focused on identifying [...] "the sequence of events" [...] that triggered the collapse, and did not include {{detailed analysis of the}} collapse mechanism itself (after the point at which events made the collapse inevitable). In line with the concerns of most engineers, NIST focused on the airplane impacts and the spread and effects of the fires, modeling these using the software program Fire Dynamics Simulator. NIST developed several highly detailed structural models for specific sub-systems such as the floor trusses as well as a global model of the towers as a whole which is less detailed. [...] These models are static or <b>quasi-static,</b> including deformation but not the motion of structural elements after rupture as would dynamic models. [...] So, the NIST models are useful for determining how the collapse was triggered, but do not shed light on events after that point.|$|E
2500|$|The {{steady state}} has a {{slightly}} different value depending on the strain rate at which it is measured. [...] Thus the steady state shear strength at the <b>quasi-static</b> strain rate (the strain {{rate at which the}} critical state is defined to occur at) would seem to correspond to the critical state shear strength. [...] However, there is an additional difference between the two states. This is that at the steady state condition the grains position themselves in the steady state structure, whereas no such structure occurs for the critical state. In the case of shearing to large strains for soils with elongated particles, this steady state structure is one where the grains are oriented (perhaps even aligned) in the direction of shear. In the case where the particles are strongly aligned in the direction of shear, the steady state corresponds to the [...] "residual condition." ...|$|E

A notable example of {{a process that is}} not even <b>quasi-static</b> is the slow heat exchange between two bodies at two finitely different temperatures, where the heat exchange rate is controlled by an approximately adiabatic partition between the two bodies - in this case, no matter how slowly the process takes place, the states of the two bodies are never infinitesimally close to equilibrium, since thermal equilibrium requires that the two bodies be at the same temperature.|$|E
