5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies {{over the course of}} its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Mycologists Tsuguo Hongo and Rokuya Imazeki {{suggested}} in the 1980s that the Japanese mushroom A.sphaerobulbosa was synonymous with the North American A.abrupta. However, a 1999 study of Amanita specimens in Japanese herbaria concluded that they were closely related but distinct species, {{due to differences in}} spore shape and in the microstructure of the volval remnants. Another similar species, A.magniverrucata, is differentiated from A.abrupta by a number of characteristics: the universal veil is clearly separated from the flesh of the cap; the volval warts disappear more <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> the surface of the cap cuticle gelatinizes; the partial veil is more persistent; the spores are smaller and roughly spherical; {{on the underside of the}} partial veil, the stem has surface fibrils that are drawn upward so as to somewhat resemble a cortina (a cobweb-like protective covering over the immature spore bearing surfaces); A.magniverrucata has a known distribution limited to the south western coast of North America.|$|E

25|$|After Diệm, South Vietnam {{went through}} a period of {{persistent}} and serious instability, as multiple coups, as well as other failed uprisings, occurred for 18 months. Apart from personal rivalries between the senior officers, the infighting was also stoked by conflict between religious pressure movements. The Buddhists lobbied for the removal of Diệm's pro-Catholic policies, as well as those officers who had risen up the ranks <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> they converted to Catholicism and vigorously enacted Diệm's policies. On the other hand, Catholics, whose privileges were rolled back post-Diệm, accused the regime of General Nguyễn Khánh of persecuting them on behalf of the Buddhists. At times, religious riots broke out during this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} made of two {{independent}} settlements: Lower Košice and Upper Košice, amalgamated in the 13th century around the long lens-formed ring, of today's Main Street. The first known town privileges come from 1290. The city grew <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> of its strategic location on an international trade route from agriculturally rich central Hungary to central Poland, itself along a greater route connecting the Balkans and the Adriatic and Aegean seas to the Baltic Sea. The privileges given by the king were helpful in developing crafts, business, increasing importance (seat of the royal chamber for Upper Hungary), and for building its strong fortifications. In 1307, the first guild regulations were registered here and were the oldest in Kingdom of Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} were always held on Fridays in the Astronaut Office {{and it was}} here that Collins found himself on January 27, 1967. Don Gregory was running the meeting in the absence of Alan Shepard and so it was he who answered the red phone to be informed that there was a fire in the Apollo 1 CM. When the enormity of the situation was ascertained, it fell on Collins to go the Chaffee household to tell Martha Chaffee that her husband was dead. The Astronaut Office had learned to be proactive in informing astronauts' families of a death <b>quickly,</b> <b>because</b> of the death of Theodore Freeman in an aircraft crash, when a newspaper reporter was the first to his house.|$|E

25|$|The {{norm for}} landing at Fornebu was to {{rendezvous}} with a radio beacon, Rumba, and conduct a fifteen-degree left turn {{for about half}} a minute. The aircraft would then be aligned with the 06 runway and could glide down following the instrument landing system (ILS). This maneuver would nominally take place {{at an altitude of}} 1,100meters (3,500ft). However, in clear weather the pilots often opted for a short-cut to reach the approach path more <b>quickly.</b> <b>Because</b> of the topography, it was possible that the ILS beams would deviate up to twenty-five degrees, which could cause the pilots to turn the aircraft too early and would cause the aircraft to fly over a range of hills on the wrong heading. This was a known fault with the system and pilots would therefore check the direction of the radio beacon at Asker to ensure they were in the correct position. This short-cut was carried out by Flight 239.|$|E
25|$|Linda Dugeau and Dot Robinson co-founded Motor Maids with 51 {{members and}} a dream. She took {{interest}} {{in the idea of}} creating a women’s group in the 1930s and took the liberty to reach out to motorcycle dealerships, AMA clubs and fellow riders in search to find women riders who would take part in helping her form a motorcycle organization of females. Although the idea of forming a group took ten years before becoming reality it took Dugeau and her old friend Dot Robinson three of the ten years to find willing female participates to be considered as Motor Maid members. Once the organization found its standing legs the organization expanded quickly, and opportunities to showcase themselves at parades and other events approached them <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> they had a distinctive image. The Motor Maids organization became very popular throughout the United States of America and president Dot Robinson and secretary Linda Dugeau were ecstatic with the movement they were creating.|$|E
25|$|The Parabolica corner was altered {{ahead of}} the race weekend, with {{a large portion of}} the turn's gravel trap removed and {{replaced}} with an asphalt run-off area. It was reported that the alteration was made ahead of a possible return of the Superbike World Championship in 2015 after series officials raised concerns about the lack of run-off areas on the circuit. The change was heavily criticised by the sport's fan base on social media and certain drivers who felt it removed part of the challenge from Parabolica. The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting, however, defended the changes, revealing that drivers and the sport's governing body asked for alterations to be made for safety reasons but acknowledged the turn may not provide much of a challenge as it previously did. Others, including Romain Grosjean joined in Whiting's defence, with him believing the gravel trap's removal would enable drivers to find their limit more <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> of the lack of fear of a large accident in the event of problems.|$|E

Once, when Sun Quan was away on a campaign, they {{took advantage of the}} situation to set their plans into motion. At the time, the various chiefs of the counties in Danyang were scheduled to meet Sun Yi in the commandery capital. Before the meeting, Sun Yi asked his wife, Lady Xu (徐氏), who was versed in divination, to predict the events of the meeting. Lady Xu predicted ill luck and advised her husband to postpone the meeting, but Sun Yi wanted to settle the meeting <b>quickly</b> <b>because</b> the Chiefs had been waiting for some time since they arrived, so he hosted a banquet for them. Sun Yi often carried a sword with him when he travelled around, but he became tipsy after the feast so he was unarmed when he saw the guests off. Just then, Bian Hong attacked him from behind. The scene was thrown into disarray and no one came to Sun Yi's rescue so Sun died at the hands of Bian Hong. Bian Hong escaped to the hills after murdering Sun Yi, but was later killed by Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E
