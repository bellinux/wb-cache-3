5000|$|Users must ‘extend trust’ to the Ripple gateway {{that holds}} their deposit. This manual {{creation}} of a trustline indicates to the Ripple network that the user is comfortable with the gateway’s counterparty risk. Furthermore, the user must put a <b>quantitative</b> <b>limit</b> on this trust and create a similar limit for each currency on deposit at that gateway. For example, if a user deposits US$50 and BTC2.00 at The Rock Trading, the user will have to grant trust of at least that much in both currencies to the gateway for the monies to {{be available in the}} Ripple network. When a user has allowed multiple gateways in the same currency, there is an advanced option to allow [...] "rippling," [...] which subjects the user’s balance of that currency to switch (or ripple) between gateways. Though their total balance doesn't alter, users earn a small transit fee for providing inter-gateway liquidity.|$|E
50|$|In solids, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>limit</b> of heat {{capacity}} {{in general is}} about 3 R per mole of atoms, where R is the ideal gas constant. This 3 R value is about 24.9 J/mole.K. Six degrees of freedom (three kinetic and three potential) are available to each atom. Each of these six contributes R specific {{heat capacity}} per mole of atoms. This limit of 3 R per mole specific heat capacity is approached {{at room temperature for}} most solids, with significant departures at this temperature only for solids composed of the lightest atoms which are bound very strongly, such as beryllium (where the value is only of 66% of 3 R), or diamond (where it is only 24% of 3 R). These large departures are due to quantum effects which prevent full distribution of heat into all vibrational modes, when the energy difference between vibrational quantum states is very large compared to the average energy available to each atom from the ambient temperature.|$|E
40|$|On {{efficiency}} grounds, {{the economics}} community has to date tended to emphasize price-based policies to address climate change [...] such as taxes or a "safety-valve" price ceiling for cap-and-trade [...] while environmental advocates have sought a more clear <b>quantitative</b> <b>limit</b> on emissions. This paper presents a simple modification {{to the idea}} of a safety valve: a <b>quantitative</b> <b>limit</b> that we call the allowance reserve. Importantly, this idea may bridge the gap between competing interests and potentially improve efficiency relative to tax or other price-based policies. The last point highlights the deficiencies in several previous studies of price and quantity controls for climate change that do not adequately capture the dynamic opportunities within a cap-and-trade system for allowance banking, borrowing, and intertemporal arbitrage in response to unfolding information. ...|$|E
