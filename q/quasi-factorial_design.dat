40|$|This study investigates whether {{indirect}} {{corrective feedback}} is effective on students’ writing accuracy {{and whether there}} is any interaction between corrective feedback and students’ levels of grammatical sensitivity. A <b>quasi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> was adopted for this research. The subjects of the study were fourth-semester students of English Department, at a State University in Malang, selected randomly. The experimental group was treated with indirect corrective feedback and the control group with direct corrective feedback. A parametric statistical test, ANCOVA, {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. The findings show that there was no statistical difference on writing accuracy between the experimental and control groups. Yet, among students {{with a high level of}} grammatical sensitivity, there was significant difference in writing accuracy between those given indirect and direct corrective feedback. Further, there was no interaction between corrective feedback on writing accuracy and students’ levels of grammatical sensitivity. However, indirect corrective feedback improved students’ writing accuracy better than direct corrective feedback...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of acupuncture alone and in combination with education on smoking cessation and cigarette consumption. Methods. We prospectively studied 141 adults in a <b>quasi-factorial</b> <b>design</b> using acu-puncture, sham acupuncture, and education. Results. All groups showed significant reductions in smoking and posttreatment cig-arette consumption, with the combined acupuncture–education group showing the great-est effect from treatment. The trend continued in follow-up; however, significant differ-ences were not maintained. Greater pack-year history (i. e. {{the number of years}} smoking multiplied by baseline number of cigarettes smoked per year, divided by 20 cigarettes per pack) negatively correlated with treatment effect. Trend analysis suggested 20 pack-years as the cutoff point for this correlation. Conclusions. Acupuncture and education, alone and in combination, significantly re-duce smoking; however, combined they show a significantly greater effect, as seen in subjects with a greater pack-year history.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic {{therapy for}} acute ischemic stroke with a lower-than-standard dose of {{intravenous}} alteplase may improve recovery {{along with a}} reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: Using a 2 -by- 2 <b>quasi-factorial</b> open-label <b>design,</b> we randomly assigned 3310 patients who were eligible for thrombolytic therapy (median age, 67 years; 63 % Asian) to low-dose intravenous alteplase (0. 6 mg per kilogram of body weight) or the standard dose (0. 9 mg per kilogram); patients underwent randomization within 4. 5 hours after the onset of stroke. The primary objective {{was to determine whether}} the low dose would be noninferior to the standard dose with respect to the primary outcome of death or disability at 90 days, which was defined by scores of 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Secondary objectives were to determine whether the low dose would be superior to the standard dose with respect to centrally adjudicated symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and whether the low dose would be noninferior in an ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (testing for an improvement in the distribution of scores). The trial included 935 patients who were also randomly assigned to intensive or guideline-recommended blood-pressure control. RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 855 of 1607 participants (53. 2 %) in the low-dose group and in 817 of 1599 participants (51. 1 %) in the standard-dose group (odds ratio, 1. 09; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 95 to 1. 25; the upper boundary exceeded the noninferiority margin of 1. 14; P= 0. 51 for noninferiority). Low-dose alteplase was noninferior in the ordinal analysis of modified Rankin scale scores (unadjusted common odds ratio, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 89 to 1. 13; P= 0. 04 for noninferiority). Major symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1. 0 % {{of the participants in the}} low-dose group and in 2. 1 % of the participants in the standard-dose group (P= 0. 01); fatal events occurred within 7 days in 0. 5 % and 1. 5 %, respectively (P= 0. 01). Mortality at 90 days did not differ significantly between the two groups (8. 5 % and 10. 3 %, respectively; P= 0. 07). CONCLUSIONS: This trial involving predominantly Asian patients with acute ischemic stroke did not show the noninferiority of low-dose alteplase to standard-dose alteplase with respect to death and disability at 90 days. There were significantly fewer symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages with low-dose alteplase.

40|$|Background Thrombolytic {{therapy for}} acute ischemic stroke with lower than {{standard}} dose of intravenous alteplase may improve recovery with reduced risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Methods Using a 2 -by- 2 <b>quasi-factorial</b> open label <b>design,</b> we randomly assigned 3310 patients eligible for thrombolytic therapy (median age 67 years, 63 % Asian) within 4. 5 hours of stroke onset, {{to test for}} noninferiority of low-dose (0. 6 mg/kg) compared with standard-dose (0. 9 mg/kg) intravenous alteplase. The trial included 940 patients co-randomized to intensive versus guideline-recommended blood pressure control. The primary outcome was death or disability at 90 days (scores 2 to 6 on the modified Rankin scale [mRS]; range 0, no symptoms, to 6, death). Secondary objectives included tests of superiority for centrally-adjudicated symptomatic ICH and noninferiority in ordinal analysis of the mRS (testing for improvement across scale categories).
