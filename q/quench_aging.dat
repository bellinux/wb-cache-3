40|$|A non-quench aging (reheating {{hot-rolled}} {{plates to}} 600 &DEG; C for isothermal aging), {{different from the}} conventional <b>quench</b> <b>aging</b> (quench followed by temper), was carried Out to improve the strength level for acicular ferrite (AF) pipeline steels, while their impact energies and ductilities did not decrease obviously, and the Charpy impact fracture appearances were similar between the as-rolled and the aged samples, showing the ductile dimple rupture over the whole fracture surface. The strengthening was ascribed to the further additional precipitation of microalloyed carbonitrides, and the little degradation of ductile and toughness is believed to relate to both the tempering of martensite in martensite/austenite (M/A) islands and the improvement of microstructural uniformity upon the non-quench aging. The nucleation and strengthening of the carbonitrides in the Current non-quench aging were hypothetically calculated with the present mathematical modes and hypothesis based on the thermodynamic consideration and Orowan looping mechanism, which was somewhat consistent with the present experiment, indicating that the strengthening mechanism of the present AF pipeline steels by the current non-quench aging evidently resulted from the additional precipitation of carbonitrides in ferrite region of approximately 600 &DEG; C...|$|E

Due {{to the low}} solubility of both aluminum and silver in beryllium, the silver was concentrated in the aluminum phase, which appeared to separate from the beryllium in the liquid phase. A fine, continuous composite beryllium-aluminum microstructure was formed, which did not significantly change after hot isostatically pressing at 550 C for one hour at 30, 000 psi argon pressure.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effectiveness}} and {{usefulness of the}} <b>quench</b> <b>ageing</b> on the service properties of massive duplex cast steel was presented in this work. The mechanism of precipitation of a ε-Cu phase {{and its effect on}} the mechanical properties of the cast steel were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The microscopic analysis of the cast steel was performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 25 optical microscope. The substructure of ferrite was examined on a JOEL JEM 3010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The analysis of chemical composition of selected micro-regions was carried out using a JEOL JSM 5400 scanning microscope equipped with an EDS microanalyzer. The verification of the metallographic examination results was done using the Thermo-Calc program. Findings: The formation of the ε-Cu phase during <b>quench</b> <b>ageing</b> causes an increase in hardness and drop in impact resistance. The ageing parameters have a substantial influence on the ferrite substructure and the degree of coherence, dispersion and amount of the ε-Cu phase. The ageing treatment at 480 °C causes the precipitation of the ε-Cu phase coherent with the matrix. This temperature of <b>quench</b> <b>ageing</b> produce also the formation of a α’-Cr phase and an α-Fe phase. Practical implications: Duplex cast steels are becoming an irreplaceable material in the elements of equipment exposed to the simultaneous action of corrosive and erosive environment. In the case of massive elements like pumps and pipeline elements, the effect of <b>quench</b> <b>ageing</b> is much lower which is associated with the presence of a large amount of the incoherent ε-Cu phase in the cast steel after the solution heat treatment. Originality/value: The lower temperature of <b>quench</b> <b>ageing</b> duplex cast steels with copper addition should not be lower than 500 °C because of the temperature of an undesirable spinodal decomposition of the ferrite in 480 °C which is partially responsible for the slight increase in hardness and a drastic drop in plastic properties...|$|R

The {{objective of}} this paper was to describe phenomena related to the formation of functional properties CuFe 2 strips, especially for obtaining hardness in 120 - 140 HV range and electrical conductivity above 35 MS/m. Design/methodology/approach: The investigated material consisted of two industrial melts of CuFe 2. Systematic investigations of selected variants of heat treatment and plastic working operations were carried out. The investigations started with description of microstructure and properties in initial state, after quenching, after cold working, <b>quenching</b> and <b>ageing,</b> after <b>quenching</b> and <b>ageing,</b> after <b>quenching,</b> <b>ageing</b> and cold working and after cold working and annealing - omitting <b>quenching</b> and <b>ageing</b> process. Hardness test (HV) and electrical conductivity were determined on strip samples. Typical tension tests and metallographic investigations were also carried out.

It could be assumed, that the dissolved in a melting process alloy additives (in this case a part of dissolved iron) might be supersaturated, but some of them might be precipitated. This theory was confirmed by the results of investigation into mechanical properties, microstructure and electrical conductivity.

The truncated activity of cluster galaxies was parametrised using a specific star formation history with two free parameters, the <b>quenching</b> <b>age</b> QA and the quenching factor QF.

40|$|Aging {{is always}} present, {{tailoring}} our interactions {{with others and}} postulating a finite lifespan during which {{we are able to}} exercise them. We consider the prisoner's dilemma game on a square lattice, and examine how <b>quenched</b> <b>age</b> distributions and different aging protocols influence the evolution of cooperation when taking the life experience and knowledge accumulation into account as time passes. In agreement with previous studies, we find that a <b>quenched</b> assignment of <b>age</b> to players, introducing heterogeneity to the game, substantially promotes cooperative behavior. Introduction of aging and subsequent death as a coevolutionary process may act detrimental on cooperation but enhances it efficiently if the offspring of individuals that have successfully passed their strategy is considered newborn. We study resulting age distributions of players, and show that the heterogeneity is vital yet insufficient for explaining the observed differences in cooperator abundance on the spatial grid.

The molten alloys were poured in to a mild steel die to cast tensile test bars. Then tensile and hardness tests were performed in order to analyze the properties and fracture surfaces of the cast specimens.

Practical implications: Tested composite materials can be applicate among the others in automotive industry but it requires additional researches. Originality/value: It was demonstrated that the mechanical properties, as well as the wear and corrosion resistance of the sintered composite materials with the EN AW-Al Cu 4 Mg 1 (A) alloy matrix may be formed by the dispersion hardening with the Al 2 O 3 particles in various portions and by the precipitation hardening of the matrix...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>quenching</b> and <b>aging</b> {{treatment}} on microstructure and abrasive wear of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The as-received alloy was solution treated at 1339 K, then oil <b>quenched,</b> followed by <b>aging</b> at 823 K for 4 h (14, 400 s). The microstructures of as-received and quench-aged specimens were characterized by using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and electron backscattered diffraction techniques. The as-received specimen consisted of very fine alpha grains (average grain size 2 mu m) with beta phase uniformly dispersed throughout. The microstructure of the quench-aged specimen showed alpha plates (formed by the decomposition of alpha' during aging). The beta phase precipitated out of alpha' martensite during aging and hence was dispersed uniformly in the alpha matrix. Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy was quench-aged to achieve maximum hardness with a view that the increased hardness would lead to an improvement in abrasive wear behavior. Two-body abrasive wear tests were carried out on the as-received and quench-aged specimens using pin-on-disk apparatus with SiC as abrasive media (150 -grit size). The effect of sliding distance and normal load on the abrasive wear behavior was studied. The wear resistance of the as-received specimen was {{greater than that of}} quench-aged specimen, while hardness of the as-received specimen was lower than that of quench-aged specimen. The abrasive wear behavior of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy has been explained based on morphology/microstructure of the alloy and the associated wear mechanism(s) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} {{facilitated}} spin models of cooperative dynamics introduced by Fredrickson and Andersen display on Bethe lattices a glassy behaviour {{similar to the}} one predicted by the mode-coupling theory of supercooled liquids and the dynamical theory of mean-field disordered systems. At low temperature such cooperative models show a two-step relaxation and their equilibration time diverges at a finite temperature according to a power-law. The geometric nature of the dynamical arrest corresponds to a bootstrap percolation process which leads to a phase space organization {{similar to the one}} of mean-field disordered systems. The relaxation dynamics after a subcritical <b>quench</b> exhibits <b>aging</b> and converges asymptotically to the threshold states that appear at the bootstrap percolation transition.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various high {{temperature}} heat treatments and cooling {{rates on the}} hardness of cast 60 -NITINOL (60 wt%Ni- 40 wt%Ti) was studied. The hardness ranged from approximately 33 HRC for annealed specimens to 63 HRC for water <b>quenched</b> specimens. <b>Aging</b> {{did not have a}} further effect on the hardness of the heat-treated and quenched material. The issue of material contamination and its possible effect on quench cracking during heat treatment above 1000 C was explored. The Charpy impact energy of the material was found to be relatively low (ranging from 0. 4 to 1. 0 J) and comparable to that of cast magnesium. Selection of service environments and applications for this material based on these findings should consider the processing route by which it was produced...|$|R
