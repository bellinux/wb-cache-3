A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment; and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects.|$|E

The Soviet Union also contained the highest grades of stoat pelts, with the best grade North American pelts being comparable only to the 9th grade in the <b>quality</b> <b>criteria</b> of former Soviet stoat standards. However, stoat harvesting never became a specialty in any Soviet republic, with most stoats being captured incidentally in traps or near villages. Stoats in the Soviet Union were captured either with dogs or with box-traps or jaw-traps. Guns were rarely used, as they could damage the pelt.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the class into service has not been without problems. Since June 2005, all active Armidales have undergone operating restrictions on two occasions, both due to water contamination of the main fuel systems. The first occurrence, in September 2006, led to the suspension of operations by the patrol boats for a month, and the engineering controls were redesigned. The problem occurred again in January 2007, and led to an 'operational pause' while Austal redesigned the fuel system, engineering procedures were altered, and fuel <b>quality</b> <b>criteria</b> were tightened. The five ships yet to be completed were fitted with the modified fuel system during construction, while the active ships were refitted {{over the course of}} 2007. As of December 2007, no further fuel problems have occurred.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the development of Handling <b>Qualities</b> <b>criteria</b> for a civil tiltrotor. The work presented is the outcome of a combined effort of European research organizations and helicopter industries, working together in an European Commission sponsored critical technology program – RHILP (Rotorcraft Handling, Interactions and Loads Prediction). The RHILP approach to Handling Qualities has developed from the systems methodology in ADS- 33. An important exercise has involved assembling a consistent set of Handling <b>Qualities</b> <b>criteria</b> appropriate to flight in rotorcraft, conversion and fixed-wing aircraft modes. Within this process a compatibility analysis has revealed inconsistencies and, more critically, gaps in the available data, particularly relating to flight in conversion mode. The paper outlines the approach taken and presents results from a series of piloted simulation trials carried out to provide supporting data which can be used to fill the gaps. The results presented are considered to be unique since there are no open publications available to date on tiltrotor aircraft Handling <b>Qualities</b> <b>criteria...</b>|$|R
