500|$|Having {{previously}} worked on D.R. & <b>Quinch</b> for 2000 AD, a title made popular by John Constantine's creator Alan Moore, Delano {{was selected to}} start the character's first run in his own comic by then editor Karen Berger in 1988. Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city financiers being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with Freemasons from the Houses of Parliament. He also had environmentalist issues crop up, especially in [...] "The Fear Machine" [...] (issues #15-22), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor Karen Berger noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that Margaret Thatcher was forced out of office.|$|E
2500|$|During this three-year period, 2000AD {{would accept}} and publish over fifty of Moore's one-off stories for their Future Shocks and Time Twisters science fiction series. The editors at the {{magazine}} were impressed by Moore's work and decided to offer him a more permanent strip, starting with a story {{that they wanted to}} be vaguely based upon the hit film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The result, Skizz, which was illustrated by Jim Baikie, told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a teenager named Roxy, and Moore later noted that in his opinion, this work [...] "owes far too much to Alan Bleasdale." [...] Another series he produced for 2000AD was D.R. and <b>Quinch,</b> which was illustrated by Alan Davis. The story, which Moore described as [...] "continuing the tradition of Dennis the Menace, but giving him a thermonuclear capacity", revolved around two delinquent aliens, and was a science-fiction take on National Lampoons characters O.C. and Stiggs. The work widely considered to be the highlight of his 2000AD career, and that he himself described as [...] "the one that worked best for me" [...] was The Ballad of Halo Jones. Co-created with artist Ian Gibson, the series was set in the 50th century. It finished before all the episodes were written.|$|E

60|$|On the {{occurrence}} of a death in Titbull's, it is invariably agreed among the survivors--and {{it is the only}} subject on which they do agree--that the departed did something 'to bring it on.' Judging by Titbull's, I should say the human race need never die, if they took care. But they don't take care, and they do die, and when they die in Titbull's they are buried at the cost of the Foundation. Some provision has been made for the purpose, in virtue of which (I record this on the strength of having seen the funeral of Mrs. <b>Quinch)</b> a lively neighbouring undertaker dresses up four of the old men, and four of the old women, hustles them into a procession of four couples, and leads off with a large black bow {{at the back of his}} hat, looking over his shoulder at them airily from time to time to see that no member of the party has got lost, or has tumbled down; as if they were a company of dim old dolls.|$|E
5000|$|The pair's last strip, [...] "D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> Go to Hollywood" [...] {{ran from}} issues 363 to 367 and is {{considered}} to be Moore and Davis's finest D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> story. However, at the time, the Moore/Davis partnership was undergoing strain due to Moore refusing permission for their Captain Britain work to be reprinted. The pair's last D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> work together was in the 2000 AD Sci-Fi Special in 1985.|$|E
50|$|D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> {{began in}} 2000 AD as a one-off Time Twister titled “D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> Have Fun On Earth”. The {{characters}} were initially meant to only appear once but they proved {{so popular that}} they were given their own semi-regular series.|$|E
5000|$|D.R. & <b>Quinchs</b> anarchic humour {{was popular}} with its {{original}} audience but Alan Moore has expressed discomfort with how it exploits violence for comic effect, claiming {{that it has}} no “lasting or redeeming social value”. The series has had a strong reputation since it was first published. It stands out as something so obviously different when compared to the rest of Moore’s body of work that it is worthy of attention. It has been called the [...] "absurd, cartoony, delightfully vicious other side of Halo Jones". Writing for Time Douglas Wolk has described it as, for the majority of its run, [...] "one of the funniest comics ever" [...] and Neil Gaiman has credited it with being one of the greatest 2000 AD stories.|$|R

5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are scalloped on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf.

Halo was an everywoman in the far future, born into mass unemployment on a floating housing estate, who escaped the earth and became involved in a terrible galactic war. Three books were published, and more were planned, but Moores demands for creators rights and his increasing commitments to American publishers meant they never materialised.|$|E

Davis and Moore formed a close working partnership as creators; they also created D.R. and <b>Quinch</b> for 2000AD. Later, Davis replaced Garry Leach on Marvelman in Warrior and yet again worked with Moore. He also drew the story [...] "Harry Twenty on the High Rock" [...] in 2000AD.|$|E
