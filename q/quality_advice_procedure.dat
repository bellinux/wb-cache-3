40|$|Objective: To {{examine how}} health advice is {{provided}} in popular magazines and the <b>quality</b> of that <b>advice.</b> Methods: A prospective quantitative analysis of the <b>quality</b> of health <b>advice</b> provided in Australian magazines between July and December 2011 was conducted. A rating instrument was adapted from the Media Doctor Australia rating tool used to assess quality of health news reporting. Criteria included: recommends seeing a doctor; advice based on reliable evidence; advice clear and easily applied; benefits presented meaningfully; potential harms mentioned; evidence of disease mongering; availability and cost of treatments; obvious advertising; vested interest, and anecdotal evidence. Results: 163 health advice articles were rated showing a wide variation in the <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> presented between magazines. Magazines with ‘health’ in the title, rated most poorly with only 36 % (26 / 73) of these articles presenting clear and meaningful advice and 52 % (38 / 73) giving advice based on reliable evidence. Conclusions: Australian magazines, especially those with health in the title, generally presented poor <b>quality,</b> unreliable health <b>advice.</b> Teen magazine Dolly provided the highest <b>quality</b> <b>advice.</b> Implications: Consumers {{need to be aware}} of this when making health choices.

In the case of experts markets, where the expert observes the intervention that a consumer needs to fix his problem and also provides a treatment, price discrimination proceeds along the dimension of <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> offered. High <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> and appropriate treatment is provided to the most profitable market segment only. Less profitable consumers are induced to demand either unnecessary or insufficient procedures. The welfare consequences of price discrimination are ambiguous: On the one hand, price discrimination increases the number of consumers that get an intervention.

40|$|Financial {{decision}} making is complex and individuals either {{need to have the}} financial knowledge to make the correct decisions, or they need to ask for advice from experts. However, there are two key questions pertaining to financial advice. Firstly, do financially unsophisticated individuals know that they need advice, and do they therefore ask for assistance? Secondly, if they do ask for advice, are financially unsophisticated individuals able to assess the <b>quality</b> of the <b>advice</b> received? A growing body of research is focused on determining to what extent financial advice can act as a substitute for low levels of financial literacy. To date, studies have found conflicting results. This study used data from a national survey of South Africans to determine whether advice could substitute for low levels of financial sophistication. Additionally, the <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> in pre-retirement cash-out decisions was assessed using survey data collected at a university. The results indicate that professional financial advice complements financial literacy, while advice from other sources could substitute for low levels of financial sophistication.

In credence goods markets, where consumers do not know which quality of the good or service they need, price discrimination proceeds along the dimension of <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> offered. High <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> and appropriate treatment is provided to the most profitable market segment only. Less profitable consumers are induced to demand a treatment without a serious diagnosis. If consumers differ in the probabilities of needing different treatments some consumers are potentially overtreated. By contrast, under heterogeneity in the valuations of a successful intervention some consumers are potentially undertreated. Our results help to explain the casual observation that in the early phase of the IT industry only low quality equipment was distributed via warehouse sellers while today it is quite common to see high quality equipment at discounters.

40|$|The {{financial}} planning profession in Malaysia is {{in a curious}} regulatory posture. While the financial services industry {{is one of the}} most highly regulated sectors in the country, the {{financial planning}} profession itself lacks a stand-alone regulatory system. Currently, financial planners are not regulated and the financial planning industry itself is straddling between two regulators – the Securities Commission and Bank Negara. This study found that the lack of a social security system in Malaysia to protect the public from social and economic distress has driven home the urgent need and necessity for prudent financial planning and for individuals to arrange their financial affairs to meet their life goals and objectives. Contributions and savings via the Employees Provident Fund and the Socso are simply not enough to insure a comfortable living after one’s retirement or support to dependents arising from the income earner’s premature death or disability. As Malaysians live longer, they need additional resources to finance the extra years of life after retirement. The financial planning industry in Malaysia is said to be about 20 years behind that of the United States where it started. This study found that if the right regulatory framework is nurtured and the profession itself work on developing what are the core competencies that the financial planner should focus on in order to offer <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> to the client, and uphold the high ethical standards expected, then this emerging profession in Malaysia can leapfrog the usual stumbling advances and catch up with the other developed countries.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of continuous {{development of new}} medicines is publicly recognized, but {{the development of new}} medicines requires increasing efforts and costs. Despite regulatory initiatives to enhance marketing authorisation such as the orphan regulation and the scientific <b>advice</b> <b>procedure,</b> current non-approval rates of new medicines are relatively high, varying from 25 - 40 %. In order to further improve the EU marketing authorisation system {{there is a need for}} empirical studies to gain insight in the way benefits and risks are evaluated and approval decisions are made by regulatory authorities. This thesis offers empirical analyses of approval decisions and the scientific <b>advice</b> <b>procedure</b> to facilitate future evidence-based improvement of the regulatory system. First, we assessed to what extent the design of the development plan, the clinical outcomes and clinical {{relevance of}} new active substances in the EU according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use, were associated with non-approval. This study demonstrated that disappointing clinical efficacy and safety outcomes were the major driver for non-approval (odds ratio (OR) 21. 7; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 5. 0 – 94. 0). Non-convincing clinical relevance contributed less to the likelihood of non-approval (OR 4. 6; 95 % CI 1. 1 – 20. 0) than a disappointing clinical outcome. Conversely, positive scores on clinical relevance can help overcome deficiencies with regard to clinical outcome, particularly when good alternative treatment options are lacking for the disease. In addition, we demonstrated the relevance of the underlying development plan (exploratory and confirmatory) for increasing the likelihood that a medicinal product is approved (OR 6. 1; 95 % CI 0. 9 – 42. 7). Relevant exploratory studies of the mode of action, proof of concept and dosing are valuable in reducing the number of failed dossiers and speeding up pharmaceutical innovation. Drug developers are encouraged to increase investments in such studies before moving to large and more costly Phase III trials. We also compared orphan medicinal products (OMPs) and non-OMPs and found differences in regulators´ concerns related to the clinical development plan (study design), related to clinical outcome (safety profile), and related to acknowledged high medical need. But overall these differences did not result in differential weighing of the benefit-risk for marketing approval. Our results encourage future OMP developers to search for opportunities to meet the high standards of clinical drug development e. g. for comparative study designs and validated clinically relevant endpoints. Secondly, we evaluated the role of the scientific <b>advice</b> <b>procedure.</b> An interview study with Dutch small and medium-sized enterprises demonstrated that their aims of scientific advice were to retrieve regulators’ reassurance of their development plan, to gain regulators’ trust and to a lesser extent to fill knowledge gaps where guidelines are lacking or unclear. An overview of scientific advice questions discussed with the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board in the period 2006 – 2008 demonstrated that large companies considered the phase III trial package most relevant to discuss with regulators, whereas small companies more often aimed to discuss early drug development. The relevance of an appropriate development plan for marketing approval implies that scientific advice about exploratory and confirmatory development plans earlier and continuously during drug development could increase approval rate...|$|R
