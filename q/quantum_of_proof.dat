It reasoned that since the relevant Illinois statute did not expressly set forth a <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof,</b> preponderance was the required quantum under an Illinois Supreme Court precedent holding preponderance applicable “absent a statutorily assigned evidentiary standard. ” The Appellate Court distinguished a proceeding to modify a prior custody judgment where the quantum is “clear and convincing evidence” per an explicit statute. It concluded that “a removal petition is not a petition to modify custody” and that defaulting to preponderance should occur whenever the relevant statute is silent on burden of proof. Without an explicit statute, there should not necessarily be a default rule favoring a preponderance norm for removal issues, or for all other legal issues, in civil cases. The Illinois Supreme Court ruling said to establish such a rule itself did not apply a default rule. The high court case involved the State’s petition to terminate the parental rights of a mother and father whose child was then in foster care; the termination process was said to be significantly controlled by U. S. Supreme Court precedent holding that federal constitutional Fourteenth Amendment due process requires “at least clear and convincing evidence” of permanent parental neglect. Per U. S.

Despite an impressive body of work trying to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open. The above-mentioned proof verification statement {{has also been shown}} equivalent to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in the language of multi-prover games is known.

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} advantage available to a prosecutor in a criminal conspiracy case is {{the exception to the}} hearsay rule for co-conspirator declarations. The exception is widely used and is often {{a significant part of the}} government presentation. In essence, it provides that otherwise inadmissible hearsay declarations of coconspirators are admissible at trial against the defendant so long as they were made during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The exception typically arises when an alleged co-conspirator declarant tells the witness (often an undercover police officer) all about the conspiracy, perhaps in the hope of attracting a buyer or a seller of drugs. During the conversation the defendant is identified as a member of the group. The witness then is called to testify at trial about this conversation. Numerous judges and commentators have explored why the exception is so important in a case like this. Basically it is because the declarant is often not available for cross-examination, and the witness is now specifically naming this defendant as having participated in the conspiracy. During the last several years, major changes have taken place which have affected the exception itself, its general application, and proof problems in connection with specific types of conspiracies. While some of these issues have been addressed previously, they have been viewed primarily from the vantage point of persons with expertise in the area of evidence law. Rarely, however, have these problems been analyzed in terms of general criminal law issues such as the <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> required at trial or the procedures to be employed at a conspiracy trial. This article will focus attention on five major aspects of the coconspirator exception shaped considerably by recent events: the structure of the exception, the three elements of the exception, trial procedures utilized in connection with it, confrontation clause challenges to it, and the scope of the conspiracy. Numerous other problems are related to the hearsay exception and indeed can be vital to the trial and appellate practice in conspiracy cases.

40|$|Because the {{law says}} we can do it” was the {{response}} Officer Griffith offered when asked why officers searched Rodney Gant’s car {{when he was arrested}} for driving with a suspended license. Officer Griffith’s honest answer exemplifies the effect of prior Supreme Court decisions on search incident to arrest power in the vehicle context: that a vehicle search incident to arrest is a police entitlement divorced from any rationale whatsoever. Concerns for officer safety and preservation of evidence [...] legal justifications that generally permit warrantless searches incident to arrest generally [...] had been utterly abandoned by the Court in the automobile context. This police entitlement led to invasions of privacy against persons guilty of no more than mere traffic violations, as searches were conducted simply because they were legally permissible. However, the Supreme Court in Arizona v. Gant shifted course and strengthened Fourth Amendment protections by terminating the entitlement that permitted vehicle searches incident to arrest as a matter of right. The tumultuous jurisprudence of the search incident to arrest doctrine under the Fourth Amendment has often produced inconsistent and varied results. In keeping with this tradition, the Supreme Court in Gant revised nearly thirty years of search incident to arrest law in the automobile context. Unlike Gant’s predecessors, Gant generally enhanced Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches by holding that automatic vehicle searches incident to arrest are unconstitutional. On the other hand, Gant’s second holding created a new warrant exception to govern searches of automobiles incident to arrest by allowing officers to search a vehicle, even when the justifications of officer safety and preservation of evidence are nonexistent. The author argues that Gant not only enhances Fourth Amendment protections overall by limiting authority to search an automobile upon arrest, but that its first holding also undermines other cases permitting automatic searches incident to arrest in non-vehicular situations. Gant’s affirmation of two specific rationales that permit a search incident to arrest, officer safety and the preservation of evidence, directly conflicts with non-vehicular cases that allow automatic searches irrespective of these rationales. Since Gant undermines such cases by reconnecting the search incident to arrest exception with its justifications, applying Gant to cases that permit automatic searches of containers on the person, and certain automatic home searches incident to arrest, serves to enhance privacy protections against these non-vehicular searches that have become police entitlements. Part I outlines the judicial origin of search incident to arrest law and its schizophrenic history, exposes the fundamental conflict between the cases, and discuss the legal rules and reasoning of Gant. Part II argues that the standard governing Gant’s second holding is vague, and is concerned with whether the crime of arrest involves tangible evidence rather than a <b>quantum</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> analysis prevalent in standards such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion. Part III analyzes the effect of applying Gant’s first holding to an automatic search of containers on the person incident to arrest, while Part IV applies Gant to certain automatic home searches incident to arrest. Part IV also addresses some Counterarguments and potential pitfalls. This Comment concludes that Gant’s retraction of the search incident to arrest power may serve to end, or at the least severely undermine, automatic searches of containers on the person and homes incident to arrest...|$|E

As a direct byproduct, we also provide a NC algorithm to compute the diamond norm of a class <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> channels. Furthermore, we provide a generalized form of equilibrium value problems that can be solved {{in the same way as}} well as comparisons to semidefinite programs.

40|$|Horn's problem {{asks for}} the {{conditions}} on sets of integers mu, nu and lambda that ensure {{the existence of}} Hermitian operators A, B and A+B with spectra mu, nu and lambda, respectively.

In this paper we present a <b>quantum</b> information-theoretic <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> the relation between the two problems that is asymptotic in one direction. This result has previously been obtained by Klyachko using geometric invariant theory. The work presented in this paper does not, however, touch upon the non-asymptotic equivalence between the two problems, a result that rests on the recently proven saturation conjecture for GL(d).

As a follow-up to the authors' early journal publication [J. Comput. System Sci., vol. 75, pp. 255 - 269, 2009], we further investigate the <b>quantum</b> nature <b>of</b> interactions between provers and verifiers by studying how various restrictions on quantum interactive proof systems affect the language recognition power <b>of</b> the <b>proof</b> systems. In particular, we examine three intriguing restrictions that (i) provers always behave in a classical fashion, (ii) verifiers always reveal to provers the information on next moves, and (iii) the number of interactions between provers and verifiers is bounded.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} three variants <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> interactive <b>proof</b> {{systems in}} which short (meaning logarithmic-length) messages are exchanged between the prover and verifier. The first variant {{is one in}} which the verifier sends a short message to the prover, and the prover responds with an ordinary, or polynomial-length, message; the second variant {{is one in which}} any number of messages can be exchanged, but where the combined length of all the messages is logarithmic; and the third variant is one in which the verifier sends polynomially many random bits to the prover, who responds with a short quantum message. We prove that in all of these cases the short messages can be eliminated without changing the power of the model, so the first variant has the expressive power of QMA and the second and third variants have the expressive power of BQP. These facts are proved through the use <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> state tomography, along with the finite quantum de Finetti theorem for the first variant...|$|R

40|$|For {{nearly three}} decades, the model <b>of</b> {{interactive}} <b>proof</b> systems and its variants have {{been central to}} many important and exciting developments in computational complexity theory such as exact characterization of some well known complexity classes, development <b>of</b> probabilistically checkable <b>proof</b> systems and theory of hardness of approximation, and formalization of fundamental cryptographic primitives. On the other hand, the theory <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> information, which is primarily concerned with harnessing quantum mechanical features for algorithmic, cryptographic, and information processing tasks has found many applications. In the past three decades, quantum information {{has been used to}} develop unconditionally secure quantum cryptography protocols, efficient quantum algorithms for certain problems that are believed to be intractable in classical world, and communication efficient protocols. In this thesis, we study the impact <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> information on the models <b>of</b> interactive <b>proof</b> systems and their multi-prover variants. We study various quantum models and explore two questions. The first question we address pertains to the expressive power of such models with or without resource constraints. The second question is related to error reduction technique <b>of</b> such <b>proof</b> systems via parallel repetition. The question related to the expressive power <b>of</b> models <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> interactive <b>proof</b> systems and their variants lead us to the following results. (1) We show that the expressive power <b>of</b> <b>quantum</b> interactive <b>proof</b> systems is exactly PSPACE, the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-space deterministic Turing machines and that also admit a classical interactive proof systems. This result shows that in terms of complexity-theoretic characterization, both the models are equivalent. The result is obtained using an algorithmic technique known as the matrix multiplicative weights update method to solve a semidefinite program that characterizes the success probability <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> prover. 	 (2) We show that polynomially many logarithmic-size unentangled quantum proofs are no more powerful than a classical proof if the verifier has the ability to process quantum information. This result follows from an observation that logarithmic-size quantum states can be efficiently represented classically and such classical representation can be used to efficiently generate the quantum state. 	 (3) We also establish that the model <b>of</b> multi-prover <b>quantum</b> Merlin Arthur proof system, where the verifier is only allowed to apply nonadaptive unentangled measurement on each proof and then a quantum circuit on the classical outcomes, is no more powerful than QMA under the restriction that there are only polynomial number <b>of</b> outcomes per <b>proof.</b> This result follows from showing that such proof systems also admit a QMA verification procedure. The question related to error reduction via parallel repetition lead us to following results on a class of two-prover one-round games with quantum provers and a class <b>of</b> multi-prover QMA <b>proof</b> systems. (1) We establish that for a certain class of two-prover one-round games known as XOR games, admit a perfect parallel repetition theorem in the following sense. When the provers play a collection of XOR games, an optimal strategy of the provers is to play each instance of the collection independently and optimally. In particular, the success probability <b>of</b> the <b>quantum</b> provers in the n-fold repetition of an XOR game G with quantum value w(G) is exactly (w(G)) ^n. 	 (2) We show a parallel repetition theorem for two-prover one-round unique games. More specifically, we prove that if the <b>quantum</b> value <b>of</b> a unique game is 1 -e, then the <b>quantum</b> value <b>of</b> n-fold repetition of the game is at most (1 -e^ 2 / 49) ^n. We also establish that for certain class of unique games, the <b>quantum</b> value <b>of</b> the n-fold repetition of the game is at most (1 -e/ 4) ^n. For the special case of XOR games, our proof technique gives an alternate <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> result mentioned above. 	 3. Our final result on parallel repetition is concerned with SepQMA(m) proof systems, where the verifier receives m unentangled quantum proofs and the measurement operator corresponding to outcome "accept" is a fully separable operator. We give an alternate <b>proof</b> <b>of</b> a result of Harrow and Montanaro [HM 10] that states that perfect parallel repetition theorem holds for such proof systems. The first two results follow from the duality of semidefinite programs and the final result follows from cone programming duality...|$|R
