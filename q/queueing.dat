5|$|An {{advantage}} held by Eurostar is {{the convenience}} {{and speed of}} the service: with shorter check-in times than at most airports and hence quicker boarding and less <b>queueing</b> and high punctuality, it takes less time to travel between central London and central Paris by high-speed rail than it does by air. Eurostar now has a dominant share of the combined rail–air market on its routes to Paris and Brussels. In 2004, it had a 66% share of the London–Paris market, and a 59% share of the London–Brussels market. In 2007, it achieved record market shares of 71% for London–Paris and 65% for London–Brussels routes.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th century, Piccadilly {{became known}} {{as a place to}} acquire heroin. Jazz trumpeter Dizzy Reece {{recalled}} people queuing outside Piccadilly's branch of Boots for heroin pills in the late 1940s. By the 1960s, the street and surrounding area were notorious as the centre of London's illegal drug trade, where heroin and cocaine could be purchased on the black market from unscrupulous chemists. By 1982, up to 20 people could be seen <b>queueing</b> at a chemist dealing in illegal drugs in nearby Shaftesbury Avenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson {{process can}} be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the real line, and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in <b>queueing</b> theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{new show}} {{transformed}} Iron Dragon midway {{into a new}} area called Celebration Plaza. The area features curved edges. A new entrance and <b>queueing</b> area was built for Iron Dragon because the new stage occupies the old queue and entrance area. The control booths used for American Portrait were relocated {{to the side of}} the midway. On May 2, 2012 it was announced that WildCat would be removed before opening day to expand Celebration Plaza and bleachers were added in its spot. A new concession area with patio seating was built on the left side of the control booth. During the show, a portion of the patio is blocked off as a V.I.P. seating area known as the Pepsi Fan Zone. In addition, a beer garden was added behind the control booth, to the left of the bleachers.|$|E

50|$|Shared <b>Queues</b> (z/OS only):In a Shared <b>Queue</b> environment, an {{application}} can connect {{to any of}} the <b>queue</b> managers within the queue-sharing group.

This gives greater availability if a <b>queue</b> manager stops because all the other <b>queue</b> managers in the queue-sharing group can continue processing the <b>queue.</b>|$|R

People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely {{they will be able to}} attend the service.
