500|$|The {{producers}} {{aimed to}} send a message of early detection to the series' young audience, and had Steph initially ignore her symptoms. Stenson hoped to raise awareness of cervical cancer, and educate women about the importance of regular smear tests. She stated that Steph was confident about beating her illness, as [...] "the alternative sn't worth thinking about." [...] The character was originally reluctant to tell her family about the cancer for fear of hurting them, and was embarrassed to tell her love interest Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan), not wanting him to have to look after her. As the storyline developed, Steph cancelled her wedding to Gilly due to his refusal to accept that her condition was terminal.

500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{were two}} of the first three games Ubisoft {{released}} for the My Coach series; the other game was My Word Coach. During the course of their development by Sensory Sweep Studios, the lessons and minigames were created with the help of French and Spanish language teachers. Ubisoft announced {{the creation of a new}} division to create the My Coach series on May 21, 2007, and that Pauline Jacquey, the producer of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Rayman series, would lead the division. When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series, Jacquey said that she was [...] "developing projects that make people feel that playing games is worth their while, allowing them to spend <b>quality</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> family and friends, learn a new skill, or improve their daily lives". Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that, “The timing is right for us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn, grow and feel better in an entertaining way". All three games were released on November 6, 2007 in North America. Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach, releasing it in North America on October 7, 2008; Wii versions of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30, 2007. The European releases for My French Coach, titled My French Coach Level 1: Beginners, and My Spanish Coach, renamed My Spanish Coach Level 1: Beginners, were accompanied by My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, the next games in the series.|$|E

Stenson spoke of Steph's reasoning stating: [...] "With Gilly, she's embarrassed and doesn't want him to look after her." [...] Speaking of the storyline Quinlan stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "I think Gilly's really gutted that he didn't get together with Steph sooner - he wasted so much time with Cheryl and Jem, when really {{he was in love}} with her." [...] At one point Steph cancels her wedding to Gilly because he cannot accept she is dying, of this Quinlan states: [...] "His denial is not helping her. She's tying to take this in her stride and wants to spend <b>quality</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> the people she loves before she goes. She tells him he has to accept she's going to die or the wedding is off. and she hands back her engagement ring." [...] Quinlan has also stated he was eager for the pair to marry because of the [...] "tear jerking" [...] scenes it would create. Steph is killed off during a special week of episodes dubbed [...] "fire week". The cast filmed many stunts themselves, and Quinlan filmed scenes in front of a burning set, and he stated he [...] "was very manly about it" [...] whilst filming a ladder rescue scene. Gilly's immediate grief resulted in the characters name trending on Twitter, of this Quinlan stated: [...] "So glad that the ep had the impact that was desired! Buzzing Gilly is trended again!" [...] Gilly's grief is made worse because of Steph making the decision to die prematurely. Conversing this Quinlan said: [...] "He's grieving - he just can't understand why she took her life like that." [...] He added that Gilly's grief turns to anger because he cannot get the answers to his questions. Quinlan opined that he wanted Gilly to take a different root stating: [...] "I'd like to see Gilly go down a bit of a different route because he’s been a bit of a push-over in the past. I'd like to see his character progress a bit more and I'd like to see a side of him that we haven't seen before." [...] Gilly's grief then continued to get worse with Quinlan adding: [...] "The poor guy's heading off on a very dark journey that I'm sure he'll live to regret." [...] As Gilly is still so angry, at Steph's funeral, the director of the episode asked Quinlan not to cry at all during the ceremony. Quinlan added [...] "It was all so heartfelt, though, that I broke down for real a few times - and I think that's going to come across in the final episode." ...|$|E

One factor in Maurice's recovery was the active intervention of his brothers, who had recently lost their youngest brother Andy.

He loves electricity and attends the Electrical Convention every year. Avatar is the coach of Sunny's basketball team, but he was temporarily replaced by his wife. It is also mentioned in [...] "Winter Vacation (Part 1)" [...] that Avatar and Himani are not religiously married because they were scammed by a person who impersonated a Pandit; they have a religious marriage with all four children present. His childhood dream was to be a professional boxer, which he showed in his company's commercial. Avatar gets made fun of a lot throughout the series because of his weight, usually by Sunny. He is often shown as unintelligent and breeds much resentment among his kids by being very [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "tight" [...] with his money. He wants his family to know him as a [...] "fix-it" [...] man, though his projects never seem to work out. He is slightly afraid of Himani, but he calls it a [...] "strong respect". He has two positions of authority {{when it comes to the}} children: going on outings and barbecuing. He can be lazy but is determined to spend <b>quality</b> <b>time</b> <b>with</b> his wife and children. He has issues with his mother-in-law.

In multiple episodes Avatar brags about having his own band in high school, [...] "Avatar Beats", which made a grand total of one record (an LP, no copies). He can still play bass guitar and occasionally sits in with Rohan and Popi. Late in the third season, Avatar began exercising and becomes more fit. After Himani and the kids staged an intervention to stop his more-revealing wardrobe choices, he admits the catalyst for his getting back in shape was someone in the park mistaking him for Bobby's grandfather.
