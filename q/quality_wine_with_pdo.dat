50|$|Sauvignon vert is a late budding vine {{with high}} {{sensitivity}} to downy mildew and oidium. The vine {{is prone to}} producing high yields which must be controlled {{in order to make}} premium <b>quality</b> <b>wine.</b> <b>With</b> Sauvignon vert, the <b>quality</b> of the <b>wine</b> depends greatly on the grapes being harvested at the right point. If picked too early the resulting wine will be dull and lack any varietal character. The grape also has the potential for very high levels of alcohol with 14.5% ABV not being uncommon. The wine made from Sauvignon vert varies depending on the area in which it is produced. In the Friuli region, Friuilano and in Goriška Brda region, Jakot wine is typically full bodied with moderate acidity, floral aromas and delicate fruit flavors. In Chile, Sauvignon vert typically starts with aromas of green apples in its youth that fade as it ages and is more medium bodied.|$|R
30|$|In {{this study}} we present an {{alternative}} microbiological strategy to reduce the ethanol content in wine, through a genetic modification of the S. cerevisiae Pdc 2 p transcription factor. Our results demonstrate that the insertion of the pdc 2 Δ 519 d mutation in a wine yeast strain can reduce the ethanol concentration up to 1.89 % v/v without affecting the fermentation performance. In contrast to non-GMO based strategies, our approach permits the insertion of the selected mutation in any locally selected wine strain, making possible to produce <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> <b>with</b> regional characteristics and lower alcohol content. This makes our work a valuable contribution {{to the problem of}} high ethanol concentration in wine. Nevertheless, pilot-scale trials complemented with sensorial analysis of the produced wines are required for a full evaluation of our strain’s potential for its application in the wine industry.|$|R
40|$|Wine {{consumers}} in 21 century are very demanding {{in terms of}} the quality, price, delivery reliability and the total set of services they receive from the companies participating in wine industry. On the other hand, these companies are faced with increasing pressures imposed by global hyper competition to deliver <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> <b>with</b> the right price, at the right time, at the right place and for the right costumers. In these market conditions, local markets are becoming too narrow and internationalization of operations becomes a necessity. This is especially true for Macedonian wine producers, whose domestic market is one of the smallest in Europe. Good supply chain management optimizes business processes, enables coordination of operations from the process of design until the final sale of wines and improves the competitive position of wineries in the domestic and international market...|$|R
50|$|Wine in this region, {{like the}} {{majority}} of Central Otago, focuses primarily on Pinot noir, suited to the dry climate and soils. The climate of Bannockburn epitomizes that of the Central Otago wine region and claims {{some of the highest}} temperatures and lowest rainfall in the area. The area is limited by geographical constraints to relatively small outputs, and most of the vineyards boast a boutique high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> <b>with</b> typically small volumes of grapes. The nearby location of the bustling tourist city of Queenstown is considered {{to be one of the}} possible reasons for the region's ability to have rapidly gain recognition for the <b>quality</b> of the <b>wine</b> produced. Several internationally renowned vineyards exist within a small radius producing wine that is distributed often to an international base.

25|$|The Barbera vine is very {{vigorous}} {{and capable of}} producing high yields if not kept in check by pruning and other methods. Excessive yields can diminish the fruit quality in the grape and accentuate Barbera's natural acidity and sharpness. In Piedmont, the vine was prized for its yields and ability to ripen two weeks earlier than Nebbiolo even on vineyard sites with less than ideal exposure. This allowed the Piedmontese winemakers in regions like Alba to give their best sites over to the more difficult to cultivate Nebbiolo and still produce <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> <b>with</b> Barbera that could be consumed earlier while the Nebbiolo ages. Harvest for Barbera usually takes place in late September-early October, usually two weeks after Dolcetto has been picked. In recent times, winemakers have been experimenting with harvesting Barbera later at higher sugar levels to produce heavier, more fruit forward wines. In some vintages, these producers may even harvest their Barbera after Nebbiolo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Carissa spinarum L., is a {{tropical}} underutilized fruit abundantly available during summer season, which is delicious {{to taste with}} an astringency flavor and fruity aroma. Hence, the present investigation was aimed at optimizing fermentation conditions {{for the production of}} wine and to assess its physiochemical composition and antioxidant activity. Response surface methodology coupled with central composite design was employed for the optimization studies. It was determined that fermentation temperature of 25 °C, pH of 3. 5 and inoculum size of 10 % (v/v) resulted in <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> <b>with</b> 8. 3 % (v/v) of ethanol content. Further, physicochemical composition and antioxidant activity of the optimized wine was found to be significantly higher or on par with other tropical fruit wines reported previously. Sensory analysis indicated that wine was good in terms of overall acceptability. Thus, availability of C. spinarum fruits during their glut season can be utilized for winemaking and could generate revenue among rural households further adding significant input to the economy of fruit wine market...|$|R

40|$|Wine {{marketers}} and restaurateurs have {{a vested}} interest in helping novice wine drinkers to learn more about <b>wine,</b> <b>with</b> the goal of encouraging them to purchase more <b>wine</b> and higher <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> (<b>with</b> its higher price tag). The question posed here is how best to conduct that educational effort, using a perceptual approach or a conceptual approach. Most wine promotions tend to be perceptual, in the form of tastings and printed tasting notes. However, the two experiments described in this article demonstrate the greater benefit of conceptual learning, which involves explaining how the wine is produced generally and discussions of wine varietals in particular. In the first experiment, three groups of participants (novices, intermediates, and experts) were served a sample of zinfandel and then asked to identify that exact wine from a group of five, four of which had been adulterated with sweetener. Some participants were allowed to write down a description of the wine, and all were subjected to a fictitious advertising campaign designed to sway their choice on the matching test.

Different irrigation management strategies have been used to improve <b>wine</b> <b>quality,</b> such as water stress and deficit irrigations, but the presence of a water table has not been considered in extant literature. This study analyzes the effects of the irrigation regime on grape yield and <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> when a shallow water table is located between 1. 5 to 2. 2 m depth during the irrigation season. Five applied water treatments: 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 75 %, and 100 % of estimated vineyard evapotranspiration (ETc) were applied in an own-rooted ‘Carménère’ vineyard located in the Peumo Valley (Chile) during three consecutive seasons (2004 - 2005 to 2006 - 2007). Applying 1400 to 9400 m 3 ha- 1 per season (100 % ETc) had no substantial effect on the measured quality parameters, although grape production in the treatment without irrigation (0 % ETc) was significantly reduced. Applying water at 20 % to 40 % ETc produced high yield (13 to 16 t ha- 1), double the historical mean production, and high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> <b>with</b> the presence of a water table close {{to the bottom of the}} root zone...|$|R

50|$|Frascati is an Italian {{white wine}} {{named after the}} town of Frascati, located 25 km {{southeast}} of Rome, in Lazio, Italy. Archeological discoveries from the ancient town of Tusculum, now Frascati, demonstrate the cultivation of grapes for wine since the 5th century B.C. It {{was one of the}} preferred wines of Ancient Rome, Renaissance Popes, poets and artists visiting in the Grand Tour 1700s and 1800s, and of the La Dolce Vita generation in the 1960s. Made from Malvasia di Candia, Malvasia del Lazio, Grechetto, Bombino bianco, and Trebbiano grapes, Frascati has gained Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and DOCG status in 2011, making it one of Italy's first DOC wines. The Frascati DOC/DOCG area is located {{in the heart of the}} Castelli Romani, Tuscolum and Albani Hills south of Rome, and north of Lake Albano. The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude. The soils are well drained and volcanic. The DOC allows for a minimum of 70% Malvasia (Bianca di Candia) and/or Trebbiano (Toscano), a 30% maximum of Greco and/or Malvasia (del Lazio) and a maximum of 10% other white grapes. Many of the vineyards' cellars have ancient Roman caves.

30|$|We propose an {{alternative}} GMO based strategy to obtain Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant strains {{with a slight}} reduction {{in their ability to}} produce ethanol, but with a moderate impact on the yeast metabolism. Through homologous recombination, two truncated Pdc 2 p proteins Pdc 2 pΔ 344 and Pdc 2 pΔ 519 were obtained and transformed into haploid and diploid lab yeast strains. In the pdc 2 Δ 344 mutants the DNA-binding and transactivation site of the protein remain intact, whereas in pdc 2 Δ 519 only the DNA-binding site is conserved. Compared to the control, the diploid BY 4743 pdc 2 Δ 519 mutant strain reduced up to 7.4 % the total ethanol content in lab scale-vinifications. The residual sugar and volatile acidity was not significantly affected by this ethanol reduction. Remarkably, we got a much higher ethanol reduction of 10 and 15 % when the pdc 2 Δ 519 mutation was tested in a native and a commercial wine yeast strain against their respective controls. Our results demonstrate that the insertion of the pdc 2 Δ 519 mutation in wine yeast strains can reduce the ethanol concentration up to 1.89 % (v/v) without affecting the fermentation performance. In contrast to non-GMO based strategies, our approach permits the insertion of the pdc 2 Δ 519 mutation in any locally selected wine strain, making possible to produce <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> <b>with</b> regional characteristics and lower alcohol content. Thus, we consider our work a valuable contribution to the problem of high ethanol concentration in wine.|$|R
