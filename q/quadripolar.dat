The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1 {{instead of}} the normal 1:4 or 1:6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei (syncytia). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucleoli may be of astounding size. More important, mitoses are often numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multiple spindles may be seen and sometimes appear as tripolar or <b>quadripolar</b> forms. Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i.e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as gland formation or stratified squamous architecture. Anaplasia is the most extreme disturbance in cell growth encountered in the spectrum of cellular proliferations.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the benefit}} of cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) in patients with heart failure and conduction delay, {{a considerable number of}} patients do not respond substantially. Left ventricular lead position {{is an important factor in}} response, restricted by the patient's specific anatomy and local pathophysiology. <b>Quadripolar</b> leads could enhance response to CRT, offering 4 pacing locations along the distal end of the lead. Several <b>quadripolar</b> leads are available, all with different shapes and electrode spacing. Electrodes can be positioned in an ideal pacing location, determined by delayed mechanical or electrical activation, and away from phrenic nerve stimulation, high pacing thresholds, and fibrosis. Implantation is safe, with comparable or even lower complication rates compared with standard bipolar leads. Studies on biventricular pacing with <b>quadripolar</b> leads show apparent variations in acute hemodynamic response between pacing configurations, implying a patient-specific response. Pacing with an optimal pacing vector of a <b>quadripolar</b> lead benefits acute hemodynamic response.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) using <b>quadripolar</b> {{left ventricular}} (LV) leads provides more pacing vectors compared to bipolar leads. This may avoid phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) and allow optimal lead placement to maximize biventricular pacing. However, a long-term improvement in patient outcome {{has yet to}} be demonstrated. METHODS: A total of 721 consecutive patients with conventional CRTD criteria implanted with <b>quadripolar</b> (n = 357) or bipolar (n = 364) LV leads were enrolled into a registry at 3 UK centers. Lead performance and mortality was analyzed over a 5 -year period. RESULTS: Patients receiving a <b>quadripolar</b> lead were of similar age and sex to those receiving a bipolar lead, although a lower proportion had ischemic heart disease (62. 6 % vs. 54. 1 %, P = 0. 02). Both groups had similar rates of procedural success, although lead threshold, impedance, and procedural radiation dose were significantly lower in those receiving a <b>quadripolar</b> lead. PNS was more common in those with <b>quadripolar</b> leads (16. 0 % vs. 11. 6 %, P = 0. 08), but was eliminated by switching pacing vector in all cases compared with 60 % in the bipolar group (P < 0. 001). Furthermore, LV lead displacement (1. 7 % vs. 4. 6 %, P = 0. 03) and repositioning (2. 0 % vs. 5. 2 %, P = 0. 03) occurred significantly less often in those with a <b>quadripolar</b> lead. All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the <b>quadripolar</b> compared to bipolar lead group in univariate and multivariate analysis (13. 2 % vs. 22. 5 %, P < 0. 001).

Background Bipolar LV leads cannot be implanted at the optimal site in up to 10 % of patients who need CRT, because of anatomic or technical challenges (pacing threshold, phrenic stimulation, or mechanical instability). Methods The MORE-CRT (More Options Available With a <b>Quadripolar</b> LV Lead Provide In-Clinic Solutions to CRT Challenges) trial enrolled 1, 078 patients. Patients with indications for CRT defibrillator therapy were randomized into 2 groups in a 1 : 2 ratio: a group with a bipolar CRT lead system (the BiP group; any manufacturer) and a group with a <b>quadripolar</b> CRT system (the Quad group; Quartet LV lead). The primary endpoint was freedom from a composite endpoint of intraoperative and post-operative LV lead-related events at 6 months. Results A total of 1, 074 of 1, 078 patients (99 %) were randomized and contributed to the primary endpoint. Freedom from the composite endpoint was significantly greater in the Quad than the BiP group (83. 0 % vs. 74. 4 %, p = 0. 0002). The intraoperative component of the endpoint was met less frequently by Quad group patients (6. 26 % Quad vs. 12. 1 % BiP), whereas there was no difference for the post-operative component (7. 1 % Quad vs. 7. 6 % BiP). Conclusions The Quartet LV system significantly reduced total LV lead-related events at 6 months after implantation compared with a bipolar CRT system.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Quadripolar</b> left {{ventricular}} (LV) leads allow for several pacing configurations in candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Whether different pacing configurations may affect LV dyssynchrony and systolic function {{is not completely}} known. We aimed to evaluate the acute effects of different pacing vectors on LV electromechanical parameters in patients implanted with a <b>quadripolar</b> LV lead. Methods: In this two-centre study, within 1 month of implantation 21 CRT patients (65 ± 8 years, 76 % men, 38 % ischemic) receiving a <b>quadripolar</b> LV lead (Quartet 1458 Q, St Jude Medical) underwent LV capture threshold assessment, intracardiac electrogram optimization, and two-dimensional echocardiography during four pacing configurations: D 1 -P 4, P 4 -RV coil, D 1 -RV coil, and P 4 -M 2. LV dyssynchrony and contractile function were expressed by septal-to-lateral delay and global longitudinal strain (GLS). Results: LV capture threshold varied between the configurations (P < 0. 001), showing higher values in the configurations P 4 -RV coil and P 4 -M 2. Septal-to-lateral delay decreased in the configurations D 1 -P 4 and D 1 -RV coil (P = 0. 003 and P = 0. 033 vs. spontaneous rhythm, respectively). GLS improved significantly vs. spontaneous rhythm only in the configuration D 1 -P 4 (from - 8. 6 ± 3. 5 to - 11. 0 ± 3. 2 %, P = 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Phrenic nerve {{stimulation}} (PNS) and high pacing thresholds (HPT) hinder biventricular stimulation in patients (pts) undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). A new <b>quadripolar</b> left ventricular (LV) lead (Quartet 1458 Q, St. Jude Medical) with {{increased number of}} pacing configuration, might overcome this problem. Methods: All consecutive pts in whom a standard bipolar lead intraoperatively resulted in PNS and/or HPT (≥ 4. 00  V/ 1  mV), received, during the same implant, a <b>quadripolar</b> LV lead. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate acute and short term outcome. Results: 26 pts [24 (92 %) male, mean age 74 ± 6  years) ] with PNS (22 pts; 85 %) and HPT (4 pts; 15 %) were included. Permanent right ventricular pacing was the reason for broad QRS complex in 4 (15 %) pts, whereas all other pts had a left bundle branch block. Severely symptomatic (NYHA Class ≥ 3) heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF 31 ± 9 %) was mostly caused by ischemic heart disease (14 pts; 54 %). Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular heart disease were diagnosed in 6 (23 %) pts each. In most (24 / 26, 92 %) pts the use of the Quartet lead led to successful biventricular pacing due to a significant reduction in intraoperative pacing threshold (5. 2  V/ 1. 0  ms vs. 1. 4  V/ 0. 8  ms; p= 0. 03), which was maintained (1. 2  V/ 0. 7  ms) at follow-up.

40|$|In this paper, {{common mode}} (CM) {{conducted}} perturbations are predicted and compared with experiments in a variable-speed drive system, {{thanks to a}} mixed approach based on experimental measurements and on the modeling of the complete CM circuit. Its different parts are considered and represented by a chain of <b>quadripolar</b> matrices: the inverter, the cables, and the induction motor. At last, it is shown that the parasitic currents in the system can be calculated in the different stages of the matrix chain. Experiments have successfully confirmed this approach...|$|E
