40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a model for}} the joint dynamics of asset prices which can capture both a stochastic correlation between stock returns as well as between stock returns and volatilities (stochastic leverage). By relying on two factors for stochastic volatility, the model allows for stochastic leverage and is thus able to explain time-varying slopes of the smiles. The use of Wishart processes for the covariance matrix of returns enables the model to also capture stochastic correlations between the assets. Our model offers an integrated pricing approach for both <b>Quanto</b> and plain-vanilla <b>options</b> on the stock as well as the foreign exchange rate. We derive semi-closed form solutions for option prices and analyze the impact of state variables. <b>Quanto</b> <b>options</b> offer a significant exposure to the stochastic covariance between stock prices and exchange rates.

The explicit consideration of the returns on exchange rates introduces non-linearities in the model, both in the objective function (return maximization) and in the triangulation requirement of the foreign exchange rates. The uncertainty associated with both types of returns is incorporated directly in the model by the use of robust optimization techniques. We show that, by using appropriate assumptions regarding the formulation of the uncertainty sets, the proposed model has a semidefinite programming formulation and can be solved efficiently. While robust optimization provides a guaranteed minimum return inside the uncertainty set considered, we also discuss an extension of our formulation with additional guarantees through trading in <b>quanto</b> <b>options</b> for the foreign assets and in equity options for the domestic assets. robust optimization, international portfolio optimization, <b>quanto</b> <b>options,</b> semidefinite programming...|$|R

40|$|Weather {{derivatives}} {{have become}} very popular tools in weather risk management in recent years. One of the elements supporting their diffusion has been the increase in volatility observed on many energy markets. Among the several available contracts, <b>Quanto</b> <b>options</b> are now becoming very popular for a simple reason: they {{take into account the}} strong correlation between energy consumption and certain weather conditions, so enabling price and weather risk to be controlled at the same time. These products are more efficient and, in many cases, significantly cheaper than simpler plain vanilla options. Unfortunately, the specific features of energy and weather time series do not enable the use of analytical formulae based on the Black- Scholes pricing approach, nor other more advanced continuous time methods that extend the Black- Scholes approach, unless under strong and unrealistic assumptions. In this study, we propose a Monte Carlo pricing framework based on a bivariate time series model. Our approach takes into account the average and variance interdependence between temperature and energy price series. Furthermore, our approach includes other relevant empirical features, such as periodic patterns in average, variance, and correlations.

30|$|In recent years, {{the study}} of finite {{difference}} methods for solving the dual currency option pricing model has {{made a lot of}} progress. An implicit scheme for the multi-asset option pricing model had been made by Gilli et al. (2002), but a calculation of this scheme was relatively complex; one needed to solve algebra equations which contained a large tridiagonal block matrix [4]. Khaliq et al. (2008) had given a kind of difference method for solving the 2 D B-S equation [5]; the method needs to use the penalty function approach. So the method was difficult on using parallel computing on a computer. Yang and Zhou (2011) had put forward a rapid AOS difference method of <b>quanto</b> <b>option</b> pricing model [6], but the calculation accuracy of the method is not ideal, because the error of its mixed derivative term is not ideal. In addition, most of those schemes had applied serial calculation. When the computing grid points or dimension of equation required is large, a higher order algebraic equation Ax=b should be solved. The efficiency of the calculation process is not ideal, {{and it is difficult to}} meet the requirements of the options as regards time.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} make full use of the {{computer}} advantages of multi-core processors, a parallel algorithm and a parallel program design have become a necessary means to improve the computing efficiency [9]. The implicit scheme generally has good stability, but it is unfavorable for parallel computing. Inspired by the grouping explicit method [10], Zhang et al. put forward the thought that using the Saul’yev asymmetric scheme to construct a segment implicit scheme, and one properly used the alternating technology to establish a variety of explicit-implicit and pure implicit alternating parallel schemes (such as an alternating segment explicit-implicit (ASE-I) scheme, an alternating segment Crank-Nicolson (ASC-N) scheme), then one got some numerical results which contained stability and parallelism [11]. Yang et al. constructed {{a new kind of}} parallel difference scheme-the alternating band Crank-Nicolson (ABdC-N) scheme for solving the <b>quanto</b> <b>option</b> pricing model and proved that it is close to second-order accuracy and unconditionally stable [12]. Yuan et al. had put forward a parallel difference scheme with second-order accuracy and unconditional stability for a nonlinear parabolic equation [13]. Wang also gave a kind of alternating segment difference scheme with intrinsic parallelism for the KdV equation and proved that the scheme is linearly absolute stable [14]. Zhang showed the alternating segment explicit-implicit parallel difference scheme for a class of nonlinear evolution equations and got the result that the method has unconditional stability and parallelism [15].|$|E

This thesis is divided into three parts and contains a wide range of topics related to the impact of financial correlation, its modellings and applications in finance. The first part is devoted to briefly introduce basic notions of counterparty credit risk (CCR), credit value adjustment (CVA) and to study default dependence between counterparties in a credit default swap (CDS) contract. To compute the highly accurate bilateral CVA (BVA) on CDS, we employ tailored numerical methods to obtain the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the integrated Cox- Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process, which is demanded to to compute the survival probabilities of the counterparties. Furthermore, we develop a new formula which allows simultaneous defaults among counterparties, the simultaneous default risk can thus be regarded. From the first part we get motivated to work on the dynamical (time-dependent) and stochastic correlation model in the next two parts. In the second part, we provide an appropriate and reasonable time-dependent correlation function and present the concept of dynamically (time-dependent) correlated Brownian motions (BMs) and its construction. As example, we apply this new time-dependent correlation function to price European <b>options</b> and <b>Quanto</b> <b>options.</b> We analyze the improvement by using a time-dependent correlation instead of a constant correlation. As randomness features more generally, like moving from time-dependent interest rate to stochastic interest rate, from time-dependent volatility to stochastic volatility, in the last part we investigate how to model correlation as a stochastic process and its applications in finance. We provide a general stochastic correlation model and discuss several stochastic correlation processes. We apply stochastic correlation to price <b>Quanto</b> <b>options</b> and quantify the correlation risk caused by using a wrong (constant) correlation.
