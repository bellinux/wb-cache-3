30|$|Spilite, {{keratophyre}} and <b>quartz-keratophyre</b> {{are often}} {{incorporated into the}} eruptive succession of submarine volcanoes and form spilite−keratophyre construction which is commonly regarded as a marine volcanic succession and is commonly developed in the orogenic belt as well as around the modern mid-ocean ridge, accompanied with pillow lava and marine sedimentary rocks (Yang 2000). At present, there still exists a controversy regarding the origin of spilite−keratophyre. One possible origin is magmatic crystallization and the opposite one is the epigenetic alteration. Therefore, the spilite−keratophyre construction is only suited for auxiliary reference when it is used for environment identification.|$|E
40|$|The Shuangqiaoshan Group is an {{important}} stratigraphic unit in the Jiangnan orogen, however, prior to this study its age was unclear. Zircon from the intruding gabbros, interleaved <b>quartz-keratophyres</b> and tuffs yielded ages of 801 ± 4  Ma, 878 ± 5  Ma and 879 ± 6  Ma, respectively. The ages of the <b>quartz-keratophyres</b> and tuffs suggest that the depositional age for the Shuangqiaoshan Group is ca. 880  Ma, rather than Mesoproterozoic as previously suggested. This Shuangqiaoshan Group, and temporally equivalent folded sedimentary sequences along the Jiangnan orogen, may have possibly formed within a back-arc foreland basin setting. The ca. 800  Ma gabbros have arc-like geochemical features, high positive εHf(t) values (mean value of 5. 2 ± 0. 7), and Mesoproterozoic Hf model ages of 1163 ± 26  Ma, suggesting that they may generate from the partial melting of juvenile crustal materials resulting from the early subduction. Zircon from the interleaved <b>quartz-keratophyres</b> and tuffs have high positive εHf(t) values, ranging from 3. 3 to 18. 8. They, {{as well as their}} equivalent volcanic rocks, may have acted as a main source for 880 - 850  Ma detrital zircon in folded sequences along the Jiangnan orogen, and their mantle source would represent the depleted mantle end-member for Neoproterozoic crustal-mantle interactions in the Jiangnan orogen. © 2008 Elsevier B.
