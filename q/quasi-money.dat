40|$|During {{the recent}} Argentinean crisis, many provinces {{experienced}} very dramatic fiscal imbalances. In {{front of the}} shortfall in their resources {{and in order to}} avoid the default, provincial governors issued bonds as a way to finance a part of their spending. The problem of the cancellation of the provincial bonds found two different solutions. Some local governments chose to repurchase their bonds to their owners, when some others benefited from an help of the federal government in the context of a rescue package negotiated in march 2003. The former option was made possible by the existence of hydrocarbon concessions in some provinces, mainly those of Patagonia (in the west and in the south of the country), with the payment of royalties in dollar terms. Since the end of the currency board, the dollar was very strongly appreciated. This outcome implied a sharp increase in the peso value of the commodity-induced resources of the Argentinean provinces. This allowed, in the provinces which benefited from it, to remove their deficits and to withdraw the local <b>quasi-moneys</b> from circulation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the demand for}} currency and <b>quasi-money</b> in Indonesia with linear and neural network models. The goal is to predict better the recent financial distress, reflected by the flight into currency and decline of <b>quasi-money.</b> The results show that neural network approaches, much more than linear models, are capable of accurate out-of-sample predictions for both monetary aggregates. However, for the very turbulent period of November and December of 1997, even the neural network models show large out-of-sample forecasts errors. When a proxy for exchange-rate uncertainty supplements the network models, the out-of-sample currency demand becomes quite accurate, even for {{the last months of}} 1997. The <b>quasi-money</b> demand forecasts also improve, although not as dramatically as those of currency demand.

40|$|In {{centrally}} planned economies, domestic prices do {{not respond}} flexibly to market forces, so economic disequilibria - including repressed inflation - persist. The authors assess the extent of repressed inflation in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania between 1980 and 1990. First, they develop a simultaneous equation model, which stipulates that the repressed inflation {{is caused by the}} difference in growth rate between households'money holdings and retail sales in the economy. Following are the model's basic assumptions: a stable demand for money function exists where the demand for real <b>quasi-money</b> depends on the level of real income and the expected rate of inflation; inflationary expectations are formed under an adaptive scheme in which expected inflation for the next period depends on the error made in predicting the current period's true inflation; the real stock of <b>quasi-money</b> balances adjusts to the desired level, after a time lag. The authors then derive a reduced-form equation on real <b>quasi-money</b> holdings, and estimate it with quarterly data for Czechoslovakia and Poland, and with annual data for Romania. Based on the estimated equation, they derive the true inflation rate for each economy. Finally, they determine the significance of the repressed inflation in each economy through statistical tests on parameters of the estimated equation. These are the authors'main findings: during 1980 - 90 in Czechoslovakia, repressed inflation was insignificant, the demand for money was mostly for transaction purposes, and inflationary expectations were almost myopic; in Poland, repressed inflation was significant but decreasing after 1987, and inflationary expectations adjusted fairly rapidly; and in Romania, repressed inflation was serious throughout the period, and inflationary expectations adjusted quite rapidly. This economic model needs to be refined and the data used need to be improved. But the paper's findings are broadly consistent with the results of most other studies.

40|$|This project {{addresses}} the channels through which monetary policy may have produced {{the decline of}} output in Russia. In particular, it considers the role of interenterprise arrears in the transmission process, {{as well as the}} question of whether monetary impulses affected the sectoral pattern of the industrial recession. It appears that the fall in output related to monetary contraction may be significant, given the deficiencies of the credit market. Furthermore, it appears that distortions associated with the policy (which resulted in the outburst of <b>quasi-money</b> and extremely high interest rates) may have lengthened the recession. On the supply side, the structural weakness of the banking system results in a lack of adequate substitutes for Central Bank of Russia (CBR) loans. This intensifies the decline of credit supply in periods of monetary tightening. On the demand side, the lack of substitutes for bank credit deepens enterprise-side reaction, adversely affecting the viability of firms in the long-run. The model explains the transactions‚Äô role of money and reveals that interenterprise arrears may soften or strengthen production-side responses to a monetary impulse in the steady state (compared with the case when no arrears are allowed). Empirical evidence appears to favor the ‚Äúcushioning‚Äù effect of arrears. Russia, transition economics, trade credit, transmission mechanism, transaction costs...|$|E
40|$|How should socialist economies {{treat the}} money {{form in the}} {{transition}} from capitalism with all its disasters, instability and inequalities? In origins and function money is an essential nexus of market economies. It represents the means of accounting and exchange {{as well as the}} absolute form of wealth. Therefore, as we shall see in more detail below, the classics of Marxism assumed that in a socialist planned economy without markets money would disappear. In reality however, the Soviet type of socialism retained a form of paper money (e. g. rouble, mark, zloty) with certain restricted social functions. Goods and services were in a sense ‚Äòpriced ‚Äô although their prices were not determined in a market. The nature and functions of money in such societies are therefore an interesting theoretical problem in itself as well as being relevant to wider questions of how societies of the Soviet type should be interpreted and to our vision of a future socialism beyond the market. It will be How should socialist economies treat money? Theoretically at least three different cases are conceivable. First, a form of socialist <b>quasi-money</b> (s-money) or labour certificate is introduced, called ‚Äòlabour-money‚Äô. Second, another form of s-money is possible without accounting for labour-time but with publicly determined prices. Third, money exists in a market socialist economy. This paper examines the nature of money in the Soviet Union, and criticizes the Soviet orthodox view defining the rouble as real money by the false dichotomy of posing either labour certificate or real money. The possible forms and functions of (s-) money {{as well as those of}} (s-) credit in socialist economies should be more flexibly understood in accordance with various possible forms of socialist economies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEssential {{component}} of a country's economy, the financial system includes all financial relations between different actors {{in the process of}} formation, distribution and use of financial resources. The major objectives of an economy such as stability, economic growth and sustainable development are closely linked to the ability of financial systems to undertake such objectives. However, the main objective of the financial system in an economy is that of ensuring long-term economic growth through efficient financing of the economy. Financing economy refers to how the procurement and allocation of resources, both at micro and macro level, which can be divided into three categories:, Equity Finance (self-financing); Financing the capital market (direct funding); Debt financing (indirect financing). Elements of the financial system in our country are: financial markets (money market and capital market), financial intermediaries (banks, insurance companies, and investment companies), and financial infrastructure (payment systems and clearing houses). In general, emerging markets are characterized by financial systems based mainly on banks, while in developed countries for financial systems is based on the capital market. This may explain why emerging markets return after a period of crisis, it is cumbersome and lengthy. We believe {{that there should be a}} balance between the two components of the financial system so that recovery of losses incurred in a period of crisis, to be made in a short time. In this paper we use several variables to measure the development of the two components of the financial system and the banking capital market, such as market capitalization, leading interest rates, average annual growth rate in money and <b>quasi-money,</b> bank capital to assets ratio, domestic credit provided by banking sector. We analyzed, using SPSSS, the main indicators characterizing the relationship between financial sector development in our country, showing that there is a significant relationship between capitalization and loan rate, M 2, the rate of bank assets and domestic credit from the banking sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} non-payment in Russia {{has been a}} notorious {{epidemic}} {{since the start of}} its transition from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy. Though the economic reforms in 1990 s were to establish a monetary economy, they led to such 'demonetizations,' as widespread barter deals. Non-payment can also be viewed as one of the widespread forms of demonetization. There are five forms of nonpayment: the non-payment between enterprises, between the government and enterprises, between banks and enterprises, from the pension fund to pensioners, and from enterprises to workers. This article analyzes the formation and development of the non-payment problems by focusing on the evolution of the non-payment of wages in Russia. With the widespread demonetization and non-payment of wages, the situation grew worse and the population has been seriously affected. However, {{one of the most serious}} aspects of wage arrears lies in the fact that it is almost impossible to resolve the problem by utilizing <b>quasi-money,</b> such as payments in kind, or the pseudo-settlement mechanisms, such as zachet or offsets. The payment of wages, in principle, should be made in cash as should be wage arrears. Therefore, there have been relatively few cases of wages being paid in kind between enterprises. This means the wage debts have piled up continuously and will likely grow much larger. Second, whether workers necessary receive wages promptly is directly related to the amount of their disposable income to assure standard of living. With wage arrears, workers can get smaller incomes and their living standard falls. That is why the non-payment of wages is one of the most serious phenomena of the demonetizations. Third, it is widely believed that the non-payment of wages prevents the restructuring of enterprises, because even without laying off the excess labor, the enterprises can reduce their payroll costs through wage arrears. Indeed it reflects the malfunction of the labor market in Russia. The non-payment of wages peaked just after the August crisis in 1998. Both the federal and local governments were responsible for 15 to 20 percent of the total non-payment of wages. The federal government owed army salaries and payments for state orders for the military complex, while the local governments owed wages for workers in the education, health, and other sectors. The remaining part of wage arrears was responsible for enterprises' themselves. In the public sector, the non-payment of wages takes place because the government, especially local governments, are eager to maintain the regional level of employment regardless of their severe budget constraints. Despite the wage arrears, local governments maintain employment levels with the help of federal transfers and subsidies. At the same time, even though the federal government provides the financial resources to respond to the local authorities' requests for aid, the latter do not necessarily allocate those funds properly. The local governments have an interest to maintain a certain level of wage arrears in the region. In the private sector, our analysis of the wage payment from the viewpoint of both managers and workers found that the managers do not pay primarily because of the lack of working capital. The widespread demonetizations mean a shortage of cash for salaries. They cannot but delay the the payment of wages. Even if there is cash revenue, the payment of taxes should have a higher priority. The government tries to pursue the cash revenue. For instance the effective tax rate to the tax delinquent enterprises was as much as 100 %. The second aspect of management behavior concerns the exploitability of wage non-payment. Because of wage arrears, the firms ask the government for subsidies while the local government has good reason to believe this necessary to prevent social unrest. If the managers know workers will not move in spite of the wage arrears, then wage non-payment becomes a lower priority. On the contrary, wage nonpayment can guarantee that workers will not be laid off, due to the expensive severance pay. They also assure that the enterprise will continue to supply social services. Lastly demonetizations complicate the economic situation of the firm manager and workers alike. This enables the managers to manipulate financial flows in their favor and to embezzle funds with ease. Next follows an explanation for why managers prefer the nonpayment of wages to layoffs. One reason is the harsh legal environment for layoffs in Russia. Firms have to pay 3 -months of serverance pay. Second, they want to retain their labor force, because they are optimistic about the near future and believe that they have to maintain their labor force for the anticipated increase in demand. It has also become clear that non-payment of wages can be used to differentiate the labor force. Some get wages promptly, some with a 1 -month delay, and some with a 3 -month delay. By so doing managers can segregate employees. But that does not mean they want to dismiss the least skilled workers, rather through the non-payment of wages, they can reduce their wage taxes. The third question concerns why they are not eager to decrease salary levels while the wage arrears pile up. That is because inflation works as a tool to discount the debt. The wage bills tended to inflate under the pressure of the insider-employees, but inflation discounts the value of these wages. The national wage tariff system also plays an important role in preventing wage adjustments. There is a downward rigidity of wages in Russia. Workers accept wage arrears. First, employees have no legal recourse against wage arrears. Second, labor unions are so weak and fragmented that they have no clout. Workers do not move despite the wage arrears because the housing market in Russia is not developed and it is very expensive to move for a new job, especially out of town. Third, without wages, employees often pilfer from enterprises to provide materials for their own side businesses. At the same time, continued employment at a formerly state-owned enterprise means they remain eligible for social services. Although managers and workers are in the state of confrontation, they have a common desire to exploit wage arrears. For the workers it is more beneficial to exploit wage arrears than to change jobs. In this sense, they provide an element of cohesion. This is the main reason why wage arrears continue to accumulate. In our analysis of the role played by labor unions, we have found that there are two types of unions in Russia. Traditional labor unions have common interests with their enterprise managers. Both tend to appeal in critical situations to the local government for support. In contrast, newly established unions are more radical and take legal action to secure proper wage payments. These two types of unions often work in opposition to each other. Such divisions prevent the development of an effective alliance against management. We cannot neglect one of the important aspects of the non-payment of wages. This is the social and historical background surrounding enterprises. We all know that the Soviet Union tried to separate its monetary circulation into two parts: cash and non-cash. Workers received cash wages to meet the needs of their daily economic life, mainly in the retail sphere. At the same time people did not pay for health care services, for example, because those services were provided by their place of employment. That was a non-monetary side of Russian economic life. The extension of the monetary economy in Russia remains quite limited even after the transition. Workers are more sensitive to losing these non-monetary benefits from enterprises than to losing their wages. With wage arrears, people have to make ends meet by using networks of relatives and friends and by growing their own food, making the Russian economy more and more non-monetary. Enterprises in Russia are quite important for both employers and employees, not because they are capital assets that can create profits, but because they serve as hosts for a variety of parasitic activities: managers can get cash flow while workers can get both cash flow and social services. For the Russians it is quite natural to remain in an enterprise that regularly cannot meet payroll. This explains the paradoxical non-payment of wages during the economic transition of the Russian Federation. Both workers and managers can gain, not lose, from the non-payment of wages...|$|E
