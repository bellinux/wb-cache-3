The remaining {{portion of the}} only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (385oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.

5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in <b>question</b> <b>are</b> used in agriculture, as companions, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E
5|$|There is also {{a debate}} in the {{linguistic}} literature whether Greenlandic has noun incorporation. This is because Greenlandic does not allow the kind of incorporation common in many languages in which a noun root {{can be incorporated into}} almost any verb to form a verb with a new meaning. On the other hand, Greenlandic does often form verbs that include noun roots. The question then becomes whether to analyse these verb formations as incorporation or as denominal derivation of verbs. Greenlandic has a number of morphemes that require a noun root as their host and which form complex predicates that correspond closely in meaning to what is often seen in languages that have canonical noun incorporation. Linguists who propose that Greenlandic does have incorporation argue that these morphemes are in fact verbal roots that must obligatorily incorporate nouns to form grammatical clauses. This argument is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the derivational morphemes that form denominal verbs work almost identically to canonical noun incorporation. They allow the formation of words with a semantic content corresponding to an entire English clause with verb, subject and object. Another argument is that the morphemes used to derive denominal verbs come from historical noun incorporating constructions that have become fossilized. Other linguists maintain that the morphemes in <b>question</b> <b>are</b> simply derivational morphemes that allow the formation of denominal verbs. This argument is supported by the fact that the morphemes cannot occur without being latched on to a nominal element. The examples below illustrate how Greenlandic forms complex predicates including nominal roots.|$|E
50|$|The multiple-choice {{questions}} {{within each}} {{section of the}} CPA Exam are administered in three blocks, called testlets. Each testlet contains operational and pretest <b>questions.</b> Operational <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> scored, while pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> not scored. Instead, a candidate’s response to a pretest <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{used to evaluate the}} question’s statistical performance. A majority of the <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> operational questions; however, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> mixed into the exam and are not identified as pretest questions. From the candidate’s perspective, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> indistinguishable from operational questions. Pretest questions that meet certain statistical criteria are used as operational questions on future exams. This strategy for pretesting <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> common practice in high-stakes testing.|$|R

30|$|To do the comparison, {{we first}} {{implemented}} {{a method for}} machine-generating questions from a biology knowledge base. A second set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> formed by selecting questions retrieved from the web. The authors of most web <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> probably students and not biology experts. Our third set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> comprised of professional human-generated questions from textbooks and a biology study website ([URL] University biology students were recruited to act as judges. They rated the three sets of questions on four measures. Our primary <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether the machine-generated <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> worse than the human-generated ones.

25|$|Geometric group {{theory is}} an area in {{mathematics}} devoted {{to the study of}} finitely generated groups via exploring the connections between algebraic properties of such groups and topological and geometric properties of spaces on which these groups act (that is, when the groups in <b>question</b> <b>are</b> realized as geometric symmetries or continuous transformations of some spaces).|$|E

25|$|The problem {{statement}} is therefore that the alleles in <b>question</b> <b>are</b> not particularly beneficial under the previous circumstances; but {{a change in}} environment favours these genes by natural selection. The individuals without the genes are therefore disfavored, and the favourable genes spread in the population by the death (or lowered fertility) of the individuals without the genes. Note that Haldane's model as stated here allows {{for more than one}} gene to move towards fixation at a time; but each such will add to the cost of substitution.|$|E
25|$|The {{solutions}} {{are based on}} linear isotropic infinitesimal elasticity and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. In other words, they contain the assumptions (among others) that the materials in <b>question</b> <b>are</b> elastic, that stress is related linearly to strain, that the material (but not the structure) behaves identically regardless of direction of the applied load, that all deformations are small, and that beams are long relative to their depth. As with any simplifying assumption in engineering, the more the model strays from reality, the less useful (and more dangerous) the result.|$|E
