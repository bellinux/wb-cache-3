25|$|Emphasis and {{contrast}} may override normal stress. Pronouns frequently take stress because of this. In a simple <b>question</b> <b>like</b> Ĉu vi vídis? ('Did you see?'), the pronoun hardly {{needs to be}} said and is unstressed; compare Né, dónu al mí and ('No, give me). Within a word, a prefix that wasn't heard correctly may be stressed upon repetition: Né, ne tíen! Iru máldekstren, mi diris! ('No, not over there! Go left, I said!'). Because stress doesn't distinguish words in Esperanto, shifting it to an unexpected syllable calls attention to that syllable, but doesn't cause confusion as it might in English.|$|E

2500|$|The {{collection}} in <b>question,</b> <b>like</b> that of Dionysius Exiguus {{on which it}} is based, contains two parts: the first includes canons of Greek, African, Gallican and Spanish councils, with some letters of St. Cyril of Alexandria and Atticus of Constantinople, while the second has the papal decretals as found in Dionysius, together with some others, most of the latter addressed to Spanish bishops. This is the chronological [...] "Hispana". Somewhat later, {{towards the end of}} the seventh century, it was recast in logical order, by some unknown writer, and divided into ten books, which were again subdivided into titles and chapters. This is the methodical [...] "Hispana". Finally, the copyists were wont to place at the beginning of the chronological [...] "Hispana" [...] a table of contents of the methodical collection, but with references to the text of the chronological: in this shape it was known as the [...] "Excerpta Canonum". The chronological [...] "Hispana" [...] seems to have been originally the [...] "Codex Canonum" [...] mentioned at the Fourth Council of Toledo (633), with later additions. In the ninth century it was attributed, with insufficient evidence, to St. Isidore of Seville.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a method for the {{formalization}} of probabilistic models of human-computer interaction (HCI) including user behavior. These models can then {{be used for the}} analysis and verification of HCI systems with the support of model checking tools. This method allows to answer probabilistic <b>questions</b> <b>like</b> what is the probability that the user will unintentionally send confidential information to unautho-rized recipients. And it allows to compute average interaction costs and answer <b>questions</b> <b>like</b> how much time does a user on average need to send an email?...|$|R

5000|$|Quine's {{approach}} to the internal-external division was to cast internal questions as subclass questions and external questions as category questions. What Quine meant by 'subclass' <b>questions</b> were <b>questions</b> <b>like</b> [...] "what are so-and-so's?" [...] where the answers are restricted to lie within a specific linguistic framework. On the other hand, 'category' <b>questions</b> were <b>questions</b> <b>like</b> [...] "what are so-and-so's?" [...] asked outside any specific language where the answers are not so-restricted. The term subclass arises as follows: Quine supposes that a particular linguistic framework selects from a broad category of meanings for a term, say furniture, a particular or subclass of meanings, say chairs.|$|R
