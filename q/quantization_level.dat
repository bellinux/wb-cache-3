50|$|Cinavia's in-band {{signaling}} introduces intentional spread spectrum phase distortion {{in the frequency}} domain of each individual audio channel separately, giving a per-channel digital signal that can yield up to around 0.2 bits per second—depending on the <b>quantization</b> <b>level</b> available, and the desired trade-off between the required robustness and acceptable levels of psychoacoustic perceptibility. It is intended to survive analog distortions such as the wow and flutter and amplitude modulation from magnetic tape sound recording.

50|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} in the behaviour of analog and digital systems when high level signals are present, where {{there is the possibility}} that such signals could push the system into overload. With high level signals, analog magnetic tape approaches saturation, and high frequency response drops in proportion to low frequency response. While undesirable, the audible effect of this can be reasonably unobjectionable. In contrast, digital PCM recorders show non-benign behaviour in overload; samples that exceed the peak <b>quantization</b> <b>level</b> are simply truncated, clipping the waveform squarely, which introduces distortion in the form of large quantities of higher-frequency harmonics. In principle, PCM digital systems have the lowest level of nonlinear distortion at full signal amplitude. The opposite is usually true of analog systems, where distortion tends to increase at high signal levels. A study by Manson (1980) considered the requirements of a digital audio system for high quality broadcasting. It concluded that a 16 bit system would be sufficient, but noted the small reserve the system provided in ordinary operating conditions. For this reason, it was suggested that a fast-acting signal limiter or 'soft clipper' be used to prevent the system from becoming overloaded.|$|E

40|$|Various {{wireless}} technologies, such as RF, Bluetooth, and Zigbee, {{have been}} applied to sensor communications. However, the applications of Bluetooth-based wireless sensor networks (WSN) have a security issue. In one pairing process during Bluetooth communication, which is known as simple secure pairing (SSP), the devices are required to specify I/O capability or user interference to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This study proposes an enhanced SSP in which a nonce to be transferred is converted to a corresponding signal interval. The <b>quantization</b> <b>level,</b> {{which is used to}} interpret physical signal intervals, is renewed at every connection by the transferred nonce and applied to the next nonce exchange so that the same signal intervals can represent different numbers. Even if attackers eavesdrop on the signals, they cannot understand what is being transferred because they cannot determine the <b>quantization</b> <b>level.</b> Furthermore, the proposed model does not require exchanging passkeys as data, and the devices are secure in the case of using a fixed PIN. Subsequently, the new <b>quantization</b> <b>level</b> is calculated automatically whenever the same devices attempt to connect with each other. Therefore, the pairing process can be protected from MITM attacks and be convenient for users...|$|E

The relationship between the quantized DCT coefficients and the <b>quantization</b> <b>level</b> is also investigated. Based on the MAE of the motion compensated difference block and the <b>quantization</b> <b>level,</b> three options for the DCT calculation can be chosen: calculating all 8 x 8 DCT coefficients, calculating the DC coefficient only, or skipping the whole DCT computation.

A compression amplifier can be used to increase the weighting of the consonant sound amplitudes in the analog-to-digital converter. An expansion network must be installed at the output of the digital-to-analog converter to restore the original weighting of the consonant sounds.

Codebook and quantization are already adopted in LTE and MIMO-based Wi-Fi systems [1, 2, 15 - 17]; however, selecting the optimal <b>quantization</b> <b>level</b> is still an open problem. In Wi-Fi systems, it is proposed to compress the CSI report along three dimensions: time, frequency, and <b>quantization</b> <b>level.</b> Even though compression is used, it is reported that the feedback can take about 25 times longer than the data transmission time when sending a small packet with a high data rate [10]. A vast literature of work has aimed to design an efficient CSI quantization mechanism [18 - 22]. Recently, compressive sensing has also been used for feedback reduction in MIMO communications [23, 24]. The downside of compressions is, as expected, a throughput loss of MU-MIMO transmission: fewer bits may offer diminishing returns.|$|E

Typically, the measure of channel quality must be quantized at each mobile station {{before it can be}} sent back. In this paper, we present two distributed scalar quantization schemes that optimize two different performance criteria: a) the minimization of the probability Pe of incorrectly identifying the user with the best channel quality and b) maximization of the resulting throughput R. For a typical Rayleigh-fading system with 30 users per sector, numerical optimization results show that the Pe and R realized by the uniform quantization strategy with 16 <b>quantization</b> <b>levels</b> for each user can be achieved by only three <b>quantization</b> <b>levels</b> using the two proposed strategies.
