40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} validating two self-report composite rating scales of core affect that are useful when <b>quick</b> <b>assessments</b> are required, for instance, of current mood or recalled, anticipated, and experienced emotional reactions. The ratings {{were derived from}} the Swedish Core Affect Scales (SCAS) comprising six self-report rating scales of the two orthogonal dimensions of core affect, valence (unpleasantness-pleasantness) and activation (quietness-excitement). In three samples of university students who were requested to rate current moods, affect-inducing sounds, or affect-inducing pictures, the composite ratings were compared to SCAS, two widely used graphical rating scales of valence and activation, and skin conductance responses and the acceleratory peak of heart rate. Three different rating formats were also compared. The {{results showed that the}} composite ratings were reliable and yielded the expected correlations with the other ratings and with the physiological affect indicators. No effects of rating format were detected. It is concluded that the composite ratings of valence and activation may be used if <b>quick</b> <b>assessments</b> are called for. Choices can be made of any of three rating formats depending on purpose with the assessments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to propose an {{analytical}} approximate squeeze-film lubrication model of the human ankle joint for a <b>quick</b> <b>assessment</b> of the synovial pressure field and the load carrying due to the squeeze motion. The model starts from the theory of boosted lubrication for the human articular joints lubrication (Walker et al., Rheum Dis 27 : 512 – 520, 1968; Maroudas, Lubrication and wear in joints. Sector, London, 1969) and takes into account the fluid transport across the articular cartilage using Darcy’s equation to depict the synovial fluid motion through a porous cartilage matrix. The human ankle joint is assumed to be cylindrical enabling motion in the sagittal plane only. The proposed model is based on a modified Reynolds equation; its integration allows to obtain a <b>quick</b> <b>assessment</b> on the synovial pressure field showing a good agreement with those obtained numerically (Hlavacek, J Biomech 33 : 1415 – 1422, 2000).

40|$|Refugees in Kashiwazaki were {{surveyed}} {{immediately after the}} Niigataken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake to gather data on their knowledge about the system for <b>quick</b> <b>assessments</b> of damaged buildings and its effectiveness. <b>Quick</b> <b>assessments</b> of damaged buildings are a system for evaluating the safety of such buildings with the assigned purpose of preventing secondary injuries due to aftershocks or other events. It has been considered an effective program for protecting public safety. Survey results indicated low public recognition of the program {{despite the fact that}} this population had experienced the Niigataken Chuetsu Earthquake three years previously. It also showed that most of the population had access to buildings that had been determined to be dangerous. Another key issue for this system revealed in the survey was that the authorities did not sufficiently address the public's concerns about the safety of buildings by failing to publicize how buildings were to be repaired and made suitable for occupancy after emergencies. It is desirable to establish a system to provide an emergency repair method in combination with this inspection system...|$|R
