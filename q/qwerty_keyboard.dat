25|$|Not {{surprisingly}} network economics {{became a}} hot topic after the diffusion of the Internet across academia. Most people know only of Metcalfe's law as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing lock-in with the most-cited examples being Microsoft products and the <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The QWERTY layout is not {{the most}} {{efficient}} layout possible for the English language, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. Although the <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Eastern and Western Armenian keyboards {{are based}} on the layout of the font Arasan. These keyboard layouts are mostly phonetic, and allow direct access to every character in the alphabet. Because there are more characters in the Armenian alphabet (39) than in Latin (26), some Armenian characters appear on non-alphabetic keys on a conventional <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> (for example, շ maps to ,).|$|E

25|$|Chinese, Japanese and Korean {{require special}} input methods, often {{abbreviated}} to CJK IMEs (Input Method Editors), {{due to the}} thousands of possible characters in these languages. Various methods have been invented to fit every possibility into a <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> so East Asian keyboards are essentially the same as those in other countries. However, their input methods are considerably more complex, without one-to-one mappings between keys and characters.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{typographical}} conventions originate from {{the widespread use}} of the typewriter, based on the characteristics and limitations of the typewriter itself. For example, the <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> typewriter did not include keys for the en dash and the em dash. To overcome this limitation, users typically typed more than one adjacent hyphen to approximate these symbols. This typewriter convention is still sometimes used today, even though modern computer word processing applications can input the correct en and em dashes for each font type.|$|E
25|$|Dubeolsik, which shares its symbol layout {{with the}} <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> {{is much more}} {{commonly}} used. While Korean consonants and vowels (jamo) are grouped together into syllabic grids when written, the script is essentially alphabetical, and therefore typing in Korean is quite simple for those who understand the Korean alphabet Hangul. Each jamo is assigned to a single key. As the user types letters, the computer automatically groups them into syllabic characters. Given a sequence of jamo, {{there is only one}} unambiguous way letters can be validly grouped into syllables, so the computer groups them together as the user types.|$|E

30|$|As the {{conventional}} password/PIN authentication has been rigorously investigated, {{we focus on}} how to use machine learning techniques to process the sensor data of smartwatches and match users’ profiles. We collect the sensor data when users type passwords on <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboards</b> or type PINs on numeric keypads. <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboards</b> and numeric keypads are mainstream devices for inputting passwords and PINs nowadays, respectively. As long as a user types passwords or PINs with the hand wearing the smartwatch, the sensor data can be collected and then help authenticate the user. We extract unique features from the sensor data and train several machine learning classifiers using the features as user profiles. The classifiers are used to authenticate users.|$|R

The Priv retained the best BlackBerry 10 features. Its 3,410mAh battery is said to provide 22.5 hours of mixed use. The 18-megapixel camera, with a Schneider-Kreuznach lens, can also record 4K video; a secondary selfie camera is also provided. Several important apps unique to the Priv were available from Google Play by mid December.|$|E
25|$|The Russian phonetic {{keyboard}} layout (also called homophonic or transliterated) {{is widely used}} outside Russia, where normally there are no Russian letters drawn on keyboard buttons. This layout is made for typists who are more familiar with other layouts, like the common English <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> and follows the Greek and Armenian layouts in placing most letters at the corresponding Latin letter locations. It is famous among both native speakers and people who use, teach, or are learning Russian, and is recommended — along with the Standard Layout — by the linguists, translators, teachers and students of AATSEEL.org. The earliest known implementation of the Cyrillic-to-QWERTY homophonic keyboard was by former AATSEEL officer Constance Curtin between 1972 and 1976, for the PLATO education system's Russian Language curriculum developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Curtin's design sought to map phonetically related Russian sounds to QWERTY keys, to map proximate phonetic and visual cues nearby one another, {{as well as to}} map unused positions in a mnemonically ideal way. Peter Zelchenko worked under Curtin at UIUC, and his later modifications to the number row for Windows and Macintosh keyboards follow Curtin's original design intent.|$|E

500|$|Starting April 2009, various rumors {{circulated}} {{regarding the}} smartphone and other reportedly planned {{models for the}} BlackBerry line-up. The first rumor reported that a trio of devices were being developed as high-end smartphones, codenamed Onyx, Driftwood and Magnum. All of them were rumored to contain a [...] "hybrid concept" [...] with a touch screen and a <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> with similar prototype designs but destined to different networks. Onyx was rumored to be released only for AT markets.|$|E
500|$|During its development, the {{typewriter}} {{evolved from a}} crude curiosity into a practical device, the basic form of which became the industry standard. The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design, including a cylindrical platen and a four-rowed <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard.</b> Several design deficiencies remained, however. The Sholes and Glidden could print only upper-case letters—an issue remedied in its successor, the Remington No.2—and was a [...] "blind writer", meaning the typist could not see what was being written as it was entered.|$|E
500|$|The {{front part}} of the case is {{occupied}} by an integrated 40-key membrane keyboard displaying 20graphic and 54inverse video characters. Each key has up to five functions, accessed via the SHIFT and FUNCTION keys or depending on context. For example, the P key combines the letter P, the [...] " [...] character, and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB. The ZX81 uses a standard <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout. The keyboard is mechanically very simple, consisting of 40pressure-pad switches and 8 diodes under a plastic overlay, connected in a matrix of 8 rows and 5 columns.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} mobile phones today are built with either full <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboards</b> or {{software}} implementations {{of them on}} a touch screen.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{wearables}} (e. g., smartwatches, smartglasses, and digital jewelry) anticipates {{the need for}} text entry methods on very small devices. We conduct fundamental research on this topic using 3 qwerty-based soft keyboards for 3 different screen sizes, motivated by the extensive training that users have with <b>qwerty</b> <b>keyboards.</b> In addition to ZoomBoard (a soft keyboard for diminutive screens), we propose a callout-based soft keyboard and ZShift, a novel extension of the Shift pointing technique. We conducted a comprehensive user study followed by extensive analyses on performance, usability, and short-term learning. Our results show that different small screen sizes demand different types of assistance. In general, manufacturers can benefit from these findings by selecting an appropriate <b>qwerty</b> soft <b>keyboard</b> for their devices. Ultimately, this work provides designers, researchers, and practitioners with new understanding of <b>qwerty</b> soft <b>keyboard</b> design space and its scalability for tiny touchscreens...|$|R
500|$|The Oliver’s typebars {{are bent}} in a bow (forming an {{inverted}} [...] "U" [...] shape) and rest in [...] "towers" [...] {{on the sides}} of the typewriter. This design limited the machine to a three-row <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard</b> as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added. The size and usability implications of adding additional keys and thus, more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers. Although a four-row prototype was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company’s financial troubles at that time. The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had four-row keyboards.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1872, the {{appearance}} and function of the typewriter had assumed the form that would become standard in the industry and remain largely unchanged for the next century. Although the machine possessed a cylindrical platen and what was essentially a <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard,</b> two design elements that would later become essential were lacking: the ability to write in upper and lowercase letters and [...] "visible" [...] print. Although the former was implemented in the Remington No.2, the machine was fundamentally an [...] "upstrike" [...] design, meaning the typebars struck upwards against {{the underside of the}} platen. As this occurred inside the machine, the operator could not see what was being entered as it was typed. Although competing brands, such as the Oliver and Underwood, began to market [...] "visible" [...] typewriters in the 1890s, a Remington-branded model did not appear until the Remington No.10 in 1906.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Google {{acquired}} Android Inc., {{a company}} led by Andy Rubin which {{was working on}} unspecified software for mobile devices. Under the leadership of Google, the team {{was in the process}} of developing a standardized, Linux-based operating system for mobile phones to compete against the likes of Symbian and Windows Mobile, which would be offered for use by individual original equipment manufacturers. Initial development of what would become Android was targeted towards a prototype device codenamed [...] "Sooner"; the device was a messaging phone in the style of BlackBerry, with a small, non-touch screen, navigation keys, and a physical <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The January 2007 unveiling of the iPhone, Apple's first smartphone, and its pioneering design aspects, caught Rubin off-guard and led to a change in course for the project. The operating system's design was quickly reworked, and attention shifted to a new prototype device codenamed [...] "Dream"—a touchscreen device with a sliding, physical keyboard. The inclusion of a physical keyboard was intentional, as Android developers recognized users did not like the idea of a virtual keyboard as they lacked the physical feedback that makes hardware keyboards useful.|$|E
40|$|Tablet devices {{can display}} {{full-size}} <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboards</b> {{similar to the}} physical ones. Yet, the lack of tactile feedback and the inability to rest the fingers on the home keys result in a highly demanding and slow exploration task for blind users. We present SpatialTouch, an input system that leverages previous experience with physical <b>QWERTY</b> <b>keyboards,</b> by supporting two-handed interaction through multitouch exploration and spatial, simultaneous audio feedback. We conducted a user study, with 30 novice touchscreen participants entering text under one of two conditions: (1) SpatialTouch or (2) mainstream accessibility method Explore by Touch. We show that SpatialTouch enables blind users to leverage previous experience as they do a better use of home keys and perform more efficient exploration paths. Results suggest that although SpatialTouch {{did not result in}} faster input rates overall, it was indeed able to leverage previous QWERTY experience in contrast to Explore by Touch...|$|R
