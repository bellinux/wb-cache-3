40|$|The {{traditional}} {{concepts of}} water resource development and utilization have caused serious hydrological {{and environmental issues}} in some regions. In addition, policy issues in China {{have led to a}} severe water crisis. The <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> of water resources is a theoretical approach to solving these problems. In this paper, 13 indicators were selected from four classes, including resources, the environment, society, and efficiency, and a case study of Jinan, Shandong Province, was performed using a set pair analysis model to calculate the water resource assets from 2011 – 2015. In previous methods of water resource accounting, the water quality was not considered; therefore, the loss coefficient of water resource assets was proposed to improve the reliability of accounting. According to the relationships among the unit price of water, water quantity, and water quality, physical and <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> methods were used to create water balance sheets from 2011 – 2015. The calculation results showed that the physical change in water resource assets in Jinan City was − 30 million m 3, and water resource assets initially increased and then decreased. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, water resource assets totalled 36. 5 million USD, 45. 9 million USD, 66. 7 million USD, 35. 5 million USD, and 37. 5 million USD, respectively (at 6. 4588, 6. 3125, 6. 1932, 6. 2166, 6. 2284 USRMB, respectively).

40|$|AbstractSpreading {{depression}} (SD), a propagating wave {{of electrical}} {{silence in the}} cortex and archicortex, involves depolarization of neurons and astrocytes for ∼ 1 min, due principally to a large increase in extracellular K+. SD is accompanied by large increases in extracellular ATP and is blocked by glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. As a principal means of transmission between astrocytes is through their release of ATP, we have investigated if a model in which SD {{is driven by the}} effects of astrocyte waves of ATP interacting with waves of glutamate release from neurons and astrocytes can give a <b>quantitative</b> <b>account</b> of experimental observations on SD. We show that the characteristics of SD and the accompanying extracellular ionic changes can be accommodated by such a model—whether astrocyte transmission is principally through the release of ATP, as in archicortex (hippocampus) and spinal cord, or via gap junctions, as in the neocortex. Furthermore, these models give <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounts</b> of the effects on the characteristics of SD of agents toxic for astrocytes and of gap-junction blockers.

40|$|RNA folding into stable {{tertiary}} structures {{is remarkably}} {{sensitive to the}} concentrations and types of cations present; {{an understanding of the}} physical basis of ion-RNA interactions is therefore a prerequisite for a <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> of RNA stability. This article summarizes the energetic factors that must be considered when ions interact with two different RNA environments. “Diffuse ions” accumulate near the RNA because of the RNA electrostatic field and remain largely hydrated. A “chelated” ion directly contacts a specific location on the RNA surface and is held in place by electrostatic forces. Energetic costs of ion chelation include displacement of some of the waters of hydration by the RNA surface and repulsion of diffuse ions. Methods are discussed for computing both the free energy of the set of diffuse ions associated with an RNA and the binding free energies of individual chelated ions. Such calculations quantitatively account for the effects of Mg 2 + on RNA stability where experimental data are available. An important conclusion is that diffuse ions are {{a major factor in the}} stabilization of RNA tertiary structures...|$|E
40|$|An {{equivalent}} {{electrical circuit}} has been constructed for small atrial trabecula of frog {{in a double}} sucrose gap voltage clamp apparatus. The basic strategy in constructing the circuit was to derive the distribution of membrane capacitance and extracellular resistance from the preparation's response to small voltage displacements near the resting condition, when the membrane conductance is presumably quite low. Then standard Hodgkin-Huxley channels were placed in parallel with the capacitance {{and the results of}} voltage clamp experiments were simulated. The results suggest that the membranes of the preparation cannot in fact be clamped near the control voltage nor can the ionic currents be measured directly with reasonable accuracy by axon standards. It {{may or may not be}} a realizable goal in the future to define the preparation's electrical behavior well enough to permit the ultimate quantitative description of the membrane's specific ion conductances. The result of this paper suggest that if this goal is achieved using the double sucrose gap voltage clamp, it will be by a detailed <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> for substantial irreducible errors in voltage control, rather than by experimental achievement of good voltage control...|$|E

40|$|Using two popular accounting-based {{models for}} {{earnings}} manipulation (i. e., the Beneish M-Score and the Dechow F-Score) {{and the financial}} data of public companies from 2004 to 2012, 1 find that the M-Score (F-Score) predicts less (more) earnings overstatements during the recent financial crisis in 2007 - 2008 than other sample years. However, a detailed investigation at the industry level reveals that this does not hold in all industries. I further show that the potential misstating firms flagged by the M-Score tend to under-perform the market both at the aggregate and the industry level, {{and some of those}} flagged by the F-Score under-perform at the industry level. Finally, by running Fama-French three-factor regressions at the aggregate level, I provide evidence that the firms flagged by the MScore generally yield negative risk-adjusted stock returns. The evidence suggests public availability of financial statements alone does not ensure that all the elements of financial statements are fully integrated into prices in a timely manner.

The Transbaikalian National Park was taken as the example. In the course of research the comprehensive assessment of the recreational degradation of the terrain, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> of the recreational load of the objects was carried out; those having a rest as well as the local residents were interviewed. Based on the results the methods for solving the problematic situations have been developed that can help to mitigate or prevent the escalation of the destructive natural processes. In order to radically solve the issues related to the further tourism development within the specified area it was suggested to use the method of the permissible landscape changes instead of the permissible recreational load method approved for the national planning system before. The research findings may be put to good use not only within the Transbaikalian National park but also on the entire Baikal natural area.

40|$|Two {{facets of}} climate change [...] {{increased}} tropical storm intensity and ocean acidification [...] are expected to detrimentally affect reef-building organisms by increasing their mortality rates and decreasing their calcification rates. Our current understanding of these effects is largely based on individual organisms' short-term responses to experimental manipulations. However, predicting the ecologically-relevant effects {{of climate change}} requires understanding the long-term demographic implications of these organism-level responses. In this study, we investigate how storm intensity and calcification rate interact to affect population dynamics of the table coral Acropora hyacinthus, a dominant and geographically widespread ecosystem engineer on wave-exposed Indo-Pacific reefs. We develop a mechanistic framework based on the responses of individual-level demographic rates to changes in the physical and chemical environment, using a size-structured population model that enables us to rigorously incorporate uncertainty. We find that table coral populations are vulnerable to future collapse, placing in jeopardy many other reef organisms that are dependent upon them for shelter and food. Resistance to collapse is largely insensitive to predicted changes in storm intensity, but is highly dependent {{on the extent to which}} calcification influences both the mechanical properties of reef substrate and the colony-level trade-off between growth rate and skeletal strength. This study provides the first rigorous <b>quantitative</b> <b>accounting</b> of the demographic implications of the effects of ocean acidification and changes in storm intensity, and provides a template for further studies of climate-induced shifts in ecosystems, including coral reefs...|$|E
