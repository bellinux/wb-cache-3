2500|$|In the United States Coast Guard and United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the coxswain has the {{authority}} to direct all boat and crew activities during the mission and modify planned missions to provide {{for the safety of the}} boat and the crew.

40|$|<b>Qualification</b> <b>procedures</b> {{for complex}} {{integrated}} circuits {{are being developed}} under a U. S. government program known as Qualified Manufacturing Lines (QML). This effort is focused on circuits designed by IC manufacturers and has not addressed application specific IC's (ASIC's) designed at system houses. The <b>qualification</b> <b>procedures</b> described here are intended to be responsive {{to the needs of}} system houses who design their own ASIC's and have them fabricated at Silicon foundries. A particular focus of this presentation will be the use of the TID (total Ionizing Dose) Chip to evaluate CMOS foundry processes and to provide parameters for circuit simulators. This chip is under development as a standard chip for qualifying the total dose aspects of ASIC's. The benefits of standardization are that the results will be well understood and easy to interpret. Data is presented and compared for 1. 6 micron and 3. 0 micron CMOS. The data shows that 1. 6 micron CMOS is significantly harder than 3. 0 micron CMOS. Two failure modes are explored: (1) the radiation-induced degradation of timing delays; and (2) radiation-induced leakage currents...|$|R
