40|$|Shaded-relief images {{created from}} digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) are helpful in identifying faults in rugged mountains, because, unlike conventional airphoto interpretation, the method can enhance lineaments at different orientations by simulating topographic illumination under varied light directions.

Field surveys and detailed analysis of large-scale maps and airphotos revealed the lineament to be an active fault with high rates of vertical and lateral slip. The new fault can be regarded as the southernmost segment or branch of a known adjacent fault, and the rate and direction of its slip provide fresh insight into late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> of the fault system.

30|$|Space {{does not}} allow further {{analysis}} of these differences between the comparatively low “quaternary” economic development of the recent decade or two in South Korea’s growth trajectory. We simply assert from the limited evidence mobilised, that two important deductions {{can be made from}} the comparative data and analysis proposed by economic growth theorists such as Rodrik (1995, 2011) The first of these is that manufacturing employment and GDP share remain high in South Korea. Meanwhile some even later industrialising countries have already begun de-industrializing, notably China and Vietnam. Conversely, the “Tiger” economies, notably Singapore and Hong Kong, and their Asian successors have “financialized” their economies more than South Korea (e.g. also Vietnam) and have augmented such quaternary activity with other knowledge-intensive, high value, high skill and high profitability <b>quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> as in Taiwan. These include activities such as innovative ICT, software, systems design, medical biotechnology and R&D. In this respect their economic profiles are closer to those of regions like Silicon Valley, Greater Cambridgeshire and Israel, which are among the most knowledge-intensive “quaternary” regions in the world.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} stratigraphic and morphotectonic {{analyses}} {{made on the}} Pleistocene terraces at the outlet of the Meduna valley (eastern Carnic Prealps) are presented and discussed. The investigated area belongs {{to the front of}} the eastern Southalpine chain that hit destructive earthquakes both historical and instrumental. Structural framework of the front of the Southalpine chain is made by a set of WNW-ESE striking, SSE-verging medium to low-angle thrusts gradually propagating in the Friulian Plain. In the study area, located south of the Periadriatic thrust, the main structural elements are the WSW-ENE striking Maniago and M. Jouf thrusts. East of Meduno locality, this structural framework shows a noticeable undulation, probably reflecting a Cretaceous or Eocene paleostructure and causing a NW-SE striking dextral transpressive transfer zone. Both thrusts show evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity.</b> Nine depositional units Early Pleistocene – Holocene in age and six terraced orders are detected. Stratigraphic and geometric relationships between depositional units and terraced surfaces allowed to reconstruct the chronology of the depositional events.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the Montello thrust system in the Eastern Southern Alps as a {{potential}} seismogenic source. This system {{is of particular interest}} because of its lack of historical seismicity. Nevertheless, the system is undergoing active deformation. We developed a finite-element model using visco-elasto-plastic rheology. The free parameters of the model (essentially, the locking status of the three thrusts included in the study), were constrained by matching the observed horizontal GPS and vertical levelling data. We show that the amount of interseismic fault locking, and thus the seismic potential, is not necessarily associated with the fastest-slipping faults. More specifically, the locked Bassano thrust has a greater seismic potential than the freely slipping Montello thrust. The findings suggest that faults with subtle evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> should be carefully considered when creating seismic hazard maps...|$|R
30|$|While this {{narrative}} does {{not seek to}} present platform ecosystems of the Quaternary kind under discussion as paragons of virtue, {{it is clear that}} even the tightest hierarchical control assumed to be typical of military hierarchies is not immune to major failures of administration predicted in Perrow’s (1999) “normal accidents” analysis. Although we have yet to turn to the implications of {{this narrative}} for the prodigious hierarchical control of Chaebols like Samsung in the South Korean context it should nevertheless give pause for concern during that national economy’s period of relative stagnation compared to the past. One reason is that a tradition of Neo-Confucianist hierarchy, obedience and control associated with Chaebol tradition is no longer the administrative power in industrial organization that it once was. More recently, notions of “flattened hierarchies”, “intrapreneurship” and “open innovation” have affected learning in some large corporate entities as they have struggled to compete with more flexible, nimble and agile regional and global supply and knowledge networks. Typically, this way of operating has characterised the SME platform ecosystems of the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> pronounced in the Silicon Valley, Cambridge and Israeli set-ups and in the global financial “superhubs, “biomedical megacentres” that are nowadays the leading “frame” for learning innovative organizational “(non)governance” (Nadivi, 2017).|$|E
30|$|Accordingly {{a highly}} “networked” {{collaborative}} enterprise complex characterises, {{for example the}} “complex adaptive super-systems” that manage global financial systems. These elements of “superhub globalisation” with numerous nodes distributed across the planet contrast with the “thin globalisation” networks more typical of the other knowledge-intensive <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> associated with “Big Data”, cybersecurity, systems design, software algorithms, biopharmaceuticals and cleantech. As noted earlier, these have high rate of networking among technology entrepreneurs, university researchers and government or military representatives and clients. Such platform ecosystems are thus not top-down hierarchical administrative or bureaucratic systems in any meaningful way. It is thus a decentralised, associational “Innovation Advocacy” model of industry organization. There is usually no formal strategy; the main driver has been incremental, evolutionary, sometimes rapid, change. “Superhubs” for financial services and *biotech megacentres” particularly in the UK and US tend to be open not managed economies {{and there has been}} little or no recognisable industrial strategy The UK’s recent attempt at an industrial strategy in 2017 was disparagingly referred to as a political “toyshop” Finally, we now see, typically new innovation models emerging in the likes of Cambridge where “crossover” mutations from microelectronics to advanced combustion engines and healthcare are being fashioned (Eason & Dean, 2016).|$|E

In July of 2012, using a structured questionnaire, persons employed in travel agencies and TC hotels were surveyed in relation to the following issues: what is, in their own opinion, the determining factor for a tourist in choosing a tour package in TC as a destination; how would they assess the tourist’s motives for choosing TC as a destination; how would they characterize (assess) the value factors of the TC tourist offer. The conducted research indicates that employees in the tourism industry have formed perceptions of TC as a tourist destination: it is a destination where tourists feel pleasant and happy to stay at; it has outstanding natural attractions, a welcoming environment and solid accommodation and catering potentials. However, elements that need improving and further development are highlighted as well. Methods used for collecting, processing and analyzing data are: historical, descriptive, comparative.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of national research programs (CARG Project, DPC-INGV, S 1 Project) detailed geological, structural and morphotectonic investigations integrated with the analysis of topographic maps (scale 1 : 10. 000), high resolution-DEM (supplied by the Civil Protection of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region) and ENI – AGIP seismic profiles, {{was carried out in}} the western sector of the Carnic Prealps (Friuli) in order to characterize as many as possible geometric (trend, size, depth), kinematic (slip vector, cumulative displacement, slip per event), dynamic (maximum expected magnitude) and chronological (slip-rate and mean recurrence interval) parameters of the major active faults located in this portion of the front of the eastern Southern Alps. The study area is located at the southern border of the western Carnic Prealps and includes the northern sector of the Friuli piedmont plain. This area belongs to the Pliocene-Quaternary front of the eastern Southalpine Chain (ESC), a south-verging polyphase fold and thrust belt, in evolution from the Middle Miocene to the Present (Castellarin et al., 1992). In the Carnic Prealps, the outer sector of the ESC is made of a series of arched SW-NE trending, SE-verging thin-skinned thrusts, stacking on the foreland and involving more external portions of the plain through the activation of new external splays. In the adjoining plain, thrusts are mostly blind but deformation affects the upper Pleistocene to Present fluvio-glacial and alluvial deposits. Presently in the Friuli area σ 1 spreads between NNW-SSE in the western region, to NNE-SSW in the east. GPS records (Bechtold et al., 2009; Serpelloni et al., 2005) indicate a crustal shortening rate of about 2 - 3 mm/a. According to the DBMI Catalogue (Locati et al., 2011) the study area was hit by both historical and instrumental earthquakes: 1776 Tramonti, Io= 8 - 9; 1812 Sequals, Imax: 7 - 8; 1873 Alpago Imax: 9 - 10; 1936 Cansiglio Imax: 9. Intensive losses were also recorded {{as a consequence of the}} destructive earthquakes of 1976 (Friuli) and 1928 (Carnia). Three tectonic units were identified and parametrized in the western pre-alpine Carnic area: the Arba-Ragogna, the M. Jouf-Maniago and the Polcenigo-Montereale respectively. a) The Mt. Jouf - Maniago is a NE-SW striking, SE-verging thrust-system running at the base of the Carnic prealps east the Cellina River. Both thrusts show evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity.</b> Near Maniago locality the terraced middle and upper Pleistocene units (respectively Maniago conglomerates and Maniago gravels) are back-tilted and uplifted on the present piedmont plain (Zanferrari et al., 2008) and lacustrine deposits (9090 ± 90 years 14 C BP), cropping out along the Colvera creek, a few kilometres north of Maniago, are gently folded and fractured (Zanferrari et al., 2008). Recently, on the basis of stratigraphic and morphotectonic analyses carried out on Pleistocene terraces at the outlet of the Meduna valley, a post-LGM-Holocene slip rate of about 0. 5 mm/a was detected for the Maniago thrust (Monegato and Poli, 2015). b) South of the Maniago - M. Jouf tectonic unit, the Miocene succession is thrust and folded by the Arba-Ragogna thrust-system that shows evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity,</b> as testifies the angular unconformity between the lower Messinian Montello Conglomerate and the lower Quaternary San Pietro di Ragogna Conglomerate (Zanferrari et al., 2008; Poli et al., 2009). The recent tectonic activity of the Arba-Ragogna thrust system is also testified by drainage anomalies and gentle scarps connecting uplifted paleolandscapes of Quaternary age (Galadini et al., 2005). A vertical slip-rate of about 0. 19 mm/y has been calculated for the Arba–Ragogna thrust during the last 21 kys. (Poli et al., 2009). The analysis of the ENI-AGIP industrial seismic lines confirms evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> for both the structures. c) The Polcenigo-Montereale thrust-system gives rise to the major morphological element of the western area and it is made of a NW-SE striking imbricate thrusts running at the base of the Cansiglio-Cavallo carbonate plateau from Montereale Valcellina to Caneva. Toward the east it is segmented by the M. Jouf-Maniago thrust system, in the west it is separated from the Cansiglio thrust by means the Col Longone lateral ramp. The Polcenigo-Montereale thrust overlaps the Upper Jurassic - Upper Cretaceous Limestones of the Friulian Carbonatic Platform (FCP) not only on the Miocene Southalpine molassa but also on the Quaternary successions. Near Aviano the Holocene alluvial fan of Ossena river is gentle folded and its post-Roman age gravels are about 15 ° back-tilted. Near Polcenigo, the Budoia-Aviano splay deforms the LGM alluvial fan of the Artugna river giving rise to considerable drainage anomalies. Near Montereale along the Malnisio thrust the deposits related to the LGM Cellina fan (Avigliano et al., 2002) are displaced of about 10 m, suggesting also for this sector a recent slip rate of about 0. 5 mm/y. West of Polcenigo, the Col Longone lateral ramp acts as left lateral strike-slip fault and splits the Polcenigo-Montereale thrust from the Cansiglio one. The W-E trending, S-verging low angle Cansiglio thrust extends for about 6 km around the base of the Cansiglio massif and overlaps the Upper Jurassic-Upper Cretaceous limestones of the FCP on the Miocene units. Late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> is demonstrated by the displacement of a post-LGM stratified slope deposits along the fault surficial expression (Galadini et al., 2005). Westward it seals the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> of Montello thrust (Galadini et al., 2005). On the basis of the processing of the macroseimic data-point distribution the Cansiglio thrust is generally considered as the source of the 1936 earthquake (Galadini et al., 2005; Sirovich et al., 2004) ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative methodological procedure for determining settlement centrality {{in the form}} of the relative importance of centralities, expressed through numerical values. It offers easy-to-process data for further research. The calculated values of centrality agree with the spirit of W. Christaller’s "classical" theoiy of central settlements. The simple sum of tertiary and quaternary contents of a settlement expresses no more than the wealth of its offer and only if we evaluate the importance of this offer can we reach the degree of the settlement’s potential centrality. Up to the moment when we determine the relative importance of centrality of a settlement, we remain in the domain of its nodal importance. The concept of nodality and the concept of centrality of a settlement are two hindered concepts. The first may be called the concept of importance and the second the concept of relative importance of a settlement. In real life there is a whole range of transitive situations, from the good supply of the central settlement with tertiary and quaternary functions, whose capacities exceed the needs of the population in the gravitational area of the settlement, to the opposite situation, which is reflected in positive and negative values of the relative importance of centrality. Therefore, the balance between the supply of the settlement and the demand of the gravitational area can be defined as "ideal centrality". A comparative analysis of systems of central settlements on the basis of relative importance of centrality shows some inter-regional relations. The poor capacity of tertiary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> in several larger settlements of the Osijek macroregion is especially prominent. An analysis shows that their specific position also means their satellite character. The system of central settlements in the Lika association of communes, on the other hand, is very well supplied...|$|E
40|$|New {{applications}} of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating were carried out {{with the aim of}} understanding late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activities</b> for the Tibetan Plateau. This included studying the slip rate of the Altyn Tagh Fault, northeast Tibetan Plateau, and revealing the environmental changes derived from large inland lake’s evolution, central south Tibet. Two deflected streams across the Altyn Tagh Fault close to Aksay (39 ° 24. 572 ’N, 94 ° 16. 012 ’E) were investigated. Geomorphological analysis suggests that loess covering deflected stream banks has recorded past faulting events. A conceptual model is proposed illustrating the relationship. OSL dating of sixteen loess samples at both streams support the model, suggesting the loess is deposited episodically after fault strikes and subsequent channel wall refreshment. The age and offset indicate a slip rate of 11 ± 2 mm/yr for this part of the Altyn Tagh Fault. Another river section near Aksay was also investigated for the slip rate information. Two risers between three terraces are clearly offset; OSL dating of loess covering terrace surfaces yielded terrace ages. Using the upper-terrace age to represent riser displacement duration, the rate is estimated to be 12 ± 1 mm/yr. The result suggests that using upper terrace is more suitable in this region. Notably, though, the slow rate is at odds with proposals that assume high-speed extrusion (~ 23 mm/year) of the Tibetan Plateau being accommodated by the Altyn Tagh Fault. Palaeo-shorelines around the third largest lake in Tibet, Zhari Namco, were for the first time systematically investigated using OSL dating. Twenty-two sediment samples from eleven shorelines indicate that the water level has dropped ~ 128 m and the lake has undergone stepwise shrinkage since 8. 2 ka. Digital elevation model calculation indicates the lake has shrunk from 4605 km 2 in size at 8. 2 ka to 996 km 2 at present, which is equivalent to ~ 300 km 3 of water. This implies a significant reduction in precipitation over the past 8. 2 ka, a result of weakening Indian Monsoon or a shift of monsoon circulation path. The result is consistent with other lake-core, ice-core climate proxies and solar insolation changes, implying the dominance of a weakening Indian Monsoon over central Tibet in the Holocene. Using the elevation of the highest shoreline of the four largest lakes in Tibet, the early Holocene Pan-lake hypothesis is proposed for the central Tibet. In addition to these {{applications of}} OSL dating, technical studies on sensitivity changes and residual doses have been carried out for potassium rich feldspar (K-feldspar). Recent development of infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals from K-feldspar has shown great potential for extending the datable range for OSL dating. Sensitivity changes and residual doses of post-IR IRSL and multi-elevated -temperature post-IR IRSL protocols for K-feldspar were studied. A sensitivity decrease is observed after adopting a high temperature IRSL. IRSL signals stimulated at high temperature are found to contain large residual doses. The residual dose rises with stimulation time, suggesting that the initial part of IRSL signals contains more easy-to-bleach signals comparing with the later part. published_or_final_versionEarth SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

Geometry and kinematic of the Arba-Ragogna thrust-system were recognised both using structural survey and industrial reflection seismic profiles. The system is arranged as a S-SE verging and about WSW-ENE striking imbricate fan of medium to low-angle thrusts. The outermost is the Arba-Ragogna blind thrust. Its long–lasting activity is testified by the angular unconformities between the Upper Miocene, Upper Pliocene and Pleistocene stratigraphic units. A vertical slip rate of about 0. 19 mm/a was calculated for the Arba –Ragogna thrust during the last 21000 years. The Arba-Ragogna thrust is one of the seismogenic sources capable to generate earthquakes with M 6 in the Veneto-Friuli region, but it cannot be related to historical earthquakes.

The catchment consists of an extensive array of channel and floodplain types that we show have undergone large-scale fluvial adjustment in-channel planform, geometry and sinuosity. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of quartz sediments from fifteen (3 – 18 m) floodplain cores throughout the basin indicates several discrete phases of active bedload activity: at ∼ 105 – 85 ka in Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, at ∼ 50 – 40 ka (MIS 3), and at ∼ 30 – 10 ka (MIS 3 / 2). The overall timing of late <b>Quaternary</b> fluvial <b>activity</b> correlates well with previous accounts from across Australia with rivers being primarily active during interstadials. Fluvial activity, however, {{does not appear to}} have been synchronous throughout the basin’s major sub-catchments. Fluvial activity throughout MIS 2 (i. e. across the Last Glacial Maximum) in the meandering channels of the Fitzroy correlates well with regional data in tropical northeastern Queensland, and casts new light on the river response to reduced rainfall and vegetation cover suggested by regional palaeoclimate indicators. Moreover, the absence of a strong Holocene signal is at odds with previous accounts from elsewhere throughout Australia. The latitudinal position of the Fitzroy across the Tropic of Capricorn places this catchment at a key location for elucidating the main hydrological drivers of <b>Quaternary</b> fluvial <b>activity</b> in northeastern Australia, and especially for determining tropical moisture sources feeding into the headwaters of Cooper Creek, a major river system of the continental interior...|$|R

Paleoseismic studies in this area yield data that can be compared and correlated with the morphologic and tectono-sedimentary evolution of the alluvial fan. The spatial arrangement of the sedimentary alluvial fan units near the fault zone, shown in trenches, is controlled by the recurrent reverse, left-lateral coseismic events. We analysed the morphology of the drainage network using a 1 : 5000 scale orthoimage to identify and measure horizontal deflections along the fault. The channel pattern analysis allowed us to estimate the average horizontal slip rate of the SAMF for the last 130 ka. This value is 0. 21 mm/a, which is slightly higher than the range of values obtained by trenching analysis for the last 30 ka, (0. 06 to 0. 15 mm/yr). The interpretation of the stratigraphic sequence exposed along the trench walls constrained the occurrence of at least two surface faulting earthquakes during the last 30000 years.

Despite the recognised seismic risk faults capable of producing strong magnitude earthquakes are poorly known. This doctoral dissertation presents an investigation of active faults in the Ljubljana Basin using the approach of tectonic geomorphology. Active faults were identified with regional-scale geomorphologic mapping using remote sensing data. The right-lateral strike-slip Sava fault and reverse Vodice fault were investigated in detail with geomorphologic analysis of spatial topographic data and field survey. Study of these faults was focused on describing geomorphic indicators of activity, determining the fault kinematics, geometry and segmentation and on estimating offsets and ages of geomorphic markers. The obtained data alowed us to quantitatively constrain the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> of Sava and Vodice faults. Furthermore, their seismogenic potential was estimated based on geometric type of segmentation using scaling laws.

Slip rates have been estimated from offsets of Quaternary volcanic markers and alluvial fan using in situ cosmogenic 36 Cl exposure dating.

The horizontal slip rate is within the range of longer-term geological slip rates and short-term GPS-based estimates. In addition, the non-negligible vertical motion participates in the uplift of the block north of the fault and seems to be a manifestation of the regional, far-field stress regime.

Recent acquisition of airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) topography along the ∼ 140 km length of the Kern Canyon fault provides a comprehensive view of the active surface trace. High-resolution, lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) for the northern Kern Canyon fault enable identification of previously unrecognized offsets of late Quaternary moraines near Soda Spring (36. 345 °N, 118. 408 °W). Predominately north-striking fault scarps developed on the Soda Spring moraines display west-side-up displacement and lack a significant sense of strike-slip separation, consistent with detailed mapping and trenching along the entire Kern Canyon fault. Scarp-normal topographic profiling derived from the lidar DEMs suggests normal displacement of at least 2. 8 + 0. 6 /– 0. 5 m of the Tioga terminal moraine crest. Cosmogenic 10 Be exposure dating of Tioga moraine boulders yields a tight age cluster centered around 18. 1 ± 0. 5 ka (n = 6), indicating a minimum normal-sense fault slip rate of ∼ 0. 1 – 0. 2 mm/yr over this period. Taken together, these results provide the first clear documentation of late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> on the Kern Canyon fault and highlight its role in accommodating internal deformation of the southern Sierra Nevada...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree new tephra layers {{have been}} {{identified}} and analysed in the deeper sections of the EPICA Dome C (EDC) and Vostok ice record (East Antarctic plateau) : one from EDC (358 ka old), originated from an Antarctic volcano, and two from Vostok (406 and 414 ka old, respectively), which are related to Antarctic volcanoes and to southern Andes and/or Antarctic Peninsula centres, respectively. These layers represent the oldest tephra-bearing events so far detected in deep polar ice cores and extend the regional tephrostratigraphic framework back to the fourth climatic cycle. Although differences between the drill sites are observed, new and previously published tephra data from deep ice cores broadly confirm that the clockwise circum-Antarctic atmospheric circulation {{played a major role}} in the dispersal of volcanic dust onto the plateau. While the last 220 -ka core sections contain about a dozen visible tephra fall layers, the ice representing the time interval from 220 ka back to 800 ka (i. e. the EDC core bottom) is almost devoid of observed tephras. Although it is possible that the reduced frequency is an observational artefact, the observed pattern could alternatively reflect late <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> fluctuations of sources for tephra in the East Antarctic plateau, particularly South Sandwich Islands, with enhanced explosive activity in the last two glacial cycles with respect to previous periods...|$|R
40|$|Active fault {{databases}} are a {{very powerful}} and useful tool in seismic hazard assessment, particularly when singular faults are considered seismogenic sources. Active fault databases are also a very relevant source of information for earth scientists, earthquake engineers and even teachers or journalists. Hence, active fault databases should be updated and thoroughly reviewed {{on a regular basis}} in order to keep a standard quality and uniformed criteria. Desirably, active fault databases should somehow indicate the quality of the geological data and, particularly, the reliability attributed to crucial fault-seismic parameters, such as maximum magnitude and recurrence interval. In this paper we explain how we tackled these issues during the process of updating and reviewing the Quaternary Active Fault Database of Iberia (QAFI) to its current version  3. We devote particular attention to describing the scheme devised for classifying the quality and representativeness of the geological evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> and the accuracy of the slip rate estimation in the database. Subsequently, we use this information as input for a straightforward rating of the level of reliability of maximum magnitude and recurrence interval fault seismic parameters. We conclude that QAFI v. 3 is a much better database than version  2 either for proper use in seismic hazard applications or as an informative source for non-specialized users. However, we already envision new improvements for a future update...|$|R
40|$|Several major {{earthquakes}} {{have affected}} El Salvador, Central America, during the Past 100 yr {{as a consequence}} of oblique subduction of the Cocos plate under the Caribbean plate, which is partitioned between trench-orthogonal compression and strike-slip defor- mation parallel to the volcanic arc. Focal mechanisms and the distribution of the most destructive earthquakes, together with geomorphologic evidence, suggest that this trans- current component of motion may be accommodated by a major strike-slip fault (El Sal- vador fault zone). We present field geological, structural, and geomorphological data col- lected in central El Salvador that allow the constraint of the kinematics and the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> of this major seismogenic strike-slip fault system. Data suggest that the El Salvador fault zone consists of at least two main E-W fault segments (San Vicente and Berlin segments), with associated secondary synthetic (WNW-ESE) and antithetic (NNW-SSE) Riedel shears and NW-SE tensional structures. The two main fault segments overlap in a dextral en echelon style with the formation of an intervening pull-apart basin. Our original geological and geomorphologic data suggest a late Pleistocene–Holocene slip rate of 11 mm/yr along the Berlin segment, in contrast with low historical seismicity. The kinematics and rates of deformation suggested by our new data are consistent with models involving slip partitioning during oblique subduction, and support the notion that a trench-parallel component of motion between the Caribbean and Cocos plates is con- centrated along E-W dextral strike-slip faults parallel to the volcanic arc...|$|R
40|$|Foreland (early-orogenic) and {{hinterland}} (late-orogenic) extensional domains {{have been}} widely documented in the Northern Apennines, where they are synchronous with contraction in the active part of the fold and thrust belt. The progressive eastward migration of the contractional front and the associated hinterland extensional field implies that early-orogenic extensional structures, developed in the foreland domains, may experience reactivation/inversion. We present new field data, integrated with seismic evidence, from the Gubbio normal fault, a 22 km long presently active fault, showing: a) evidence for early-orogenic extension since the Lower Miocene time; b) successive positive inversion during the Upper Miocene contraction; and c) renewed, late-orogenic, extension during the Quaternary age. Field data allowed two systems of mesoscale normal faults, respectively interpreted as early- and late-orogenic structures, to be recognised. Stress fields associated with contractional and early- late-orogenic extensional tectonic regimes, are characterised by an overall coaxiality, with directions of compression and tension consistently aligned NE-SW. The symmetry between the successive deformation stages is interpreted as a likely cause for the repeated reactivation of the Gubbio fault since the Miocene. Our analysis in the Gubbio area shows that normal faults {{play a key role}} during the evolution of a fold and thrust belt from the early-orogenic stages, when they influence the geometry and evolution of foredeep basins, to the late-orogenic stages when <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity,</b> due to extension reactivation, controls the evolution of the intramountain basins...|$|R

In September 2008 the marine geophysical cruise EVENT-SHELF was carried out (Spanish RV Garcia del Cid). One of the main goals was to map the sub-seafloor active structures (faults and folds) of the offshore area of BSFZ using high-resolution seismics (Spaker GeoSpark 6 kJ) in order to characterize their <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity.</b> A total of 10 regional profiles were acquired along and across the BSFZ with 30 cm of resolution at 1. 5 km water depth with 400 m of penetration below seabed.

Moreover, these structures are active since they are deforming Quaternary units, in some locations the younger discontinuity (aprox. 20 ka) and, even, the seafloor. To characterize the seismogenic parameters of the active faults we have calculated the maximum magnitude earthquake and the recurrence interval of events using empirical relationships. Nevertheless, given the high resolution of the seismic profiles, it has been possible to perform a marine paleoseismological analysis allowing to identify individual seismic events and therefore obtain the time passed between specific. The active structures (faults and folds) described on the onshore Bajo Segura basin propagates towards the Mediterranean Sea from 10 to 60 km.

40|$|The Carrascoy Fault (CAF) {{is one of}} {{the main}} active faults that form part of the Eastern Betic Shear Zone, a 450 km fault system that {{accommodates}} most of the convergence between the Eurasian (Iberia) and Nubian plates in the Betic Cordillera, south Spain. Although the CAF represents a major earthquake threat to the nearby City of Murcia, studies on its Quaternary tectonics and seismogenic potential are scarce to date. We present evidence that supports the division of the CAF into two overlapping segments with contrasting tectonic structure, <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity,</b> and landform control: a SW segment, characterized by a broad fold-and-thrust zone similar to the forebergs defined in the Gobi-Altai region, and a NE segment, characterized by a sharp mountain front controlled by strike-slip tectonics. We attribute the differentiation into these two segments to the stresses associated with topography, which in turn is a consequence of the shortening component, at the middle Pleistocene, after circa 217. 4 ka. For the SW segment we infer the occurrence of 9 to 11, Mw 6. 7 paleoearthquakes in the last 30. 2 kyr, and a slip rate of 0. 37 ± 0. 08 m/kyr.

40|$|Site {{characterization}} of the potential nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, requires detailed knowledge of the displacement histories of nearby Quaternary faults. Ongoing paleoseismic studies provide data on the amount and rates of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> on the Paintbrush Canyon, Bow Ridge, and Stagecoach Road faults along the eastern margin of the mountain over varying time spans of 0 - 700 ka to perhaps 0 - 30 ka, depending on the site. Preliminary stratigraphic interpretations of deposits and deformation at many logged trenches and natural exposures indicate {{that each of these}} faults have experienced from 3 to 8 surface-rupturing earthquakes associated with variable dip-slip displacements per event ranging from 5 to 115 cm, and commonly in the range of 20 to 85 cm. Cumulative dip-slip offsets of units with broadly assigned ages of 100 - 200 ka are typically less than 200 cm, although accounting for the effects of possible left normal-oblique slip could increase these displacements by factors of 1. 1 to 1. 7. Current age constraints indicate recurrence intervals of 10 {sup 4 } to 10 {sup 5 } years (commonly between 30 and 80 k. y.) and slip rates of 0. 001 to 0. 08 mm/yr (typically 0. 01 - 0. 02 mm/yr).

The study area belongs to the Neogene-Quaternary front of the eastern Southern Alps: the Montello and the Cansiglio thrusts show much evidence of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>activity</b> and are considered seismic sources capable of destructive earthquakes. As a result of the 1936 earthquake, strong site effects became manifest in Ceneda and Serravalle, located respectively to the south and north of Vittorio Veneto. A geological and geomorphological survey enabled us to point out the surficial characteristics of the Vittorio Veneto basin, carved in the Tertiary Molasse. In order to characterize lithology and geometry of the Quaternary sediments and reconstruct the geometry of the bedrock-surface, about sixty borehole stratigraphies were analyzed. Bedrocksurface dips gently northwards: an effect of the tectonic activity of the Montello thrust. Maximum thickness of Quaternary sediments (more than 80 m) is located south of the Serravalle gorge. Three Quaternary sedimentary units have been recognised in the subsurface of the Vittorio Veneto basin: 1) a sandy-gravelly body (with maximum thickness of about 70 m) of alluvial and glacial origin that almost completely fills the Vittorio Veneto basin and contains an important aquifer; 2) thinner sedimentary bodies (with medium thickness about 10 - 15 m) that form the alluvial fans {{at the base of the}} reliefs and are composed of a close sequence of silts, muds and clays interbedded with thin gravelly levels; 3) finally in the Lapisina valley, north of Serravalle gorge, prevailing sands with lenses of lacustrine silts and peat deposits form a sedimentary body that locally reaches 20 - 30 m in thickness...|$|R
