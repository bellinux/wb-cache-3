25|$|Wine expert Jancis Robinson {{has noted}} that Chenin blanc is {{probably}} the world's most versatile grape, being able to produce <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> of various sweetness, including dessert wines noted for their aging ability, as well as sparkling made according to the méthode champenoise and fortified wines. The grape can distinguish itself as a single varietal wine, or it can add acidity as a blending component. Its ability to be crafted into premium <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> across {{a wide spectrum of}} dry and sweetness levels invites the comparison to German Rieslings, with Robinson noting that in many ways Chenin blanc is France's answer to the German Riesling.|$|E
25|$|Argentine winemakers {{have long}} held {{the belief that}} vines {{required}} hot and arid climates with large temperature variations to produce <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> This 'winning formula' led to a concentration of wineries in Mendoza, San Juan and La Rioja provinces in the west, as well as higher-altitude vineyards in Salta.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Montana in Marlborough started {{producing}} wines {{which were}} labelled by {{year of production}} (vintage) and grape variety (in the style of wine producers in Australia). The first production of a Sauvignon blanc of great note appears to have occurred in 1977. Also produced in that year were superior <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> of Muller Thurgau, Riesling and Pinotage.|$|E

25|$|Because of the northerly climate, {{there has}} been a search for {{suitable}} grape varieties (particularly frost resistant and early harvesting ones), and many crosses have been developed, such as Müller-Thurgau in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute.

25|$|Another {{promising}} {{region are}} the Sierras de Cordoba {{in the middle}} of the country. Contrasting with the humid temperate Pampas, mountainous areas have better drainage, cooler nights and sunny weather. Historically, wine was grown in two areas: the Northern part of the province around Colonia Caroya and the extreme Western part, around Villa Dolores. These are the warmest, sunniest parts of the province and, in the past, produced sweet, lower <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> (although new wineries are creating more interesting varietals).|$|E
25|$|Wine was a {{basic part}} of the Parisian diet, ranking with bread and meat. Fine wines arrived from Bordeaux, {{ordinary}} wines {{were brought to the}} city in large casks from Burgundy and Provence; lesser <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> came from vineyards just outside the city, in Montmartre and Belleville. Beer consumption was small, was only eight percent of that of wine, and cider only three percent. The most common strong alcoholic beverage was eau-de-vie, with as much as twenty-seven percent alcohol. It was most popular among the working class Parisians.|$|E

25|$|The Anjou {{region of}} the Middle Loire is {{situated}} around the town of Angers and is known primarily for the rosé wines based on the Grolleau and Cabernet franc, including the Rosé d'Anjou and the Cabernet d'Anjou. White wine made from the Chenin blanc is known as Anjou Blanc while Anjou Rouge is often made from Gamay. Some of the higher <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> are often labeled with the AOC designation Anjou-Villages. The Chenin blanc grape has been planted in the region since at least 845 AD when it was planted at the Abbey of Glanfeuil.

25|$|Political {{instability}} in the 20th century, coupled with bureaucratic regulations and high taxes tempered {{the growth of the}} Chilean wine industry. Prior to the 1980s, the vast majority of Chilean wine was considered low quality and mostly consumed domestically. As awareness of Chile's favorable growing conditions for viticulture increased so did foreign investment in Chilean wineries. This period saw many technical advances in winemaking as Chile earned a reputation for reasonably priced premium <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> Chile began to export extensively, becoming the third leading exporter, after France and Italy, into the United States {{by the turn of the}} 21st century. It has since dropped to fourth in the US, being surpassed by Australia, but focus has switched to developing exports in the world's other major wine markets like the United Kingdom and Japan.|$|E

25|$|Sicily is {{the third}} largest wine {{producer}} in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The region is known mainly for fortified Marsala wines. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varietals, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local varietal is Nero d'Avola, named for a small town not far from Syracuse; the best wines made with these grapes come from Noto, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varietals are Nerello Mascalese {{used to make the}} Etna Rosso DOC wine, Frappato that is a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine, Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as Zibibbo) used to make different Pantelleria wines, Malvasia di Lipari used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine and Catarratto mostly used to make the white wine Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily high <b>quality</b> <b>wines</b> are also produced using non-native varietals like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.|$|E
25|$|In California, the {{influence}} of Italian immigrants in {{the early history of}} the state's wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo (as well as other Italian grape varieties) steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim for producing higher <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> there has been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are {{still trying to figure out}} which sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, the Amarone wines of Valpolicella {{experienced}} {{a spike in}} popularity on the world's wine market. Production of Amarone jumped from 522,320 US gallons (19,772 hectoliters) in 1972 to 1.2 million gallons (46,500 hl) by 1990. By 2000 Amarone production grew to over 3.9 million (148,000 hl). By this point, the price for grapes destined for Amarone production was nearly three times higher than what a comparable quantity of grapes would fetch for basic Valpolicella production. This sparked renewed interest in planting vineyards in the high altitude hillside locations that produced lower yields of grapes better suited for Amarone production. In the 21st century, the reputation of Valpolicella wines continued to expand on the world's wine market, as ambitious winemakers began to invest more in advanced viticultural and winemaking techniques that produce higher <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> In 2003, the DOC regulations were adjusted to eliminate mandatory blending requirements for sub-quality grapes such as Molinara. At the end of 2009, the production of both Amarone and recioto dessert wines in the Valpolicella zone received Italy's highest quality wine designation as a DOCG zones.|$|E

500|$|Riesling {{is a white}} grape variety which {{originated}} in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, semi-sweet, sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling {{was estimated to be}} the world's 20th most grown variety at [...] (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for <b>quality</b> <b>wines,</b> it is usually included in the [...] "top three" [...] white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc.

2500|$|With {{the export}} of wine during the 17th and 18th century, {{vineyards}} began to extend along the Douro River valley bringing a mature level of economic growth.

2500|$|Cabernet Franc is {{believed}} to have been established in the Libournais region of southwest France sometime in the 17th century, when Cardinal Richelieu transported cuttings of the vine to the Loire Valley. [...] They were planted at the Abbey of Bourgueil under the care of an abbot named Breton, whose name became associated with the grape. By the 18th century, plantings of Cabernet Franc (known as Bouchet) were found throughout Fronsac, Pomerol and St-Emilion, making <b>quality</b> <b>wines.</b> As Cabernet Sauvignon grew more popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the close similarity of the two grapes was observed and theories emerged as to the extent of their relationship. In 1997, DNA evidence emerged to show that Cabernet Franc had crossed with Sauvignon blanc to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.|$|E

40|$|Italian wine {{firms are}} facing a {{significant}} reduction in wine consumption and increasing competition in international markets. In fact, markets are becoming increasingly liberalized and producers of non-EU countries adopt even more aggressive strategies to increase their competitiveness. Nevertheless, demand for high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> which includes a large number of Italian wines, is increasing. The aim of this work is to explain the magnitude of the trade flows for high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> from Italy to its main importing countries. This objective has been reached by establishing an appropriate econometric model derived from an extended form of the Gravity Model. This model has been broadly applied to the analysis of international trade because it provides robust estimates. Note that applications to the specific products trade are still limited in number. The results obtained and the model itself are useful in forecasting potential trends in the exportation of high <b>quality</b> Italian <b>wines.</b> Moreover, it is possible to identify the growing markets where Italian ventures could exploit certain promotional and communication strategies. Finally, with respect to Italian high <b>quality</b> <b>wine</b> these estimates give a quantitative evaluation of the export gains that could result from the enlargement of the EU and from an increasing liberalization in international trade.
