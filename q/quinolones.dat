5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, <b>quinolones,</b> and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the <b>quinolones,</b> linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
25|$|Resistance to <b>quinolones</b> can evolve rapidly, {{even during}} {{a course of}} treatment. Numerous pathogens, {{including}} Escherichia coli, commonly exhibit resistance. Widespread veterinary usage of <b>quinolones,</b> in particular in Europe, has been implicated.|$|E
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{sparfloxacin}} uptake {{was higher than}} that of norfloxacin uptake in Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, energy-dependent reduction in <b>quinolone</b> uptake, probably due to active efflux of the <b>quinolone,</b> was observed. The reduction in <b>quinolone</b> uptake appeared to be associated with <b>quinolone</b> resistance in S. aureus...|$|R
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and convenient method for <b>quinolone</b> determination has been developed, {{based on the}} natural fluorescence of the <b>quinolone</b> nucleus. Fleroxacin (Ro 23 - 6240; AM 833), used as a prototype <b>quinolone</b> in these studies, had an excitation maximum at 282 nm and an admission maximum at 442 nm (pH 3. 0). Fluorescence intensity was pH dependent, being maximal at pH 3. 0 and linear at <b>quinolone</b> concentrations between 1 and 200 ng/ml. A protocol for the fluorometric monitoring of fleroxacin uptake in Escherichia coli was developed. Intracellular <b>quinolone</b> concentrations measured by the fluorometric assay correlated well with values obtained by the bioassay. The {{results indicate that the}} fluorometric assay is an attractive alternative to the more laborious bioassay...|$|R
40|$|The <b>quinolone</b> {{antibiotics}} are potent {{drugs for}} combating infections caused by various bacterial species with satisfactory results and relatively minimal adverse effects. Antioxidant dietary supplements, such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin E (a-tocopherol), are occasionally prescribed along with <b>quinolone</b> antibiotics {{during the course}} of treatment of an infection. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the effects of these antioxidants on the antibacterial action of <b>quinolone</b> antibiotics...|$|R
25|$|<b>Quinolones</b> exert their {{antibacterial}} {{effect by}} preventing bacterial DNA from unwinding and duplicating. The majority of <b>quinolones</b> in clinical use are fluoroquinolones, {{which have a}} fluorine atom attached to the central ring system, typically at the 6-position or C-7 position. Most of them are named with the -oxacin suffix.|$|E
25|$|Three {{mechanisms}} of resistance are known. Some types of efflux pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration. In gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that {{can bind to}} DNA gyrase, protecting it from the action of <b>quinolones.</b> Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV can decrease their binding affinity to <b>quinolones,</b> decreasing the drugs' effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quinolones</b> {{have been}} widely used in animal husbandry, and several agents have veterinary-specific applications.|$|E
5000|$|Ozenoxacin is an {{experimental}} <b>quinolone</b> antibiotic being {{developed for the}} treatment of impetigo and other dermatological bacterial infections. [...] Ozenoxacin is active against some bacteria that have developed resistance to currently used <b>quinolone</b> and fluoroquinolone antibiotics.|$|R
40|$|The Escherichia coli gyrase A gene was cloned in the broad-host-range cosmid vector pLA 2917. The {{resulting}} plasmid, pNJR 3 - 2, conferred <b>quinolone</b> susceptibility on a gyrA mutant of E. coli. To {{analyze the}} expression of this E. coli gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pNJR 3 - 2 or pLA 2917 was mobilized via conjugation into P. aeruginosa PAO 2 and several well-characterized quinolone-resistant mutants of this strain. The vector pLA 2917 did not significantly affect the <b>quinolone</b> susceptibilities {{of any of the}} P. aeruginosa strains. However, pNJR 3 - 2 conferred wild-type <b>quinolone</b> susceptibility on P. aeruginosa cfxA (gyrA) mutants and intermediate <b>quinolone</b> susceptibility on cfxA-cfxB double mutants of P. aeruginosa. The <b>quinolone</b> susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO 2 gyrA+ was unaffected by pNJR 3 - 2. Also, pNJR 3 - 2 had no significant effect on P. aeruginosa cfxB (permeability) mutants. These results demonstrate that the DNA gyrase A gene from E. coli is expressed in P. aeruginosa and confers dominant susceptibility on gyrA mutants. Thus, pNJR 3 - 2 can be used to detect the <b>quinolone</b> resistance mutations that occur in the gyrase A gene of this organism. pNJR 3 - 2 also appears to discriminate between mutations in gyrA and mutations which alter permeability. This gyrase A probe was used successfully in the analysis of <b>quinolone</b> resistance in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa...|$|R
40|$|The plasmid-encoded <b>quinolone</b> {{resistance}} gene qnrA confers low-level <b>quinolone</b> resistance, facilitating {{selection of}} higher-level resistance. Epidemiologic surveys for qnrA were extended to isolates of Enterobacter spp. and to quinolone-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Two (10 %) of 20 ceftazidime-resistant quinolone-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae strains carried the gene, as did 12 (17 %) of 71 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter strains {{from across the}} United States. One of these Enterobacter isolates was <b>quinolone</b> susceptible. Thus, qnrA is present in quinolone-resistant and quinolone-susceptible Enterobacter and Klebsiella strains in the United States...|$|R
25|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of drugs that}} are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 system is enhanced by concomitant use of some <b>quinolones.</b> <b>Quinolones,</b> including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.|$|E
25|$|Erythromycin {{can be used}} in children, and {{tetracycline}} in adults. Some studies show, however, that erythromycin rapidly eliminates Campylobacter {{from the}} stool without affecting the duration of illness. Nevertheless, children with dysentery due to C. jejuni benefit from early treatment with erythromycin. Treatment with antibiotics, therefore, depends on the severity of symptoms. <b>Quinolones</b> are effective if the organism is sensitive, but high rates of quinolone use in livestock means that <b>quinolones</b> are now largely ineffective.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quinolones</b> can be {{classified}} into generations based on their antibacterial spectrum. The earlier-generation agents are, in general, more narrow-spectrum than the later ones, {{but there is no}} standard employed to determine which drug belongs to which generation. The only universal standard applied is the grouping of the non-fluorinated drugs found within this class (<b>quinolones)</b> within the first-generation heading. As such, there exists a wide variation within the literature dependent upon the methods employed by the authors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{cytochrome}} P 450 RauA from Rhodococcus erythropolis JCM 6824 catalyzes the hydroxylation of a nitrogen atom in the <b>quinolone</b> ring of aurachin, thereby conferring strong antibiotic {{activity on}} the aurachin alkaloid. Here, we report the crystal structure of RauA in complex with its substrate, a biosynthetic intermediate of aurachin RE. Clear electron density showed that the <b>quinolone</b> ring is oriented parallel to the porphyrin plane of the heme cofactor, while the farnesyl chain curls into a U-shape topology and is buried inside the solvent-inaccessible hydrophobic interior of RauA. The nearest atom from the heme iron is the <b>quinolone</b> nitrogen (4. 3 Å), {{which is consistent with}} RauA catalyzing the N-hydroxylation of the <b>quinolone</b> ring to produce mature aurachin RE...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare <b>quinolone</b> resistance and gyrA mutations in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli from Chinese adults who used <b>quinolone</b> in the preceding month and children without any known history of <b>quinolone</b> administration. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of 61 isolates from children and 79 isolates from adults were determined. The mutations in the <b>quinolone</b> resistance-determining regions in gyrA gene were detected by PCR and DNA sequencing. Fluoroquinolone resistance and types of gyrA mutations in isolates from children and adults were compared and statistically analyzed. No significant differences were detected in the resistance rates of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin between children and adults among isolates of the two species (all P> 0. 05). The double mutation Ser 83 →Leu + Asp 87 →Asn in the ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates occurred in 73. 7 % isolates from the children and 67. 9 % from the adults, respectively (P= 0. 5444). Children with no known history of <b>quinolone</b> administration were found to carry fluoroquinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. The occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance and the major types of gyrA mutations in the isolates from the children were similar to those from adults. The results indicate that precautions should be taken on environmental issues resulting from widespread transmission of <b>quinolone</b> resistance...|$|R
25|$|Administration of {{quinolone}} antibiotics to a benzodiazepine dependent {{individual can}} precipitate acute benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms due to <b>quinolones</b> displacing benzodiazepines from their binding site.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} {{administration of}} <b>quinolones</b> including norfloxacin with glyburide (a sulfonylurea agent) has, on rare occasions, resulted in severe hypoglycemia. Therefore, monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quinolones</b> are {{contraindicated}} if {{a patient}} has epilepsy, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or the patient has suffered a stroke. They are best avoided in the athlete population. Safety concerns exist for fluoroquinolone use during pregnancy, so they are contraindicated unless no other safe alternative antibiotic exists. However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Their use in children is not absolutely contraindicated, however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use can be justified. <b>Quinolones</b> should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} a <b>quinolone,</b> nalidixic acid {{is considered the}} first <b>quinolone</b> drug. It was introduced in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a distillate during an attempt at chloroquine synthesis. Nalidixic acid is thus {{considered to be the}} predecessor of all members of the <b>quinolone</b> family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. Since the introduction of nalidixic acid in 1962, more than 10,000 analogs have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice. The first generation also included other <b>quinolone</b> drugs, such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid.|$|R
40|$|<b>Quinolone</b> derivative, {{particularly}} fluoroquinolones {{are important}} synthetic antimicrobial agents. Currently some <b>quinolone</b> derivatives are {{under investigation for}} the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensive drug resistance tuberculosis (XDR-TB), and are under investigation as first-line anti-TB drugs. The main biological objective in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the DNA gyrase, a topoisomerase II encoded by gyrA and gyrB that is necessary to retain the DNA supercoil. Mutations in short regions of DNA gyrase are associated with <b>quinolone</b> resistance and take place in several MDR clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The new <b>quinolone</b> derivatives, isoniazid-fluoroquinolones and triazoloquinolone derivatives are representatives of a new class of potent and selective anti-TB agents. The esters of triazoloquinolone derivatives are with absence of cytotoxicity. Furthermore, they are particularly interesting is their activity against MDR-TB and XDR-TB...|$|R

25|$|The basic pharmacophore, or active structure, of the {{fluoroquinolone}} {{class is}} based upon the quinoline ring system. The addition of the fluorine atom at C6 distinguishes the successive-generation fluoroquinolones from the first-generation of <b>quinolones.</b> The addition of the C6 fluorine atom has since been demonstrated not to be required for the antibacterial activity of this class (circa 1997).|$|E
25|$|The basic pharmacophore, or active structure, of the {{fluoroquinolone}} {{class is}} based upon the quinoline ring system. Various substitutions made to the quinoline ring resulted in the development of numerous fluoroquinolone drugs.

25|$|Some <b>quinolones</b> exert an {{inhibitory}} {{effect on the}} cytochrome P-450 system, thereby reducing theophylline clearance and increasing theophylline blood levels. Coadministration of certain fluoroquinolones and other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g. theophylline, methylxanthines, tizanidine) results in increased plasma concentrations and could lead to clinically significant side effects of the coadministered drug. Additionally other fluoroquinolones, especially enoxacin, {{and to a lesser}} extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, also inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophylline.|$|E
25|$|Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} that {{is active}} against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all <b>quinolones,</b> it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV {{is necessary to}} separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, {{so that it will}} fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quinolones</b> are {{associated}} with a small risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture; a 2013 review found the incidence of tendon injury among those taking fluoroquinolones to be between 0.08 and 0.2%. The risk appears to be higher among people older than 60 and those also taking corticosteroids; there may also be higher risk among people who are male, have a pre-existing joint or tendon issue, have kidney disease, and are highly active. Some experts have advised avoidance of fluoroquinolones in athletes. If tendonitis occurs, it generally appears within one month, and the most common tendon that is injured appears to be the Achilles tendon. The cause is not well understood.|$|E
