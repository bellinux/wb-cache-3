5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside.

But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to the status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> northern Italy.|$|E

5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously been encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} with the status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of}} a change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Aleutian Islands played little {{part in the}} {{proceedings}} of World War I, as the events of this war were concentrated in Europe. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the United States, the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy. Article XIX of the Treaty required Japan, Britain and the United States {{to maintain the status}} <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> terms of military fortifications in their respective Pacific Rim territories. While Japan and Britain gained a number of exemptions from the terms of Article XIX (for example, Australia and New Zealand were not prevented from building up their fortifications {{as a result of the}} Treaty), Japan made it a requirement of their agreement to the Treaty that the Aleutian Islands were not to be exempted.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that the status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
5|$|With the Zanj subdued, after 883 al-Muwaffaq {{turned his}} {{attention}} again to the east. Ya'qub al-Saffar's brother and successor, Amr ibn al-Layth, had acknowledged the Caliph's suzerainty and had been rewarded with the governorship over the eastern provinces and the position of sahib al-shurta of Baghdad—essentially the same posts the Tahirids had held—in exchange for an annual tribute, but soon {{he was having trouble}} asserting his authority, especially in Khurasan, where Rafi ibn Harthama emerged {{as the leader of the}} former Tahirid troops. In 884/885, Amr was formally deprived of his governorship of Khurasan in favour of the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz, and the army under the vizier Sa'id ibn Makhlad conquered most of the province of Fars, forcing Amr himself to come west. After initial success against the general Tark ibn al-Abbas, Amr was routed by Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz in 886, and again in 887 by al-Muwaffaq in person. Nevertheless, the threat by the Tulunids and the Byzantines in the west forced al-Muwaffaq to negotiate a settlement in 888/889 that largely restored the previous status <b>quo.</b> <b>In</b> 890, al-Muwaffaq again attempted to take back Fars, but this time Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz was defeated, and another agreement restored peace and Amr's titles and possessions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the legions}} under Flamininus had {{returned}} to Italy, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of Macedon, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the praetor Atilius with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy {{as well as an}} embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead of waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to pieces in the first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean strategus Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept the status <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.|$|E
