For HK, HT, HG and HQ the Holden Monaro carried the ID plate luxury level coding for a Kingswood but never wore Kingswood badges as a production car. HQ-HJ Monaro LS and HQ Monaro LS V8 shared luxury level coding with their respective Premier but also never wore Premier badges. HK-HJ Monaro GTS coupe, HJ Monaro GTS sedan, HT-HQ Monaro GTS V8 coupe and Monaro GTS327/350 coupe (HK-HQ) carried unique luxury level coding. HQ Monaro GTS sedan and HQ Monaro GTS350 sedan shared Kingswood luxury level coding with later examples actually displaying the GTS coupe's <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> on the VIN plate but still retaining the HQ V8 Kingswood's 80469 model coding {{on the body}} plate. The Brougham was replaced in 1971 by the Statesman brand, based upon the station wagon chassis of the then new HQ series.

2500|$|Radiotelegraphy using Morse code, {{also known}} as [...] "CW" [...] from [...] "continuous wave", is the {{wireless}} extension of landline (wired) telegraphy developed by Samuel Morse and dates to {{the earliest days of}} radio. Although computer-based (digital) modes and methods have largely replaced CW for commercial and military applications, many amateur radio operators still enjoy using the CW mode—particularly on the shortwave bands and for experimental work, such as earth-moon-earth communication, because of its inherent signal-to-noise ratio advantages. Morse, using internationally agreed message encodings such as the <b>Q</b> <b>code,</b> enables communication between amateurs who speak different languages. It is also popular with homebrewers and in particular with [...] "QRP" [...] or very-low-power enthusiasts, as CW-only transmitters are simpler to construct, and the human ear-brain signal processing system can pull weak CW signals out of the noise where voice signals would be totally inaudible. A similar [...] "legacy" [...] mode popular with home constructors is amplitude modulation (AM), pursued by many vintage amateur radio enthusiasts and aficionados of vacuum tube technology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Q</b> <b>code</b> and prosigns for Morse code {{are used}} in amateur radio, {{aviation}} and marine radio. They provide specific abbreviations for concepts related to aviation, shipping, RTTY, radiotelegraph and amateur radio. In radiotelegraph operation, a <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> is often shorter (as ten-codes require transmission of three prefix characters: 1, 0, hyphen) and provides standardization of codes, essential in international and shortwave communications.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> {{are also}} used in aviation, in {{particular}} QNE, QNH and QFE, referring to certain altimeter settings. These codes are used in radiotelephone conversations with air traffic control as unambiguous shorthand, where safety and efficiency are of vital importance. A subset of <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> {{is used by the}} Miami-Dade County, Florida local government for law enforcement and fire rescue communications, one of the few instances where <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> are used in ground voice communication.|$|R
50|$|The Great <b>Qing</b> Legal <b>Code</b> (or Great Ching Legal Code), {{also known}} as the <b>Qing</b> <b>Code</b> (Ching Code) or, in Hong Kong law, as the Ta Tsing Leu Lee (大清律例), was the legal <b>code</b> of the <b>Qing</b> empire (1644-1912). The code was based on the Ming legal system, which was kept largely intact. Compared to the Ming code which had no more than several hundred {{statutes}} and sub-statutes, the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> contained 1,907 statutes from over 30 times of revisions between 1644 and 1912.|$|R

The <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> facilitated communication between maritime radio operators speaking different languages, so they were soon adopted internationally. A total of forty-five <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> appeared in the [...] "List of Abbreviations to be used in Radio Communications", which was included in the Service Regulations affixed to the Third International Radiotelegraph Convention in London (The Convention was signed on July 5, 1912, and became effective July 1, 1913.) ...|$|R

A <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> message can stand for a {{statement}} or a question (when the code is followed by a question mark). In this case, 'QSL?' (note the question mark) means [...] "Do you confirm receipt of my transmission?" [...] while 'QSL' (without a question mark) means [...] "I confirm receipt of your transmission.".|$|E

5000|$|The {{term has}} {{its origins in}} the <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> used for {{commercial}} radiotelegraph communication, and later adopted by other radio services, especially amateur radio. The first number {{is the answer to}} the question [...] "How do you receive me?" [...] (<b>Q</b> <b>code</b> QRK), typically answered with [...] "I am receiving (1-5)" [...] where 1 is unreadable and 5 is perfect. The second number is {{the answer to the question}} [...] "What is the strength of my signals?" [...] (<b>Q</b> <b>code</b> QSA), typically answered with [...] "The strength of your signals is ... (1 to 5).". [...] "5 by 5" [...] was the answer to the QRK/QSA questions to indicate the best quality signal. [...] "5 by 5" [...] being the best quality was applied to other things by analogy.|$|E
40|$|The Great <b>Qing</b> <b>Code</b> (大清律例, Da <b>Qing</b> lü li or Ta Tsing Leu Lee) {{was drafted}} in 1646, but {{abolished}} {{along with the}} end of Qing dynasty in 1912. This gigantic legislative work spanned over two centuries and ruled millions of people. As a fundamental comprehensive criminal <b>code</b> of <b>Qing</b> dynasty (1644 - 1912) and the last traditional legal code in Chinese history, literally, the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> offers us a very broad view on the traditional Chinese law. It is an extraordinary monument for legal historians to penetrate and comprehend Chinese traditional ways of understanding law, justice and punishment. Its 436 statutes (律, lü) and over 1, 000 sub-statutes (例, li) form an intricate body of rules, analogies, exceptions, annotations and cases. Furthermore, a very strong continuity can be found between the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> and the Tang code (唐律, Tang lü) promulgated in the seventh century since about 40 per cent articles of the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> was derived from the Tang code. This essay focuses on the formation, the distinctive character, the basic structure, the diffusion and the reform of the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> from historical and comparative perspectives...|$|R

5000|$|Used {{in their}} formal [...] "question/answer" [...] sense, {{the meaning of}} a <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> varies {{depending}} on whether the individual <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> is sent as a question or an answer. For example, the message [...] "QRP?" [...] means [...] "Shall I decrease transmitter power?", and a reply of [...] "QRP" [...] means [...] "Yes, decrease your transmitter power", whereas an unprompted statement [...] "QRP" [...] means [...] "Please decrease your transmitter power". This structured use of Q codes is fairly rare and now mainly limited to amateur radio and military Morse code (CW) traffic networks.|$|E
50|$|Q {{signals are}} no longer {{substantially}} used in the maritime service. Morse code is now very rarely used for maritime communications, but in isolated maritime regions like Antarctica and the South Pacific the use of <b>Q</b> <b>Codes</b> continues. <b>Q</b> <b>Codes</b> still work when HF voice circuits are not possible due to atmospherics and the nearest vessel is one ionospheric hop away.|$|R

40|$|The Chinese clan is {{a patriarchal}} one, and the {{traditional}} law and ethic of China are to safeguard the patriarchal society as such. As a traditional code of laws, the <b>Qing</b> <b>Code</b> (Ta Ching Lu Li) definitely defends the moral value of the concepts of 'loyalty' and 'filial piety' because the greatest beneficiaries of 'loyalty' and 'filial piety' are 'monarch' and 'patriarch' - the highest leader in politics and a clan.

5000|$|Many {{users and}} experimenters have settled on {{extremely}} slow, computer-generated and displayed Morse code {{as the most}} common transmission mode. This mode is known as QRSS, where the doubling of the ‘S’ emphasises the extreme slowness. (The international <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> QRS means “Please send more slowly”, or “slow Morse” in radio jargon.) ...|$|E
5000|$|QRSS {{refers to}} {{transmitting}} extremely slowly. Some extreme QRP enthusiasts use QRSS {{to compensate for}} the decreased signal-to-noise ratio involved in QRP operation. QRSS derives from the standard <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> used in radio communications, where [...] "QRS?" [...] asks [...] "Shall I send more slowly?" [...] and [...] "QRS" [...] requests [...] "Send more slowly".|$|E
5000|$|The {{abbreviation}} QNH originates {{from the}} days when voice modulated radio was often difficult to receive, and communication was done by Morse Code. To avoid the need for long Morse transmissions, many of the most commonly used communications were incorporated into a <b>Q</b> <b>code.</b> To ask for atmospheric pressure at sea-level (i.e., at zero altitude) the letters 'QNH' would be transmitted.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> was {{the last}} legal code of {{imperial}} China. By the end of Qing dynasty, {{it was the only}} legal code enforced in China for nearly 270 years. Even with the fall of imperial Qing in 1912, the Confucian philosophy of social control enshrined in the <b>Qing</b> <b>code</b> remain influential in the German-based system of the Republic of China, and later, the Soviet-based system of the People's Republic of China.|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} the {{original}} <b>Q</b> <b>codes</b> were modified to reflect changes in radio practice. For example, QSW/QSX originally stood for, [...] "Shall I increase/decrease my spark frequency?", but in the 1920s, spark-gap transmitters were banned in the United States, rendering that meaning obsolete. By the 1970s, the Post Office Handbook for Radio Operators listed over a hundred <b>Q</b> <b>codes,</b> covering {{a wide range of}} subjects including radio procedures, meteorology, radio direction finding, and search and rescue.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{a larger}} set of <b>Q</b> <b>Codes</b> {{designated}} by the ITU-R, the QOA-QQZ code range is reserved for the Maritime Mobile Service.|$|R
5000|$|In amateur radio, QRP {{operation}} {{refers to}} transmitting at reduced power {{while attempting to}} maximize one's effective range. The term QRP derives from the standard <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> used in radio communications, where [...] "QRP" [...] and [...] "QRP?" [...] are used to request, [...] "Reduce power", and ask [...] "Should I reduce power?" [...] respectively. The opposite of QRP is QRO, or high-power operation.|$|E
50|$|The letters I, J and X are not {{currently}} {{used as the}} first letter of any ICAO identifier. In Russia and CIS, Latin letter X (or its Morse/Baudot Cyrillic equivalent Ь) is used to designate government, military and experimental aviation airfields in internal airfield codes similar in structure and purpose to ICAO codes but not used internationally. Q is reserved for international radiocommunications and other non-geographical special uses (see <b>Q</b> <b>code).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Selected Q codes {{were soon}} adopted by amateur radio operators. In December 1915, the American Radio Relay League began {{publication}} of a magazine titled QST, named after the <b>Q</b> <b>code</b> for [...] "General call to all stations". In amateur radio, the Q codes were originally used in Morse code transmissions to shorten lengthy phrases and were followed by a Morse code question mark (··— —··) if the phrase was a question.|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong was ceded (in {{case of the}} New Territories, leased) to the United Kingdom by Qing dynasty China {{through a}} series of treaties, {{starting}} with the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. As a ceded or leased territory with its own set of laws, the Great <b>Qing</b> Legal <b>Code</b> remained in force for the local Chinese population. Until the end of the 19th century, a Chinese man convicted of murder would be executed by decapitation, while an Englishman convicted of the same crime would be sentenced to death by hanging. It was not until 1971, nearly six decades {{after the fall of the}} Qing dynasty, that the last of the <b>Qing</b> <b>Code</b> was abolished in Hong Kong. Even then, some vestiges of it remain. For example, before the Marriage Reform Ordinance 1970 (Cap.178) came into force on 7 October 1971, a man could practice polygamy by virtue of the <b>Qing</b> <b>Code.</b> The courts still refer to the <b>Qing</b> <b>Code</b> regarding the inheritance rights of surviving concubines married before 1971 and that of their children.|$|R
50|$|The Great <b>Qing</b> Legal <b>Code</b> was {{the first}} written Chinese work {{directly}} translated into English.
