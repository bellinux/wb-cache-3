However, experts have reasoned that the quantity of resources {{is as important as the}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>spending.</b> If resources are allocated efficiently, more could be achieved with the same resources. Ensuring an effective strategy and basis for prioritising crop research investments so as to improve productivity is a major challenge in Zambia and other African countries. This study investigates the economic returns of investment in crop research and sets priorities for research investment using the Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (DREAM) model. The findings show that maize, soya beans, groundnuts, cotton, millet, sunflower and sorghum are the crops that should receive priority in terms of funding for research under the efficiency objective. However, the study showed that the allocation of financial resources towards crop research in Zambia is not aligned with the social and economic returns of that investment. Nonetheless, positive returns from crop research investments were obtained, which suggests that investing in crop research is worthwhile but that attention needs to be paid to the appropriate research priorities. This is critical for improved competitiveness in Zambian agriculture. The study recommends further investment in and robust prioritisation of crop research, complemented by improved infrastructure, institutions and markets for a thriving agricultural sector.

40|$|India, home to {{more than}} one billion people, has {{experienced}} rapid growth over the past decade, averaging about six percent per year between 1992 / 93 and 2003 / 04. The agenda backed in this report is one that receives widespread support from both the central and state governments in India. The fiscal stress of the late nineties gave rise to an intense state-level reform effort. Six years on, this report documents the many initiatives undertaken by the states to restore fiscal sustainability, and become more effective agents of development. It outlines successes, lessons learnt, and highlights further challenges, on both the expenditure side (chapter two) and the revenue side (chapter three). It also looks at the incentive framework within which the states operate (chapter four), and asks whether there is a feasible reform package that will take the states not only out of fiscal crisis, but strengthened to meet the development challenges which confront them. This chapter provides the context for what follows by outlining the role and increasingly divergent performance of the state governments (section two), and then in turn, the genesis of the fiscal crisis (section three), its developmental impact (section four), the reform response of the state and central governments (section five), and the reform challenges facing the states today (section six). Although associated with an increase in public spending, the fiscal crisis weakened the developmental and poverty impact of state governments, especially in the poorer states; it also called into question India's overall fiscal sustainability. This report is written to help share the lessons and success-stories to date, and to assist states and the central government in implementing the national agenda of state-level fiscal stabilization and empowerment. Given the low levels and the worrying recent trends in both the quantity of expenditure in priority expenditure areas, and the quality of expenditure across the board, there is an urgent need for expenditure restructuring to free up fiscal resources and for reforms to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>spending.</b> Focus in this chapter on areas where expenditure can be cut rather than where it should be increased is not because we think there are no areas of underfunding.

40|$|Indonesia {{has made}} a clear {{commitment}} to education - passing a constitutional mandate to allocate at least 20 {{percent of the total}} government budget to education (the " 20 percent rule"). This has led to a large increase in resources, more than doubling education spending in real terms since the passage of the constitutional amendment in 2002. The rule's mandate was fully {{met for the first time}} in 2009, when the government allocated more than 20 percent of the state budget to education. The goal of this report is to understand how these additional resources were spent and the extent to which they have translated into educational outcomes. The report provides recommendations to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>spending</b> by improving the education financing system. The" 20 percent rule" has resulted in a rapid increase in the education budget, but has also complicated budget management. One of the biggest drawbacks of the 20 percent rule isthat earmarking funds reduces the incentives to optimize their use. The link between policy planning and resources isbroken; large exogenous increases to the budget (regardless of results and independent of planning) can create inefficiencies in spending. Earmarking funds also creates rigidities in the budget and limits the capacity of the government to optimize the allocation of resources across sectors. Lastly, because the rule applies to both the planned and the revised budgets, it makes the education budget unpredictable and creates large budget "windfalls": with the budget highly dependent on the price of oil due to fuel subsidies, every adjustment to oil prices results in large fluctuations in total government spending. These windfalls have proven difficult to manage, despite Government of Indonesia (GOI) 's creation of the National Education Development Fund. The biggest payoff for this increase in spending has been in terms of access and equity, but access to senior secondary and tertiary education still remains extremely low for the poor. There has been rapid progress in access and equity, with children from poor families enrolling earlier and staying in school longer. The share of 15 year olds from the poorest consumption quintile who are enrolled in school increased from 60 to 80 percent between 2006 and 2010. However, beyond the age of 15, enrollment from this quintile drops dramatically, and by higher education, falls to less than 2 percent. Learning outcomes are still poor and show some worrisome trends in math and science. Meanwhile, the share of top performers is extremely low. Indonesia generally scores on the bottom on international tests (TIMMS, PIRLS and PISA), including compared with other countries in the region. On the PISA, the test with the most recent result and the longest time trend, the scores are mixed: while reading scores have shown steady improvement since 2000, math and science scores have not. In math, a promising increase in scores between 2000 and 2006 was set back in 2009, when scores declined for all socioeconomic deciles. In science, the trend has been flat since 2000. Equally alarming isthe small number of top performers on both the TIMSS and the PIRLS, while on PISA, no student in the sample performed at level 6 (the highest) in math or science in 2009. Given recent evidence linking PISA scores and the share of top performers with GDP growth, it isevident that increasing quality of education must be apriority...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 {{national}} {{heads of}} African states, including Zambia, met in Maputo and pledged to increase {{financial resources to}} the agriculture sector, up to 10 % of their national budgets, {{in order to meet}} growth targets. Given the need to increase investments in agriculture, it follows that impact assessment studies have become handy as funding agencies demand better accountability and empirical justification for further investment. However, experts have reasoned that the quantity of resources {{is as important as the}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>spending</b> in that, if resources are allocated efficiently, more could be achieved with the same level of resources. The lack of an effective strategy and basis upon which investments in agriculture crop research ought to be prioritised in order to improve agricultural productivity is the main concern in Zambia. This study sought to illustrate the use of the Dynamic Research Evaluation for Management (DREAM) model to assess the economic returns of investing in agriculture technologies and to set priorities for crop-based research activities in Zambia. The study hypothesised that the financial outlay allocated to agricultural crop research is not efficiently allocated so as to achieve the nation’s agricultural production potential, and that agricultural crop research investment influences the distribution of welfare effects on producers and consumers. The DREAM model is conceptually based on the economic surplus theory and is designed for research priority setting and ex ante evaluations. It computes the net present value (NPV) of benefits for both producers and consumers as a result of investing in agriculture technology. The findings from this study reveal that investment in agriculture crop research in Zambia is worthwhile as positive net present values were obtained for all crops under consideration in this study. Maize research gives the highest return to both large-scale and smallholder producers. Maize also yielded the highest returns for consumers in Zambia. In order of priority, maize is followed by soya bean, groundnuts, cotton, millet, sunflower and sorghum. In spite of this, the order of priority in terms of financial expenditure on crop research is maize, cotton, sorghum, soya bean, groundnuts, sunflower and millet. Therefore, the allocation of financial resources towards crop research is not efficient for all crops except maize since some crops such as sorghum receiving high financial expenditure in research did not necessarily generate high returns. This is because the Government still conducts the bulk of research in Zambia, and as such, other social objectives such as equity and food security considerations play a major role in determining investment patterns. The study further establishes that the choice of crop research expenditure influences the distribution of welfare benefits on different producer groups; and that smallholder farmers in Central, Eastern and Southern province are among the group that received the highest proportion of benefits even for crops such as maize for which financial resources were efficiently allocated. Therefore, the efficiency objective may not necessarily leave smallholder farmers worse off as long as they have access to complementary infrastructure and institutions for agriculture production and marketing. As such the study recommends that the Government, private sector and other development partners must focus on raising agriculture productivity by expanding investments in crop science-based technologies; and also recommends re-allocation of financial resources between crops in favour of crops with high returns because this benefits both large scale and smallholder farmers. This must be accompanied by further investment in complementary infrastructure and good governance. CopyrightDissertation (MScAgric) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|Time {{is running}} out for the {{government}} to reverse the profligacy of the last four budgets, argues STEPHEN ANTHONY TODAY Macroeconomics. com. au released the April 2008 edition of our Commowealth Budget Bulletin (PDF), in which we argue for the necessity of spending cuts. To make the case, we resorted to some ancient history. In 1988 a Labor government faced with a negative terms of trade shock, a huge budget deficit and a strong economy cut public spending by 2. 3 per cent of GDP in the budget year. In 2008, another Labor government faced with a positive terms of trade shock, burgeoning inflation, and a strong economy should cut public spending by at least 1. 5 per cent of GDP and cajole the states to make a further 1 per cent of GDP in savings. The Howard government undertook a massive discretionary easing in budgetry policy from 2001 - 02, adding up to around $ 27 billion in new measures, on average, each year. The bulk of the loosening occurred from the 2004 - 05 budget onwards - totalling around $ 150 billion. All this spending was thrown at an economy in the mist of a commodity boom. Blind Freddy could have told you the outcome would be inflation. Throwing a huge stimulus at an economy lacking idle capacity and facing supply-side constraints was clearly inappropriate. This spending fever was overseen by senior ministers and endorsed by senior officials, who publicly lauded the achievements of the medium term fiscal strategy without making a well timed comment on the spending track record. The sheer volume and poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>spending</b> has contributed to bottlenecks in the economy, crowding out resource flows to productive sectors. Irresponsible budget policy and administration has contributed to higher prices and higher interest rates. An “easy” fiscal policy implies that monetary policy is tighter then necessary. We estimate that the $ 25 - 30 billion structural deterioration in the budget position of Australian governments since May 2002 is responsible for the 300 basis points (or 3 percentage points) tightening of monetary policy. Already the Reserve Bank has raised official interest rates by 75 basis points since the last election and we anticipate two further 25 basis point increases in June and October this year before the current tightening cycle comes to an end. The Rudd government has been slow off the blocks on macroeconomic management and has struggled to find a consistent narrative to portray its intent and reasoning. This is contributing to the lack of coordination in macroeconomic policy management evident is recent months and has seen the entire stabilisation burden of macroeconomic policy fall to monetary policy. The trade-off is simple. • Option 1 : Easy fiscal and tight monetary policy resulting in higher interest rates today and lower growth in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. • Option 2 : Tight fiscal and easy monetary policy resulting in lower interest rates today and higher growth in 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10. The political honeymoon afforded to a new government provides a window of opportunity for bold reform, but it will soon be over. By budget night 2008, the bureaucracy will have wasted almost six months for net discretionary policy savings of less than $ 6 billion, delaying the necessary fiscal consolidation. It may be that deferring the pain now will contribute to a larger downturn later down the track. The aim of the game of fiscal policy setting is lower spending in 2008 and 2009 thus providing more room for private economic activity to forestall inflation pressures. Spending cuts to target Achieving $ 15 to 20 billion in spending reductions requires more political courage than hard work. Most of the adjustment burden is achieved by reversing the worst policy decisions of the previous government. For example, the budget should restore the eligibility requirements for the age pension. This is the single largest spending program of the Commonwealth, with recent real growth in advance of 5 per cent and a steadily ageing population. Then there is the need to cap or means test payments such at the Carers Allowance, telephone, utility and seniors’ concession allowances, and to introduce adequate means testing for programs without means testing, or with low level tests, such as Family Tax Benefit B, the Baby Bonus and the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. And there is the need to restructure politically motivated programmes like Natural Heritage Trust, Exceptional Circumstances Assistance and Regional Partnerships that previously had a blank cheque to spend whatever they liked. Large savings can also be achieved by scrapping all current indexation arrangements along with the efficiency dividend and replacing these with CPI indexation and directly compensating individuals with less means. Large savings can also be achieved through the widespread adoption of competitive tendering processes, and by incorporating economic efficiency principles into contract design especially for the purchase of large capital items and defence weapons platforms. Large savings can also be achieved through the recentralisation of some departmental expenses functions related to office space, accounting, IT, legal services and human resource management. The best approach to spending reduction is to spread the pain of adjustment as thinly as possible and to impose the largest share of adjustment burden on those most likely to benefit from resultant resumption of strong growth and lower interest rates. The price of not doing anything - can anyone still remember 1983 and 1991 ? • Stephen Anthony is Director of Budget Policy & Forecasting at Macroeconomics. com. au Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E

Africa has markedly achieved significant economic progress since the 80 's decade crisis.

While several ways are being looked for creating a sustained fiscal space, this paper argues that improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> public <b>spending</b> remains the key avenue. It then derives fiscal space by computing Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) efficiency scores <b>of</b> public <b>spending</b> using a group of 62 African and non-African countries over the period 1980 - 2013.

40|$|Abstract: A {{little more}} than a decade after independence, the small island state of East Timor is exhibiting the {{hallmarks}} of a neo-patrimonialist state. Since 2008, utilizing its considerable oil reserves, the government has embarked on a major infrastructure development program. However, despite a complex regulatory regime to safeguard the <b>quality</b> and transparency <b>of</b> <b>spending,</b> these systems have been routinely bypassed by executive-style decision making and a variety of informal and sub-legal devices. Public funds have been channeled to clientelist networks via often controversial infrastructure projects or state employment. This article details the emergence of this state and explains how a command style of government and complex systems of reciprocal obligation embedded in an array of parallel, informal networks have undermined the foundations of a Weberian rational-legal state, with critical consequences for development and stability...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} that early integration of palliative care improves <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, lowers <b>spending</b> and helps clarify preferences and goals for advanced cancer patients. Little {{is known about the}} feasibility and acceptability of early integration. AIM: Assessing feasibility of early integration of palliative care, and exploring concerns perceived and problems encountered by patients, relatives and oncologists. DESIGN: A phase 2 mixed-methods study (ClinicalTrials. Gov :NCT 02078700). METHODS: Oncologists of two outpatient clinics offered a specialised palliative care intervention integrated with standard oncological care to all consecutive newly diagnosed metastatic respiratory/gastrointestinal cancer patients. We interviewed samples of patients, relatives and oncologists to explore strengths and weaknesses of the intervention. RESULTS: The intervention was proposed to 44 / 54 eligible patients (81. 5...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the funding of {{cultural}} activities, describing and analyzing the arguments that justify the State's participation in this funding. It analyzes the critics who claim {{to have been the}} cultural policies in Brazil left to the market due to the primacy of tax incentives, part of the Rouanet Law. To meet this objective it analyzes the composition of public and private resources and public indirect tax expenditures. The argument unfolds in the reflection on the legitimacy foundations of the state's participation on funding cultural consumption via "Culture Tickets", which is a form of tax incentives, establishing new ideological and principled arguments, expressing the view that the state should subsidize the members of the working class individual choices in relation to the preferences of consumption of cultural goods. Finally, a third aspect is the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> budget execution flow of the public body. In this case, our hypothesis is that much of the energy expended in criticizing questions of general principles like the preference for the market could be redirected into an effort to reform the state itself. There are many problems in the public decision making process about the state budget and its implementation. Strong initiatives are needed to adjust the amounts of financial resources to cultural needs, but also to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>spending</b> process...|$|R
40|$|This {{series of}} papers summarises key {{features}} of the new Federal Budget. Overview The 2014 – 15 Budget was introduced into Parliament on 13  May  2014. It is the first Budget of the Coalition Government. This overview provides {{a summary of the}} headline numbers, the economic context, the government’s fiscal strategy and broader policy agenda, and how the fiscal outlook has changed since the Mid–Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO). The Budget is the government’s key economic and fiscal statement each year. The major influences on the content of the Budget include past revenue and expenditure decisions, the economic outlook, and the government’s fiscal strategy and broader policy agenda. The Parliament plays a critical role in scrutinising and debating the content of the Budget. It has to consider questions such as: 	Will the decisions in the Budget improve the wellbeing of current and future generations? 	How well does the Budget manage the risks and opportunities Australia faces? 	What are the implications for economic growth and living standards? 	What are the distributional effects of the Budget? 	What is the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>spending</b> and revenue decisions? 	What trade–offs have been made? 	What has been left for another day...|$|R

However, it is also a region that has been prone to crises while growth has not delivered a significant reduction in poverty and inequality. Maintaining a strong and stable macroeconomic performance in Latin America will depend on further cuts in public debt, identification and reduction of fiscal vulnerabilities and improvements in the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> public <b>spending.</b> Improvements in governance and the business environment will also aid in attracting investment. This paper draws on assessments of fiscal transparency in twelve countries in Latin America to highlight good fiscal management and improvements in fiscal transparency that might enhance the prospect for sound fiscal performance and a more favorable investment environment.

40|$|The thesis {{contains}} {{a case study}} of a 4 th year class that I was teaching during the school year 2010 / 2011. Fifteen elementary school pupils participated in the research. While teaching I found out how pupils differ from each other on different fields. I focused mainly on the difference in interests, learning results and social skills and relationships. The fact is that apart from the time spent at school, pupils also have their free time they can use for various activities. Schools and other institutions offer them manifold choise of free time activities. Pupils can choose from these activities those that interest them or those they are more talented for. I was curious if the pupils who have some free time activities are also more successful and socially skilled than those who have no free time activities. I judged the pupils' social skills indirectly, {{with the help of the}} answers of the two teachers who taught the class together with me and I also observed the pupils myself. Only three of the fifteen pupils had no free time activities. These were the pupils with poorer learning results. As teachers we judged them as less socially skillful. The majority of pupils participating in free time activities had better final grade average. Pupils are shaped by various factors that influence their learning results and social relationships. Free time activities are an important factor <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>spending</b> <b>of</b> free time. Because of this it is important that teachers encourage pupils to participate in free time activities. ...|$|R

Este trabalho propõe uma metodologia de análise da relação entre a transparência dos procedimentos de licitação utilizados pelas admi­nistrações municipais e as irregularidades apontadas nestes municípios nos relatórios da Controladoria Geral da União (CGU). Para tanto, enfoca-se a aplicação local de recursos públicos federais nas áreas de saúde e de educação. Para este trabalho foram aplicadas estatísticas descritivas como um primeiro critério de avaliação da relação entre transparência e irregularidades encontradas pela CGU. Os resultados iniciais mostraram que a relação é ambígua, o que pede por estudos mais profundos sobre ela. A preocupação deste estudo foi propor uma metodologia de análise da relação entre transparência e qualidade da aplicação de recursos públicos, abrindo a possibilidade de novos debates no estudo de governos locais, e não produzir conclusões robustas e definitivas sobre o tema.

40|$|Gender {{sensitive}} budget {{analysis has}} {{attracted much attention}} in developing countries as a potential accountability tool. 2 These efforts to analyse the likely genderdifferential impact <b>of</b> planned <b>spending</b> are vital {{in order to make}} positive links between national gender equity policies and actual spending allocations. But this does not address problems in micro-level accountability, which is what matters to the consumers of public services. One of the most effective ways <b>of</b> improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> public <b>spending</b> {{from the point of view}} of poor women is to ensure that gender-sensitive processes of monitoring, budgeting, and in particular auditing are carried out at the local level. Participatory local development planning and budgeting 3 provides opportunities for more responsive planning, but more importantly, local monitoring and auditing is the only way of verifying that both national and local-level budgetary commitments – for instance to <b>spending</b> in areas <b>of</b> particular concern to women – do not just languish on paper. Local planning and auditing are responses to the perennial problem of government accountability to citizens. The local environment has an element of immediacy which the macro environment lacks; it enables citizens to see the direct links between revenue generation and expenditure, and between priority setting, planning and the actual implementation of public policies. From the point of view of women, and the poor, local-level budget analysis and auditing contribute to more gender- and povertysensitive development planning and policy implementation in the following ways:...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of oil {{producing}} countries, oil revenue accounts {{for the majority of}} government revenue, but is expected to be depleted in a relatively short time frame. Ensuring that fiscal policy is on a sustainable path is thus a high priority, but political and social adjustment costs create incentives to delay fiscal consolidation. This paper estimates how the permanently sustainable non-oil primary deficit (PSNOPD) depends on the speed of consolidation, using an optimization model with habit formation. Realism is added by allowing for negative growth-adjusted interest rates during a temporary period of catch-up growth. Applied to the Republic of Congo, this approach leads to the following conclusions: (i) the current fiscalpolicy stance is unsustainable; (ii) social adjustment costs justify spreading the bulk of the adjustment over five years; and (iii) the slower the adjustment, the lower the PSNOPD level.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} new {{evidence}} regarding the impact <b>of</b> public <b>spending</b> {{on the supply}} of leisure services on citizens’ spare-time <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Using data from 103 Italian capital municipalities covering the period 2007 – 2010, the analysis revealed that public spending on leisure impacted spare-time <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life in various ways, depending on the category <b>of</b> <b>spending.</b> Spending for tourism essentially followed an upward path, linearly enhancing citizens’ spare-time <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Surprisingly, municipalities’ spending on sport- and culture-related services had a non-linear impact. Hence, spending on sports within a maximum threshold reveals {{a positive impact on}} spare-time <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, whereas passing over a minimum level <b>of</b> public <b>spending</b> for culture-related projects had a positive effect. This paper provides helpful suggestions for policymakers who approach decisions that address whether it is worth spending on leisure, which is typically a non-basic need but one that must be properly satisfied by municipalities in today’s service-based society...|$|R
