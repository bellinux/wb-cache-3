The PPAP package is a series of documents which need a formal certification/sign-off by the supplier and approval/sign-off by the customer. The form that summarizes this package is called PSW (Part Submission Warrant). The signature in the supplier certification area of the PSW indicates that the supplier-responsible person (usually the <b>Quality</b> <b>Engineer</b> or Quality Manager) has reviewed this package and that the customer-responsible person (usually a Customer <b>Quality</b> <b>Engineer</b> or Customer Quality Manager) has not identified any issues that would prevent its approbation.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes <b>quality</b> <b>engineers</b> do {{not have}} data to {{generate}} a distribution, especially prior to production. However, the quality control strategy still must be planned, and a preliminary distribution is required. As data come to hand, the distribution can be updated via an evolutionary approach. This article considers cast feature dimensions. Through consideration of casting theory, probability theory, and published data, {{it is argued that}} the lognormal distribution is the preferred assumption for the initial distribution. Finally, it is concluded that <b>quality</b> <b>engineers</b> can use more than Goodness of Fit (GOF) tests to choose distributions and should understand operations to generate distributions case by case...|$|R

5000|$|For {{software}} testing the certifications can be grouped into exam-based and education-based.

40|$|Capstone design {{courses are}} {{prominent}} elements of engineering degree programs and {{are central to}} the development and assessment of student professional competencies for program accreditation. This paper describes a process for establishing broadly-applicable capstone design course learning outcomes and proposes a set that may become universally applicable across programs and disciplines. These capstone course outcome definitions will guide faculty in creation of improved instructional materials and methods for facilitating engineering-practice-oriented student learning. They also provide a foundation upon which broadly-applicable assessments of student learning can be developed to address the nationwide challenge for capstone course instructors to assess student achievement of important program outcomes. Capstone course learning outcomes were derived from the attributes of top <b>quality</b> <b>engineers,</b> both upon graduation and five years after graduation, as defined by a team of faculty and industry engineers collaborating across disciplines and organizations. The attributes of top <b>quality</b> <b>engineers</b> include: (1) motivation, (2) technical competence, (3) judgment and decision making, (4) innovation, (5) client/quality focus, (6) business orientation, (7) product development, (8) professional/ethical, (9) teamwork, (10) change management, and (11) communication. These attributes span ABET engineering criteria 3 and 4 requirements. A set of broadly-applicable capstone course learning outcomes is presented to address needs for developing the attributes of top <b>quality</b> <b>engineers</b> and to match capstone course objectives within engineering curricula...|$|R

5000|$|Once the [...] "alpha" [...] {{prototype}} is finalized {{after many}} iterations, {{the next step}} is the [...] "beta" [...] pre-production prototype. The design engineer, working with an industrial engineer, manufacturing engineer, and <b>quality</b> <b>engineer,</b> reviews an initial run of components and assemblies for design compliance and fabrication/manufacturing methods analysis. This is often determined through statistical process control. Variations in the product are correlated to aspects of the process and eliminated. The most common metric used is the process capability index Cpk. A Cpk of 1.0 is considered the baseline acceptance for full production go-ahead.|$|E

5000|$|The {{purpose in}} adding warning limits or subdividing the control chart into zones {{is to provide}} early {{notification}} if something is amiss. Instead of immediately launching a process improvement effort to determine whether special causes are present, the <b>Quality</b> <b>Engineer</b> may temporarily increase {{the rate at which}} samples are taken from the process output until {{it is clear that the}} process is truly in control. Note that with three-sigma limits, common-cause variations result in signals less than once out of every twenty-two points for skewed processes and about once out of every three hundred seventy (1/370.4) points for normally distributed processes. The two-sigma warning levels will be reached about once for every twenty-two (1/21.98) plotted points in normally distributed data. (For example, the means of sufficiently large samples drawn from practically any underlying distribution whose variance exists are normally distributed, according to the Central Limit Theorem.) ...|$|E
