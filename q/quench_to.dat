50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the fuel mixture {{is set at}} full rich on an {{aircraft}} engine when running it at high power settings (such as during takeoff). The extra fuel does not burn; its only purpose is to evaporate to absorb heat. This uses fuel faster and also decreases {{the efficiency of the}} combustion process. By using water injection, the cooling effect of the water lets the fuel mixture run leaner at its maximum power setting. Many military aircraft engines of the 1940s utilized a pressure carburetor, a type of fuel metering system similar to a throttle body injection system. In a water-injected engine, the pressure carburetor features a mechanical derichment valve that makes the system nearly automatic. When the pilot turns on the water injection pump, water pressure moves the derichment valve to restrict fuel flow to lean the mixture {{while at the same time}} mixing the water/methanol fluid into the system. When the system runs out of fluid the derichment valve shuts and cuts off the water injection system, while enriching the fuel mixture to provide a cooling <b>quench</b> <b>to</b> prevent sudden detonation.|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease, a {{debilitating}} neurodegenerative illness, {{is caused by}} the irreversible aggregation of beta-amyloid proteins in the brain. In Alzheimer’s brains, the protein can become disfigured, causing it to aggregate into long, insoluble fibers that deposit on brain tissue.

Heat induced aggregation of insulin provides a model system to study the aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins.

40|$|The {{time-dependent}} Mott {{transition in}} a periodic Anderson model with off-site, nearest-neighbor hybridization is studied {{within the framework}} of nonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. Using the two-site dynamical-impurity approximation, we compute the real-time dynamics of the optimal variational parameter and of different observables initiated by sudden quenches of the Hubbard-U and identify the critical interaction. The time-dependent transition is orbital selective, i. e., in the final state, reached in the long-time limit after the <b>quench</b> <b>to</b> the critical interaction, the Mott gap opens in the spectral function of the localized orbitals only. We discuss the dependence of the critical interaction and of the final-state effective temperature on the hybridization strength and point out the various similarities between the nonequilibrium and the equilibrium Mott transition.
