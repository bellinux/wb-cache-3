The method {{is based on}} the determination and the compensation of the phase mismatch by the introduction of a relevant signal-to-noise ratio metric. The principle is validated numerically and the algorithm is validated experimentally through bit-error-rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements. A 20 Gb/s optical QPSK experiment reveals a good agreement of theproposed method with the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure (GSOP). Moreover, the robustness of both methods was verified with up to 30 ° phase misalignment by comparing the signal after phase imbalance compensation to that without compensation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{benefits}} of employing improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) in full duplex relaying (FDR) suffering from in-phase and <b>quadrature</b> <b>imbalance</b> (IQI). Different from the traditional symmetric signaling scheme, proper Gaussian signaling (PGS), that is parametrized by its variance, IGS needs additional statistical-quantity called the pseudo-variance to be fully described. The cooperative system under consideration suffers from two types of interferences, the residual self-interference (RSI) and IQI. To evaluate the system performance gain using IGS, first we express the end-to-end achievable rate for different IQI. Then, we optimize the pseudo-variance to compensate the interferences impact and improve the end-to-end achievable rate. Interestingly, IGS-based scheme outperforms its counterpart PGS-based scheme, especially at higher interference-to-noise ratio. Our findings reveal that using single-user detection with asymmetric signaling can compensate both RSI and IQI and improve the system performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Although the {{quadrature}} mixing radio front-end {{offers an}} attractive way to perform frequency translation, its image rejection capability is severely affected by gain and phase imbalances (I/Q imbalances) between its two analog signal paths. Digital signal processing techniques {{have been widely}} proposed to compensate for these mixer imperfections. Of these techniques, the class of blind compensation techniques seems very attractive since no test signals are required. This correspondence presents a novel I/Q imbalance extraction technique which uses a Cholesky decomposition of the received signal’s covariance matrix to extract the exact imbalances of the front-end. Analysis is also presented on extracting and separating the imbalances of a cascaded imbalanced modulator and demodulator. Both a block-based and an adaptive variant of the technique are proposed, and a performance evaluation over multipath channels is presented.

40|$|Abstract—Despite the {{advantages}} that quadrature mixing offers to radio front-ends, its practical use {{has been limited}} due to its sensitivity towards gain and phase mismatches between its in-phase and quadrature channels. DC offsets are also a problem when a zero-IF transceiver topology is used. In this paper, novel digital compensation techniques are introduced to extract and correct the quadrature imbalances (gain and phase errors), {{as well as any}} offset errors that may exist in the quadrature mixing front-end of the modulator or demodulator. The techniques developed in this paper are not based on iterative search techniques, but rather use spectral measurements to extract the imbalance and offset errors directly.

40|$|In this paper, a {{new model}} and {{compensation}} scheme of <b>quadrature</b> <b>imbalance</b> in analog I/Q OFDM transceivers is presented. Classically, the effect of I/Q imbalance is modeled by a cross-talk between pairs of symmetrical OFDM sub-carriers. We show that this model is not valid when the carrier frequency offset is compensated after the source of I/Q mismatch. Assuming a perfect digital compensation of the frequency offset in baseband, the I/Q imbalance generates interference between all sub-carriers and not only symmetrical ones. When analog components, multipath propagation and frequency offsets are taken into account, the complete matrix analysis has {{to make use of}} mathematical results such as the diagonalization of pseudo-circulant matrices. The existing models happen to be a sub-case of this new more general result. A new compensation scheme applying to every case is proposed as well as a receiver autocalibration procedure.

The semiconductor downscaling trend has exacerbated device impairments such as inphase and <b>quadrature</b> (I/Q) <b>imbalances</b> which cause inter-carrier interferences in OFDM systems which cannot be remedied by increasing signal power. Different RF chains of MIMO branches can cause different I/Q imbalances which further complicates MIMO OFDM channel estimation.

The theoretical predictions of the performance are illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations as well as experimental data obtained from testing several universal software radio peripheral (USRP) receivers. The work shows that for the studied off-the-shelf receivers, gain <b>imbalance</b> and <b>quadrature</b> skew may be predicted accurately (i. e., < 0. 1 dB and < 1 deegre, respectively) by employing baseband data covering only a handful of full periods of the excitation stimuli.

The present work is devoted to the quantification and evaluation of the RF IQI effects in the context of realistic wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications over double-Nakagami−m fading channels.

To achieve the image frequency interference factors which are caused by an IQ imbalance effect, each symbol of the TS is modulated on only a half of all the subcarriers while the remaining subcarriers are modulated with zeros. By doing this, the IQ imbalance coefficients are directly estimated without recursive calculation requirements. This brings a low complexity to implementation in hardware. The performances of the modeling system are evaluated by a numerical simulation method where the error vector magnitude (EVM), the bit error ratio (BER), and the mean square error (MSE) quantities are used as performance indicators.

40|$|Due to {{the open}} nature of the radio signal {{propagation}} medium, wireless communication is inherently more vulnerable to various attacks than wired communication. Consequently, communication security is always one of the critical concerns in wireless networks. Given that the sophisticated adversaries may cover up their malicious behaviors through impersonation of legitimate devices, reliable wireless authentication is becoming indispensable to prevent such impersonation-based attacks through verification of the claimed identities of wireless devices. Conventional wireless authentication is achieved above the physical layer using upper-layer identities and key-based cryptography. As a result, user authenticity can even be validated for the malicious attackers using compromised security key. Recently, many studies have proven that wireless devices can be authenticated by exploiting unique physical-layer characteristics. Compared to the key-based approach, the possession of such physical-layer characteristics is directly associated with the transceiver 2 ̆ 7 s unique radio-frequency hardware and corresponding communication environment, which are extremely difficult to forge in practice. However, the reliability of physical-layer authentication is not always high enough. Due to the popularity of cooperative communications, effective implementation of physical-layer authentication in wireless relay systems is urgently needed. On the other hand, the integration with existing upper-layer authentication protocols still has many challenges, e. g., end-to-end authentication. This dissertation is motivated to develop novel physical-layer authentication techniques in addressing the aforementioned challenges. In achieving enhanced wireless authentication, we first specifically identify the technique challenges in authenticating cooperative amplify-and-forward (AF) relay. Since AF relay only works at the physical layer, all of the existing upper-layer authentication protocols are ineffective in identifying AF relay nodes. To solve this problem, a novel device fingerprint of AF relay consisting of wireless channel gains and in-phase and <b>quadrature</b> <b>imbalances</b> (IQI) is proposed. Using this device fingerprint, satisfactory authentication accuracy is achieved when the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough. Besides, the optimal AF relay identification system is studied to maximize the performance of identifying multiple AF relays in the low signal-to-noise regime and small IQI. The optimal signals for quadrature amplitude modulation and phase shift keying modulations are derived to defend against the repeated access attempts made by some attackers with specific IQIs. Exploring effective authentication enhancement technique is another key objective of this dissertation. Due to the fast variation of channel-based fingerprints {{as well as the}} limited range of device-specific fingerprints, the performance of physical-layer authentication is not always reliable. In light of this, the physical-layer authentication is enhanced in two aspects. On the one hand, the device fingerprinting can be strengthened by considering multiple characteristics. The proper characteristics selection strategy, measurement method and optimal weighted combination of the selected characteristics are investigated. On the other hand, the accuracy of fingerprint estimation and differentiation can be improved by exploiting diversity techniques. To be specific, cooperative diversity in the form of involving multiple collaborative receivers is used in differentiating both frequency-dependent and frequency-independent device fingerprints. As a typical combining method of the space diversity techniques, the maximal-ratio combining is also applied in the receiver side to combat the channel degeneration effect and increase the fingerprint-to-noise ratio. Given the inherent weaknesses of the widely utilized upper-layer authentication protocols, it is straightforward to consider physical-layer authentication as an effective complement to reinforce existing authentication schemes. To this end, a cross-layer authentication is designed to seamlessly integrate the physical-layer authentication with existing infrastructures and protocols. The specific problems such as physical-layer key generation as well as the end-to-end authentication in networks are investigated. In addition, the authentication complexity reduction is also studied. Through prediction, pre-sharing and reusing the physical-layer information, the authentication processing time can be significantly shortened...|$|R

A number of approaches to mitigate some of these hardware effects have been proposed for full-duplex systems, for example, [21] developed a digital domain scheme to compensate the IQ imbalance introduced by mixers, while [17 - 20] showed that sharing the oscillator between the transmit, receive and cancellation chains can reduce the impact of phase noise. It should be noted that some hardware components and resulting impairments - such as oscillator phase noise and mixer IQ imbalance - are common to both transmitter and receiver circuits. Previous research on receiver-specific hardware impairments has largely focused on the impact of imperfect analog-to-digital converters (ADC) [21, 26, 27]. In particular, [21] examined the quantisation noise introduced by the ADCs, while [26] examined the impact of limited ADC resolution and established the relationships between the ADC resolution and the required analog suppression to achieve a sufficient signal to self-interference ratio. The impact and mitigation of sampling jitter on self-interference suppression was considered in [28, 29]. However, most of these studies are based on theoretical models and simulation analysis of assumed hardware imperfections without experimental verification. Unfortunately, it is mostly the uncertainty and inaccuracy of the models that renders the suppression of these effects difficult. Hence, their identification through measurements and experiments takes an important role in enabling full-duplex communication nodes.|$|R

The universal software radio peripheral (USRP) is a widespread hardware for research, education, and development regarding future wireless communication receivers. A set of USRPs are tested. It is shown that for the receivers studied, gain <b>imbalance</b> and <b>quadrature</b> skew may be predicted accurately (that is, < 0. 1 dB and < 1 deg, respectively) by employing baseband data covering a handful of full periods of the excitation stimuli. The work also shows that local oscillator leakage may suffer from systematic bias error of the order of 15 dB. To obtain leakage estimates with an uncertainty in the order of one dB, the measurement time has to be increased by two orders of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Error vector {{magnitude}} (EVM) {{is one of}} {{the widely}} accepted figure of merits used to evaluate the quality of communication systems. In the literature, EVM has been related to signalto-noise ratio (SNR) for data-aided receivers, where preamble sequences or pilots are used to measure the EVM, or under the assumption of high SNR values. In this paper, this relation is examined for nondata-aided receivers and is shown to perform poorly, especially for low SNR values or high modulation orders. The EVM for nondata-aided receivers is then evaluated and its value is related to the SNR for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels, and for systems with IQ imbalances. The results show that derived equations can be used to reliably estimate SNR values using EVM measurements that are made based on detected data symbols. Thus, presented work can be quite useful for measurement devices such as vector signal analyzers (VSA), where EVM measurements are readily available.

Continuous-wave {{microwave}} Doppler radar {{has been}} used extensively in physiological monitoring, for wireless detection of respiration rate and heart rate, arterial pulse wave, respiratory tidal volume, sleep apnea, and fall detection. By taking the advantage of its non-contact and non- invasive features, physiological parameters can be assessed without obstructing the integrity of patient’s physiological activities {{as well as providing}} a continuous vital sign monitoring for event diagnosis. While physiological rates can be accurately estimated using various radar architectures and demodulation methods, a higher precision instrumentation is needed for accurate physiological waveform tracking and torso displacement estimation that may provide stroke volume and pulse pressure information. In this dissertation, high accuracy displacement estimation techniques were investigated. The goal is to obtain feasible methods in accurately estimation of torso displacement for applying to associated physiological parameters measurement such as stroke volume and pulse pressure. The challenges lie in limitation of accuracy in full signal reconstruction due to <b>Quadrature</b> channel <b>imbalance</b> and limited phase information associated with millimeter-order physiological displacements. To increase chest wall displacement estimation accuracy without compromising the computational complexity for higher precision cardiopulmonary activities reconstruction, quantitative analysis on the center estimation method used for non-linear demodulation of quadrature Doppler radar was presented. To address the issue, techniques that calibrate quadrature Doppler radar outputs for more accurate full waveform recovery and displacement estimation were proposed. Additional contribution of this dissertation presented a preliminary study on the mapping of chest wall mechanics due to respiratory effort. Using a set of infrared camera tracking system, an average respiratory angle was estimated from 20 subjects. This angle was further applied to compensate the probing angle of quadrature Doppler radar antenna in order to increase detection sensitivity. Last but not least, the quadrature Doppler radar was used for sensing hand gestures with novel barcode feature. In total eight non-identical gestures were measured and represented in a barcoded plot featuring distinctive differences. Future work covers a variety of topics, including Doppler radar vital sign sensing sensitivity enhancement by probing angle compensation, self-corrected high accuracy torso displacement estimation, and hand gesture classification by barcoded Doppler radar signal features and its recognition...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a push toward {{low-cost}} phased array radar technologies with signal digitization moving closer to the antenna elements. Lowering {{the cost of the}} overall aperture precludes the use of brick-style T/R modules coupled to advanced, high-tolerance transceivers and instead calls for standard, surface-mount technologies with simpler transceiver architectures that have fewer frequency conversion stages. These changes are not without risk, as this leads to a number of non-idealities in the analog signal paths that place limitations on overall system performance and require more sophisticated calibration procedures. This is especially true of direct-conversion architectures, where in-phase and <b>quadrature</b> (I/Q) signal <b>imbalances</b> and mismatches in bandpass channel characteristics can lead to significant errors. At the same time, digitization of an increasing number of channels creates both processing and I/O bandwidth challenges that must be met with digital backend architectures that provide a maximum level of flexibility and capability without excessive hardware requirements. Proposed and demonstrated herein is a set of techniques that leverage the capabilities of a general hierarchical digital backend with digitization at the element level to overcome the limitations of these simpler analog receive chains while simultaneously providing new calibration and performance monitoring capabilities. These techniques, which feature direct, element-to-element mutual coupling measurements, are then extended and related to the real-world, practical challenge of calibrating dual-polarized phased arrays for weather radar applications, where precise knowledge and control of polarimetric antenna array patterns are required in order to meet strict performance requirements. ...|$|R
