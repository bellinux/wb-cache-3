The key <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> are to identify which {{parts of the brain}} are involved in sleep onset and what their mechanisms of action are. In humans and most animals sleep and wakefulness seems to follow an electronic flip-flop model i.e. both states are stable, but the intermediate states are not. Of course, unlike in the flip-flop, in the case of sleep, {{there seems to be a}} timer ticking away from the minute of waking so that after a certain period one must sleep, and in such a case even waking becomes an unstable state. The reverse may also be true to a lesser extent.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} EastEnders insider also commented: [...] "The {{fact that}} Kat gets pregnant {{at all is}} amazing. Alfie has believed that he was infertile after trying to have kids with his wife for ages with no luck. So when Kat finds out that she's expecting, it's devastating not least because it raises some big questions in Alfie's mind." [...] The insider added to Inside Soap: [...] "Who can blame Alfie for asking some <b>questions</b> <b>here?</b> He stood by Kat while she had his cousin's baby and through the misery of losing baby Tommy. It would be absolutely devastating for him to learn that all this tragedy has driven them apart again." [...] STV added that after forgiving Kat for cheating on him with Michael, Alfie would {{find it hard to}} get over another betrayal.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Official Xbox Magazine called it [...] "A decent upgrade or {{introduction to the}} series". GameSpot noted [...] "This movie trivia game offers consistent multiplayer fun despite its limited feature set". IGN stated [...] "Scene It? Bright Lights! Big Screen! gets a few things right that a trivia game should — the clips are plentiful, the round with the edited photos is fun, and there's {{a fair amount of}} <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> — but the things it misses sink any shot this game had at being something you need to play". GameZone commented [...] "Scene It? features plenty of movie trivia factoids to keep cinemaphiles happy, but a dearth of features (no online play?!?) and the availability of other, better trivia games for PlayStation 3 makes me doubt that this was ever intended for the big screen to begin with". In contrast, Game Revolution cited [...] "Scene It? can only be entertaining — not to mention, fair — if everyone playing not only has comparable movie knowledge but also comparable gaming experience, which is completely ridiculous for a casual party game. And the thing that's so irritating about it all is that these problems could have been fixed with almost zero effort".|$|E

60|$|Richard {{very briefly}} related {{the history of}} the rescue of the infant, which he said he could confirm by the {{testimony}} of Goatley and of Heatherthwayte. He then explained how Langston had been present when she was brought home, and had afterwards made communications to the Queen of Scots that led to the girl, already in attendance on her, being claimed and recognised; after which he confessed that he had not the heart to do what might separate the mother and daughter by declaring their relationship. Elizabeth meanwhile was evidently comparing his narrative with the letters of the Queen of Scots, asking searching <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> and there.|$|E
60|$|When the {{waitress}} left the room, Nicholas pushed aside his plate and gazed {{out of the}} window. He was not going over into the Froom Valley altogether on Christine's account, but she had greatly animated his motive in coming that way. Anyhow he would push on there {{now that he was}} so near, and not ask <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> where he was liable to be wrongly informed. The fundamental inquiry he had not ventured to make--whether Christine had married before the family went away. He had abstained because of an absurd dread of extinguishing hopeful surmise. That the Everards had left their old home was bad enough intelligence for one day.|$|E

6000|$|DON JUAN. Then {{you must}} stay here; for hell {{is the home}} of the unreal and of the seekers for happiness. It is the only refuge from heaven, which is, as I tell you, the home of the masters of reality, and from earth, which {{is the home of}} the slaves of reality. The earth is a nursery in which men and women play at being heros and heroines, saints and sinners; but they are dragged down from their fool's paradise by their bodies: hunger and cold and thirst, age and decay and disease, death above all, make them slaves of reality: thrice a day meals must be eaten and digested: thrice a century a new {{generation}} must be engendered: ages of faith, of romance, and of science are all driven at last to have but one prayer, [...] "Make me a healthy animal." [...] But here you escape the tyranny of the flesh; for here you are not an animal at all: you are a ghost, an appearance, an illusion, a convention, deathless, ageless: in a word, bodiless. There are no social <b>questions</b> <b>here,</b> no political questions, no religious questions, best of all, perhaps, no sanitary <b>questions.</b> <b>Here</b> you call your appearance beauty, your emotions love, your sentiments heroism, your aspirations virtue, just as you did on earth; but here there are no hard facts to contradict you, no ironic contrast of your needs with your pretensions, no human comedy, nothing but a perpetual romance, a universal melodrama. As our German friend put it in his poem, [...] "the poetically nonsensical here is good sense; and the Eternal Feminine draws us ever upward and on"--without getting us a step farther. And yet you want to leave this paradise! ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{accompanying}} map (see frontispiece) we have {{laid down the}} distribution of each species {{so far as it}} can be ascertained from the works of Sharpe and Dresser for Europe, Jerdon for India, Swinhoe for China, and Mr. Seebohm's recent work for Japan. There is, however, much uncertainty in many places, and gaps have to be filled up conjecturally, while such a large part of Asia is still very imperfectly explored, that considerable modifications may have to be made when the country becomes more accurately known. But though details may be modified we can hardly suppose that the great features of the several specific areas, or their relations to each other {23} will be much affected; and these are what we have chiefly to consider as bearing on the <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> discussed.|$|E
60|$|He had no {{need for}} further <b>questions.</b> <b>Here</b> was a proof more eloquent than words to his ready wit.

He was out of sympathy himself. But not {{to the extent of}} {{standing}} by to see his throat cut. She would have the plot succeed--whatever it might be and yet that he himself be spared. There his thoughts paused; but only for a moment. He saw suddenly in this, not a proof of concern born of love but of duty towards him who had imperilled himself once--and for all time, indeed--that he might save her brother and Sir Rowland.|$|E

60|$|I {{left this}} {{question}} to the reader's thought two months ago, choosing rather that he should work it out for himself than have it sharply stated to him. But now, the ground being sufficiently broken (and the details into which the several <b>questions,</b> <b>here</b> opened, must lead us, being too complex for discussion {{in the pages of}} a periodical, so that I must pursue them elsewhere), I desire, in closing the series of introductory papers, to leave this one great fact clearly stated. THERE IS NO WEALTH BUT LIFE. Life, including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration. That country is the richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings; that man is richest who, having perfected the functions of his own life to the utmost, has also the widest helpful influence, both personal and by means of his possessions, over the lives of others.|$|E
6000|$|I {{certainly}} was not aware that I had evaded the <b>questions</b> <b>here</b> stated; indeed I should say that I have indicated my reply to them pretty clearly; but, as Dr. Wace wants a plainer answer, he shall certainly be gratified. If, as Dr. Wace declares it is, his [...] "whole case is involved in" [...] the argument {{as stated in the}} latter of these two extracts, so much the worse for his whole case. For I am of opinion that there is the gravest reason for doubting whether the [...] "Sermon on the Mount" [...] was ever preached, and whether the so-called [...] "Lord's Prayer" [...] was ever prayed, by Jesus of Nazareth. My reasons for this opinion are, among others, these:--There is now no doubt that the three Synoptic Gospels, so far from being the work of three {416} independent writers, are closely interdependent,[109] and that in one of two ways. Either all three contain, as their foundation, versions, to a large extent verbally identical, of one and the same tradition; or two of them are thus closely dependent on the third; and the opinion {{of the majority of the}} best critics has of late years more and more converged towards the conviction that our canonical second gospel (the so-called [...] "Mark's" [...] Gospel) is that which most closely represents the primitive groundwork of the three.[110] That I take to be one of the most valid results of New Testament criticism, of immeasurably greater importance than the discussion about dates and authorship.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{previous}} book, [...] "First and Last Things" [...] (Constable and Co.), he has stated his convictions upon certain general ideas {{of life and}} thought as clearly as he could. All of philosophy, all of metaphysics that is, seems to {{him to be a}} discussion of the relations of class and individual. The antagonism of the Nominalist and the Realist, the opposition of the One and the Many, the contrast of the Ideal and the Actual, all these oppositions express a certain structural and essential duality in the activity of the human mind. From an imperfect recognition of that duality ensue great masses of misconception. That was the substance of [...] "First and Last Things." [...] In this present book there is no further attack on philosophical or metaphysical <b>questions.</b> <b>Here</b> we work at a less fundamental level and deal with religious feeling and religious ideas. But just as the writer was inclined to attribute a whole world of disputation and inexactitudes to confused thinking about the exact value of classes and terms, so here he is disposed to think that interminable controversies and conflicts arise out of a confusion of intention due to a double meaning of the word [...] "God"; that the word [...] "God" [...] conveys not one idea or set of ideas, but several essentially different ideas, incompatible one with another, and falling mainly into one or other of two divergent groups; and that people slip carelessly {{from one to the other}} of these groups of ideas and so get into ultimately inextricable confusions.|$|E
