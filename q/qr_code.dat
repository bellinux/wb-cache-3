40|$|AbstractQuick Response (<b>QR)</b> <b>Codes</b> are {{becoming}} {{a part of our}} lives. As mobile technologies are booming, <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> are being used for various purposes, one of which is for mobile marketing. In this study, our goal was to investigate the current use and future intent of use of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> in mobile marketing among college students. We surveyed 241 college students in the beginning of 2013. The findings indicate that while more than 80 % of students recognized <b>QR</b> <b>codes,</b> only half of them had used <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> before. Furthermore, while the interest in using <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> is currently low, the likelihood of using them is slightly higher than the current interest. Therefore, we can simply conclude that we are more likely to see higher adoption levels of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> among the traditional-age college students in the future. However, we also believe that mobile marketers need to find ways to promote the use of <b>QR</b> <b>codes,</b> teach how to use them, and increase adoption levels if they want to benefit from this new technology...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This article {{explains}} {{the nature of}} <b>QR</b> (Quick response) <b>codes</b> and their possible applications in libraries. Design/methodology/approach: Existing uses; applications and functionality of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> are looked, before turning to the limited existing use of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> in libraries. The Author then suggests many different ways <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> {{could be used in}} our libraries. Findings: Most of our users are {{likely to be able to}} use <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> if they install a free reader onto their camera 'phones or other mobile device. An already high and further increasing number of people own suitable devices. There are many ways <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> can be used, with the most exciting applications relying on the use of the internet from mobile devices. The main restrictions on their take up is likely to be increasing awareness of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> and carefully marketing services based on <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> to our users. Originality/value: Outside Japan few libraries have implemented services based on <b>QR</b> <b>codes.</b> This article is the first of it's kind aimed at libraries and it shows how we can use them to take advantage of the mobile devices in many of our users' pockets...|$|R

After {{the revelation of}} the first teaser trailer, in August2009, the film's official website featured only an animation of Cobb's spinning top. In December, the top toppled over and the website opened the online game Mind Crime, which upon completion revealed Inceptions poster. The rest of the campaign unrolled after WonderCon in April2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had a <b>QR</b> <b>code</b> linking to an online manual of the device. Mind Crime also received a stage2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie. More pieces of {{viral marketing}} began to surface before Inceptions release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent to Wired magazine, and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film.

25|$|Many {{phones are}} able to decode {{barcodes}} using their built-in camera, as well. Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner, while mbarcode is a <b>QR</b> <b>code</b> reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the <b>QR</b> <b>Code</b> contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web browser. Windows Phone 7.5 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of barcodes. As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated barcode scanner or portable data terminal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, mobile {{devices and}} {{applications}} offer new possibilities to learn anytime and anywhere. These technologies caused a disruption in traditional learning, {{opening up a}} new range of opportunities for learning at the workplace. Quick Response (<b>QR)</b> <b>codes</b> are one example of technology popularized with the adoption of mobile devices. When attached to an object or location, <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> add a digital layer of information that transform and extend the way workers interact in their daily routines. This paper presents an illustrative scenario in which <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> are used to support collaboration at the workplace. These <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> are generated with etiquetAR, an authoring tool that allows creating personalized <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> that users can access and contribute to with comments. In this scenario, <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> act as the element for triggering interactions, opening a new communication space that promotes collaboration, sharing and discussion among workers while enhancing reflection and facilitating decision making processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explore and analyse {{teaching}} methods and processes that incorporate Quick Response (<b>QR)</b> <b>codes</b> and mobile devices into the classroom. Quick Response codes are two dimensional barcodes that are used to encode and decode information. <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> can contain information such as text, URL links, automatic SMS messages, or just about any other information that can be embedded in a two-dimensional barcode. This encoded data can be decoded by scanning the barcode with a mobile device that is equipped with a camera and QR reader software. Although <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> are very versatile and have been around for over fifteen years, their use in education is still in its infancy. This paper introduces the available implementations of <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> in education. These implementations were developed with teachers to correspond to their needs and wishes. The students were very enthusiastic and motivated but the teachers’ attitude was more sceptical. The main feedback from the teachers was that the planning of QR activities is an arduous task when one is not familiar with <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> or the ways to utilize them. In our study we found that <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> can support learning in different contexts. We also found that <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> can support both independent and collaborative learning and that <b>QR</b> <b>codes</b> can motivate and engage learners...|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of several items, including a soft-drink glass, {{a bottle of}} milk, marshmallows, and pages from a briefcase, falling onto the ground. A <b>QR</b> <b>code,</b> which was said to produce the word [...] "LOVE" [...] when scanned, can be seen printed on the glass and bottle, {{and on the ground}} during the scene of the marshmallows falling. In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the falling objects convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E
