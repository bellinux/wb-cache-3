Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to <b>quality</b> <b>health</b> care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E

The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} <b>quality</b> of primary <b>health</b> care services in Albania based on physicians' perceptions towards the quality of the services provided to the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in January-March 2013 including a representative sample of 132 physicians (59 men aged 41. 3 ± 6. 9 years and 73 women aged 43. 7 ± 4. 8 years; overall response rate: 132 / 150 = 88 %) providing primary health care services in several polyclinics (health centers) of Tirana, the Albanian capital city. A structured self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was applied including physicians' perceptions regarding different dimensions of the <b>quality</b> of primary <b>health</b> care. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association of self-perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> care services with baseline characteristics of physicians. RESULTS: Self-perceived adequate <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> care services was positively related to the age of physicians, their working experience, female gender, a lower population served, and specialization in family medicine. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide useful evidence on the self-perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> services from primary health care physicians' perspective in transitional Albania.
