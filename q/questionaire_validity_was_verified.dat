After the semantic-cultural adaptation process, {{this study was}} composed by 380 educators from the public educational system {{in the state of}} São Paulo. The teacher self-efficacy scale, composed by 12 items, was organized into three factors. The School Collective Efficacy scale, composed by 12 items, was structured into two factors. Such adaptations, through the exploratory factor analysis yielded similar factor structure to the original scales, showed good evidence for variance explained, and internal consistency. Convergent <b>validity</b> <b>was</b> <b>verified</b> by the significant correlation between self-efficacy and collective efficacy.
