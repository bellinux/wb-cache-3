5|$|The town {{is notable}} for once being the {{location}} of a Royal Naval Air Service seaplane base at St Mildred's Bay, which defended the Thames Estuary coastal towns during World War I. The town is the subject of Sir John Betjeman's poem, Westgate-on-Sea. Residents have included the 19th-century surgeon Sir Erasmus Wilson and former Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple. The artist Sir William <b>Quiller</b> Orchardson painted several of his best-known pictures while living in Westgate-on-Sea. The British composer Arnold Cooke attended the town's Streete Preparatory School in the early 20th century, and Eton headmaster Anthony Chenevix-Trench spent the earliest few years of his education in the town.|$|E
5|$|The venture, {{financed by}} John <b>Quiller</b> Rowett, is {{sometimes}} referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quiller's</b> {{narration}} of the tradecraft he routinely employs {{is one of}} {{the defining}} elements of the novels. Certain other common factors appear. First, he is almost always reluctant to take on a mission and he regularly tells the reader all Bureau operatives have an option to refuse. Manipulation to get him to agree to the mission is usually necessary.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{quilling}} {{is seeing}} a resurgence in popularity with <b>quillers</b> (people who practice {{the art of}} quilling) on every continent and in every walk of life. No longer confined to the [...] "upper classes", this is a peoples art form {{and the beauty of}} the art is always expanding thanks to innovators and rapidly growing number of <b>quillers.</b> Quilling is great for all ages thanks to the simplicity of the techniques and how relaxing it is. The craft has become increasingly popular due to the low cost of the material. It is used to decorate wedding invitations, for Christmas, birth announcements, greeting cards, scrapbook pages, and boxes. Quilling can be found in art galleries in Europe and in the United States and is an art that is practiced around the world. One of the most well-known quilling artists in modern times is Russian artist, Yulia Brodskaya.|$|R

5|$|Later {{that year}} John <b>Quiller</b> Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, on a bed of stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although the boat is sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|John Graham-Gilbert (1794–1866) {{was born}} in Glasgow {{and worked in the}} city from 1834, playing an {{important}} part in the professionalisation of painting there. Other figures to pursue their careers largely in portraiture and based in Glasgow included Daniel Macnee (1806–82). He moved to Edinburgh after his election of President of the Academy in 1876. Other major figures who worked in portraiture included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William <b>Quiller</b> Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists of the later nineteenth century. Andrew Geddes (1783–1844) produced some landscapes, but also portraits before he finally moved to London in 1831. David Wilkie (1785–1841) worked mainly in London, and produced the flattering painting of the King George IV in Highland dress commemorating the royal visit to Scotland in 1823 that set off the international fashion for the kilt. He succeeded Raeburn as Royal Limner in 1823 and would emerge {{of one of the most}} influential British artists of the century.|$|E
5|$|From {{the mid-nineteenth}} century {{portrait}} painting declined as an art. This was {{partly due to the}} advent of photography, which could record the human face with greater ease. While grander commissions were still made, the miniature in particular, which had often been in an intimate locket or brooch, was largely replaced. David Octavius Hill (1802–70) originally took an interest in photography as a means of being able to record the figures of Great Disruption of 1843 for a composite painted portrait, but as part of Hill & Adamson {{he was one of the}} founding fathers of art photography. Just as portrait photography inherited many of the conventions of painting, photography also began to influence painting. From the 1840s John Watson Gordon's work began to be influenced by early photography, with cool light and muted colours, as can be seen in his full-length portrait of Principal Lee (1847). Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, who became the first Scottish president of the Royal Academy in London, Robert Scott Lauder (1803–69), William <b>Quiller</b> Orchardson (1832–1910) and John Pettie (1839–93). John Zephaniah Bell (1794–1883) was educated in London and was a forerunner of the trend of Parisian education that would become common among Scottish artists from the later nineteenth century. The most significant grouping in late nineteenth-century Scotland, the Glasgow Boys, mainly focused on landscape. They were influenced by the leading continental artists of the day and broke with Victorian convention. A number of artists identified with the group came to support themselves through portrait painting, including James Guthrie (1859–1930) and Belfast-born John Lavery (1856–1944).|$|E

500|$|Shackleton {{returned}} to the lecture circuit and published his own account of the Endurance expedition, South, in December 1919. In 1920, tired of the lecture circuit, Shackleton began {{to consider the possibility}} of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the Beaufort Sea area of the Arctic, a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government. With funds supplied by former schoolfriend John <b>Quiller</b> Rowett, he acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named Foca I which he renamed Quest. The plan changed; the destination became the Antarctic, and the project was defined by Shackleton as an [...] "oceanographic and sub-antarctic expedition". The goals of the venture were imprecise, but a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and investigation of some [...] "lost" [...] sub-Antarctic islands, such as Tuanaki, were mentioned as objectives.|$|E
500|$|The {{generation}} of painters that followed Raeburn included David Watson, John Watson Gordon and David Wilkie who {{became one of}} the most influential British artists of the century. From the mid-nineteenth century, portrait painting, particularity the miniature, declined as an art, photography also began to influence painting. Major figures who worked in portraiture and came to prominence in the second half of the century included Francis Grant, Robert Scott Lauder, William <b>Quiller</b> Orchardson and John Pettie. In the twentieth century the move away from figurative painting to impressionism and abstraction, speeded the decline of portrait painting. Artists who continued to pursue portraiture included Francis Cadell, Cecile Walton, Dorothy Johnstone and James Cowie. The second half of the twentieth century saw a general movement back towards figurative representation. Alexander Moffat was among the leading Scottish intellectuals from the 1960s. The artists associated with Moffat known as the [...] "new Glasgow Boys" [...] included Steven Campbell, Peter Howson, Ken Currie and Adrian Wisniewski. A parallel movement in Edinburgh, focused around the 369 Gallery in the city, included Caroline McNairn, Robert MacLaurin and Gwen Hardie.|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{appears in}} a number of artworks, {{including}} several depicting the ship's role in Napoleon's surrender. Sir William <b>Quiller</b> Orchardson painted Napoleon on the Bellerophon, depicting the former emperor standing on the poop deck, watching the French coastline recede as his retinue look on. Sir Charles Lock Eastlake painted a portrait of Napoleon in uniform, standing on Bellerophons deck, while John James Chalon produced Scene in Plymouth Sound in August 1815, a seascape, with Bellerophon surrounded by crowds of people in small boats. Thomas Luny painted a similar scene, showing Bellerophon putting into Torbay to rendezvous with HMS Northumberland. Numerous popular prints and engravings were also produced, depicting moments from Napoleon's arrival on Bellerophon to surrender, to his final transfer to Northumberland for his voyage into exile. [...] The ship also appears in prints and paintings of the battles she had fought in. She is depicted on the Cadiz blockade {{with the rest of the}} inshore squadron in a work by Thomas Buttersworth, and is visible at the Glorious First of June in works by Nicholas Pocock, Cornwallis's Retreat by William Anderson, and the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar by Thomas Whitcombe.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore had {{originally}} signed a three-film contract with Eon Productions, which covered {{his first three}} appearances up to The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent to this, the actor negotiated contracts on a film-by-film basis. Uncertainty surrounding his involvement in For Your Eyes Only considering retire by age, led to other actors being considered to take over, including Lewis Collins, known in the UK for his portrayal of Bodie in The Professionals;; Ian Ogilvy, like Moore very known by his role in Return of the Saint Michael Billington, who previously appeared in The Spy Who Loved Me as Agent XXX's ill-fated lover, (Billington's screen test for For Your Eyes Only {{was one of the}} five occasions he auditioned for the role of Bond) and Michael Jayston, who had appeared as the eponymous spy in the British TV series of <b>Quiller</b> (Jayston eventually played Bond in a BBC Radio production of You Only Live Twice in 1985). Timothy Dalton was strongly considered but Dalton declined, as he disliked the direction the series was taking at the time. [...] Eventually, this came to nothing as Moore agreed to play Bond once again.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the large}} debts still {{outstanding}} from the Endurance expedition, Shackleton's mind turned towards another exploration venture. He {{decided to turn}} away from the Antarctic, go northwards and, as he put it, [...] "fill in this great blank now called the Beaufort Sea". This area of the Arctic Ocean, to the north of Alaska and west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, was largely unexplored; Shackleton believed, on the basis of tidal records, that it contained large undiscovered land masses that [...] "would be of the greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic value". He also hoped to reach the northern [...] "pole of inaccessibility", the most remote point in the Arctic regions. In March 1920, his plans received the general approval of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and were supported by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the necessary funding, which he estimated at £50,000. Later that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, John <b>Quiller</b> Rowett, who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get Shackleton started. With this money, in January 1921 Shackleton purchased the wooden Norwegian whaler Foca I together with other equipment, and began the process of hiring of a crew.|$|E

Another role which is sometimes referred to as one which he considered his best and is so considered by many critics, is that of Colonel Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960). Guinness also played the role of Jamessir Bensonmum, the blind butler, in the 1976 Neil Simon film Murder by Death.|$|E

6000|$|Tom, to my surprise, {{refused a}} cocktail. It seems, as he explained, that he [...] "got {{into the way}} of taking nothing over there."

6000|$|Wasn't most {{literature}} in the same class?

Imagine any one in distress about his soul or about mankind, going to a professor of economics or sociology or philosophy! He thought of the endless, big, expensive, fruitless books, the windy expansions of industrious pedantry that mocked the spirit of inquiry. The fields of physical and biological science alone had been partially rescued from the floods of human inconsecutiveness. There at least a man must, on the whole, join on to the work of other men, stand a searching criticism, justify himself. Philosophically this was an age of relaxed schoolmen. He thought of Doctor Codger at Cambridge, bubbling away with his iridescent Hegelianism like a salted snail; of Doctor <b>Quiller</b> at Oxford, ignoring Bergson and fulminating a preposterous insular Pragmatism. Each contradicted the other fundamentally upon matters of universal concern; neither ever joined issue with the other.

50|$|Upon leaving, <b>Quiller</b> confronts a man {{who seems}} to be {{following}} him. Having earlier told Hengel he understands no German, <b>Quiller</b> is revealed to speak it fluently. The man strenuously denies following him and other man intervenes, before <b>Quiller</b> returns to his hotel. Outside the hotel, a porter bumps into his leg with a heavy suitcase. Though the porter says 'excuse me', Porter thinks its a set-up, but after a moment, <b>Quiller</b> jumps in his car, and drives off, managing to shake his minder, Hengel,who sees men in another car following <b>Quiller.</b> <b>Quiller</b> notices the other car is following him. But, at a traffic light, with the car aside his, <b>Quiller</b> quicklybecomes drowsy, and semi-conscious. When the traffic light changes to green, <b>Quiller</b> is unable to move; the passenger door on the car alongside his opens, and a man gently moves <b>Quiller</b> from the driving seat and drives on.|$|E
5000|$|Later, <b>Quiller</b> {{walks into}} Inge's classroom. Inge {{explains}} she [...] "was lucky {{they let me}} go", but <b>Quiller</b> has already realized; Inge is not who she seems. Inge says she tried to ring the number <b>Quiller</b> had given her, but says it just rang, to which <b>Quiller</b> replies; 'I must've given you the wrong number'. Quillertells Inge; 'we got them all... well, maybe not quite all', the implication being Inge {{is a member of}} Phoenix, and she had been set up with Quillerfrom the very beginning.|$|E
50|$|After {{sleeping}} with <b>Quiller,</b> <b>Quiller</b> admits he isn't a writer, but, is, in fact, an 'investigator', whom {{is on the}} trail if neo-nazis. Surprisingly, none of this phases Inge, in any way, and she readily admits she has a friend who might know the location of Phoenix's HQ. Inge takes <b>Quiller</b> to the swimming pool manager, Hassler, who is now much more friendly. He drives <b>Quiller,</b> and Inge to a spot, where Hassler's contact - Inge's headmistress appears, and points to a dilapidated old building, as their headquarters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quiller</b> comes round lying {{somewhere in}} the city beside the river. He hails a cab and when his driver gets out, and and he sees several men - all keeping eyes on him, <b>Quiller</b> steals it, evading a {{pursuing}} Mercedes before booking himself into a squalid hotel. He telephones Inge from the hall, and they arrange to meet the following evening. Pol also arranges another meeting with <b>Quiller,</b> where his handler explains that each side is trying to discover and annihilate the other's base; <b>Quiller</b> alone {{is in a position}} to know both.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>Quiller</b> goes {{to check}} the house on his own, he tells Inge if he doesn't return in 20 minutes, she's to ring a certain number, <b>Quiller</b> asks her to memorise.|$|E
5000|$|He {{leaves the}} bomb, and has about 30seconds {{to get himself}} far enough to not be killed. The bomb explodes, and Oktober's men assume <b>Quiller</b> has been killed. <b>Quiller</b> {{makes his way to}} the SIS office, and reports the {{location}} of Phoenix's HQ. Pol appears calmly indifferent, and asks <b>Quiller</b> to make a full report for the record, as he arranges to round up the gang. A few minutes later, the phone rings to report they are all arrested. <b>Quiller</b> asks about Inge, and is told there was no woman at the scene.yet Inge turns out not to be among them.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Berlin, <b>Quiller</b> shakes off someone {{following}} him, then {{confronts the}} tail in a pub, {{only to discover}} the man is his minder, Hengel (Peter Carsten).

50|$|The {{street is}} the same one on which Quiller's {{predecessor}} was murdered {{at the start of the}} film. <b>Quiller</b> enters the house, which appears deserted, until he notices Oktober's henchmen standing all around him. They take <b>Quiller</b> into the same room where he was held captive, and later take him down to the cellar via lift, where several men are organising the move to the organisation's new HQ. <b>Quiller</b> is horrified to see Inge has been brought there too. Oktober offers <b>Quiller</b> an ultimatum: either he reveals where the SIS base is by dawn, or both of them will be killed. <b>Quiller</b> is released back onto the dark streets to walk and ponder, surrounded by Oktober's armed men, who - while they keep their silent distance - make it impossible for him to evade them, or use any public telephone to ring his controller.|$|E
