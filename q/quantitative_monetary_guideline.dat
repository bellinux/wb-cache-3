40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{financial}} market functioning under the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) {{and the subsequent}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>monetary</b> easing policy (QMEP) conducted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). First, the estimation results of the Japanese government bond yield curve using the Black-Gorovoi-Linetsky (BGL) model show that (1) the shadow interest rate has been negative since the late 1990 s, turned upward in 2003, and has been on an uptrend since then, and (2) the first-hitting time until the negative shadow interest rate hits zero again under the risk-neutral probability {{is estimated to be}} about three months as of the end of February 2006. Second, under the ZIRP and QMEP, the risk premiums for Japanese banks have almost disappeared in short-term money markets such as the market for negotiable certificates of deposit, while they have remained in the credit default swap market and the stock market. This result supports the view that market participants have positively perceived the BOJfs ample liquidity provisions in containing the near- term defaults of banks caused by the liquidity shortage.

Specifically, we extend our previous study (Okina and Shiratsuka (2003)) by applying wavelet analysis to indicators for policy duration effect. As in the previous study, the policy duration effect was found to be highly effective in stabilizing market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, thereby reducing longer-term interest rates and flattening the yield curve.

Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced. ...|$|R

I find a significant pass-through from overnight interest rates to banking interest rates denominated in domestic currency but no significant passthrough to those denominated in foreign currency.

Further, in a financial crisis there are benefits from credit policy even if the nom-inal interest has not reached the zero lower bound.

This provides for much better trade-off decisions in new product development.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the overall economic impact and transmission mechanisms of Japan's <b>quantitative</b> <b>monetary</b> easing policy (QMEP) based on Honda, Kuroki, and Tachibana (2007). A vector auto regression (VAR) model analysis {{has led to}} the following four observations. First, an increase of base money raises aggregate output. Second, the impact of the QMEP is primarily transmitted through the channels of asset prices and bank balance sheets. Not verified are the transmission channels of the bank's information production, exchange rate, or the policy duration effect. These findings confirm the results of Honda, Kuroki, and Tachibana (2007). but the identification of bank balance sheets as a transmission channel represents a new finding. Additionally, these channels were reaffirmed even when subject to more rigorous analysis. Third, the QMEP raises interest rates in the long term, which raises doubt about the validity of the policy duration effect and, in particular, the signaling effect. Fourth, even during the period when a traditional interest rate policy was being implemented, base money had an effect on aggregate output. These results suggest that Japan's monetary policy has been an effective means of easing Japan's prolonged economic downturn. ...|$|R

We incorporate Good-friend’s (2000) idea of broad liquidity services into the model by allowing the amounts of bonds with various maturities held by a household to enter its utility function. We show that the sa-tiation of money (or the zero marginal utility of money) is not {{a necessary condition for}} the one-period interest rate to reach the zero lower bound; instead, we present a weaker necessary condition that the marginal liquidity service provided by money coincides with the marginal liq-uidity service provided by the one-period bonds, both of which are not necessarily equal to zero. This result implies that massive money injection would have some influences on an equilibrium of the economy even if it does not alter the private sector’s expectations about future monetary policy.
