In 1653 another {{collection}} was published by Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson; titled Six New Plays, the volume included The Brothers, The Sisters, The Doubtful Heir, The Imposture, The Cardinal, and The Court Secret.|$|E

The order of the 12 Prophets is unusual: Hosea, Amos, Micah, Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

25|$|Evelyn's Diary {{remained}} unpublished as {{a manuscript}} until 1818. It is in a <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> containing 700 pages, covering {{the years between}} 1641 and 1697, and is continued in a smaller book – which brings the narrative down to within three weeks of its author's death. A selection from this was edited by William Bray, {{with the permission of}} the Evelyn family, in 1818, under the title of Memoirs illustrative of the Life and Writings of John Evelyn, comprising his Diary from 1641 to 1705/6, and a Selection of his Familiar Letters. Other editions followed, the most notable being those of H. B. Wheatley (1879) and Austin Dobson (3 vols, 1906).|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} is a <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> {{written on}} paper in 223 leaves; since it also contains random items {{not connected to}} the Chronicle itself (for example, poems and health advice), it was clearly a commonplace book. Still, {{the majority of the}} content makes up what has become known as the Chronicle of London, and ranges from the accession of Richard I to the deposition of Edward IV. It is predominantly London-centric, particularly pertaining to major political events such as the rebellion of Jack Cade in 1450 and the resultant 'harvest of heads' on London Bridge Gate, as the chronicle calls it. It has been suggested, in fact, that the level of detail with which it describes the revolt indicates that the author witnessed it first-hand. The chronicler likewise discusses the [...] "trayturly" [...] murder of James I of Scotland in 1437 amidst a discussion of London business, and on occasion demonstrates humour, if a politically-motivated form of it. Occasionally the author reveals a mildly sardonic view of the then king, Henry VI, although generally, [...] "the chronicler does not seem to care at all" [...] about the king (unlike, say, the author of Bale's Chronicle).|$|E
2500|$|In 1827 {{he issued}} his classic Memoir on the Geology of Central France, {{including}} the Volcanic formations of Auvergne, the Velay and the Vivarais, a <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> illustrated by maps and plates. The substance {{of this was}} reproduced in a revised and somewhat more popular form in The Geology and extinct Volcanos of Central France (1858). [...] These books were the first widely published descriptions of the Chaîne des Puys, a chain of over 70 small volcanoes in the Massif Central.|$|E

2500|$|The 8th edition was {{published}} from 1853 to 1860, with title pages for each volume dated {{the year that}} volume was printed. It contained 21 numbered volumes, with 17,957 pages and 402 plates. The index, published in 1861, was 239 pages, and was either bound alone as an unnumbered 22nd volume, or was bound together with volume I, the dissertations volume. Four of these dissertations were carried over from the 7th edition, and two were new to the 8th. The five included in volume 1 of the 8th (1853) were authored by Dugald Stewart, James Mackintosh, Richard Whately, John Playfair, and John Leslie, in that order, with the Whately work being a new one. A sixth dissertation, by J.D. Forbes, was issued in 1856, in a separate <b>quarto</b> <b>volume,</b> [...] "gratis, along with Vol. XII".|$|E
2500|$|After several attacks purportedly by the Jesuits, in 1607 a new {{attempt was}} made. In 1594 Scaliger had {{published}} his Epistola de vetustate et splendore gentis Scaligerae et JC Scaligeri vita. In 1601 Gaspar Scioppius, {{then in the}} service of the Jesuits published his Scaliger Hypobolimaeus ("The Supposititious Scaliger"), a <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> of more than four hundred pages. The author purports to point out five hundred lies in the Epistola de vetustate of Scaliger, but the main argument of the book is to show the falsity of his pretensions to be of the family of La Scala, and of the narrative of his father's early life. [...] "No stronger proof," [...] says Pattison, [...] "can be given of the impressions produced by this powerful philippic, dedicated to the defamation of an individual, than that it had been the source from which the biography of Scaliger, as it now stands in our biographical collections, has mainly flowed." ...|$|E

Grandclaude's work (Paris, 1882-3) is practically a compendium of Schmalzgrueber.|$|R

50|$|Although {{described}} as a “dictionary”, the work is better {{described as}} an encyclopaedia, with signed articles sometimes several pages in length. It is a substantial work, with five <b>quarto</b> <b>volumes</b> each of about 900 pages.

The Ferrarese are more jealous of their claims since the animosity of Denina, arising from a cause which their apologists mysteriously hint is not unknown to them, ventured to degrade their soil and climate to a Boeotian in capacity for all spiritual productions. A <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> has been called forth by the detraction, and this supplement to Barotti's Memoirs of the illustrious Ferarrese, has been considered a triumphant reply to the [...] "Quadro Storico Statistico dell' Alta Italia." ...|$|E

60|$|To {{a person}} who, in this presumptuous, trifling, and {{conceited}} spirit, has composed a <b>quarto</b> <b>volume</b> {{full of the}} greatest absurdities and grossest obscenities ever impressed on paper, it was {{the pleasure of the}} most Christian Monarch to consign the most absolute power which could be exercised on these poor people; and he might with as much prudence have turned a ravenous wolf upon an undefended flock, of whom the animal was the natural enemy, as they were his natural prey. The priest, as well as the ignorant peasant, fell under the suspicion of this fell Commission; and De Lancre writes, with much complacency, that the accused were brought to trial to the number of forty in one day--with what chance of escape, when the judges were blinded with prejudice, and could only hear the evidence and the defence through the medium of an interpreter, the understanding of the reader may easily anticipate.|$|E
