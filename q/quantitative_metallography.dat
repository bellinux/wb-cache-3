Experiments were conducted in which the neutron beam continuously passed through a specially designed layered sample, the temperature of which could be controlled to allow for a high-temperature austenization treatment followed by accelerated cooling to an isothermal transformation temperature in the range of 275 - 450 degrees C. It was possible to measure the volume fraction of the face-centred cubic (fcc) and body-centred cubic (bcc) phases and the carbon concentration of the fcc phase by characterizing the neutron Bragg edges in the transmitted beam. This provides a technique for in situ continuous measurements on the decomposition of austentite.

In this research, macro-segregation and primary Fe-containing intermetallic peritectic transformations in an Al- 19 wt pct Si- 4 wt pct Fe alloy were investigated without and with USMT. Macrostructural examination showed that in the absence of USMT the ingot revealed considerable non-uniform distribution of both the primary Fe-containing intermetallic and primary Si particles, whereas the ingot with USMT exhibited near homogeneous distribution of both primary phases, i. e., reduced macro-segregation. The beneficial effect of USMT on relieving macro-segregation was further examined using <b>quantitative</b> microstructural <b>metallography</b> and the results indicated that the area fraction, number density, and size distribution of both primary phases became essentially uniform across the ingot after USMT. USMT further exerted a significant impact on the constitution of the primary Fe-containing intermetallics, where complex particles of delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 /beta-Al 5 FeSi were prominent without USMT, while few delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles were observed after USMT and the primary Fe-containing intermetallics existed mostly as the single-phase beta-Al 5 FeSi. The underlying reason was attributed to the reduction in the size of the primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles which ensures the complete transformation of most primary delta-Al 3 FeSi 2 particles to the peritectic beta-Al 5 FeSi phase.

40|$|Metastable {{austenitic}} stainless steels undergo a strain-induced martensitic transformation, where the metastable austenite phase is transformed to the thermodynamically more stable α'-martensite phase due to plastic deformation. The strain-induced martensitic transformation enhances the work hardening of the metastable {{austenitic stainless}} steels, and affects their ductility. This thesis concentrated {{on the effects of}} the strain-induced martensitic transformation on the mechanical properties of the metastable {{austenitic stainless steels}}, focussing on the interaction between the strain-induced martensitic transformation and the work hardening. The effects of chemical composition, temperature and strain rate on the strain-induced martensitic transformation were studied. The experiments were carried out on the steel grades EN 1. 4318 (AISI 301 LN) and EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304). Mechanical testing was performed by means of uniaxial tensile tests at temperatures ranging between − 40 and + 80 °C and at strain rates ranging between 3 × 10 − 4 and 200 s− 1. The α'-martensite volume fractions were measured with a Ferritescope. X-ray diffraction was used for phase identification, dislocation density measurements and to measure the stacking fault energies of the test materials. Microstructure investigations were carried out by means of the scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and optical metallography. Load distribution between the phases was studied by in-situ X-ray diffraction stress measurements. The effects of applied stress and the stacking fault energy on the formation of the shear bands, acting as the nucleation sites for the α'-martensite, were demonstrated by using the model developed by Byun (2003). An excellent correlation between the theoretical predictions and the scanning electron microscopy findings was found. The suppression of the strain-induced α'-martensite transformation with increasing strain rate and temperature was attributed to the temperature dependence of the stacking fault energy. A direct relationship between the work-hardening rate and the rate of the α'-martensite transformation was found. The α'-martensite transformation was concluded to govern the uniform elongation by affecting the work-hardening rate. In the optimum condition the transformation effectively shifts the intersection of the stress-strain and work-hardening curves to higher strains. The higher was the transformation rate, the higher was the work-hardening rate. The dislocation density of the austenite phase was found to increase with increasing plastic strain and stress. Instead, the dislocation density of the α'-martensite was substantially higher and remained relatively constant. The work hardening sequence of the metastable steels was divided in four stages. During the first stage, the work-hardening rate decreased rapidly due to the dynamic softening effect caused by the strain-induced α'-martensite transformation. During the stage II, the work-hardening rate started to increase due to the dispersion hardening caused by the strain-induced α'-martensite. The dispersion hardening effect was analysed by means of <b>quantitative</b> optical <b>metallography</b> and the theory developed by Ashby (1971). At the onset of the stage III, the α'-martensite forms a percolating cluster extending through the whole body. This manifested itself by an abrupt change in the relations between the flow stress, α'-martensite volume fraction and dislocation density of the austenite. During the stage III the work-hardening rate continued to increase. The stage IV was related to the high α'-martensite volume fractions, where the α'-martensite became the matrix phase, and the work-hardening rate started to decrease. Metastabiileissa austeniittisissa ruostumattomissa teräksissä tapahtuu plastisen venymän vaikutuksesta faasimuutos, jossa huoneenlämpötilassa pysyvä austeniittifaasi transformoituu termodynaamisesti stabiilimmaksi α'-martensiitiksi. Martensiittitransformaation takia metastabiilit austeniittiset ruostumattomat teräkset muokkauslujittuvat voimakkaasti. Väitöskirjan tavoitteena oli tarkastella venymän aiheuttaman martensiittitransformaation vaikutusta metastabiilien austeniittisten ruostumattomien terästen mekaanisiin ominaisuuksiin, keskittyen erityisesti martensiittitransformaation ja muokkauslujittumisen väliseen yhteyteen. Lisäksi tutkittiin kemiallisen koostumuksen, lämpötilan ja muodonmuutosnopeuden vaikutusta martensiittitransformaatioon. Koemateriaaleina käytettiin teräslaatuja EN 1. 4318 (AISI 301 LN) ja EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304). Koemateriaalien mekaanisia ominaisuuksia tutkittiin vetokokein. α'-martensiitin faasiosuus määritettiin ferriittimittarilla. Röntgendiffraktiomittauksia käytettiin ε- ja α'-martensiittifaasien havaitsemiseen, dislokaatiotiheysmittauksiin ja terästen pinousvian pintaenergian mittaukseen. Muokkauksessa syntyneitä mikrorakenteita tutkittiin käyttäen pyyhkäisy- ja läpivalaisuelektronimikroskopiaa sekä optista metallografiaa. Jännitysten jakautumista faasien välillä vetomuodonmuutoksen aikana tarkasteltiin in situ jännitysmittauksin röntgendiffraktion avulla. Lämpötilan ja muodonmuutosnopeuden kasvaessa α'-martensiittia havaittiin muodostuvan vähemmän. Tämä johtui pääasiassa pinousvian pintaenergian lämpötilariippuvuudesta. Muokkauslujittumisen ja α'-martensiittitransformaation välillä havaittiin suora yhteys. Mitä suurempi transformaationopeus oli, sitä nopeampaa oli muokkauslujittuminen. Martensiittitransformaatio vaikutti terästen tasavenymään muokkauslujittumisnopeuden kautta. Venymän ja jännityksen kasvaessa austeniitin dislokaatiotiheys kasvoi, mutta α'-martensiitin dislokaatiotiheys pysyi melko muuttumattomana ja oli alusta lähtien selvästi suurempi kuin austeniitin. α'-martensiitin todettiin lujittavan teräksiä kahdella eri mekanismilla: α'-martensiittipitoisuuden ollessa alle 30 % luja martensiittifaasi dispersiolujittaa pehmeämpää austeniittia, ja plastinen muodonmuutos tapahtuu pääasiassa austeniitin deformaation välityksellä. α'-martensiittipitoisuuden ylittäessä 30 % α'-martensiitti muodostaa perkoloivan klusterin, joka ulottuu läpi koko materiaalin. Näin ollen materiaali ei voi muokkautua ilman, että myös lujempi α'-martensiitti muokkautuu. Tämä ilmenee yhä nopeampana muokkauslujittumisena. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to study the grain growth during {{reheating}} and phase transformation behaviour during continuous cooling of austenite in five microalloyed steels. Two of these steels were supplied in as-cast slab {{as well as in}} controlled rolled plate conditions. These steels contained similar levels of C (~ 0. 07 %), Ti (~ 0. 013 %) and Mo (~ 0. 2 %) but had different levels of Mn (1. 1 to 1. 7 %) and Nb (0. 03 % to 0. 06 %) contents. The principal aim of this work was to simulate as closely as possible the controlled rolling schedule used in industry for the production of plates in laboratory. Laboratory process simulation was carried out using quench and deformation dilatometry. Continuous cooling transformation behaviour of the undeformed as well as thermomechanically processed austenite was investigated from the dilatometric data, <b>quantitative</b> optical <b>metallography</b> and microhardness tests. Continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of the undeformed and thermomechanically processed steels were constructed. Effects of thermomechanical processing (TMP), accelerated cooling and Mn and Nb contents on austenite transformation critical temperature (Ar 3), phase transformation kinetics, CCT diagrams, grain size and hardness were investigated. The experimental work on the grain growth of austenite during reheating involved mainly the determination of Grain Coarsening Temperatures (GCT) for various microalloyed steels. It was found that the conventional method of detecting the GCT from the mean grain size v/s reheating temperature plot was inadequate in locating the abnormal grain growth in some microalloyed steels. An alternative quantitative metallographic method which consists of plotting the mean size of the largest grain function of reheating temperature was therefore developed. The new method was found to be more effective and sensitive in detecting the abnormal grain growth in all microalloyed steels studied. The factors in addition to precipitate dissolution and coarsening which influence the GCT of microalloyed steels were investigated. It was found that a high heterogeneity ratio (Z) present in the initial austenite grain structure (prior to coarsening) can result in lowering the GCT significantly. The reasons why different steels exhibit different values of heterogeneity ratios were also investigated. was found that microstructural features before reheating influences the α→γ transformation which results in different values of Z in different steels. In slab steels, microstructure containing coarse ferrite grains and a small volume fraction of acicular ferrite + pearlite resulted in a high value of Z. In case of plate steels, microstructure consisting of heterogeneous distribution of ferrite grain sizes and a non-uniform distribution of pearlite (banded microstructure) led to the generation of high Z in austenite grain sizes. Grain growth behaviour of plate steels was found to be significantly different than that of slab steels of the same composition. Plate steels exhibited two stages of accelerated grain growth compared to only one stage of accelerated grain growth found in slab steels. Also, abnormal grain growth in plate steels was found to be not as significant as that in slab steels. Empirical mathematical models to predict the grain growth of austenite were critically reviewed. It was found that, for the same starting conditions, predictions from these models differ from one other considerably. Furthermore, none of the models could adequately describe the grain growth behaviour, particularly at higher temperatures, of as-cast slabs. Basic principles of grain growth were therefore revisited in an attempt to develop a mathematical model which can account for abnormal grain growth. A model was developed which also accounts for the effect of initial grain size on the process of grain growth. Supporting mathematical models for the prediction of particle coarsening and dissolution as a function time, temperature and composition were developed. It was found that predictions based on this model were in close agreement with the experimental grain growth data. In the second part, an effort was made to characterise the TMP used in the industry for the production of controlled rolled plates and then to simulate this process as closely possible in the laboratory using quench and deformation dilatometry. Effects of TMP, accelerated cooling and alloying elements (Nb and Mn) on Ar 3 temperature, phase transformation kinetics, grain size, CCT diagrams and microhardness were investigated. It was found that the TMP accelerated the onset of γ/α transformation (γ transformation start temperature, Ar 3, was raised). However, the progress of γ/α transformation was retarded considerably in the deformed samples. TMP lowered the hardenability of austenite considerably, thus lowering the hardness of the deformed samples. TMP had pronounced effects on the CCT diagrams which include: 1. γ/α transformation was raised to higher temperatures, 2. γ/α transformation nose was shifted towards faster cooling rates; and 3. γ/α transformation occurred over a wider temperature range. TMP also refined the ferrite grain size significantly. Increase in cooling rate lowered the Ar 3 significantly and also accelerated the progress of γ transformation. Increased cooling rate allowed the transformation of γ to nonequilibrium phases such as bainite and martensite and thus increased the hardness of undeformed as well as deformed samples. Increased cooling rate was found to have marginal effect on the refinement of ferrite grain size. For similar levels of other alloying elements, an increase in N b content was found to lower the Ar 3 of undeformed samples {{at a rate of about}} 10 °C/ 0. 01 % dissolved Nb. However, in deformed samples, increase in Nb content actually raised the Ar 3 temperature. This effect was considered to be due to two main reasons: firstly, the strain induced precipitation of Nb in austenite which would act as nucleation sites for phase transformation and secondly, due to the scavenging of Nb during precipitation which decreases the hardenability of austenite. Higher Nb content retarded the progress of γ transformation of undeformed as well as deformed austenite. Increase in Nb content increased the hardness of undeformed as well as deformed samples and refined ferrite grain size marginally. Nb had no significant influence on the location of phase transformation noses in the CCT diagrams. For similar levels of other alloying elements, an increase in Mn content was found to lower the Ar 3 of undeformed samples. In contrast with Nb, increased Mn content lowered the Ar 3 of deformed samples as well, suggesting that Mn is not scavenged during the strain induced precipitation of Nb and remains dissolved in the austenite which increases its hardenability. Increase in Mn content retarded the progress of transformation of undeformed as well as deformed samples. Increased Mn content increased the hardness of both undeformed and deformed samples significantly. Mn also refined ferrite grain size. Bs temperature was significantly lowered due to a higher Mn content. Increase in Mn content pushed the polygonal ferrite nose in CCT diagrams to slower cooling rates which indicates increased hardenability of austenite and thus counters the effect of TMP which decreases the hardenability...|$|R

This work employs <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography</b> on a much wider scale to provide better quality control of deposit microstructures...|$|E
40|$|The Ni – base {{superalloys}} {{are used}} in aircraft industry for production of aero engine most stressed parts, as are turbine blades. From this reason a dendrite arm spacing, carbides size and distribution, morphology, number and value of γ ′- phase are very important structural characteristics for blade lifetime prediction as well as aero engine its self. In this article are used methods of <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography</b> (software LUCIA for carbides evaluation, measuring of secondary dendrite arm spacing and coherent testing grid for γ ′- phase evaluation) for evaluation of structural characteristics mentioned above on experimental material Inconel IN 738. The high temperature effect and cooling rate on structural characteristics and application of quantitative methods evaluation are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|A {{programme}} {{of research}} was undertaken {{to identify the}} mechanisms of formation of voids and defects in aluminium alloy C 354 and C 355 castings. The following aspects of the material processing were studied as independent and linked effects: casting technique and associated variables, hot isostatic pressing cycle parameters, and heat treatment cycle. Microstructure related driving forces for defect formation were quantified using differential scanning calorimetry and <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography</b> and surface effects investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was shown that by controlling key variables within casting, the component can become less sensitive to subsequent defect evolution from further thermal processing. Optimised parameters were defined and the mechanism of defect formation elucidated. A Non Destructive Testing (NDT) method {{for the detection of}} defects within C 354 components was developed...|$|E
40|$|Work was {{undertaken}} to establish reliable time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams for the cast duplex stainless steels CD 3 MN and CD 3 MWCuN. The latter contains higher Cr, Ni, and Mo contents {{compared to the}} former. The TTT diagrams for sigma-phase formation in both alloys were developed based on <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography</b> results from optical and scanning electron microscopy. The kinetics of sigma-phase {{were found to be}} much faster in CD 3 MWCuN alloys than in CD 3 MN. An Avrami analysis was employed to assess transformation characteristics and to refine the TTT diagram determination. Theoretical prediction of phase equilibria using the thermodynamic software package ThermoCalc was compared to the amount of sigma phase observed experimentally from long-term heat treatments. The constructed TTT diagrams of the cast alloys were compared to wrought counterpart alloys...|$|E
40|$|The {{permeable}} element method (PEM), as {{the development}} of an arbitrary Eulerian-Lagrangian finite element approximation, intended for the description of densification of porous bodies, is elaborated. The Eulerian frame of reference, for which the material movement is independent of the movement of a discretizing network, is the basis for the consideration of the deformation process. The shape of the elements and network movement are deliberately determined {{from the point of view}} of convenience for the analysis of the calculation results. Using the PEM, the pressing of hollow cylinders in a rigid die is considered. The computed spatial density distributions are compared with the experimental data obtained, using <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography</b> analysis. The problem of pressing an article of a stepped shape is solved. The peculiarities of material flow and density distributions are discussed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} {{described in}} this thesis {{is concerned with the}} identification of the products of isothermal transformation of austenite containing 1. 44 % C, at temperatures just above and just below the Ms temperature, and determination of the isothermal transformation diagram for this range of temperatures. In part A of the thesis, the literature relevant to the martensite and lowerbainite transformations is reviewed, with particular emphasis being placed on those features of each transformation which may possibly be used to identify the product. It is concluded that habit plane measurements offer the most suitable experimental means for identification of the products. In part B the experimental techniques of <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallography,</b> for habit plane measurements, and optical and electron microscopy, for study of the morphology and internal inhomogeneities of the products, are described...|$|E
