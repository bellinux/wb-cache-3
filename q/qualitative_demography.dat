40|$|Background : Automated text {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} across the social sciences, yet the application of these methods has largely proceeded independently of qualitative analysis. Objective : This paper explores the advantages of applying automated {{text analysis}} to augment traditional <b>qualitative</b> methods in <b>demography.</b> Computational text analysis does not replace close reading or subjective theorizing, but it can provide a complementary set of tools that we believe will be appealing for qualitative demographers. Methods : We apply topic modeling to text data from the Malawi Journals Project as a case study. Results : We examine three common issues that demographers face in analyzing qualitative data: large samples, the challenge of comparing qualitative data across external categories, and making data analysis transparent and readily accessible to other scholars. We discuss ways that new tools from machine learning and computer science might help qualitative scholars to address these issues. Conclusions : We {{believe that there is}} great promise in mixed-method approaches to analyzing text. New methods that allow better access to data and new ways to approach qualitative data are likely to be fertile ground for research. Contribution : No research, to our knowledge, has used automated text analysis to take an explicitly mixed-method approach to the analysis of textual data. We develop a framework that allows qualitative researchers to do so...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the meaning of}} the phrase "the woman’s status in the society" that is recognized in demography as an important cultural factor of demographic development and transitional changes. The analysis indicates qualitative shifts in the woman’s status and simultaneously reveals its importance at present, not only in traditional, but also in modern and developed societies. On the other hand, it explains the importance of sex as a biodemographic determinant, and introduces the concept of gender that sheds another light on the concepts of sex and woman’s status in the society and integrates them. Gender regimes that subsume the inferiority of women in public and private social structures are examined from demographic perspective, albeit only in those phenomenological aspects that can be supported by demographic research, theories, and analyses. To this end, the paper {{analyzes the}} effects of strengthening gender equalities on the fertility and mortality transitions, the gender’s impact on the population distribution by sex in South Asian countries, and highlights the key role of gender in interpreting certain social and economic structures. It also stresses the establishing of gender equality as an important element of population policies. The global dimension of the patriarchal society is illustrated through a series of examples of demographic phenomena from various societies. Gender regimes underlie all of these phenomena. The paper puts foreword certain theoretical hypotheses about gender inequalities, and finds their connections with demographic behaviors and demographic indicators. Finally, it summarizes the role of demography in gender (in) equality research and the demographic perspective of the way and the speed the demographic equality is being established. Demography is seen as an irreplaceable discipline in examining gender inequalities, especially at the global level. With the advance of <b>qualitative</b> methods in <b>demography</b> and with its multidisciplinary nature, demography gets {{closer and closer to the}} field of "woman issues"...|$|R
