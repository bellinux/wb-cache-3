The methodology for analyzing the interview data followed recommendations in Kvale and Brinkmann (2009) and Mason (2002). The interview transcripts were read for each participant individually and also across participants when identifying recurrent patterns and themes. Information regarding approaches to study as well as the reasons given for these approaches was highlighted and coded according to categories that evolved during the process of analysis. The approach was both inductive and deductive; in other words, themes emerged from the data without a priori hypotheses but the researcher also had some expectations of what the data may reveal based on knowledge of the test, the context, and previous research. All English translations provided in this report were checked for accuracy by a native speaker of Japanese who was proficient in English.|$|E

The present study examines the social influential factors on individual’s level of professional ethics in the workplace. For this purpose, 400 workers in both branches of industrial townships of Ardabil participated in this study. The data for this study was collected from administering a researcher-made questionnaire (consisting of 78 <b>questions),</b> <b>interview,</b> and observation. The findings revealed that socio-cultural factors primarily and individual-personality factors secondarily, affect the person’s work ethics.

In particular, the number of times the challenge question was used per task was recorded, as was the number of times the transparent authentication method was deactivated. These values were expected to vary depending on category. Those in the “All” category, for instance, should not have needed to turn off security or answer the challenge question. The participants in the “None” category, however, may have overridden the mechanism by using the challenge question several times before turning off the mechanism altogether. Once the participants had completed all tasks, they were asked a series of questions about their experience in a semi-structured interview (see Appendix A: interview <b>questions).</b> <b>Interview</b> questions explored candidate attitudes towards mobile phone security in general and attempted to gauge initial impressions about the acceptability of a transparent authentication mechanism controlling access on a mobile device.|$|E
