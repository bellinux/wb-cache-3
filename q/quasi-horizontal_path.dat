40|$|Two {{numerical}} {{models of}} aircraft performance are developed to relate atmospheric wind signals in wind-shear situations to aircraft response. Both models produce time histories of pitch angle, airspeed, height above the ground, and other parameters for simulating aircraft making precision approaches along a 3 -deg glide slope to the runway. Simulations conducted using thunderstorm environment wind {{data indicate that}} the horizontal wind component {{is at least as}} important as the vertical component in determining aircraft response to wind shear. Obtaining quantitative measurements of aircraft approach or departure quality is found to depend on several factors, including the knowledge of winds along the expected flight track, clear-air detection in a <b>quasi-horizontal</b> <b>path,</b> and a near continuous estimate of approach deterioration due to shear conditions...|$|E
40|$|Global {{analyses}} {{from the}} European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) {{are used to}} analyze the sequence of events leading {{to the creation of a}} large-scale reversal of potential vorticity (PV) gradients across the subtropical tropopause on 10 June 1992 over the North Pacific. The ‘‘reversed’ ’ (i. e., southward directed) PV gradients across the tropopause initially appeared at 1200 UTC on 10 June, the time herein designated as the ‘‘onset’ ’ of this event, at 258 N near the date line. Maps of PV are shown to highlight the evolution of a mobile Rossby wave packet during its migration across eastern Asia toward the subtropical Pacific during the several days prior to onset. With explicit regard to the validity of linear theory and the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin–Jeffreys approximation, wave activity flux diag-nostics are employed to assess the propagation characteristics of this disturbance during that time. Following its departure from eastern Asia, much of the wave activity associated with the packet traveled southeastward along a <b>quasi-horizontal</b> <b>path</b> to the subtropical Pacific, above 300 hPa. A Hovmöller diagram of PV at 350 K is used to estimate the eastward phase speed (cx) of the PV anomalies in the wave packet during its upper-level transit. The spatial distribution of 2 cx, where symbolizes the basic-state zonal wind, suggests that theu u generation of reversed PV gradients over the subtropical Pacific in this case was a result of the wave packet’...|$|E
