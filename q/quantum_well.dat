25|$|If {{the middle}} layer is made thin enough, {{it acts as}} a <b>quantum</b> <b>well.</b> This means that the {{vertical}} variation of the electron's wavefunction, and thus a component of its energy, is quantized. The efficiency of a <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> laser is {{greater than that of}} a bulk laser because the density of states function of electrons in the <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> system has an abrupt edge that concentrates electrons in energy states that contribute to laser action.|$|E
25|$|A <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> laser is a {{laser diode}} in which the active region of the device is so narrow that quantum {{confinement}} occurs.

Electroluminescence of GaAsPN/GaPN and GaAsP/GaP <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> is first presented. Nitrogen {{is found to}} induce large bandgap bowing in the bandstructure as well as spectacular enhancement of radiative quantum efficiency. Tight-binding bandstructure calculations are then presented which reveal N-induced large bandgap modification. N-localised levels are supposed to play significant role in carrier injection inside GaAsPN/GaPN <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> while disorder alloying effects also participate to the achievement of such a high quantum efficiency. GaAsP/GaP and GaAsPN/GaPN <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> are finally grown on Silicon substrate, very near the GaP/Si interface. High resolution transmision electron microscopy performed on GaAsP/GaP/Si <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> indicate good strain status, as well as GaP/Si interface originating defects. Photoluminescence is finally detected at 810 nm up to 230 K on silicon substrate from GaAsPN/GaPN <b>quantum</b> <b>wells.</b> This is explained by both a better carrier injection efficiency related to N-localized energy levels {{as well as a}} higher quantum efficiency than GaAsP/GaP/Si <b>quantum</b> <b>wells...</b>|$|R

25|$|Specifically, {{the quantum}} well’s {{behavior}} can be represented by the particle in a finite well model. Two boundary conditions must be selected. The first is that the wave function must be continuous. Often, the second boundary condition is chosen to be the derivative of the wave function must be continuous across the boundary, {{but in the case}} of the <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> the masses are different on either side of the boundary. Instead, the second boundary condition is chosen to conserve particle flux as, which is consistent with experiment. The solution to the finite well particle in a box must be solved numerically, resulting in wave functions that are sine functions inside the <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> and exponentially decaying functions in the barriers. This quantization of the energy levels of the electrons allows a <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> laser to emit light more efficiently than conventional semiconductor lasers.|$|E

25|$|In {{a quantum}} cascade laser, the {{difference}} between <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> energy levels {{is used for the}} laser transition instead of the bandgap.

25|$|The {{problem with}} the simple <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> diode {{described}} above is that the thin layer is simply too small to effectively confine the light.

40|$|Hole spin {{relaxation}} in p-type (111) GaAs <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> is {{investigated in}} the case with only the lowest hole subband, which is heavy-hole like in (111) GaAs/AlAs and light-hole like in (111) GaAs/InP <b>quantum</b> <b>wells,</b> being relevant. The subband Löwdin perturbation method is applied to obtain the effective Hamiltonian including the Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings. Under a proper gate voltage, the total in-plane effective magnetic field in (111) GaAs/AlAs <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> can be strongly suppressed in the whole momentum space, while the one in (111) GaAs/InP <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> can be suppressed only on a special momentum circle. The hole spin relaxation due to the D'yakonov-Perel' and Elliott-Yafet mechanisms is calculated {{by means of the}} fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equation approach with all the relevant scatterings explicitly included. For (111) GaAs/AlAs <b>quantum</b> <b>wells,</b> extremely long heavy-hole spin relaxation time (upto hundreds of nanoseconds) is predicted. In addition, we predict a pronounced peak in the gate-voltage dependence of the heavy-hole spin relaxation time due to the D'yakonov-Perel' mechanism. This peak origins from the suppression of the unique inhomogeneous broadening in (111) GaAs/AlAs <b>quantum</b> <b>wells.</b> Moreover, the Elliott-Yafet mechanism influences the spin relaxation only around the peak area due to the small spin mixing between the heavy and light holes in <b>quantum</b> <b>wells</b> with small well width. We also show the anisotropy of the spin relaxation. In (111) GaAs/InP <b>quantum</b> <b>wells,</b> a mild peak, similar to the case for electrons in (111) GaAs <b>quantum</b> <b>wells,</b> is also predicted in the gate-voltage dependence of the light-hole spin relaxation time.

25|$|Physical chemists often model {{bonding with}} the quantum {{harmonic}} oscillator, simplifying a hydrogen-hydrogen bond as two balls {{connected by a}} spring. The quantum harmonic oscillator is itself based on Hooke's Law and acts as a good approximation of the Morse potential that accurately describes bonding. Modeling hydrogen and deuterium in a chemical reaction demonstrates the energy distributions of isotopes in products and reactants. Lower energy levels for the heavier isotope deuterium can be explained mathematically by the harmonic oscillator's dependence on the inverse of the reduced mass, denoted μ. Thus, a larger reduced mass is a larger denominator and thus a smaller zero point energy and a lower energy state in the <b>quantum</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this energy {{distribution}} manifest in the kinetic isotope effect and the equilibrium isotope effect. In a reversible reaction, under equilibrium conditions, the reaction will proceed forwards and backwards, distributing the isotopes to minimize thermodynamic free energy. Some time later, at equilibrium, more heavy isotopes {{will be on the}} product side. The stability of the lower energy drives the products to be enriched in deuterium relative to reactants. Conversely, under kinetic conditions, reactions are generally irreversible. The limiting step in the reaction is overcoming the activation energy barrier to reach an intermediate state. The lighter isotope has a higher energy state in the <b>quantum</b> <b>well</b> and will thus be preferentially formed into products. Thus under kinetic conditions the product will be relatively depleted in deuterium.|$|E
