Additionally, each Member of Parliament is entitled to table <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answer.</b> Written questions are addressed to the Ministerial head of a government department, usually a Secretary of State, but they are often answered by a Minister of State or Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

Nevertheless, the Chamber's ethnic composition {{has become more}} reflective {{of the general population}} {{as a result of the}} 2005 and 2010 parliamentary elections. The paper seeks to map and explain variations in the extent to which BAME Members of Parliament (MPs) use the Chamber to articulate issues relevant to minority constituents. We compare the content of all parliamentary <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answer</b> asked by BAME MPs between May 2005 and December 2011 to the questions asked by a matching sample of non-minority legislators. We find that BAME MPs ask more questions relating to the problems and rights of ethnic minorities in, and immigration to, the UK. However, we also find that all British MPs are responsive to the interests of minority constituents where these are geographically concentrated. Building on theoretical predictions derived from (a) models focusing on MPs’ political socialisation and (b) on the electoral incentives they are facing, we discover that the MPs in our sample respond systematically to electoral incentives, especially in the politically salient area of immigration policy. While these findings are in line with an ’electoral-incentives model’, whereas a ‘socialisation model’ is better suited to explain the larger number of questions on the interests of ethnic minorities asked by Labour MPs...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Oxford University Press via the DOI in this record. The substantive representation of minority groups in national legislatures is a topic of significant normative, theoretical and empirical importance. Addressing this question, {{this article focuses on}} what drives Members of the UK House of Commons to raise issues on concern for Jewish and Muslim minority groups in relatively low-cost parliamentary activity, i. e. Parliamentary <b>Questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answers</b> (WPQs). Drawing on the suggested positive relationship between descriptive and substantive minority representation (e. g., Hansard, 2009 a), it uses content and statistical analysis to examine if having a Jewish or Muslim background impacts on the frequency and the probability of MPs’ engagement with minority issues, and how this effect compares to that from institutional predictors, namely the party parliamentary status and the minority presence in a constituency. The findings demonstrate that a religious minority background has a limited impact on MPs’ engagement with minority issues in WPQs, being inferior to that of institutional predictors Being in Opposition, in particular, has a consistent, positive influence on the content of WPQs, whereby Opposition MPs table more WPQs on the issues of minority concern that Members from the party of Government...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} parliamentary representation of Jewish and Muslim minorities. It is assessed drawing upon the behaviour of MPs from Jewish and Muslim backgrounds and their engagement {{with issues of}} concern for the respective minority in high- and low-cost parliamentary activities. The analysis is conducted on the content of 96 votes, 708, 429 Parliamentary <b>Questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answers</b> (WPQs), and 5, 160 Early Day Motions (EDMs). Voting divisions are examined using methods of descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis, whereas relational, computer-aided, dictionary-based content analysis with time series cross-sectional data analysis is applied to examine the content of EDMs and WPQs. The analysis demonstrates that coming from a religious minority background has a limited impact on the behaviour of MPs and is largely inferior to the institutional predictors of behaviour, such as legislative role and the party-related predictors. This suggests that MPs from Jewish and Muslim backgrounds do not necessarily act for their minority groups driven by their heritage alone. Instead, MPs’ engagement with minority issues depends on their duties, responsibilities and party affiliations, even when the party discipline is loosened. The findings of the research have significant policy implications. They show that the presence of minority politicians in a legislature does not necessarily lead to better substantive representation of these minority groups through minority MPs’ engagement with minority issues. That is because minority parliamentarians are bound by the same constraints {{as the rest of the}} House, which reduces their ability to deliver expertise on minority issues...|$|R

During assembling the <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> verification, many teachers nowadays help themselves using different test generators like Hot Potatoes, Moodle, Test Pilot, and others, they are all available on internet. At the Pedagogical faculty of the University of Ljubljana at the study courses Programing I and Programing II (in continuation: Programing) a teacher do not use any test generator during assembling <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> verification. This means that <b>for</b> assembling new <b>written</b> <b>questions,</b> a teacher has to use a lot of imagination and has to take time needed. A requirement to reduce a teacher's working load during further assembling of exam <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>written</b> verification lead us to the topic for this diploma thesis which is development of a generator of text assignments. The generator is specific for generating text assignments for programing languages Pascal, C, and JavaScript. To acquire the information about what should be the features of our generator, we first performed a few interviews with a few university teachers, and made the analysis of exam questions and assignments which appeared during written examinations in the past years. We originated from the features being the main characteristics of some generators readily available on internet. We shortly described these characteristics in the thesis and maximally considered them during development of our generator. To develop the generator, we used web server Apache, server scripting language PHP, and MYSQL system to maintain databases. At the end of diploma thesis, we performed evaluation of the developed generator, described the problems we were faced with during its development, and listed suggestions for its upgrading. ...|$|R

40|$|Verbal {{reports are}} a common method of data {{collection}} in studies of mathematics learning, often in studies with a longitudinal component or those employing microgenetic methods where several observations of problem-solving are made over a short period of time. Whilst there is a fairly substantial literature on reactivity to verbal reports, addressing concerns that the production of verbal reports will change the behaviour that participants are reporting on, little of this literature addresses the question of how verbal reports might affect subsequent trials (what we would like to call second-order reactivity). In order to address the issues of both first- and second-order reactivity, ninety-nine 14 -year-old participants were asked to provide answers to a set of six questions on two occasions, one week apart. Fifty-eight participants were asked <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answers</b> and explanations, while 41 participants were asked for both concurrent and retrospective verbal reports. The results show evidence for both first- and second-order reactivity. The distribution of strategies employed in the first session was different for the two conditions and there were some interesting differences in patterns of strategy selection across the two sessions. These findings have some important implications for the use of verbal reports over multiple trials...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: {{dyslexia}} is {{a learning}} disorder, the primary sign {{of which is}} significant difficulty in learning to read and spell. However, accumulating evidence suggests that many people with dyslexia can overcome their reading difficulties and enjoy high levels of educational success. There is debate about the appropriateness of different forms of summative assessment for people with dyslexia, {{but there is little}} research investigating different examination formats, particularly in higher education, including medical education. Currently, medical school examinations comprise a range of different assessments, both written and performance-based, offering an opportunity to compare performance on different formats. This study compared results between students with and without dyslexia on all summative assessment types used at one UK medical school. METHODS: examination scores were collated for all summative Year 1 and 2 examinations at Hull York Medical School (HYMS) over four cohorts entering from 2004 to 2007. These included scores on two types of forced-choice question (multiple-choice and extended matching question) examinations, on short <b>written</b> <b>answer</b> examinations and on performance in a 16 -station objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). Results <b>for</b> <b>written</b> <b>answers</b> were gathered separately <b>for</b> basic science <b>questions</b> and <b>for</b> <b>questions</b> involving critical analysis and evidence-based medicine. RESULTS: an overall multivariate analysis of covariance (mancova) on examinations across both years controlling for gender, ethnicity and age on entry indicated that there was no significant overall effect of dyslexia on examination results. Regression analysis further showed that dyslexia was not a significant predictor on any of the examination forms in Year 1 or Year 2. CONCLUSIONS: {{there is no indication that}} any of the assessment methods used in HYMS, in common with many other medical schools, disadvantage students with dyslexia in comparison with their peers. In the light of these findings, we support the current view that a variety of assessment types should be included in the assessment of all medical students, as is already considered to be best practice...|$|R

By using the Startup Work-book by Startups in the Startup Center Saxion (part of the Center for Entrepreneurship) it was revealed that one has a need to really use it as a workbook.
