5|$|A {{pressing}} issue {{not resolved}} by Wilson was the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> towards Bolshevik Russia. The U.S. had {{been among the}} nations that had sent troops there after the Russian Revolution. Afterwards, Wilson refused to recognize the Russian SFSR. Under Harding, Commerce Secretary Hoover, with considerable experience of Russian affairs, took the lead on policy. When famine struck Russia in 1921, Hoover had the American Relief Administration, which he had headed, negotiate with the Russians to provide aid. Soviet leaders (the U.S.S.R. was established in 1922) hoped in vain that the agreement would lead to recognition. Hoover supported trade with the Soviets, fearing U.S. companies would be frozen out of the Soviet market, but Hughes opposed this, and the matter was not resolved under Harding's presidency.|$|E
5|$|When Stanley Baldwin {{retired in}} May 1937, Chamberlain {{took his place}} as Prime Minister. His premiership was {{dominated}} by the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among Britons at the time. When Hitler continued his aggression, Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought Britain into war when Germany attacked Poland in 1939. Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 after the Allies were forced to retreat from Norway, as he believed that a government supported by all parties was essential, and the Labour and Liberal parties would not join a government headed by him. He was succeeded by Winston Churchill but remained very well-regarded in Parliament, especially among Conservatives. Before ill-health forced him to resign, he was an important member of Churchill's War Cabinet, heading it in the new premier's absence. Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram differentia {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better differentia was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E

No. 1, , the United States Supreme Court stated: [...] "There are no hard-and-fast {{standards}} {{governing the}} allocation {{of the burden of}} proof in every situation. The issue, rather, 'is merely a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> and fairness based on experience in the different situations.'" [...] For support, the Court cited 9 John H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2486, at 275 (3d ed. 1940). In Keyes, the Supreme Court held that if [...] "school authorities have been found to have practised purposeful segregation in part of a school system," [...] the burden of persuasion shifts to the school to prove that it did not engage in such discrimination in other segregated schools in the same system.|$|E
2500|$|Hart and Honore, {{in their}} famous work Causation in the Law, also tackle {{the problem of}} 'too many causes'. [...] For them, there are degrees of causal contribution. [...] A member of the NESS set is a [...] "causally {{relevant}} condition". [...] This is elevated into a [...] "cause" [...] where it is a deliberate human intervention, or an abnormal act in the context. [...] So, returning to our hunter example, hunter A's grandmother's birth is a causally relevant condition, but not a [...] "cause". [...] On the other hand, hunter A's gunshot, being a deliberate human intervention in the ordinary state of affairs, is elevated {{to the status of}} [...] "cause". [...] An intermediate position can be occupied by those who [...] "occasion" [...] harm, such as accomplices. [...] Imagine an accomplice to a murder who drives the principal {{to the scene of the}} crime. [...] Clearly the principal's act in committing the murder is a [...] "cause" [...] (on the but for or NESS test). [...] So is the accomplice's act in driving the principal to the scene of the crime. [...] However the causal contribution is not of the same level (and, incidentally, this provides some basis for treating principals and accomplices differently under criminal law). [...] Leon Green and Jane Stapleton are two scholars who take the opposite view. [...] They consider that once something is a [...] "but for" [...] (Green) or NESS (Stapleton) condition, that ends the factual inquiry altogether, and anything further is a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The single <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> {{on which}} General McClellan differs from Mr. Lincoln, {{stripped}} {{of the conventional}} phrases in which he drapes it, is Slavery. He can mean nothing else when he talks of [...] "conciliation and compromise," [...] of receiving back any State that may choose to return [...] "with a full guaranty of all its constitutional rights." [...] If it be true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet, it is equally true {{that there is a}} certain species of toadstool that would be none the less disgusting under whatever alias. Compromise and conciliation are both excellent things in their own way, and in the fitting time and place, but right cannot be compromised without surrendering it, and to attempt conciliation by showing the white feather ends, not in reconcilement, but subjection. The combined ignorance of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus as to what had been going on while they were in their cavern would hardly equal that of General McClellan alone as to the political history of the country. In the few months between Mr. Lincoln's election and the attack on Fort Sumter we tried conciliation in every form, carrying it almost to the verge of ignominy. The Southern leaders would have none of it. They saw in it only a confession of weakness, and were but the more arrogant in their demand of all or nothing. Compromise we tried for three quarters of a century, and it brought us to where we are, for it was only a fine name for cowardice, and invited aggression. And now that the patient is dying of this drench of lukewarm water, Doctor Sangrado McClellan gravely prescribes another gallon. If that fail to finish him, why, give him a gallon more.|$|E
60|$|This disinterested {{and wise}} {{movement}} {{is fraught with}} so many wholesome changes {{in the lives of}} the working people, and with so much good in the way of overcoming that suspicion which our own unconscious impertinence has engendered, that it is scarcely gracious to criticise details as yet; the rather, because it is indisputable that the managers of the Whitechapel establishment most thoroughly feel that they are upon their honour with the customers, as to the minutest points of administration. But, although the American stoves cannot roast, they can surely boil one kind of meat as well as another, and need not always circumscribe their boiling talents within the limits of ham and beef. The most enthusiastic admirer of those substantials, would probably not object to occasional inconstancy in respect of pork and mutton: or, especially in cold weather, to a little innocent trifling with Irish stews, meat pies, and toads in holes. Another drawback on the Whitechapel establishment, is the absence of beer. Regarded merely as a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy,</b> it is very impolitic, as having a tendency to send the working men to the public-house, where gin is reported to be sold. But, there is a much higher ground on which this absence of beer is objectionable. It expresses distrust of the working man. It is a fragment of that old mantle of patronage in which so many estimable Thugs, so darkly wandering up and down the moral world, are sworn to muffle him. Good beer is a good thing for him, he says, and he likes it; the Depot could give it him good, and he now gets it bad. Why does the Depot not give it him good? Because he would get drunk. Why does the Depot not let him have a pint with his dinner, which would not make him drunk? Because he might have had another pint, or another two pints, before he came. Now, this distrust is an affront, is exceedingly inconsistent with the confidence the managers express in their hand-bills, and is a timid stopping-short upon the straight highway. It is unjust and unreasonable, also. It is unjust, because it punishes the sober man for the vice of the drunken man. It is unreasonable, because any one at all experienced in such things knows that the drunken workman does not get drunk where he goes to eat and drink, but where he goes to drink--expressly to drink. To suppose that the working man cannot state this question to himself quite as plainly as I state it here, is to suppose that he is a baby, and is again to tell him in the old wearisome, condescending, patronising way that he must be goody-poody, and do as he is toldy-poldy, and not be a manny-panny or a voter-poter, but fold his handy-pandys, and be a childy-pildy.|$|E
