If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea that}} Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> (i.e. assumes <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena.

[...] being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), to say that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> in <b>the</b> second premise. He assumes that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is a meaningful one (i.e. {{that it is an}} open <b>question).</b> This begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> and <b>the</b> open-question argument thus fails.|$|R

5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to <b>question</b> <b>the</b> concept of hope.

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into <b>question.</b> <b>The</b> condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had to be added to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material.

Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to <b>question</b> <b>the</b> auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to <b>question</b> <b>the</b> company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's accounting practices. When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
