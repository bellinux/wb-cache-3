5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, and to the world outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E
5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through sexual reproduction. Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{whether there}} was an {{unlawful}} conspiracy, and the second <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> to measure the damages for any loss, given the difficulty of knowing how many people might have attended different films.|$|R
25|$|The {{private sector}} {{partners}} {{pulled out of}} the Plains Upgrader because upgrading heavy oil at that time was a risky financial proposition. To be economic, these projects rely on substantial differences in pricing ("differentials") between light and heavy crude oil. Heavy oil is worth less than light oil; the <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>How</b> much less? Unless upgraded oil fetched considerably more per barrel than the less attractive heavy oil, the upgrader would not make money on processing the stuff.|$|E
25|$|The <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> can the {{differences}} between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, {{they are less likely}} to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. The issues are currently being investigated.|$|E
25|$|The experiential {{dimension}} concerns how {{meaning is}} expressed in the group as the organisation of experience. The critical <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> and whether the head is modified. The head {{does not have to}} be modified to constitute a group in this technical sense. Thus, four types of nominal group are possible: the head alone ("apples"), the head with premodifiers ("Those five beautiful shiny Jonathan apples"), the head with a qualifier ("apples sitting on the chair"), and the full structure of premodification and qualification, as above.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} <b>was</b> to {{describe}} <b>how</b> male social workers who work in the section for children and family in one municipality in southern Sweden, experience that their gender influences their daily work. The main focus is to understand {{what it means to be}} a man in the social services department. The first research <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the male social workers experienced how their gender influenced their contact with children and parents in terms of possibilities and obstacles. The second research <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the male social workers experienced how their gender influenced their working place in terms of possibilities and obstacles. The third research <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the male social workers experienced that their gender affected the work with women colleagues. The fourth and last research <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> the male social workers experienced what it means to be a man in the present society. The study was based on a qualitative method and contains semi-structured interviews done with five social workers. I analyzed my interviews with the help of a theory which focused on masculine hegemony and with the help of prior research in this area. My results show that male social workers experience both possibilities and obstacles because of their gender when working with children and parents. Male social workers also felt that their gender affected their work with women colleagues...|$|R

25|$|The {{origins of}} Christianity, {{as well as}} the {{historical}} Jesus and the , are a matter of longstanding debates in theological and historical research. Within a few years after the death of Jesus in c. 33 CE, already before Paul started preaching, a number of proto-Christian communities seem to have been in existence. A central <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> these communities developed and what their original convictions were, as a wide range of beliefs and ideas can be found in early Christianity, including adoptionism, docetism and gnosticism, which were deemed heretical by proto-orthodox Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} general {{question}} of the [...] "hard problem" [...] of consciousness, roughly speaking, {{the question of how}} mental experience arises from a physical basis, a more specialized <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> to square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.|$|E
500|$|Help!, a {{magazine}} published by former Mad editor Harvey Kurtzman, published two stories featuring Fritz, including the character's first public appearance in January 1965, [...] "Fritz Comes on Strong".

Preceding the publication of the story, Kurtzman sent Crumb a letter which read, [...] "Dear R.

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> much, if at all, Verdi {{was influenced}} by Wagner's comic opera Die Meistersinger. At {{the time of the}} premiere this was a sensitive subject; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner's music, and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi's reputation. Nevertheless, Verdi's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s, and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes. In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote, [...] "That Falstaff was Verdi's and Boito's answer to Wagner's Meistersinger seems evident now. But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly." [...] Toscanini, who did more than anyone else to bring Falstaff into the regular operatic repertoire, commented: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, {{there are some people who}} survive, and the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> will these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series." [...] However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons. It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was Stargate (followed by Stargate SG-1, Stargate Infinity, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe), and the second was Godzilla (followed by the animated [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|The <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> {{do these}} effects come {{about in the}} absence of {{mathematical}} or mechanical links among the things in a single category?

2500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{published}} October 10, 1835, {{days after the}} Texas Revolution began. [...] By this time, the owners had changed the name to Telegraph and Texas Register. [...] In an editorial, the owners explained that the paper's original name had been chosen when [...] "the engrossing object was the accumulating of wealth and consequent aggrandizement of the country. [...] Since that time affairs have assumed an entirely different aspect, and the all-absorbing <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> to protect ourselves, and what we already possess." [...] The newspaper was therefore renamed to reflect their new goal of serving as [...] "a faithful register of passing events".|$|E
2500|$|A 2004 book on Russian {{floating}} {{nuclear power}} stations {{was written by}} a number of authors, including [...] "Vladimir Kuznetsov, formerly of the Russian Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety; Alexey Yablokov, a biologist, former environmental advisor to the Russian president and president of the Center for Russian Environmental Policy; Yevgeney Simonov, senior engineer at the Obninsk nuclear power plant; Vladimir Desyatov, an engineer who worked in nuclear submarine construction; and Alexander Nikitin." [...] The book concludes that such stations are impossible to protect against terrorism, that safety cannot be guaranteed ("The only <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> serious the emergency and its consequences."), and that an accident would be uniquely difficult to contain. Besides that, the book argues that such stations would be uneconomic.|$|E
2500|$|Human {{sperm and}} eggs also lack {{molecules}} for the immune recognition of [...] "self". These immune markers are {{also known as}} major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens or more specifically in humans as human leukocyte antigens (HLA)). Therefore, a major <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> are human gametes recognized by immune effector cells. Specifically, their lack of MHC recognition markers should trigger the immune system, resulting in lysis of both sperm and eggs by leukocytes known as natural killer, or NK cells. These cells target and kill other cells lacking such MHC markers, a concept known as [...] "missing self". One distinct possibility is that sperm and eggs are recognized via oligosaccharides expressed on their surfaces. For example, human gametes are coated with carbohydrate sequences that have been implicated in the suppression of NK cell mediated responses.|$|E
