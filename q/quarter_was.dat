5|$|Engel was {{the fastest}} driver {{who was not}} issued with a penalty to not qualify within the top ten; his fastest time was eight-tenths of a second slower than Piquet's pole {{position}} lap. He was more than one-tenth of a second faster than 13th-placed qualifier Félix da Costa, who in turn, was nearly four-tenths ahead of débutant Carroll. The three drivers were followed by Sarrazin in 15th, and Evans in 16th; the latter struggled with cold brakes and tyres which prevented him from going faster. Ma's left-rear <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> damaged when he contacted the barriers lining the circuit and qualified 17th. Jérôme d'Ambrosio struggled and was restricted to starting behind Ma. Di Grassi pushed hard and made a mistake at the chicane, making contact with the wall, and his front-left <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> damaged, triggering red-flag conditions with three minutes left of the second group's running. He was restricted to starting 19th. Frijns completed the field and caused qualifying to be temporarily stopped when his car went airborne after hitting the kerbs at the chicane and collided with the barrier.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was never}} in {{contention}} during the game, as Michigan's offense was shut {{out in the first}} half, while Wisconsin's offense dominated Michigan's defense and jumped out to a 24–0 halftime lead.

In the second quarter, they added to their lead with a 25-yard field goal by Philip Welch, a 27-yard touchdown run by Montee Ball, and a 61-yard run by James White. Michigan started the second half by finally getting on the board with 2 touchdowns: a 24-yard reception by Darryl Stonum, and then a 4-yard run by Denard Robinson. Wisconsin responded with a 23-yard run by James White. Michigan replied with an 11-yard run by Denard Robinson.

2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} {{one third of}} one quarter. Using {{the example of a}} cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a <b>quarter</b> <b>is</b> a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a <b>quarter</b> <b>is</b> one twelfth, two thirds of a <b>quarter</b> <b>is</b> two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three <b>quarters,</b> <b>is</b> three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three <b>quarters</b> <b>is</b> three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three <b>quarters</b> <b>is</b> six twelfths.|$|R

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} in the afternoon; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before, causing a slight delay. The first <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> scoreless, but Navy scored a {{touchdown}} on the first play of the second quarter. Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive. Near {{the end of the}} second quarter, Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run, giving them a 147 halftime lead. The third <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> a defensive stalemate as neither team scored. Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter. Four plays afterward, Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass. Navy threw an interception at midfield, and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal. The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, the NFC North championship, {{and the second}} seed in the NFC playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver in the second <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game {{that he would make}} a decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play of the <b>quarter</b> <b>was</b> a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel for a first down. That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Noel ran for a first down at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards, setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play, and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E

After each team traded punts, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Corbin Berkstresser pass that set up Alabama's second scoring drive from the 50-yard line. AJ McCarron first had a 44-yard completion to Kenny Bell, and then Lacy scored his second touchdown of the afternoon on a three-yard run two plays later for a 14–0 lead.

Milk samples from inflamed <b>quarters</b> <b>were</b> cultured to identify mastitis pathogens; these <b>quarters</b> <b>were</b> classified as clinical; all other <b>quarters</b> <b>were</b> classified as control. Teat canal keratin was collected from all quarters just before an a. m. milking, samples were weighed and lipid determinations were conducted by TLC. Keratin from subclinical quarters compared with keratin from control quarters did not differ in either neutral lipid or fatty acid composition. Total lipid was significantly higher in keratin from teats of clinical quarters than in keratin from control quarters (27. 8 vs. 21. 5 -mu-g/mg). Neutral lipid composition of keratin was similar between teats from clinical quarters and teats from control quarters. In Experiment 2, <b>quarter</b> foremilk samples <b>were</b> also obtained to determine lipid composition.
