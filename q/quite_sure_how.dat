500|$|The Smithsonian Institution has {{categorized}} The Quest as both {{abstract and}} figurative. In 2002, journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a [...] "large tangle of snow-white bodies in a fountain". She {{wrote that the}} work is privately owned but in public view, {{and that it has}} been around [...] "long enough that no one is <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> it got there in the first place". As of 1990, The Quest was considered Portland's largest single piece of white sculptured marble. It was surveyed and considered [...] "well maintained" [...] by the Smithsonian's [...] "Save Outdoor Sculpture!" [...] program in January 1994. Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure's nose.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} siege of Riverrun, Weiss noted about Brienne and Jaime's reunion that [...] "Jaime didn't expect to see Brienne {{necessarily}} ever again, he certainly didn't expect to see her marching into his military camp. And his relationship is obviously very complicated, and fraught, and has undercurrents that he's uncomfortable with feeling." [...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> they feel about the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Eric Goldman {{rated the}} episode 8.5/10. He commented that in {{resetting}} {{the events of}} [...] "Sectionals", it [...] "felt a bit rushed", but concluded: [...] "Glee continues to work because it has its cake and eats it too. It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> we got from here to there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] replied Wheeler, [...] "is a point I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> about. <b>How</b> many {{sticks of}} giant-powder have you rammed into this heading? As you know, it's {{apt to be}} a little uncertain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{they know}} all the foxes?" [...] asked the Senator. In answer to this, Morton only shook his head, not feeling <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> himself <b>how</b> far a huntsman's {{acquaintance}} in that line might go, and being also too much impressed by the occasion for speculative conversation.|$|R
2500|$|Leaving Ireland to find employment, Ruddock went to London {{but soon}} {{realised}} {{that he was}} on a [...] "different path to others who followed the 'official' Aikido line". Having spent three years at the source he [...] "knew where he wanted to be, even if he was not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> yet <b>how</b> to get there". He taught a small Aikido group at the college where he studied to become a schoolteacher.|$|R
500|$|The team {{began working}} six-day weeks by late 2000. By 2001, {{the team was}} working 12- to 16-hour days and 6- to 7-day weeks. Hall {{described}} weekly bug meetings before release: [...] "you see 100 bugs {{at the start of}} the week, fix the 80 you can replicate, and then meet the next Monday to address the 200 bugs they found, fix the 160 you can replicate, then meet to discuss the 400 they found...the time in-between is scary. Usually, the programmers find the bug, then stumble out of their cube, 'we were SO lucky to find that' or 'how did that EVER work?' It's like some bizarre divination method that no one is <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> it finds things, but no one wants to 'disturb the mojo'." [...] Several Internet rumors that Ion Storm would soon close spread in May 2001. By June 2001, all dialogue had been recorded and Ion Storm was working on balancing, playtesting, and adjusting gameplay; release was set for the next month. Anachronox went gold and shipped to manufacturers in late June.|$|E
500|$|SFScope's Sarah Stegall {{praised the}} writers for {{showcasing}} Peter, believing Jackson gave [...] "a solid, convincing performance that teaches {{us more about}} Peter than we learned {{in the first half}} of this season". She also was pleased with Peter's reactions to the obstacles thrown in his path, but criticized the writing for having another man behind the murders ('Too much coincidence. Way too much coincidence. From a plotting standpoint, it was clumsy'). Stegall concluded her review by praising all of the actors' performances, explaining that other than the [...] "clumsy" [...] killer plot twist, [...] "I had no complaints at all about this episode. The supporting cast was top notch". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed how the episode mystery was processed from Peter's point of view, and loved the revelation at the end about Walternate. MTV columnist Josh Wigler praised the episode's [...] "pretty mature storytelling" [...] for not making Peter [...] "go on an angry rampage" [...] or become [...] "an angsty ball of self-loathing" [...] after the previous episode's events. He continued, [...] "You can see that he's hurting, but he's still not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> to process everything. Excellent work from the writers and Joshua Jackson".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, {{beginning}} World War II, many of Europe's top scientists had already fled the imminent conflict.

The house might, of course--here he feigned an anguished delicacy--be full of it. He {{was not in a}} position to say. He had not met with any open competition in his trade; but if Mr. Prout considered it was a matter that affected the honor of the house (Mr. Prout did consider it precisely that), perhaps the house-prefects would be better...|$|R
5000|$|Ruddock {{returned}} to Dublin and started an Aikido group {{which had a}} number of the people with whom he had originally learned Karate with as members. There was no formal structure at that time nor anyone else practising Aikido.Leaving Ireland to find employment, Ruddock went to London but soon realised that he was on a [...] "different path to others who followed the official Aikido line".

2500|$|Abdul was {{discovered}} by The Jacksons, after {{a few of the}} band members had watched her while attending a Los Angeles Lakers game. She was signed to do the choreography for the video to their single [...] "Torture". [...] "My only problem was how to tell the Jacksons how to dance," [...] Abdul later recalled. [...] "Imagine me telling them what routines to do. I was young, I was scared. I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> I got through that." [...] The success of the choreography in the video led to Abdul's career of choreographer in music videos. It was also due {{to the success of the}} video that Abdul was chosen to be the choreographer for the Jacksons' Victory tour.|$|E
2500|$|Abdul, a Laker Girl at the time, {{took over}} as the {{choreographer}} from that point.

I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> I got through that." [...] The success of the choreography in the video helped lead to Abdul's then new career of choreographer in music videos.

6000|$|As I {{stare at}} the Belfry, I think {{with a sort of}} smile of some of my friends in London who are <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> of <b>how</b> {{children}} will turn out if you give them what they call [...] "the right environment." [...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other. Most likely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference at all. In the scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable, and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.|$|R
2500|$|Relations between Chrétien and Martin were {{frequently}} strained, and Martin was reportedly angling to replace Chrétien {{as early as}} 1997. Martin had long hoped that Chrétien would just retire {{at the end of}} his second term, thereby allowing him to win the Liberal leadership, and were greatly disappointed in January 2000 when Chrétien's communications director Françoise Ducros had fired [...] "a shot across the bow" [...] by confirming what had been strongly hinted at since the summer of 1999 in an announcement to the caucus that Chrétien would seek a third term. Martin met with his supporters in what appeared to be a half-hearted attempt at a coup to discuss how best to replace Chrétien at the Regal Constellation Hotel near Toronto's Pearson airport in March 2000 during a Liberal convention, which Chrétien later cited as the 'breaking point' of their relationship. The secret meeting at the Constellation Hotel was called in response to Ducros's announcement with the aim of finding the best way of removing Chrétien, through Martin and his advisors were not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> about <b>how</b> best to do this, or if they even wanted to depose Chrétien at this point in time.|$|R
500|$|French {{director}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino {{was selected}} by Bowie to direct an accompanying music video. Regarding this, Bowie said, [...] "It's an experiment; I'm really putting myself in his [...] hands. [...] I think if I did it , {{it would be very}} abrasive, and I'm not <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> if that's <b>how</b> I want the song to come off visually. In concert it will be abrasive; it won't have the same quality as the video. But I really think Mondino is a fantastic video maker. He just knows that this is his genre. He's like a craftsman and that's what he's trying to perfect, this craft of making his five minutes work." [...] Actor Joe Dallesandro makes appearances throughout the clip, announcing the dance marathon. A shot from the music video was used to commercialize 7" [...] releases of the single.|$|R

5000|$|The {{short story}} alluded {{to in the}} collection's title, [...] "Shiloh", {{revolves}} around a man named Leroy who lives in rural Kentucky and is forced to quit {{his job as a}} truck driver after an accident. The plot centers around his attempt to adjust to life after the accident, {{while at the same time}} facing problems with his marriage and attempting to cope with the urbanization of his neighborhood, which was once a community of farmers. The story ends with Leroy and his wife Norma Jean visiting the battlefield of Shiloh, where Norma Jean tells Leroy that she is leaving him because she no longer loves him. Norma Jean then walks to the edge of the bluff and looks over, Leroy pursues her, and the story ends. The reader isn't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> as to <b>how</b> things end at Shiloh.|$|R
5000|$|T.M.P. of The New York Times said, [...] "To {{the wheel}} of life {{has been given a}} full, mad twirl in I Love a Soldier, which took up {{residence}} yesterday at the Paramount. And since life seldom moves along on a plane, maybe it would have been expecting too much for this particular film to maintain a perfect level. But the ups and downs and the fancy curves which the story takes in discussing the problem of war marriages neither makes for an arresting entertainment nor does it help to clarify a question that is of vital importance right now to a good many young people. Apparently both Mark Sandrich, the producer-director, and Allan Scott, the author, weren't <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> either just <b>how</b> the subject should be treated, for they tackle it, by turns, in dead seriousness and with broad comic strokes." ...|$|R

60|$|This action had quieted her, and she {{sat down}} to read Maynard's letter again. She read it {{two or three times}} without seeming to take in the sense; her {{apprehension}} was dulled by the passion of the last hour, and she found it difficult to call up the ideas suggested by the words. At last she began to have a distinct conception of the impending interview with Sir Christopher. The idea of displeasing the Baronet, of whom every one at the Manor stood in awe, frightened her so much that she thought {{it would be impossible to}} resist his wish. He believed that she loved Maynard; he had always spoken as if he were <b>quite</b> <b>sure</b> of it. <b>How</b> could she tell him he was deceived--and what if he were to ask her whether she loved anybody else? To have Sir Christopher looking angrily at her, was more than she could bear, even in imagination. He had always been so good to her! Then she began to think of the pain she might give him, and the more selfish distress of fear gave way to the distress of affection. Unselfish tears began to flow, and sorrowful gratitude to Sir Christopher helped to awaken her sensibility to Mr. Gilfil's tenderness and generosity.|$|R
