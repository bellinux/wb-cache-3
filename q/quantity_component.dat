External effects are treated in a transformation function as a ‘bad’ output additional to the normal output of a production activity. In this case we can distinguish a price component or shadow price of the external effect and a <b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> and estimate them separately. In order to calculate the price component of the external effects we first estimate one point on the marginal external costs curve {{and then try to}} obtain the whole curve, i. e. external costs associated to different levels of emissions in different years. As to the <b>quantity</b> <b>component,</b> net emissions of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium have been estimated. The aggregate value of external effects is then calculated for thirty years from 1961 to 1991 and deducted from the value added of the agricultural sector, as a first step towards the correction of national accounting aggregates to take environmental degradation into account.

In this study, the potentially frugivorous bird species in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile during the Austral autumn-winter were identified, and the <b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> of the disperser effectiveness of the birds (number of visits and number of seeds dispersed per hour) were evaluated for the tree species Luma apiculata and Aextoxicon punctatum. During the peak fruiting period of the both L. apiculata and A. punctatum 10 and 14, respectively, individuals of each species were monitored for a total of 10 days. Results show that four bird species consumed L. apiculata fruits. The birds Turdus falcklandii were the main fruit consumers (72 % of the visits), with a mean rate of 2. 2 visits per hour and 49. 2 seeds dispersed per hour. The frugivorous species visiting A. punctatum were T. falcklandii (97 % of the visits) and Columba araucana (3 %). In A. punctatum, T. falcklandii consumed 65 fruits in 35 visits, with a mean rate of 1. 8 visits per hour and 3. 4 seeds dispersed per hour. In conclusion, T. falcklandii would be the most effective seed disperser bird for autumn-winter fruiting trees in the Chiloé rainforest of our study site, at least with regard to the quantitative component of disperser effectiveness...|$|E

The effectiveness of a frugivorous species as a seed disperser is the contribution it makes to plant fitness. Effectiveness depends on the quantity of seed dispersed (‘‘quantity component’’) and the quality of dispersal provided each seed (‘‘quality component’’). For the main frugivores, we studied abundance, visitation rate, and feeding behavior, the major variables influencing the <b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> of effectiveness, and the postforaging microhabitat use and resultant seed shadows, which set the stage for postdispersal factors that will influence the quality component of effectiveness. Legitimate seed dispersers (SD) swallowed fruits whole and defecated or regurgitated intact seeds; pulp consumers (PC) pecked fruits to obtain pulp and dropped seeds to the ground, but some species occasionally dispersed seeds (PCSD species). Overall numbers of fruits removed (i. e., handled) by avian frugivores were similar in the two study years; however, the estimated percentage of seeds dispersed differed significantly, with lower relative dispersal success in the year with greater relative abundance of PC species. Similar numbers of seeds were dispersed in the two years despite nearly a fourfold difference in number of fruits produced. Fruit crop size explained > 80...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{population}} structure on the pollination success of Succisa pratensis Moench (Dipsacaceae) were investigated. Pollination services and their effects on plants' reproductive success are compared for four (natural) populations of S. pratensis that differ in size and flower diversity. Pollination services include quantity (total visitation frequency) as well as quality (per visit efficiency) components of pollination. In all populations, Succisa was visited by a large variety of insect species (22 species in total), belonging to the Syrphidae, other Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. Syrphid flies were the main visitors of Succisa during the whole flowering period, especially members of the Eristalinae (a subfamily of the Syrphidae). Helophilus trivittatus, Eristalis horticola, Helophilus pendulus, Eristalis tenax/pertinax and Eristalis arbustorunilnemorum (all members of the Eristalinae, arranged according to their abundance) showed by far the highest numbers of individuals at the sites. These syrphid fly species are (very) common in The Netherlands. On average, a flower head of Succisa received between 24 and 83 insect visits a day. Such a visitation rate is quite high in comparison with other flowering plant species and this means that Succisa is an attractive plant species for insects. The visitation rates (<b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> of pollination) did not differ between populations varying in size and flower diversity. The most frequent Succisa visitors carried {{a high proportion of}} heterospecific pollen on their bodies (ranging from 22 to 80 %) due to their generalistic feeding behaviour. Heterospecific pollen consisted mainly of Asteraceae pollen grains. The composition of the pollen loads of the visiting insects is reflected very well in the pollen deposited on Succisa stigmas. A small fraction of conspecific pollen was deposited on the stigmas of Succisa in all populations. In contrast to the <b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> of pollination, this quality component differed between the studied populations. Large populations received a higher proportion of conspecific pollen (45 % and 64 %) than small ones (17 % and 18 %). Presumably, this difference is the result of passive flower constancy of the most frequent Succisa visitors. Therefore, in The Netherlands, qualitative aspects of pollination seem to be more important in determining differences between populations of Succisa than quantitative aspects. No difference in the proportion of conspecific pollen deposited was found between populations differing in flower diversity. This is probably caused by large flight distances of the visiting insects. Long foraging distances of the pollinators of Succisa may lead to substantial gene flow by pollen between Succisa populations. This reduces the threat of genetic erosion to Succisa populations. The difference in proportion of conspecific pollen deposited does not lead to differences in seed germination rates between populations. The germination rate was low in all populations (< 50 %). Probably, this is (partly) caused by the deposition of large amounts of heterospecific pollen, even in large Succisa populations. Thus, Succisa plants suffer from competition through interspecific pollen transfer. Artificial hand pollinations are needed to determine the susceptability of Succisa to the deposition of heterospecific pollen, unambiguously. ...|$|E

40|$|Countries {{around the}} world have been {{developing}} ecological policies to protect their water resources and minimise the impacts of development on their river systems. The concept of ‘minimum flows’ was initially established as a solution but it did not provide sufficient protection as all elements of a flow regime were found to be important {{for the protection of the}} river ecosystem. “Environmental flows” were developed to determine these flow regimes to maintain a river in some defined ecological condition. Rapid, initial estimates of the <b>quantity</b> <b>component</b> of environmental flows may be determined using the Desktop Reserve Model in South Africa. However, the Desktop Reserve Model is dependent upon the characteristics of the reference natural hydrology used. The advancements in hydraulic and ecological relationships from the past decade have prompted the development of a Revised Desktop Reserve Model (RDRM) that would incorporate these relationships. The research in this thesis presents the development of the hydraulic sub-model for the RDRM. The hydraulic sub-model was designed to produce a realistic representation of the hydraulic conditions using hydraulic parameters/characteristics from readily available information for any part of South Africa. Hydraulic data from past EWR studies were used to estimate the hydraulic parameters. These estimated hydraulic parameters were used to develop hydraulic estimation relationships and these relationships were developed based on a combination of regression and rule-based procedures. The estimation relationships were incorporated into the hydraulic sub-model of the integrated RDRM and assessments of the hydraulic outputs and EWR results were undertaken to assess the ‘applicability’ of the hydraulic sub-model. The hydraulic sub-model was assessed to be at a stage where it can satisfactorily be incorporated in the RDRM and that it is adequately robust in many situations. Recommendations for future work include the refinement of estimation of the channel forming discharge or the use of spatial imagery to check the maximum channel width estimation. It is also proposed that a future version of the hydraulic sub-model could include flow regime change impacts on channel geomorphology and sedimentology so that flow management scenarios can be more effectively assessed. ...|$|E
