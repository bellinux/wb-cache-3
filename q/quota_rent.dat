40|$|Many TRQ {{policies}} are country-specific, that is, importers designate TRQ quantities to specific exporting countries.

Assessing liberaliza-tion options for these country-specific TRQs requires sort-ing out the effects of potential <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> losses, changes in tariff revenues and their transfer to exporters in the form of quota rents, and the effects of expanded trade under a liberalized trade regime.

The results on <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> highlights that Italian and Greek dairy farmers receive the highest economic rent (260 €/ton), while in Portugal the lowest (101 €/Kg) at least in the short-run. This is an indication that Italian and Greek milk supply would be the least 'sensitive' to a reduction in the intervention price.

40|$|This {{report is}} based on the outcome of a study carried out by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre - Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS, Spain) in {{cooperation}} with EuroCARE (Bonn, Germany) and the collaboration of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute (LEI, the Netherlands) and the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart (Unicatt, Italy). The report provides a review the most recent studies modelling the European milk quota. The focus is on milk <b>quota</b> <b>rents,</b> which are a central element in carrying out impact analyses on dairy policies. Direct approaches to estimating milk <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> are the only option for providing empirically gained estimates to be used in equilibrium models. From the reviewed empirical estimates, it appears that differences in magnitude and rankings are present across the considered studies. This poses serious problems when these estimates are used for calibration, because equilibrium models are highly sensitive to the assumptions made on <b>quota</b> <b>rents.</b> Another difficulty lies in the choice of the length of run used when calibrating. As previously mentioned, equilibrium models are sensitive to the assumptions made on <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> and different lengths of run may lead to different policy conclusions. Given that the micro-econometric estimation of milk <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> seems to be an ongoing issue and its translation for equilibrium models far from being settled, it is advisable to perform sensitivity analysis using, whenever possible, different sets of estimates in order to assess the robustness of policy analysis.

40|$|The Canada-U. S. Softwood Lumber Agreement (SLA) was {{the latest}} measure to {{restrict}} Canadian exports of softwood lumber to the United States. Rather than a countervail duty or export tax, SLA employed a quota that provides a large windfall (<b>quota)</b> <b>rent</b> to Canadian lumber producers in addition to extra quasi-rents to U.

However, Canadian producers have not taken full advantage of the quota regime to maximize their overall gains, which exceed what they could earn under free trade or an export/import tax. This is demonstrated using a theoretical framework and numerical illustration. It is shown that the net gain to Canadian producers does not occur when the <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> is maximized, but rather when the sum of producer surplus and <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> is maximized. It is also argued that the existence of resource rents from logging does not constitute a subsidy to lumber producers.

40|$|In the {{so-called}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 'Health Check' the European Commission has recently proposed gradual transitional measures {{to allow a}} 'soft landing' of the milk sector to quota expiry. The aim {{of this paper is}} to help policy makers gain better insights in the implications of some of the most important economic assumptions and empirical choices made in partial equilibrium models focusing on dairy. Three partial equilibrium models are considered: the Agricultural Member states MODeling (AGMEMOD) model, the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model, and the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM). This paper analyses how the economic supply components, as they are part of the three analysed key dairy models, affect milk output projections. A main conclusion is that the evaluation of the contribution of a study should not be based on one single characteristic (such as <b>quota</b> <b>rents,</b> supply responses).

40|$|Abstract — In 2005, 30 % of the Flemish farms faced a manure excess, {{while at}} {{aggregated}} level still 9. 7 % of the emission rights were unused. This means that, despite the various possibilities, Flemish farmers do {{not succeed in}} an effective exchange of manure between farms. In current paper is shown how inorganic fertilizer use influences the use and exchange of organic nitrogen. Because of the mutual interdependency between organic and inorganic nitrogen emission rights (or quota), inorganic nitrogen use limits the emission rights for organic nitrogen. Utilisation of these emission rights are analysed as a trade-offs choice between plant productivity (use of inorganic nitrogen) and manure disposal, as the major abatement alternative of manure production. Farmers still prefer inorganic fertilizers because of their effect on plant productivity and income. However, by changing the <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> of organic nitrogen, the fertilization behaviour can be influenced. A higher <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> of organic nitrogen would increase the use of manure. This trade-off behaviour seriously influences effectiveness of policies.

40|$|The study {{provides}} an agricultural multi commodity analysis {{able to focus}} and investigate the ongoing EU milk reform. The analysis is carried with the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model which is a comparative-static, partial equilibrium modelling tool covering the whole of agriculture of EU member states. The model provides a reference run which is a "baseline scenario" where the 2003 CAP Reform is projected into the future. This scenario is compared to a "quota expiry" scenario where milk quotas are abolished by 2015, a "soft landing" scenario where further quota expansions are envisaged and an "early quota expiry" by 2009. Sensitivity analysis is done for different set of <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> assumptions and export refund abolition. Key results, under a "quota expiry scenario" are that milk production would increase by 2. 8 % in EU 27 whereas milk prices would drop by 7. 5 %.

40|$|The central {{question}} {{addressed in this}} paper is whether {{the presence of the}} MFA made the NAFTA politically more acceptable. Assuming that the government maximizes a weighted sum of welfare and producer profits, we derive four key results. First, taking the initial level of trade restriction as exogenously given, it is possible for an FTA to be endorsed by both parties under the MFA-like quota in one country though it is unambiguously rejected under a tariff that provides equal protection. Second, if the initial MFA quota is itself chosen endogenously, as long as all <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> accrue to exporting countries, the quota is set so as to yield either autarky or free trade. Third, an intermediate outcome can obtain if <b>quota</b> <b>rents</b> are shared between the trading partners as is true, for example, under a tariff quota. Depending on the degree of the government’s bias in favor of producers, this outcome may be more or less restrictive than that obtained under a tariff. Finally, assuming parameter values that give rise to the intermediate outcome initially, it remains possible for an FTA to be endorsed under the MFA-type quota when it is turned down by one of the potential partners under a tariff.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dependency}} of the adjustment of prices, exchange rates, and production {{on the nature}} of the trade regime. We contrast the adjustment between a quota and a tariff regime for a 'semi-small' economy characterized by monopolistic competitive market structure and short-run nominal contracts under a floating exchange rate regime. Among other issues we focus on the factors determining the behavior of the <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> and the 'pass- through' of exchange rate adjustment to the domestic prices of importable goods. We demonstrate that the 'pass-through ratio' (measuring the elasticity of the domestic price of importable goods with respect to the exchange rate) is determined by both the commercial policy and by the market power of the various producers. It tends to be higher in a tariff regime because the endogenous adjustment of the <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> mitigates the 'pass-through'. We also show that the adjustment of the exchange rate tends to be larger in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. In the tariff regime we observe a larger switch of domestic demand relative to the quota regime, and a corresponding smaller exchange rate adjustment. In the quota regime we observe adjustment of the <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> such as to keep the net domestic demand for foreign goods intact. As a result, the relative price (of the domestic good to the foreign good) facing the foreign consumer adjusts more in the quota regime than in the tariff regime. At the same time the relative price facing domestic consumers in the quota regime adjusts by less than in the tariff regime. ...|$|E

Despite the different organisation, objectives and implementations of the diverse quota systems, the results are similar. A higher utilisation of quota is significantly driven by the <b>quota</b> <b>rent,</b> but farm characteristics are also important and the effect declines with increasing <b>quota</b> <b>rent.</b> Regardless the quota, the dairy quota flexibility behaviour of the sample of Flemish farms results in an output price elasticity of 0. 6 %.

A nonparametic statistical method was used to determine the similarities and differences in economic costs, yield, and net returns to farm management and risks between the two countries. Total economic costs were decomposed further into seed, fertilizer, chemicals, labor, and other expenses. Results indicate that economic costs in peanut production were significantly larger in the U. S. than in China. Peanut production was, however, more profitable in the U. S. than in China if land value and <b>quota</b> <b>rent</b> were not included in U. S. economic costs.

TRQs combine both restriction of imports, and safeguard of current or preferential agricultural trade flows. By restricting the market access through high level tariff beyond the quota, one can imagine that exporters enjoying low level tariff would take share of <b>quota</b> <b>rent.</b> Do developing exporting countries benefit from EU TRQs?

This article aims to present {{an analysis of the}} 87 EU's agricultural TRQs implementation from 1997 to 2002, in order to bring to the fore the effects of such an import instrument for exporting countries in competition on the import market. Some theoretical elements of the economy of TRQs are first presented in order to introduce the empirical work. The database built is then used to interpret EU agricultural TRQs implementation during the period 1997 - 2002, and the global results in terms of potential total rent that one can theoretically expect from TRQs is detailed by products grouping and export country grouping. A first examination of the database shows that while preference margin is potentially high for TRQs as a whole, potential rent is not so high. Moreover, this potential rent seems to be concentrated on only bananas and sugar, because TRQs are actually binding for those two commodities. A focus on those products indicates that only few exporting countries are susceptible to enjoy this potential rent: Latin American for bananas and ACP for sugar. However that does not signify that TRQs may be eliminated without big losses for exporters: they actually procure guaranteed EU's market shares protected from foreign competition. tariff rate quotas, <b>quota</b> <b>rent,</b> developing countries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
