50|$|A stand density {{management}} diagram is {{a simple}} biological model relating forest yield to forest density at any stage of a particular forest stand's development. Stand density management diagrams are used in forest management and designed to use a current stand's density to project its future yield. One major reason for the effectiveness of density management diagrams is the relatively low effect of site variance on the diagram’s shape. Density management diagrams have transformed ideas long held in traditional stocking diagrams. In 1967, Samuel F. Gingrich published his idea of comparing basal area per acre, trees per acre, and <b>quadratic</b> <b>mean</b> diameter in one graph. He called this the stocking diagram. These same principles are {{used to make the}} stand density management diagram work.

50|$|Anchoring is a {{cognitive}} bias that shifts perception toward a reference point (the anchor). When evaluating an investment performance, {{people tend to}} continuously compare their returns with the stock market at large, or, more precisely, with the index commonly quoted by medias, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To address this, the V2 Ratio divides the excess return of an investment by the <b>quadratic</b> <b>mean</b> of the relative drawdowns. The relative drawdown compares the loss in value of the investment since its previous peak with the loss in value in the benchmark. For instance, if an asset is down 30% since its peak while the market at large is down by 25%, then the relative drawdown is only 5%. The perception of the poor performance of the asset is somehow mitigated by the overall loss of the market. Taking the ulcer index as a direct inspiration, the V2 Ratio uses a <b>quadratic</b> <b>mean</b> of the relative drawdowns to over-penalize large swerves, as investors {{are more likely to}} liquidate the asset or abandon the strategy when facing such large relative losses.|$|E

Both sets of relations are generalized to means of order α rather than the usual <b>quadratic</b> <b>means,</b> and we show that the optimal constants are the same for preparation and for measurement uncertainty. The constants are determined numerically and compared with some bounds in the literature.
