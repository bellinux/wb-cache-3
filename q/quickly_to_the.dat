5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} {{at the end of}} the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|Reacting <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> situation, the Japanese hurriedly {{evacuated}} Kokumbona {{and ordered}} the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.|$|E
5|$|The extratropical {{remnants}} of Mitch continued <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast. On November6, they passed north of Bermuda, {{and the following}} day intensified slightly to winds of 70mph (110km/h). By November9, the remnants passed west of the British Isles, and were last monitored by the NHC later that day.|$|E

5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force winds {{were expected to}} remain off the Florida east coast, although gale-force winds were anticipated from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E

A mile past that bend Highway 82 reaches the small community of Twin Lakes, also listed on the National Register as a historic district as an early tourist town.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged {{him to be a}} potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him {{to be one of the}} best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the {{prospect}} of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore.|$|E

5|$|On June15, a {{tropical}} wave with associated instability {{was observed in}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. It moved into the central Gulf of Mexico on June16, {{and the next day}} developed a weak circulation {{at the same time that}} Tropical Storm Beulah was on the other side of the gulf. The system in the eastern gulf moved to the northeast, becoming {{a tropical}} depression by June 18 at 0000 UTC. Moving <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, the system moved across central Florida in less than six hours, making landfall near Tampa Bay and exiting near Cape Canaveral.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
5|$|The Allied plan {{consisted}} of a three-division landing of US forces led by Major General Lucian Truscott to secure a bridgehead on the first day. Their flanks were to be protected by French, American, and Canadian commando units. Within twenty-four hours, 50,000–60,000 troops and 6,500 vehicles were to be disembarked. The airborne landings would concentrate in an area near Draguignan and Le Muy, {{with the aim of}} taking these towns to prevent German counterattacks against the beaches. The bulk of the American force then had to advance <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north along the Rhône River, to take the towns of Lyon and Dijon and make contact with the Allied forces in Northern France. After the successful initial landing, units of the French ArmyB were to land, tasked with the taking of the French ports of Toulon and Marseille.|$|E

5|$|The war, the {{pre-eminent}} {{episode of}} Sultan Selim II's reign, {{began with the}} Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, {{but was unable to}} take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a separate peace, ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans and paying a tribute of 300,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|Years {{after the}} attacks, legal {{disputes}} over {{the costs of}} illnesses related to the attacks {{were still in the}} court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> greater Wall Street area.|$|E
5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around that time, the storm began moving more <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. By that time, the storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} four months of 1945, III Corps moved <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offensive. On 25 February, the corps, now as part of the First Army, {{established}} a bridgehead over the Roer River, which, in turn, led to the capture of the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, on the Rhine River, on 7 March. On 30 March, the Edersee Dam was captured intact by Task Force Wolfe of the 7th Armored Division, and the corps, now commanded by Major General James Van Fleet after Millikin's relief, continued the attack to seize the Ruhr Pocket on 5 April 1945. In late April, III Corps reformed and launched a drive through Bavaria towards Austria. On 2 May 1945, III Corps was ordered to halt at the Inn River on the Austrian border, just days before V-E Day, when the German forces surrendered, bringing an end of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{opposition}} to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and {{all the members of}} the Congress Working Committee. His countrymen retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden was Team Ninja's first action title. Its initial concept {{had nothing}} in common with the {{original}} Ninja Gaiden series that was released for the NES. However, for retail reasons Tecmo wanted to retain a link with the previous games, which had many adherents in the West, so Itagaki was asked to rethink his ideas to target the foreign market. Analysing the earlier games, he concluded that their violence appealed to players, and included gory content, such as beheadings, in the Xbox game to retain that spirit. He also aimed to make his new game hard but alluring; it would challenge players on their reflexes rather than on their memories of layouts and timings. His team made a point of designing smoothly-flowing gameplay with high-quality animations that reacted <b>quickly</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player's input. Itagaki paid homage to the earlier Ninja Gaiden series by including updated versions of foes and special attacks. Team Ninja based their 3D computer models, from the pistols of the henchman upwards, on real world material. Character models were taken from studies of human anatomy, and the team hired martial artists in order to digitally capture their movement. Rather than import the motion captures directly into the game, however, the animators used them as templates to give a sense of realism to the game characters' exaggerated movements. Itagaki found it more interesting to design nonhuman creatures than human enemies.|$|E
