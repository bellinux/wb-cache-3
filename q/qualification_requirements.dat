40|$|Many {{different}} types of <b>qualification</b> <b>requirement</b> {{and other forms of}} regulations of professions exist in the Member States of the European Union. A common <b>qualification</b> <b>requirement</b> for access to a profession or use of a professional title is the possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications that proves that the person in questions has the education and experience necessary.

The analysis is performed using an integration perspective and with its basis in the tensions between European Community law and national law that arise as Community law’s demands for free movement and equal treatment conflict with the interest of the Member States to set their own professional qualifications in accordance with national values and traditions. Central to the examination are the directives on recognition of professional qualifications adopted by the Council and the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice’s case-law on the subject.
