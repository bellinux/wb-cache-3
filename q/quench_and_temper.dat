After a <b>quench</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper</b> heat treat, the tool joints are cut into box (female) and pin (male) threads.

The lower SMYS on the connection increases the fatigue resistance. Higher strength steels are typically harder and more brittle, making them more susceptible to cracking and subsequent stress crack propagation.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> shaft has been done. Prediction was done for two different manufacture processes. In the first manufacture process the shaft was made of steel and in second one the shaft was made of cast steel. The working stress was characterized by yield strength and impact toughness. The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of quenching using a finite volume method. Hardness of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> steel can be expressed as function of maximal hardness of actual steel, hardness of steel with 50 % of martensite in microstructure, according to the time <b>and</b> temperature of <b>tempering.</b> The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and impact energy was based on hardness, HV. Starting point in studying of the mechanical properties of steel castings can be {{the fact that the}} mechanical properties of steel castings are derived from the mechanical properties of ordinary steel metal matrix reduced by the influence of the typical as-cast structure, i. e. casting defects on those properties. Hardness and yield strength will be unaffected by most defects. The only effect will be that due to the reduction in area. Coarse as-cast microstructure of cast steel lowers ductility and toughness. Impact energy of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> cast steel was predicted based on pouring temperature, temperature of mould during the pouring and fact that steel castings are not subjected to different metallurgical and mechanical processes of microstructure improvement in so far as wrought steels. Findings: It can be concluded that working stress of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> shaft can be successfully predicted by proposed method.

Results of a large experimental effort concerning the fracture toughness and fatigue properties (as well as other mechanical properties) of plastic mold steel blooms are presented and commented, also on the basis of microstructural and fractographic analysis.

The selection of optimum solutionizing temperature range for microalloyed steel grades is of utmost importance as it can significantly reduce energy consumption. Reheating studies were carried out on two different micro-alloyed steel grades (strip samples) containing Niobium. The reheating temperature range and the effect of Niobium content on the final properties of the steel were established by performing a series of <b>quench</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper</b> experiments, followed by hardness testing. A different set of samples (of the same grades) were subjected to heating in a controlled atmosphere (Nitrogen atmosphere) to mark the differences as compared to heating in open (air) atmosphere. Hardness variation across the strip width was also tested. Microstructural analysis was done using SEM and EDX for further investigation of the results obtained. For both grades (and for both cases of heating in open and nitrogen atmosphere), hardness increased with an increase in solutionizing temperature. Also, at a particular solutionizing temperature, the hardness value was higher for the grade containing greater niobium content. This effect {{can be attributed to the}} increasing fraction of Niobium that dissolves into the solution (matrix) with increasing solutionizing temperature. However, after a particular temperature range, increasing the solutionizing temperature does not significantly increase the hardness, indicating the saturation of Nb levels in the solution...|$|E

40|$|The {{key to the}} {{understanding}} of the mechanical behavior of dual phase (DP) steels is to a large extent to be found in the microstructure. The microstructure is in its turn a result of the chemical composition and the process parameters during its production. In this thesis the connection between microstructure and mechanical properties is studied, with focus on the microstructure development during annealing in a continuous annealing line. In-line trials as well as the lab simulations have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of alloying elements and process parameters on the microstructure. Further, a dislocation model has been developed in order to analyze the work hardening behavior of DP steels during plastic deformation. From the in-line trials it was concluded that there is an inheritance from the hot rolling process both on the microstructure and properties of the cold rolled and annealed product. Despite large cold rolling reductions, recrystallization and phase transformations, the final dual phase steel is still effected by process parameters far back in the production chain, such as the coiling temperature following the hot rolling. Lab simulations showed that the microstructure and consequently the mechanical properties are impacted not only by the chemical composition of the steel but also by a large number of process parameters such as soaking temperature, cooling rate prior to quenching, <b>quench</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper</b> annealing temperature.  QC 2010100...|$|E

Microstructure analysis was performed on the samples using characterization equipment such as Glow Discharge Spectroscope (GDS), Optical Microscope (OM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The results shows that heat treatment affect the microstructures and electrochemical behaviors of stainless steel. It was also found that higher temperature gives lower hardness. From the corrosion test results, it can be concluded that higher austenization temperatures and higher normalizing soaking times improved the corrosion resistance of stainless steel due to increase in grain size and less in formation of carbides.

40|$|This program {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} common manufacturing variables on spike-tempering effectiveness. The investigation used design-of-experiment (DOE) techniques, and examined both dual-phase and martensitic grades of high-strength steels (HSS). The specific grades chosen for this project were: Dual-phase (DP) 600, galvannealed (GA), 1. 55 mm (DP) 600; Dual-phase (DP) 980 (uncoated), 1. 55 mm (DP) 980; and Martensitic (M) 1300, 1. 55 mm (M) 1300. Common manufacturing conditions of interest included tempering practice (<b>quench</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper</b> time), button size, simulated part fitup (sheet angular misalignment and fitup), and electrode wear (increased electrode face diameter). All of these conditions were evaluated against mechanical performance (static and dynamic tensile shear). Weld hardness data was also used to examine correlations between mechanical performance {{and the degree of}} tempering. Mechanical performance data was used to develop empirical models. The models were used to examine the robustness of weld strength and toughness to the selected processing conditions. This was done using standard EWI techniques. Graphical representations of robustness were then coupled with metallographic data to relate mechanical properties to the effectiveness of spike tempering. Mechanical properties for all three materials were relatively robust to variation in tempering. Major deviations in mechanical properties were caused by degradation of the weld itself. This was supported by a lack of correlation between hardness data and mechanical results. Small button sizes and large electrode face diameters (worn electrodes) produced large reductions in both static and dynamic strength levels when compared to standard production setups. Dynamic strength was further degraded by edge-located welds...|$|E

In similar testing conditions, fasteners that had threads rolled before heat-treatment (<b>quench</b> <b>and</b> <b>temper)</b> had similar susceptibility to SCC. However, threads rolled after strengthening, exhibited no SCC {{after a week of}} exposure, even when stressed to 100 % of the B- 7 alloy yield strength. Similarly, intergranular SCC was produced in less than one day when machined (cut) threads of nickel-base alloys (X- 750 and aged 625) were exposed to an aggressive 750 F doped steam environment (containing 100 ppm of chloride, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate and a controlled hydrogen overpressure) and stressed to about 80 % of the alloy yield strength (117 ksi, 807 MPa). In similar testing conditions, threads rolled after strengthening exhibited no SCC after 50 days of exposure. This beneficial effect of the optimum thread rolling process (i. e., threads rolled after strengthening) is due to the retention of large residual compressive stresses in the thread roots (notches) which mitigate the applied notch tensile stresses resulting from joint design pre-loads. use of these material specific aggressive environments can provide an accelerated test to verify that threads were produced by the optimum thread rolling process. These tests could support fastener acceptance criteria or failure analysis of fasteners with unknown or uncertain manufacturing processes.

The microstructure of steel after each heat treatment was described {{with the use of}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was shown, that the austempering conducted at 240 °C produced homogenous nanobainitic structure consisting of carbide-free bainite plates with nanometric thickness separated by the layers of retained austenite. The austempering at 300 °C produced a sub-micrometric carbide-free bainite with retained austenite in form of layers and small blocks. The conventional heat treatments led to a tempered martensite microstructure. The corrosion resistance study was carried out in Na 2 SO 4 acidic and neutral environment using potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The corrosion resistance of nanostructured steel samples were compared to the steel samples with tempered martensite. The obtained results indicate, that the corrosion resistance of bearing steel with nanobainitic structure is similar to steel with tempered martensite in both acidic and neutral environment. This means that the high density of intercrystalline boundaries in nanobinite does not deteriorate the corrosion properties of the bearing steel...|$|R
40|$|AbstractQuenching <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> (Q&T) is a {{combined}} heat treatment process to achieve maximum toughness and ductility at a specified hardness and strength. It {{is important to}} develop a mathematical model for <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process for satisfy requirement of mechanical properties with low cost. This paper presents a modified model to predict structural evolution and hardness distribution during <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> process of steels. The model takes into account tempering parameters, carbon content, isothermal and non-isothermal transformations. Moreover, precipitation of transition carbides, decomposition of retained austenite and precipitation of cementite can be simulated respectively. Hardness distributions of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> workpiece are predicted by experimental regression equation. In order to validate the model, it is employed to predict the tempering of 80 MnCr 5 steel. The predicted precipitation dynamics of transition carbides and cementite {{is consistent with the}} previous experimental and simulated results from literature. Then the model is implemented {{within the framework of the}} developed simulation code COSMAP to simulate microstructure, stress and distortion in the heat treated component. It is applied to simulate Q&T process of J 55 steel. The calculated results show a good agreement with the experimental ones. This agreement indicates that the model is effective for simulation of Q&T process of steels...|$|R
