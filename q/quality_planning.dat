40|$|Background: Behaviour support <b>plan</b> (BSP) <b>quality</b> {{is known}} to be an {{important}} aspect of the support provided to people with disability who show challenging behaviours and has been found to lead to reductions in challenging behaviour. Preliminary evidence suggests that <b>quality</b> of <b>plans</b> is associated with reductions in the use of restraint and seclusion. Method and materials: Quality of a sample of behaviour support plans was assessed using the Behaviour Support <b>Plan</b> – <b>Quality</b> Evaluation II (BSP-QE II) Guide (Browning Wright, Saren & Mayer, 2003). Episodes of restraint and seclusion before and during implementation of plans were examined by comparing restraint and seclusion use between individuals with high quality versus low <b>quality</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Compared to individuals with low <b>quality</b> <b>plans,</b> individuals with high <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be subjected to less restraint and seclusion over time, while those with low <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were subjected to increases. With the exception of one quality component, all components in high <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be associated with decreases in restraint and seclusion use. Conclusions: The results support earlier preliminary findings that quality of behaviour support plans are associated with reductions in restrictive intervention use. The findings are important because they suggest that increasing quality of behaviour support plans may lead to decreases in restraint and seclusion over time...|$|R

40|$|Much {{recent work}} in {{satisficing}} planning has aimed at strik-ing {{a balance between}} coverage- solving as many problems as possible- and <b>plan</b> <b>quality.</b> Current planners achieve near perfect coverage on the latest IPC benchmarks.

40|$|Since {{inception}} of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) the issue of sustainable management has dominated planning practice in New Zealand. Over the past decade, councils have wrestled with converting the concept of sustainable management into policy and practice. Implicit to the requirement that district councils develop plans for managing the environmental effects of the use and development of natural and physical resources {{is the assumption that}} good <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> will result in improved environmental quality. The key question to be addressed in this paper is: Do good plans matter? Measuring the <b>quality</b> of <b>plan</b> implementation is a complex task, and little, if any, attempt has been made in councils to do it. The PUCM research is the first in New Zealand to attempt a quantitative analysis of the links between the <b>quality</b> of <b>plans</b> produced under the RMA and the <b>quality</b> of <b>plan</b> implementation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe the methodology that we adopted for the research and to present some preliminary results from studying the implementation of plans through the resource consent process. Overall, we are trying to determine: how best to measure the <b>quality</b> of <b>plan</b> implementation and the effect that district <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> has on implementation quality; and what factors influence the relationship between <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> and implementation quality. This paper is structured into three main parts. The first is a description of the methodological approach taken to conduct the research. In the second part, the key preliminary results are presented. Finally the findings and the implications for achieving good environmental outcomes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: We {{developed}} a <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> classification model to assess IMRT <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> {{of prostate cancer}} patients for automatic <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> control. Methods : For hollow organs such as rectum and bladder, dose-wall-histogram (DWH) {{was used to evaluate}} OAR dose sparing in our institution. Correspondingly, we proposed a new descriptor called overlap-wall-histogram (OWH) to describe the complex spatial relationship between PTV and a hollow organ. Two metrics calculated from the OWH and DWH are introduced to quantitatively evaluate the difficulty of patient geometry for <b>planning</b> and <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> in terms of OAR sparing, respectively. A linear correlation between these two metrics was observed after plotting <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> metric as a function of geometry difficulty metric studied from a database of prostate cases treated in our institution with acceptable <b>plan</b> <b>quality.</b> Thus, a fitting line was built acting as the boundary of high quality and poor <b>quality</b> <b>plans.</b> A query plan falling above the boundary is assessed as high quality, vice versa poor quality. Results: 15 prostate IMRT plans were used to test our model. One was identified as poor quality and the others were common-level. After re-planning all plans, the dose constraints for bladder wall W 75 (percentage of wall receiving more than 75 Gy), W 70, W 65 and W 60 can be reduced by 3. 34 %, 3 %, 6. 99 %, 6. 54 % for that poor <b>quality</b> <b>plan</b> and 1. 11 %, 0. 95 %, 1. 45 % and 1. 81 % averagely for the common-level quality group, without sacrificing PTV coverage and rectum dose sparing. Conclusion : An effective model was built to provide automatic IMRT <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> control by evaluating hollow OAR dose sparing for prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, for the query <b>plan</b> with poor <b>quality,</b> potential improvement of <b>plan</b> <b>quality</b> can be estimated and a good reference plan with similar or harder geometry can be automatically chosen from our database to help guide the re-planning if necessary.
