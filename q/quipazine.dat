These effects of <b>quipazine</b> were completely blocked by pretreatment with cinanserin (a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist) and attenuated by spiperone (a 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist). However, pretreatment with SB 200646 A (a 5 -HT 2 B/ 2 C receptor antagonist) only blocked the sympathoinhibition, while pretreatment with SB 204741 (a 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist) reversed the sympathoinhibition to excitation as it also did for DOI. <b>Quipazine</b> also caused renal sympathoexcitation in the presence (i. v.) of a vasopressin V 1 receptor antagonist. Injection (i. v.) of the V 1 receptor antagonist at the peak pressor response evoked by <b>quipazine</b> alone and in the presence of SB 204741 caused an immediate fall in MAP. For <b>quipazine</b> alone the renal sympathoinhibition was slowly reversed to an excitation, while the renal sympathoexcitation observed in the presence of SB 204741 was potentiated. In both, the quipazine-evoked tachycardia was unaffected. The data indicate that cardiovascular responses caused by i. c. v. <b>quipazine</b> and DOI are primarily due to activation of central 5 -HT 2 A receptors, which causes the release of vasopressin and a tachycardia. This released vasopressin appears to suppress a 5 -HT 2 A receptor-evoked central increase in sympathetic outflow, which involves the activation of central 5 -HT 2 B receptors indirectly by the released vasopressin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} serotoninergic drugs on adrenocortical {{function}} in domestic fowl were examined. Administration of the serotonin receptor agonist 2 -(1 -piperazinyl) quinoline maleate (<b>quipazine),</b> an inhibitor of serotonin metabolism, N-methyl-N- 2 -propynylbenzylamine HCl (pargyline), {{as well as}} serotonin itself, all increased plasma concentrations of corticosterone. The maximum responses to serotonin and <b>quipazine</b> occurred 1 h after treatment. The quipazine-stimulated response was partly prevented by the serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine. Cockerels pretreated with dexamethasone, a synthetic steroid known to inhibit pituitary ACTH release, showed attenuated responses to subsequent <b>quipazine,</b> pargyline or serotonin injection. Serotonin, <b>quipazine</b> and cyproheptadine did not affect corticosterone release directly from the adrenal gland incubated in vitro, nor did they affect adrenal responsiveness to ACTH stimulation. The neurotoxin 5, 6 -dihydroxytryptamine injected into day-old chicks decreased plasma concentrations of corticosterone for up to 7 days after treatment, with corresponding decreases in the hypothalamic concentration of serotonin, but not dopamine or noradrenaline concentrations. These results show that adrenal corticosterone secretion is regulated by a central serotoninergic system, probably acting on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Light is {{the major}} {{synchronizer}} of the mammalian circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Photic information is perceived by the retina and conveyed to the suprachiasmatic nucleus either directly by the retinohypothalamic tract or indirectly by the intergeniculate leaflet and the geniculohypothalamic tract. In addition, serotonin {{has been shown to}} affect the suprachiasmatic nucleus by both direct and indirect serotonin projections from the raphe nuclei. Indeed, systemic as well as local administrations of the serotonin agonist <b>quipazine</b> in the region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus mimic the effects of light on the circadian system of rats, i. e. they induce phase-advances of the locomotor activity rhythm as well as c-FOS expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during late subjective night. The aim {{of this study was to}} localize the site(s) of action mediating those effects. Phase shifts of the locomotor activity rhythm as well as c-FOS expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus after s. c. injection of <b>quipazine</b> (10 mg/kg) were assessed in Lewis rats, which had received either radio-frequency lesions of the intergeniculate leaflet or infusions of the serotonin neurotoxin 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine into the suprachiasmatic nucleus (25 microg) or bilateral enucleation. Lesions of intergeniculate leaflet and serotonin afferents to the suprachiasmatic nucleus did not reduce the photic-like effects of <b>quipazine,</b> whereas bilateral enucleation and the subsequent degeneration of the retinohypothalamic tract abolished both the phase-shifting and the FOS-inducing effects of <b>quipazine.</b> The results indicate that photic-like effects of <b>quipazine</b> are mediated via the retinohypothalamic tract...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out in the rat to {{investigate}} whether serotonin (5 -HT) is involved in the regulation of vasopressin (ADH) release. For this purpose plasma ADH levels were measured in rats treated with drugs enhancing 5 -HT transmission, such as d-fenfluramine and <b>quipazine</b> and with 5 -HT depleting drugs, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and 5, 7 -dihydroxytryptamine (5, 7 -DHT). Forebrain 5 HT, noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) were also measured. d-Fenfluramine and <b>quipazine</b> induced dose-related increases in plasma ADH levels in normohydrated rats. The effects of <b>quipazine</b> and d-fenfluramine were prevented by PCPA, indicating that 5 -HT transmission was required for the biologic response. 5, 7 -DHT and PCPA pretreatment decreased forebrain 5 -HT content and prevented ADH increases involved by water deprivation, suggesting that 5 HT is necessary for the hormonal response to osmotic stimuli.

The activity-dependent mechanisms underlying such improvement, however, are sparsely understood. Adult rats received a complete spinal cord transection (T 9), and epidural stimulation (ES) electrodes were secured to the dura matter at L 2. EMG electrodes were implanted bilaterally in selected muscles. Using a servo-controlled body weight support system for bipedal stepping, five rats were trained 7 d/week for 6 weeks (30 min/d) under <b>quipazine</b> (0. 3 mg/kg) and ES (L 2; 40 Hz). Nontrained rats were handled as trained rats but did not receive <b>quipazine</b> or ES. At {{the end of the}} experiment, a subset of rats was used for c-fos immunohistochemistry. Three trained and three nontrained rats stepped for 1 h (ES; no <b>quipazine)</b> and were returned to their cages for 1 h before intracardiac perfusion. All rats could step with ES and <b>quipazine</b> administration. The trained rats had higher and longer steps, narrower base of support at stance, and lower variability in EMG parameters than nontrained rats, and these properties approached that of noninjured controls. After 1 h of stepping, the number of FOS+ neurons was significantly lower in trained than nontrained rats throughout the extent of the lumbosacral segments. These results suggest that training reinforces the efficacy of specific sensorimotor pathways, resulting in a more selective and stable network of neurons that controls locomotion...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{serotonin}} agonists on the rhythmic excretion of the melatonin metabolite 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin was examined in rats.

All three drugs caused an acute, transient suppression of 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin excretion {{and a significant}} delay (P 0. 01).

When <b>quipazine</b> (10 mg/kg) was administered at CT 18, 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin excretion was acutely suppressed {{for the rest of the}} night and there was a large significant delay in the onset of 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin excretion (1. 2 +/- 0. 2 h) while a smaller delay was observed following 8 -OH-DPAT administration (0. 8 +/- 0. 2 h).

40|$|Serotonin (5 -HT) and 5 -HT {{agonists}} have various resetting {{effects on}} the master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), depending on the species. In rats, they induce photic-like effects on both locomotor activity rhythms and gene expression in the SCN. The 5 HT receptor(s) mediating these effects at circadian time 22 are localized in the SCN, most likely at a presynaptic level, on the retinohypothalamic terminals (RHT) known to convey photic information by releasing glutamate. Indeed, RHT degeneration blocks photic-like effects of a non-specific 5 HT agonist, <b>quipazine.</b> However, the 5 -HT receptor subtype(s) involved is still unknown, although 5 -HT 3 receptor activation is known to induce glutamate release. We thus analyzed the effects of selective 5 HT 3 agonist and antagonist, {{as well as a}} specific NMDA receptor antagonist, on different parameters of the clock. This study shows that the 5 -HT 3 receptor mediates the resetting effects of <b>quipazine</b> on locomotor activity rhythms.

When tested on the platform periodically tilted in the frontal plane, VHS and VQ animals typically were not able to perform postural corrective movements by their hindlimbs, although EMG responses (correctly or incorrectly phased) could be observed. We attempted to restore postural control in VHS and VQ rabbits by applying serotoninergic and noradrenergic drugs to the spinal cord below the lesion through the intrathecal cannula. It was found that serotonin and <b>quipazine</b> (5 -HT 1, 2, 3 agonist) did not re-establish postural corrective movements. However, when applied during a 10 -day period after lesion, these drugs produced a twofold increase of the proportion of correct EMG responses to tilts. It was also found that methoxamine (α 1 noradrenergic agonist), as well as the mixture of methoxamine and <b>quipazine,</b> did not re-establish postural corrective movements and did not increase the proportion of correct EMG responses.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of methylphenidate and to test whether stimulation of the serotonergic system may confer neurotoxic properties to methylphenidate for DA or serotonin (5 -HT) neurons. In addition, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the necessity to perform future SPECT studies in individuals using both methylphenidate and 5 -HT-acting agents. We therefore measured monoaminergic transporters in rat brain using radioligands suitable for SPECT imaging ([123 I]beta-CIT and [123 I]FP-CIT). Groups of rats were treated with methylphenidate or saline for 4 days. Additional groups were treated with the selective 5 -HT(2) receptor agonist <b>quipazine</b> or the selective 5 -HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine, alone or in combination with methylphenidate.

The difference in specific activity between the trans and cis states of the azobenzene was too small to discern a significant effect on protein activity. Lipid Phase Behaviour – The phase behaviour of 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphocholine-d 62 (d 62 -DPPC) samples containing cholesterol and the serotonin receptor agonist drugs <b>quipazine</b> and LY- 165, 135 was analysed using proton and deuterium NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The effect of <b>quipazine</b> and LY- 165, 135 on d 62 -DPPC was an elongation of the gel-to-fluid lamellar phase transition, lowering of the start of the phase transition, and disappearance of the ripple phase observed in d 62 -DPPC alone. The effect of cholesterol on d 62 -DPPC was a smoothing of the phase transition due to the presence of the liquid-ordered phase. Spectra of d 62 -DPPC, cholesterol and <b>quipazine</b> also show the presence of the liquid-ordered phase. Spectra of d 62 -DPPC and cholesterol with LY- 165, 135 show that the drug widens the temperature range over which the liquid-ordered phase exists. These results indicate that the presence of small molecules such as serotonin-receptor agonists can have a significant effect on the phase behaviour of the lipid bilayer. Analysis of Drug Localisation and Orientation in a Model Membrane by NMR Spectroscopic Methods – NOESY cross-relaxation rates were used to generate location probabilities for serotonin-receptor agonist drugs in d 62 -DPPC bilayers with and without cholesterol. Both drugs were found to locate in the interface region of the bilayer, although they had difference orientations relative to the bilayer normal; <b>quipazine</b> was oriented parallel to the d 62 -DPPC molecules, while LY- 165, 135 was oriented perpendicular to the lipid. The presence of cholesterol was found to affect the drugs‟ positions in the bilayer. <b>Quipazine</b> was pushed further towards the centre of the bilayer (the acyl chain termini) when the sample was in the fluid lamellar phase. The effect on LY- 165, 135, conversely, was to push it to towards the headgroup region as the fluid lamellar phase approached. The drug interactions with cholesterol during the mixed [lo + ld] phases indicate that these compounds may be partitioning into the liquid-ordered phase under these conditions. Use of an Enzyme Substrate to Investigate Bilayer Dynamics – DROSS NMR, 31 P NMR and fluorescence emission spectroscopy were used to analyse the effect of catalysing an enzyme substrate on a lipid bilayer. 1, 2 -Dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) is a substrate of DGK. DGK phosphorylates DGK in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), producing phosphatidic acid (PA). DROSS was used to generate order parameters while fluorescence emission spectroscopy was used to give an indication of bilayer tension. Bilayer tension and order parameters were lower for the sample containing PA co-dissolved with DOPC relative to the sample containing catalysed PA. This is due to sequestration of the catalysed PA in the immediate vicinity of the protein rather than an even distribution throughout the bilayer (as observed for co-dissolved PA), which affects the physical properties of the bilayer.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out aiming to reach {{behavioral}} and neuropharmacological evidence of the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to serotonin systemically administered in quails. Serotonin injected by a parenteral route (250 - 1000 µg. kg- 1, sc) elicited a sequence of behavioral events concerned with a sleeping-like state. Sleeping-like behaviors began with feather bristling, rapid oral movements, blinking and finally crouching and closure of the eyes. Previous administration of 5 -HT 2 C antagonist, LY 53857 (3 mg. kg- 1, sc) reduced the episodes of feather bristling and rapid oral movements significantly but without altering the frequency of blinking and closure of the eyes. Treatment with the 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C antagonist, ketanserin (3 mg. kg- 1, sc) did not affect any of the responses evoked by the serotonin. <b>Quipazine</b> (5 mg. kg- 1, sc) a 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C/ 3 agonist induced intense hypomotility, long periods of yawning-like and sleeping-like states. Previous ketanserin suppressed gaping responses and reduced hypomotility, rapid oral movements and bristling but was ineffective for remaining responses induced by <b>quipazine.</b> Results showed that unlike mammals, serotonin permeates the BBB and activates hypnogenic mechanisms in quails. Studies using serotoninergic agonist and antagonists have disclosed that among {{the actions of the}} serotonin, feather bristling, rapid oral movements and yawning-like state originated from activation of 5 -HT 2 receptors while blinking and closure of the eyes possibly require other subtypes of receptors...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{established}} {{the presence of}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) (2 A) receptors on glial cells in culture and in the brain in situ. Here we used cultured C 6 glioma cells to investigate the possibility that 5 -HT(2 A) receptors on glia regulate glutamate release from the cell. The efflux of endogenous glutamate from cultured C 6 glioma cells was increased by addition of 5 -HT in a concentration-dependent manner (maximal effect + 200 %). The efflux of serine and aspartate was not altered. The effect of 5 -HT was mimicked by both the nonselective 5 -HT receptor agonist <b>quipazine</b> and the selective 5 -HT(2) receptor agonist 4 -iodo- 2, 5 -dimethoxyamphetamine (DOI; both 0. 01 - 100 microM). The 5 -HT(2 A) receptor antagonists ketanserin (1 microM) and spiperone (1 microM) inhibited the glutamate response to 5 -HT, <b>quipazine,</b> and DOI, whereas the effect of 5 -HT was not inhibited by the 5 -HT(2 B/C) receptor antagonist SB 200646 (1 microM). The effect of 5 -HT on glutamate was specific {{in that it was}} reduced in low-calcium medium but was not prevented by furosemide (5 mM), which prevents cell swelling-induced glutamate release. Finally, the glutamate uptake inhibitor 2, 4,trans-pyrollidine dicarboxylic acid (50 microM) did not block the 5 -HT-induced efflux of glutamate, making involvement of glutamate transport unlikely. In conclusion, 5 -HT stimulates the efflux of glutamate from C 6 glioma cells following 5 -HT(2 A) receptor activation and involves a calcium-dependent mechanism...|$|E

None of the drugs, administered chronically, increased behavioural responses to the 5 -hydroxytryptamine agonist <b>quipazine</b> (25 mg/kg), and neither picrotoxin nor bicuculline altered the locomotor response to the dopamine agonist apomorphine (AP) (0. 1 mg/kg).

40|$|Radioligand binding {{techniques}} {{have demonstrated the}} existence of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) binding subtypes: 5 -HT 2, 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B. These {{techniques have}} also indicated that certain drugs appear to show sub-type specificity: 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin(8 -OH-DPAT), a 5 -HT 1 A agonist; 5 -methoxy- 3 (1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridin- 4 -yl) 1 -H indole (RU 24969), a 5 -HT 1 B agonist; and ritanserin, a 5 -HT 2 antagonist. (-) -Propranolol is a 5 -HT 1 antagonist of uncertain sub-type specificity. An examination {{has been made in}} mice and rats of the behavioural and biochemical effects of these drugs to determine whether the binding sites have physiological functions and further characterise the behavioural models. Administration of carbidopa (25 mg kg- 1) plus 5 -hydroxytryptophan (100 mg kg- 1) produced head-twitch behaviour in mice which was antagonized by ritanserin (ED 50 = 65 micrograms kg- 1) but not (-) -propranolol (20 mg kg- 1). 8 -OH-DPAT (1 - 10 mg kg- 1 s. c.) and RU 24949 (5 mg kg- 1 i. p.) did not produce head-twitch behaviour. 8 -OH-DPAT decreased 5 -HTP- but not 5 -methoxy-N-N-dimethyltryptamine (5 mg kg- 1) -induced head-twitch by a (-) -propranolol-insensitive mechanism. Locomotor activity produced in mice by RU 24969 (3 mg kg- 1) was antagonized by (-) -propranolol (20 mg kg- 1) but not the (+) -isomer. (-) -Propranolol did not antagonize the behaviour induced in rats. In mice, both 8 -OH-DPAT and RU 24969 markedly inhibited whole brain 5 -HT synthesis and this effect was not antagonized by (-) -propranolol. In rats, 8 -OH-DPAT (3 mg kg- 1 s. c.) produced all the behavioural changes seen after <b>quipazine</b> (25 mg kg- 1). (-) -Propranolol inhibited the behaviour changes produced by both agonists, while ritanserin antagonized the behaviour produced by <b>quipazine</b> but not 8 -OH-DPAT. It is concluded, therefore, that the 5 -HT 1 A receptor exists between the 5 -HT 2 receptor and the behavioural effectors. 8 -OH-DPAT (at 20 degrees C ambient temperature) rapidly decreased rat body temperature, an effect antagonized by (-) -propranolol but not ritanserin. <b>Quipazine</b> (at 27 degrees C ambient temperature, but not 20 degrees C) increased body temperature but the effect was not blocked by either antagonist.

40|$|Novel 5 -HT 3 {{receptor}} ligands {{were designed}} and synthesized {{with the aim of}} obtaining deeper insight into the molecular basis of the intrinsic efficacy of arylpiperazines interacting with the central 5 -HT 3 receptor. The newly synthesized compounds and some previously published compounds belonging to the same class of heteroarylpiperazines were tested for their potential ability to displace [H- 3]granisetron from rat cortical membranes. These 5 -HT 3 receptor binding studies revealed subnanomolar affinity in several of the compounds under study. The most active ligands were <b>quipazine</b> derivatives bearing a phenyl group in the 4 -position and various oxygenated alkyl side chains in the 3 -position of the quinoline nucleus. Qualitative and theoretical quantitative structure-affinity relationship studies were carried out, and the interaction model for the 5 -HT 3 ligands related to <b>quipazine</b> with their receptor, proposed in part 1 of the present work, was updated to incorporate the latest data. The potential 5 -HT 3 agonist/antagonist activity of 12 selected compounds was assessed in vitro on the 5 -HT 3 receptor-dependent [C- 14]guanidinium uptake in NG 108 - 15 cells. Their intrinsic efficacy ranged from the 5 -HT 3 full agonist properties of compounds 7 a and 8 h,i to those of partial agonists 10 a,d and antagonists 8 b,d,e, and 9 c,d,h,i. The comparison between these functional data and those relative to the previously described compounds suggested that in this class of 5 -HT 3 ligands the intrinsic efficacy is modulated in a rather subtle manner by the steric features of the heteroaryl moiety...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The primary {{mammalian}} circadian clock, {{located in}} the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), receives a major input from the raphe nuclei. The role of this input is largely unknown, and {{is the focus of}} this research. The SCN clock survives in vitro, where it produces a 24 -hr rhythm in spontaneous neuronal activity that is sustained for at least three cycles. The sensitivity of the SCN clock to drugs can therefore be tested in vitro by determining whether various compounds alter the phase of this rhythm. We have previously shown that the nonspecific serotonin (5 -HT) agonist <b>quipazine</b> resets the SCN clock in vitro, inducing phase advances in the daytime and phase delays at night. These results suggest that the 5 -HT-ergic input from the raphe nuclei can modulate the phase of the SCN circadian clock. In this study we began by using autoradiography to determine that the SCN contain abundant 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors, very few 5 -HT 1 Cand 5 -HT 2 receptors, and no 5 -HT 3 receptors. Next we investigated the ability of 5 -HT-ergic agonists and antagonists to reset the clock in vitro, in order to determine what type or types of 5 -HT receptor(s) are functionally linked to the SCN clock. We began by providing further evidence of 5 -HT-ergic effects in the SCN. We found that 5 -HT mimicked the effects of <b>quipazine,</b> whereas the nonspecific 5 -HT antagonist metergoline blocked these effects, in both the day and night. Next we found tha...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that serotonin might {{play a role}} in the modulation of screening-pigment position in crayfish photoreceptors was explored through experiments with isolated eyes and a membrane fraction from retinal homogenates. In the isolated eye serotonin (3 = 10 ~ 4 mol I" 1) and some of its agonists exerted a limited dark-adapting influence over the pigment position, irrespective of the presence or absence of light, and this effect was abolished by the simultaneous addition of serotonin antagonists. In the retinal membrane fraction serotonin and <b>quipazine</b> produced a methysergide-sensitive stimulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. These results are interpreted in terms of a serotonin-mediated efferent input on the photoreceptors, which would affect the ionic regulation of the pigment transport mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Interval timing {{behaviour}} {{refers to}} the ability of animals and humans to adapt their behaviour to temporal regularities in their environments. Two important classes of interval timing behaviour are temporal discrimination (discriminating between the durations of external events) and temporal differentiation (behavioural adaptation during an ongoing interval). It has been known for many years that drugs that affect central dopaminergic function can alter both forms of timing behaviour. More recently, evidence has been accumulated which shows that manipulation of central 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic (5 -HTergic) function can also influence interval timing behaviour. The experiments described in this thesis examined the effects of drugs acting at some subtypes of 5 -HT receptors on temporal discrimination and temporal differentiation in the rat. Chapter 1 contains a review of the relevant literature. First, the anatomy, biochemistry and receptor pharmacology of the 5 -HTergic system is outlined, and a selective review of the role of 5 -HT in some behaviours relevant to this project is presented. This is followed by an overview of the behavioural methodology that has been used to study timing behaviour in animals, and an account of the major theories of timing behaviour. Finally, the behavioural pharmacology of timing behaviour is reviewed. Chapters 2 - 7 describe a series of experiments examining the effects of drugs acting at 5 -HT 1 A, 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C, and 5 -HT 3 receptors on temporal discrimination and temporal differentiation. Experiment 1 examined the effect of the 5 -HT 3 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide (m-CPBG) and the non-selective agonist <b>quipazine</b> on temporal discrimination performance in the discrete-trials psychophysical procedure. <b>Quipazine</b> produced a dose-dependent disruption of temporal discrimination, consisting of a rightward displacement and flattening of the fitted psychometric function, reflected in {{a significant increase in the}} values of the indifference point T 50 and the Weber fraction. m-CPBG had no significant effect on either T 50 or the Weber fraction. The effects of <b>quipazine</b> were completely abolished by the 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist ketanserin, but not by the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist topanyl 3, 5 -dichlorobenzoate (MDL- 72222), indicating that the effect of <b>quipazine</b> was mediated by 5 -HT 2 A, and not 5 -HT 3 receptors. In experiment 2, the effects of <b>quipazine</b> and m-CPBG were examined on temporal differentiation performance in the free-operant psychophysical procedure. <b>Quipazine</b> dose-dependently displaced the psychometric function to the left, reducing the value of T 50, and significantly increased the Weber fraction. m-CPBG had no effect on the parameters of the function. The effects of <b>quipazine</b> were reversed by co-administration of ketanserin, but not by co-administration of MD L- 72222. These results suggest that while 5 -HT 2 A receptor stimulation has a robust influence on temporal differentiation, 5 -HT 3 receptor stimulation does not. Experiment 3 further examined the effect of 5 -HT 2 A receptor stimulation on temporal discrimination. The 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C receptor agonist 2, 5 - dimethoxy- 4 -iodoamphetamine (DOI) increased the Weber fraction and tended to increase T 50. Ketanserin and the highly selective 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist (±) 2, 3 -dimethoxyphenyl- 1 -(2 -(4 -piperidine) -methanol) (MDL-I 00907) fully antagonized the effects of DOI The results indicate that DOI disrupts temporal discrimination via stimulation of 5 -HT 2 A receptors. Experiment 4 examined whether intra-striatal injection of DOI would affect temporal discrimination, and whether the effect of systemically administered DOI on temporal discrimination would be blocked either by MDL- 100907 or by 8 -(5 -(2, 4 -dimethoxy- 5 -(trifluoromethylphenylsulphonamido) phenyl- 5 -oxopentyl) - 1, 3, 8 - riazaspiro(4. 5) decane- 2, 4 -dione RS- 102221 : a selective 5 -HT 2 C receptor antagonist), administered directly into the dorsal striatum. Intra-striatal injection of DOI did not affect temporal discrimination. Systemically administered DOI disrupted temporal discrimination; this effect was not attenuated by intra-striatal injection of MDL- 100907 or RS 102221, suggesting that the 5 -HT 2 receptors that mediate DOI's effect on temporal discrimination are not located in the dorsal striatum. Experiments 5 and 6 examined the effects of intra-striatally administered DOI, MDL- 100907 and RS- 102221 on temporal differentiation. In experiment 5, systemic injection of DOI significantly reduced T 50. This effect was antagonized by systemically administered MDL- 100907. In experiment 6, intra-striatally administered DOI had no significant effect on T 50 or the Weber fraction. Intra-striatal injections of MDL- 100907 and RS- 102221 did not alter temporal differentiation, and failed to reverse the effects of systemically administered DOI. The results suggest that the 5 -HT 2 receptor population responsible for DOI’s effect on temporal differentiation is not located in the dorsal striatum. Experiment 7 examined the effect of a 5 -HT 1 A and a 5 -HT 2 A receptor agonist on another widely-used temporal differentiation schedule, the fixed interval peak procedure. The 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 - 0 H-DPAT) and the 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 C receptor agonist DOI had similar effects on performance: both agonists displaced the peak function to the left and reduced the peak time, tpeak. The effect of 8 - 0 H-DPAT was antagonized by the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist N-[2 -(4 -[2 -methoxyphenyl]- 1 -piperazinyl) ethyl]-N- 2 -pyridinylcyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY- 100635), and the effect of DOI by the 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist ketanserin, respectively. These results, taken together with previous findings with the free-operant psychophysical procedure, suggest that 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 A receptors mediate similar effects on temporal differentiation. The final chapter (Chapter 8) summarizes the findings from the project, and discusses their implications for the putative role of 5 -HT in interval timing and for current theoretical accounts of timing. It is argued that current models of timing behaviour that assume the existence of a unitary 'pacemaker-driven' internal clock may have difficulty accommodating the finding that the same drug can have qualitatively different effects on temporal discrimination and temporal differentiation. Some possible directions for future research in this area are also discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence from research in neonatal and adult rat and mouse preparations to warrant {{the conclusion that}} activation of 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 1 A/ 7 receptors leads to activation of the spinal cord circuitry for locomotion. These receptors are involved in control of locomotor movements, {{but it is not}} clear how they are implicated in the responses to 5 -HT agonists observed after spinal cord injury. Here we used agonists that are efficient in promoting locomotor recovery in paraplegic rats, 8 -OHDPAT (acting on 5 -HT 1 A/ 7 receptors) and <b>quipazine</b> (acting on 5 -HT 2 receptors), to examine this issue. Analysis of intra- and interlimb coordination confirmed that the locomotor performance was significantly improved by either drug, but the data revealed marked differences in their mode of action. Interlimb coordination was significantly better after 8 -OHDPAT application, and the activity of the extensor soleus muscle was significantly longer during the stance phase of locomotor movements enhanced by <b>quipazine.</b> Our results show that activation of both receptors facilitates locomotion, but their effects are likely exerted on different populations of spinal neurons. Activation of 5 -HT 2 receptors facilitates the output stage of the locomotor system, in part by directly activating motoneurons, and also through activation of interneurons of the locomotor CPG. Activation of 5 -HT 7 / 1 A receptors facilitates the activity of the locomotor CPG, without direct actions on the output components of the locomotor system, including motoneurons. Although our findings show that the combined use of these two drugs results in production of well-coordinated weight supported locomotion with a reduced need for exteroceptive stimulation, they also indicate that there might be some limitations to the utility of combined treatment. Sensory feedback and some intraspinal circuitry recruited by the drugs can conflict with the locomotor activation...|$|E
