5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was {{under the control of the}} Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E

In the absence of employment or redeployment policies to redress such problems, he wrote, the effects of the austerity programmes might create circumstances that could derail the PNDC recovery agenda.|$|R

Odo, still angry at the invasive methods Dr. Mora employed with him, hopes to reach the infant through encouragement. Mora, however, insists on probing and measuring the little creature, to Odo's horror and disgust. Unfortunately, Odo makes little progress using his own methods, and Mora is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> this <b>out.</b> Odo refuses to even consider the doctor's expertise until Sisko informs him that Starfleet Command wants Odo to establish communication with the Changeling {{as soon as possible}} — or lose the infant to Starfleet. Unwilling to give his [...] "baby" [...] up, Odo {{has no choice but to}} listen to his old nemesis.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{assessment}} method {{is based on}} {{years of experience in}} overhead crane visual inspection and analysis. The main concern of the technique is to identify and fix the lateral and diagonal displacement of cranes originating from miscellaneous causes. The {{assessment method}} describes the steps to follow when a displacement problem is observed on an overhead crane. The analysis includes runways visual inspection, visual inspection of the runways substructures, visual analysis with cameras, monitoring of the runways substructure and runways displacement with indicators and acquisition system. The method is working by elimination to converge toward the cause of the abnormal displacement. It includes a few techniques of telemetry and traditional precision measurements. The method is in accordance with the ASME 1, 2 and CSA 3 standards and with the practices of the industry. On site anecdotes and experiences are presented in conjunction with the applicable standards <b>to</b> provide <b>quick</b> tips <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> a massive amount of interrelated problems...|$|R

The author is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist {{at the same time as}} ours, each existing in another time and place.|$|E

In June 2016, Google {{announced that}} subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, {{a change from}} the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the tense}} {{political}} circumstances {{during which the}} murder occurred, some English-language Western media outlets like The Guardian and the Los Angeles Times were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> indirectly <b>point</b> <b>out</b> a possible connection to similar events in Serbia at the time (Serbia was going through its own wave of assassinations {{in the first part}} of 2000). They went as far as to cautiously suggest Žugić's assassination was an attempt by Belgrade to destabilize Montenegro ahead of its first elections after the 78-day 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia. Others, like the Italian Corriere della Sera went even further, saying that [...] "Montenegro and Serbia have for months been at the edge of separation" [...] and that [...] "this tragic event brought the possibility of a compromise between them down to a minimum" [...] before ominously exclaiming: [...] "If another war flares up in the Balkans we will have known its start date in advance as well its detonator".|$|R
5000|$|Those {{who have}} {{attempted}} to rehabilitate Metternich likewise contend that, along with contemporaries Viscount Castlereagh and Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, Metternich [...] "unquestionably a master of diplomacy", someone who [...] "perfected" [...] and indeed shaped the nature of diplomacy in his era. For them, Metternich was [...] "handsome, witty... and tenacious", {{by his own admission}} [...] "bad at skirmishes... but good at campaigns". Likewise, Henry Kissinger's PhD dissertation about Metternich, later published in 1957, praised Metternich's role in holding together the crumbling Austrian Empire, though Kissinger's work has generated controversy in academic circles among such historians as Paul W. Schroeder, inter alia attracting criticism for the absence of footnotes. Certainly, if he was a good diplomat he certainly attracted a great deal of contemporary criticism for lying; fellow diplomats Canning and Talleyrand both commented on it, whilst the poet Franz Grillparzer suggested that Metternich came to believe his own lies. Even so, as critical historian Alan Sked argues, Metternich's [...] "smokescreen" [...] served a purpose in furthering a relative coherent set of principles, though it came at the expense of being in control of individual events. However, Sked is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> also <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Metternich's apparent liberalism, as put forward by Viereck and Haas, did not amount to wanting decentralisation, and as such the old concerns that Metternich pushed for a (now outmoded) heavily centralised autocratic system cannot be dismissed. Sked does, however, warn against the use of hindsight, arguing that Metternich's actions were, at the time, entirely in keeping with Austrian politics, and that the events of 1848 were a mere blip when Austria lost its nerve.|$|R

25|$|Engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, , Gustave-Adolphe Hirn and Marc Seguin {{recognized}} that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and {{made use of}} Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. Academics such as John Playfair were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries {{the fate of the}} lost energy was still unknown.|$|E
25|$|Davis won the World Billiards Championships in June 1980, beating Rex Williams 5978-4452, and in {{so doing}} became the only player except for Joe Davis to have lifted both the World Snooker and World Billiards titles. However, he was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that {{standards}} differed markedly from those of the 1930s when the top players made such large breaks that they killed the game as popular entertainment. He would receive £1500 plus a cheque for £500 for the highest break (583); this was presented to him by 94-year-old Willie Smith, World Billiards champion in 1920 and 1923. Davis also retained the title later in November the same year, when the championship was restored to a knock-out basis {{for the first time since}} 1934. Davis beat Paddy Morgan 1907-978, John Barrie 1253-1153 and Mark Wildman 3037-2064 in the final to pocket £4000, then a record for a billiards event.|$|E
25|$|Sakura Wars 4 {{was first}} {{announced}} in June 2001; when announced, Hiroi was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that while it}} was the last series entry for the Dreamcast, it was not the final entry in the Sakura Wars series. A preview disc was released with Sakura Wars Online, featuring promotional images and trailers released up to that point. Running up to the game's release, Sakura Wars 3 and the Dreamcast ports of the first two Sakura Wars games were reissued at reduced prices by Sega. The game was released on March 21, 2002. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). It was released for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP on March 3, 2005. This version required multiple CD-ROMs due to the game's size. A DVD-ROM version for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007. Wider localization efforts for the series were prevented due to Sega's uncertainly as to whether the game's blend of genres would find a profitable audience outside Japan.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{similarities}} between Somari and the original game, reviewers were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the many differences between them. Commentators on the Russian TV program Dendy: The New Reality stated that [...] "Somari for Dendy {{is not the same}} as Sonic for SEGA. ... Everything's different." [...] Contemporary criticism of the game emphasized its difficulty relative to the original Sonic title, and the game was characterized as having complex controls (although reviews claimed that these could be mastered in time).|$|E
500|$|In October, 2017, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, {{predicted}} {{the arrival of}} Nibiru for November 19; a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a [...] "black star" [...] {{at the edge of}} our Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though The Washington Post, quoting the United States Geological Survey, was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year.|$|E

Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed [...] "amateurish" [...] by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.|$|E
500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience. As Carole Hillenbrand wrote, it would be [...] "dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value." ...|$|E

500|$|Hartley is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that before}} [...] "Justice", the series did {{not focus on}} [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise {{you look like a}} standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated {{that he was one of}} the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E
500|$|The 1910 approach, {{which came}} into naked-eye view around 10 April {{and came to}} {{perihelion}} on 20 April, was notable for several reasons: {{it was the first}} approach of which photographs exist, and the first for which spectroscopic data were obtained. Furthermore, the comet made a relatively close approach of 0.15 AU, making it a spectacular sight. Indeed, on 19 May, Earth actually passed through the tail of the comet. One of the substances discovered in the tail by spectroscopic analysis was the toxic gas cyanogen, which led astronomer Camille Flammarion to claim that, when Earth passed through the tail, the gas [...] "would impregnate the atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet." [...] His pronouncement led to panicked buying of gas masks and quack [...] "anti-comet pills" [...] and [...] "anti-comet umbrellas" [...] by the public.
