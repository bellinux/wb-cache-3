40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Soil {{effects from}} {{mountain}} beaver (Aplodontia rufa) burrowing were investigated in Oregon Coast Range soils formed from Tyee sandstone. The potential for observed changes in soil to affect productivity was assessed. Soil horizons from mountain beaver mound soil and adjacent unmounded profiles were collected with a monolith-type <b>quantitative</b> <b>sampler.</b> Bulk density, changes in soil depth, soil C (estimated from LOI), Kjeldahl-N, Kjeldahl-P, and Oxalate extractable P and K were measured. Results from these analyses were normalized {{for differences in}} organic material by calculating variables as a mass per hectare per fixed weight of ashed soil. This approach combined the advantages of sampling by individual soil horizons, with statistical tools to compare soil profiles with dissimilar horizonal arrangements. Patterns of soil mixing due to mountain beaver, as well as dimensions and arrangement of a single burrow are described. Mountain beaver mixing altered the depth distribution of C, N, and P, increased soil depth, and reduced bulk density. The distribution of gravel in unmounded profiles suggested a history of soil mixing on this site that obscured mixing effects attributable to recent mountain beaver activity. Colluvial action, windthrow, and past animal activity {{are the most likely}} causes of background mixing in unmounded profiles. Soil mixing attributed to mountain beavers has the potential to increase site production by increasing soil depth and decreasing bulk density, which can in turn affect moisture holding capacity and rooting depth. Results suggest that mountain-beaver mixing did not change site capital of plant nutrients but altered their distribution within the soil. Potential effects of described changes on short-term and long-term weathering release of plant nutrients is discussed. Mountain beaver mixing resulted in exposure of loose mineral soil on the surface which may increase dry ravel erosion. Thus, burrowing animal activity may represent an important sediment export mechanism from managed stands...|$|E

This study took place during 1388 - 1389 with four sampling season in four stations respectively in the forests of Kalyj kheyl village in Savadkuh (first station), industrial area of Islamabad (second Station), earth dam of Sonbolrood (third station) and the Place crosses Sonbolrood with Babolrood river (fourth Station). Macroinvertebrates invertebrates collected by <b>quantitative</b> <b>sampler</b> of Sorbr and they were isolated in laboratory by loop and they were identified in the family level. Generally, Macroinvertebrates of Sonbolrood river were formed three branches: Arthropods and flat worms and mollusks, including 3 tiers, 6 orders and 14 families that showed the maximum diversity and density in autumn and the least diversity and density in summer at all stations, also {{the third and fourth}} stations respectively were highest and lowest diversity and density. The water quality of Sonbolrood river based on the water quality Guide(Hylsenhof) is evaluated with excellent condition for all stations except third station. Sonbolrood river with having high slope, rocky and sandy bed, with self-refining act, completely is a proper ecosystem for aquatic organisms, but it is done due to increased organic matter and sewage factory located in industrial zone in the third station and then the increased water pollution caused by nurturing the water warm fish in the earth dam of Sonbolrood. (because of this, the water quality at third station based on the water quality Guide(Hylsenhof) are evaluated in a fairly good condition) and adding domestic sewages of adjacent villages like Seyedkola village and Shirdarkola caused increased pollution and increased trophy of Macroinvertebrates that are resistant to pollution and affect upon Macroinvertebrates community...|$|E
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2481 on 06. 20. 2017 by CS (TIS) Seagrass beds are highly productive shallow-water marine ecosystems {{and serve as}} a habitat for numerous invertebratesa nd fishes, some of which constitute important fisheries species. S eagrassb eds {{play an important role in}} physical coastal dynamics, since they stabilise soft bottoms, while their leaf canopy attenuates strong wave action and currents, thereby, reducing coastal erosion. However, seagrass habitats are undergoing a decline worldwide, hence, there is an urgent need for data on the influence of bed fragmentation and changes in plant architecture on the diversity of associated biota. In the Mediterranean Sea, the endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica forms extensive beds that have a high structural complexity and support a high biodiversity, making them one of the most important marine habitat types in the region. The present study investigated the influence of P. oceanica bed structure (seagrassb ed morphology and within-bed architecture) on the diversity of associatedm acrofauna. P ilot surveys were made to map the occurrence and spatial distribution of different types of P. oceanica beds present off the northeastern coast of the Maltese Islands, to enable selection of four appropriate study locations. A <b>quantitative</b> <b>sampler,</b> which samples the total macroinvertebrate assemblages of P. oceanica beds, was designed and tested to determine the appropriate area and number of sampling units required to achieve given levels of accuracy and precision. Using data gathered from the pilot survey, studies were made to examine for differences in P. oceanica plant architecture, and in the species richness and abundance of motile macroinvertebrates between continuous (non-fragmented) and reticulate (fragmented) b eds of the seagrassa, crosst hree different spatial levels: (a) large (severalk m), (b) medium (circa 100 in) and small (tens of metres). A separate study examined differences in the species richness and abundance of associated motile macro invertebrates between living matte (bearing living shoots) and dead matte (without living shoots) of P. oceanica. Results of univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that there was no consistent pattern of significant differences in plant architecture,a nd in the speciesr ichnessa nd abundanceo f associatedm otile macroinvertebratesb etween the two P. oceanica bed types. Significant differences in macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance were detected between P. oceanica beds at the large spatial level that were significantly related to seagrasse piphytesa nd mean sedimentg rain size. Significant differences in macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance were detected between P. oceanica beds at the medium spatial level that were significantly related to shoot biomass. Significant differences in the assemblage composition of macroinvertebrates associated with P. oceanica beds were detected by multivariate analysis at the large and small spatial levels, with the best explanation for the multivariate assemblage structure being a combination of environmental variables that included epiphytes and sediment grain size. The results of the study comparing the motile macroinvertebrates of living and dead matte showed that dead matte supported significantly higher species richness and abundance of associated motile macro invertebrates, and had a significantly different macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, compared to living matte. Furthermore, a greater number of species occurred exclusively in dead matte than in living matte. It was concluded that natural fragmentation of continuous to reticulate P. oceanica beds does not lead to changes in plant architectural differences, or to a reduction in diversity of associated macroinvertebrates, nor does complete loss of the foliar canopy necessarily lead to a reduced diversity of macrofauna. Local factors, including nutrient levels in the water colunm (which enhanced epiphytic growth on the seagrass), sediment grain size and the hydrodynamic regime, were more important in influencing the diversity of macrofauna associated with P. oceanica beds, than bed type, leading to significant spatial variation in the associatedm acroi nvertebrate assemblagesT. he study concluded that the relative importance of different factors in influencing the diversity of macro invertebrates associated with P. oceanica beds varied, depending on scale. The results are discussed in the light of the available published data on fragmentation of seagrass habitat and on current Euro-Mediterranean proposals for the conservation of different bed types of P. oceanica. Attempts to classify different bed types of P. oceanica in categories according to value should be based on adequate ecological data.

40|$|Abstract: The use {{of aquatic}} macroinvertebrates as bio-indicators in water quality studies has {{increased}} con-siderably {{over the last}} decade in Costa Rica, and standard biomonitoring methods have now been formulated at the national level. Nevertheless, questions remain about the effectiveness of different methods of sampling freshwater benthic assemblages, and how sampling intensity may influence biomonitoring results. In this study, we compared the results of qualitative sampling using commonly applied methods with a more intensive quanti-tative approach at 12 sites in small, lowland streams on the southern Caribbean slope of Costa Rica. Qualitative samples were collected following the official protocol using a strainer during a set time period and macroinver-tebrates were field-picked. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>sampling</b> involved collecting ten replicate Surber samples and picking out macroinvertebrates in the laboratory with a stereomicroscope. The strainer sampling method consistently yielded fewer individuals and families than <b>quantitative</b> <b>samples.</b> As a result, site scores calculated using the Biological Monitoring Working Party-Costa Rica (BMWP-CR) biotic index often differed greatly depending on the sampling method. Site water quality classifications using the BMWP-CR index differed between the two sampling methods for 11 of the 12 sites in 2005, and for 9 of the 12 sites in 2006. Sampling intensity clearly had a strong influence on BMWP-CR index scores, as well as perceived differences between reference and impacted sites.

The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the composition of RBA samples with an estimate of community structure based on extensive <b>quantitative</b> <b>sampling.</b> We used logistic regression to explore the relationships between the frequency of a taxon being collected in an RBA sample and its biological and ecological traits, namely its abundance, distribution, body size and habit. RBA <b>samples</b> and <b>quantitative</b> estimates of community structure were made in riffles in the Kangaroo and Nepean Rivers, New South Wales, Australia. Single RBA samples may collect up to 63 % of the taxa that are collected by extensive <b>quantitative</b> <b>sampling</b> at a site. The frequency of a taxon being recorded in an RBA sample was significantly and positively related to all traits tested indicating a bias in the collection methods towards large, abundant and widely distributed taxa. Accordingly, taxa missed by RBA sampling were generally small, narrowly distributed or rare. These findings enhance our understanding of what RBA samples represent, and the bias and source of errors associated with RBA sampling. This study also quantifies the utility of RBA methods for biodiversity assessment. 14 page(s...|$|R
