50|$|The {{operating}} {{point of a}} device, also known as bias point, <b>quiescent</b> <b>point,</b> or Q-point, is the point on the output characteristics that shows the DC collector-emitter voltage (Vce) and the collector current (Ic) with no input signal applied.|$|E
50|$|The (large-signal) Shockley {{equation}} for a diode can be linear {{about the}} bias point or <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> (sometimes called Q-point) {{to find the}} small-signal conductance, capacitance and resistance of the diode. This procedure is {{described in more detail}} under diode modeling, which provides an example of the linear procedure followed in all small-signal models of semiconductor devices.|$|E
40|$|Software updates {{traditionally}} required {{applications to}} be stopped and restarted. Recent works proposed techniques and tools for runtime updates {{without the need for}} stop-ping and restarting applications. Such techniques rely on statically determining <b>quiescent</b> <b>points</b> where the global sys-tem state is consistent. However, <b>quiescent</b> <b>points</b> may be conservatively computed or may not occur frequently dur-ing the lifetime of an application resulting in an indefinite delay of runtime updates. Examples of applications with infrequent <b>quiescent</b> <b>points</b> include computationally-bound applications that spend most of their execution in loops, recursive applications, and multi-threaded applications. We introduce and implement a general approach that allows up-dates to be applied at almost any point during application execution. Unlike other existing approaches, our approach applies to multi-nested long-lived loops, recursive functions, multi-threaded applications, and applications actively re-ceiving data from a network socket. At the heart of our approach is a stack reconstruction technique that ensures that all functions on the call stack are updated at the same time, thereby obviating the need to wait for <b>quiescent</b> <b>points</b> to occur. Our updating system, UpStare, compiles appli-cations specifically with the capability to reconstruct their stack and does not depend on static source code type-safety analysis. Additionally it permits execution continuation to proceed from a drastically different algorithm while reusing existing program state...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a qualitative analysis on gain compression phenomenon of integrated power MOS transistor. In the large-signal operation of power device, the gain compression plays {{an essential role}} for characterizing non-linear behavior. The proposed approach combines both the RF waveform and load line characteristics in different <b>quiescent</b> <b>points.</b> Experimental results demonstrate the approach is feasible. The analysis of gain compression corresponds to different quiescent biases is useful during the implementation of power device for RFIC application. (c) 2007 Elsevier, Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|In a {{great many}} circuit designs, the dc bias {{is fed to a}} {{non-linear}} component via a resistor (or possibly a network of resistors). Since resistors are linear components, it is particularly easy to determine the <b>quiescent</b> operating <b>point</b> of the non-linear device from a graph of its transfer function. The method is as follows: from linear network analysis the output transfer function (that is output voltage against output current) is calculated for the network of resistor(s) and the generator driving them. This will be a straight line (called the load line) and can readily be superimposed on the transfer function plot of the non-linear device. The point where the lines cross is the <b>quiescent</b> operating <b>point.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since SPICE is {{generally}} used to model nonlinear circuits, the small signal analyses are necessarily {{preceded by a}} <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> calculation at which the circuit is linearized. SPICE2 also contained code for other small-signal analyses: sensitivity analysis, pole-zero analysis, and small-signal distortion analysis. Analysis at various temperatures was done by automatically updating semiconductor model parameters for temperature, allowing the circuit to be simulated at temperature extremes.|$|E
50|$|Biasing in {{electronics}} means establishing predetermined voltages or currents {{at various}} points of an electronic circuit {{for the purpose of}} establishing proper operating conditions in electronic components. Many electronic devices such as transistors and vacuum tubes, whose function is processing time-varying (AC) signals also require a steady (DC) current or voltage to operate correctly — a bias. The AC signal applied to them is superposed on this DC bias current or voltage. The operating point of a device, also known as bias point, <b>quiescent</b> <b>point,</b> or Q-point, is the steady-state (DC) voltage or current at a specified terminal of an active device (a transistor or vacuum tube) with no input signal applied. A bias circuit is a portion of the device's circuit which supplies this steady current or voltage.|$|E
50|$|Many circuit {{elements}} that operate linearly at low signal levels will show nonlinearity at higher signal levels. An {{example of this}} can be seen in many audio systems by turning up the volume. At a high enough volume level, the transistors or other amplifying elements will begin to operate nonlinearly and distort the sound. Conversely, nonlinear elements can be made to operate linearly if the signal in them is limited to a low level. If the input of a non-linear device such as a transistor only varies in a small range around a fixed value, then the input/output relation is linearized around this fixed value (usually called the <b>quiescent</b> <b>point,</b> Q-point, or bias point). This is called a small signal model. Non-linear elements will not follow Ohm's law.|$|E
40|$|Quiescent {{consistency}} is {{a notion}} of correctness for a concurrent object that gives meaning to the object's behaviours in quiescent states, i. e., states in which none of the object's operations are being executed. Correctness of an implementation object is {{defined in terms of}} a corresponding abstract specification. This gives rise to two important verification questions: membership (checking whether a behaviour of the implementation is allowed by the specification) and correctness (checking whether all behaviours of the implementation are allowed by the specification). In this paper, we show that the membership problem for quiescent consistency is NP-complete and that the correctness problem is decidable, but coNP-hard and in EXPSPACE. For both problems, we consider restricted versions of quiescent consistency by assuming an upper limit on the number of events between two <b>quiescent</b> <b>points.</b> Here, we show that the membership problem is in PTIME, whereas correctness is in PSPACE. Quiescent consistency does not guarantee sequential consistency, i. e., it allows operation calls by the same process to be reordered when mapping to an abstract specification. Therefore, we also consider quiescent sequential consistency, which strengthens quiescent consistency with an additional sequential consistency condition. We show that the unrestricted versions of membership and correctness are NP-complete and undecidable, respectively. When by placing a limit on the number of events between two <b>quiescent</b> <b>points,</b> membership is in PTIME, while correctness is in PSPACE. Finally, we consider a version of quiescent sequential consistency that places an upper limit on the number of processes for every run of the implementation, and show that the membership problem for quiescent sequential consistency with this restriction is in PTIME...|$|R
40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is a major}} part of the development cycle. The traditional methodology for rolling out an update to existing programs is to shut down the system, modify the binary, and restart the program. Downtime has significant disadvantages. In response to such concerns, researchers and practitioners have investigated how to perform update on running programs whilst maintaining various desired properties. In a multi-threaded setting this is further complicated by the interleaving of different threads' actions. In this thesis we investigate how to prove that safety and liveness are preserved when updating a program. We present two possible approaches; the main intuition behind each of these is to find <b>quiescent</b> <b>points</b> where updates are safe. The first approach requires global synchronisation, and is more generally applicable, but can delay updates indefinitely. The second restricts the class of programs that can be updated, but permits update without global synchronisation, and guarantees application of update. We provide full proofs of all relevant properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the Mariner Mark II Integrated Platform Pointing and Attitude Control System (IPPACS) microstep actuator with momentum compensation and the IPPACS optical reference tracker are examined, and the advantages of this new technology are identified. The momentum-compensated articulation acts to prevent platform articulation activity from disturbing the spacecaft. This guarantees dynamic stability, ensures a <b>quiescent</b> <b>pointing</b> environment, and decouples {{the design of the}} platform from the design of the spacecraft. A microstep actuator with harmonic drive provides platform angular step resolution to 0. 5 arcsec for precision pointing of instruments. An optical reference tracker boresighted with scientific instruments guarantees accurate target-referenced closed-loop pointing. An IPPACS star and target tracker with 1 to 10 arcsec accuracy and wide 11 x 17 degrees field of view has been derived from Advanced Star and Target Reference Optical Sensor (ASTROS) CCD star tracker technology, greatly enhancing the optical referencing capabilities of future multimission interplanetary spacecraft...|$|R
5000|$|However in some {{electronic}} circuits such as radio receivers, telecommunications, sensors, {{instrumentation and signal processing}} circuits, the AC signals are [...] "small" [...] {{compared to the}} DC voltages and currents in the circuit. In these, perturbation theory can be used to derive an approximate AC equivalent circuit which is linear, allowing the AC behavior of the circuit to be calculated easily. In these circuits a steady DC current or voltage from the power supply, called a bias, is applied to each nonlinear component such as a transistor and vacuum tube to set its operating point, and the time-varying AC current or voltage which represents the signal to be processed is added to it. The point on the graph representing the bias current and voltage is called the <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> (Q point). In the above circuits the AC signal is small compared to the bias, representing a small perturbation of the DC voltage or current in the circuit about the Q point. If the characteristic curve of the device is sufficiently flat over the region occupied by the signal, using a Taylor series expansion the nonlinear function can be approximated near the bias point by its first order partial derivative. These partial derivatives represent the incremental capacitance, resistance inductance and gain seen by the signal, and can be used to create a linear equivalent circuit giving the response of the real circuit to a small AC signal. This is called the [...] "small-signal model".|$|E
40|$|In {{systems that}} only have {{short-lived}} threads, {{it is possible}} to define a <b>Quiescent</b> <b>Point</b> (QP(t)), relative to time t, as the earliest time after t where no thread exists that was alive at time t. Quiescent points have a number of uses, such as memory reclamation for lock free objects. QDo is a facility that allows clients to register their interest for QP(t). QDo then moni-tors and notifies interested parties when a <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> is established. We have designed, implemented and analyzed the performance of the QDo facility. QDo works by check-ing the number of active threads in the previous epoch per processor. When that number reaches zero, a local <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> is established. QDo then communicates with other processors to establish a global <b>quiescent</b> <b>point.</b> Our experiment shows that callback latency and overhead is highly dependent on how frequently the QDo facility monitors for <b>quiescent</b> <b>point.</b> Checking frequency of 10 ms results in 2 % overhead for SDET benchmark...|$|E

Magnetic-material data used in the design are the normal magnetization curve and a family of incremental permeability curves. A second procedure, which requires a simpler set of calculations, starts from an assigned <b>quiescent</b> <b>point</b> on the normal magnetization curve and first screens candidate core sizes for suitability, then determines the required turns and air-gap length...|$|E

Pulsed measurements were performed at 300 and $ 10 $ K. Gate and drain lags were observed at both temperatures with a strong increase upon cooling for the drain lag. To study the influence of surface traps in the kink, pulsed measurements of devices passivated by either atomic layer deposited Al²O³ or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited Si³N⁴ were compared with no significant differences at 10 K.
