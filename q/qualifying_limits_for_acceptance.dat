Theoretically this paper is built on the idea that musical meaning conjures not only from the music itself, but also from the perceiver and the situation. Through five interviews this paper answers who the informants are, what music means for them and specifically, what the music of Blutengel means for them. The result shows that the informants were acceptant to the musical change, but for some disappointment would occur if the band continued with orchestral instrumentation.

50|$|The {{statutory}} counties {{formed the}} basis for the so-called “administrative counties”. However, it was felt that large cities and primarily rural areas in the same county could not be well administered by the same body. Thus 59 “counties in themselves”, or “county boroughs”, were created to administer the urban centres of England. These were part of the statutory counties, but not part of the administrative counties. The <b>qualifying</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> county borough status was a population of 50,000, although some historic county towns were given county borough status despite lower populations (e.g., Canterbury, Oxford). Each county borough and administrative county would then become governed by an elected county or borough council, providing services specifically for those areas. The act also created a (metropolitan) County of London from the urban areas (“metropolis”) of London, which was a full statutory county by itself. This county absorbed the Metropolitan Board of Works, which had been established in 1855 specifically to maintain the infrastructure of London.|$|R
40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic {{substances}} {{resulting from the}} secondary metabolism of several strains of filamentous fungi, thereby lowering the immune system, facilitate the emergence of diseases, and reduce weight gain, leading to numerous reproductive and production losses. In tropical and subtropical climates such as Brazil, the fungal development is favored by several factors such as, excellent moisture and temperature conditions.

These systems are subject to wear through use and time, changing their status throughout the lifetime of a vehicle.

Moreover, the steering inspection must guarantee certain requirements, such as, being able to test any vehicle steering system and being low priced. In addition, {{one of the most important}} requirements for any inspection procedure is to provide the measurements in a short time.

Earlier subjective studies aimed to set more precise <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> {{of the quality}} experienced when both the compression artifacts using different 3 D video coding methods and varying amounts of depth are presented. They have also taken a more systematic approach to the examination of depth versus compression artifacts by varying a dense set of parameters that influence quality. In the first mobile 3 D video database, the number of compression artifacts has been varied by selecting five quantization parameters (QPs) {{and the strength of}} the depth effect was varied by selecting two camera baseline ranges. The video sequences in the second 3 D video database have been encoded using four different coding methods, including H. 264 /AVC Simulcast, H. 264 /AVC multiview video coding (MVC), mixed resolution stereo coding (MRSC), and video plus depth (V[*]+[*]D). The encoding parameters have been chosen in accordance with the settings of the prospective system for mobile 3 D video delivery [15] to evaluate the perceived quality provided by each type of content. The combinations of the quality features according to our model, leading to the quality metric, are tested on both databases. The results show that this metric outperforms the current popular metrics over different 3 D video formats and compression methods.|$|R

The tests were performed in columns filled up with batteries either entire or cross-cut, using either deionized water or nitric acid solution as leachant. In a first set of tests, the NEN 7343 standard procedure was followed, with leachant circulating in open circuit from bottom to top through columns. These tests were extended to another leaching step where leachant percolated the columns in a closed loop process. Leachate solutions were periodically sampled and pH, conductivity, density, redox potential, sulphates, chlorides and heavy metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn) were determined in the samples. The results showed that the total amount of substances leached in tests with cross-cut batteries was higher than with entire ones; zinc and sulphates were the substances found the most in the leachate solutions. In general, the amount of substances dissolved in open circuit is higher than in closed loop due to the effect of solution saturation and the absence of fresh solution addition. Results were compared with metal contents in the batteries and with legal <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> in landfill (Decision 2003 / 33 /CE and Decree-Law 152 / 2002).

The extraction stage was determined by monitoring: phase relative volume (Vr), extraction percentage (%E) and tungsten concentration in the microemulsion phase (Ct m e). The reextraction phase was determined by monitoring: reextraction percentage (%Re) and tungsten concentration in the aqueous phase (Ctaq). Finally, we obtained equations that relate the extraction / reextraction properties to the composition of specific points inside the extraction region, obeying the error <b>limits</b> specified <b>for</b> the <b>acceptance</b> of each parameter.

I make a proposal on how the clinical chemistry profession could tackle the challenges focused at the conceptual, technical, and organizational level.
