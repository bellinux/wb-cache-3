5000|$|<b>Quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> is {{the formal}} method for {{describing}} the mathematical relations between abstract physical quantities. (Here the term calculus {{should be understood}} in its broader sense of [...] "a system of computation", {{rather than in the}} sense of differential calculus and integral calculus.) Its roots can be traced to Fourier's concept of dimensional analysis (1822). The basic axiom of <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> is Maxwell's description of a physical quantity as the product of a [...] "numerical value" [...] and a [...] "reference quantity" [...] (i.e. a [...] "unit quantity" [...] or a [...] "unit of measurement"). De Boer summarized the multiplication, division, addition, association and commutation rules of <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> and proposed that a full axiomatization has yet to be completed.|$|E

5000|$|A careful {{distinction}} {{needs to}} be made between abstract quantities and measurable quantities. The multiplication and division rules of <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> are applied to SI base units (which are measurable quantities) to define SI derived units, including dimensionless derived units, such as the radian (rad) and steradian (sr) which are useful for clarity, although they are both algebraically equal to 1. Thus there is some disagreement about whether it is meaningful to multiply or divide units. Emerson suggests that if the units of a quantity are algebraically simplified, they then are no longer units of that quantity. Johansson proposes that there are logical flaws in the application of <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus,</b> and that the so-called dimensionless quantities should be understood as [...] "unitless quantities".|$|E

50|$|Curvilinear {{coordinates}} {{are often}} used to define the location or distribution of physical quantities which may be, for example, scalars, vectors, or tensors. Mathematical expressions involving these <b>quantities</b> in vector <b>calculus</b> and tensor analysis (such as the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian) can be transformed from one coordinate system to another, according to transformation rules for scalars, vectors, and tensors. Such expressions then become valid for any curvilinear coordinate system.|$|R
50|$|The {{multiplication}} sign {{is usually}} left out, {{just as it}} is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus.</b> In formulas the unit Z can be treated {{as if it were a}} specific magnitude of a kind of physical dimension: see dimensional analysis for more on this treatment.|$|E
50|$|With {{advances}} {{in the theory of}} electromagnetism and in <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus,</b> it became apparent that a coherent absolute system of units could only include one electromagnetic base unit. The first such system was proposed by Giorgi in 1901: it used the ohm as the additional base unit in the MKS system, and so {{is often referred to as}} the MKSΩ system or the Giorgi system.|$|E
5000|$|Unit {{conversion}} is {{a notorious}} source of errors. Many people apply individual rules, e.g. [...] "to obtain length in centimeters multiply the length in inches by 2.54", but combining several such conversions is laborious {{and prone to}} mistakes. A better way {{is to use the}} factor-label method, which is closely related to dimensional analysis, and <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> explained in sections 1.1 and 7.1 of this compilation.|$|E

40|$|Proteomic {{analysis}} of dental calculus {{is emerging as}} {{a powerful tool for}} disease and dietary characterisation of archaeological populations. To better understand the variability in protein results from dental calculus, we analysed 21 samples from three Roman-period populations to compare: 1) the quantity of extracted protein; 2) the number of mass spectral queries; and 3) the number of peptide spectral matches and protein identifications. We found little correlation between the <b>quantity</b> of <b>calculus</b> analysed and total protein identifications, as well as no systematic trends between site location and protein preservation. We identified a wide range of individual variability, which may be associated with the mechanisms of calculus formation and/or post-depositional contamination, in addition to taphonomic factors. Our results suggest dental calculus is indeed a stable, long-term reservoir of proteins as previously reported, but further systematic studies are needed to identify mechanisms associated with protein entrapment and survival in dental calculus...|$|R
5000|$|While Leibniz's {{notation}} is used {{by modern}} mathematics, his logical base was different from our current one. Leibniz embraced infinitesimals and wrote extensively so as, “not {{to make of the}} infinitely small a mystery, as had Pascal.” According to Gilles Deleuze, Leibniz's zeroes [...] "are nothings, but they are not absolute nothings, they are nothings respectively" [...] (quoting Leibniz' text [...] "Justification of the calculus of infinitesimals by the calculus of ordinary algebra"). [...] Alternatively, he defines them as, “less than any given quantity.” For Leibniz, the world was an aggregate of infinitesimal points and the lack of scientific proof for their existence did not trouble him. Infinitesimals to Leibniz were ideal quantities of a different type from appreciable numbers. The truth of continuity was proven by existence itself. For Leibniz the principle of continuity and thus the validity of his calculus was assured. Three hundred years after Leibniz's work, Abraham Robinson showed that using infinitesimal <b>quantities</b> in <b>calculus</b> could be given a solid foundation.|$|R
40|$|An {{algebraic}} structure {{underlying the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> is proposed consisting in an algebraic fiber bundle, that is, a base structure {{which is a}} free Abelian group together with fibers which are one dimensional vector spaces, all of them bound by algebraic restrictions. Subspaces, tensor product and quotient spaces are considered as well as homomorphisms to end with a classification theorem of these structures. The new structure provides an axiomatic foundation for <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> and gives complete justification within its framework {{of the way that}} <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> is actually performed.

40|$|Dental {{calculus}} is a mineralized plaque biofilm {{formed by}} microbiota {{of the oral}} microbiome. Until recently, the vast research potential of dental calculus for archaeological study was not fully appreciated and it was often discarded. It is now recognized that dental calculus entombs and preserves valuable microfossils and biomolecules within its matrix. While microscopic and bimolecular analysis of calculus is destructive, judicious sampling of relatively small quantities of material can provide unique information on ancient health and diet. Additionally, dental calculus is not classified as human tissue, but as an ectopic growth, {{and in some cases}} may provide an alternative approach to the destructive analysis of human skeletal remains. We present a case study recovering proteins, DNA and microscopic debris from Roman Age individuals to demonstrate the important insights into diet, health and disease that can be obtained from even minute <b>quantities</b> of dental <b>calculus...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} Riemannian 4 d BF lattice gauge theory, on a triangulation of spacetime. Introducing {{the simplicity}} constraints which turn BF theory into simplicial gravity, some geometric <b>quantities</b> of Regge <b>calculus,</b> areas, and 3 d and 4 d dihedral angles, are identified. The parallel transport conditions are {{taken care of}} to ensure a consistent gluing of simplices. We show that these gluing relations, together with the simplicity constraints, contain the constraints of area-angle Regge calculus in a simple way, via the group structure of the underlying BF gauge theory. This provides a precise road from constrained BF theory to area-angle Regge calculus. Doing so, a framework combining variables of lattice BF theory and Regge calculus is built. The action takes a form à la Regge and includes {{the contribution of the}} Immirzi parameter. In the absence of simplicity constraints, the standard spin foam model for BF theory is recovered. Insertions of local observables are investigated, leading to Casimir insertions for areas and 6 j-symbols for 3 d angles. The present formulation is argued to be suitable for deriving spin foam models from discrete path integrals. Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures, addition of a few comments and reference...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} this paper fall into two closely related areas. First, we develop a formal {{framework}} for deterministic unital quantities in which measurement unitization is understood to be a built-in feature of quantities rather than a mere annotation of their numerical values with convenient units. We introduce this idea within the setting of certain ordered semigroups of physical-geometric states of classical physical systems. States are assumed to serve as truth makers of metrological statements about quantity values. A unital quantity is presented as an isomorphism from the target system’s ordered semigroup of states to that of positive reals. This framework allows us to include various derived and variable quantities, encountered in engineering and the natural sciences. For illustration and ease of presentation, we use the classical notions of length, time, electric current and mean velocity as primordial examples. The most important application of the resulting unital <b>quantity</b> <b>calculus</b> is in dimensional analysis. Second, in evaluating measurement uncertainty due to the analog-to-digital conversion of the measured quantity’s value into its measuring instrument’s pointer quantity value, we employ an ordered semigroup framework of pointer states. Pointer states encode the measuring instrument’s indiscernibility relation, manifested by {{not being able to}} distinguish the measured system’s topologically proximal states. Once again, we focus mainly on the measurement of length and electric current quantities as our motivating examples. Our approach to quantities and their measurement is strictly state-based and algebraic in flavor, rather than that of a representationalist-style structure-preserving numerical assignment...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Demand {{considered}} {{in most of}} the classical inventory models is constant, while {{in most of the}} practical cases the demand changes with time. In this study model has been framed to study the items whose demand changes with time and deterioration rate increases with time. The effect of permissible delay is also incorporated in this study. The objective of this research is to develop an inventory model for perishable items whose perish-ability rate as well as demand increases with time Approach: Firstly, problem is framed in the form of linear differential equation model and this model had been solved using general solution techniques of linear differential equations. The solution obtained gives the inventory level at any particular time of the cycle period. With the help of this inventory level, total as well as average inventory cost has been obtained. Results: This study developed a model to determine an optimal order <b>quantity</b> by using <b>calculus</b> technique of maxima and minima. Thus it helps retailer to decide its optimal ordering quantity under the constraints of variable deterioration rate and linear pattern of demand. Conclusion: Numerical solution of the suggested model had also been proposed, the above model can be converted into constant demand model, or for items having no deterioration. This study can further be extended for items having some other demand pattern, also time value of money and inflation can be incorporated in this model to make it more realistic and present business environment suited...|$|R
40|$|We examine one loop amplitudes {{for open}} and closed strings in certain D-brane configurations, and {{investigate}} {{the consequences for}} phenomenology. Initially we consider open strings at D 6 -brane intersections. We develop techniques for one-loop diagrams. The one-loop propagator of chiral intersection states is calculated exactly and its finiteness is shown to be guaranteed by RR tadpole cancellation. The result is used to demonstrate the expected softening of power law running of Yukawa couplings at the string scale. We also develop methods to calculate arbitrary TV-point functions at one-loop, including those without gauge bosons in the loop. These techniques are also applicable to heterotic orbifold models. One issue of the intersecting D 6 -brane models is that the Yukawa couplings of the simpler models suffer from the so-called "rank one" problem - {{there is only a}} single non-zero mass and no mixing. We consider the one-loop contribution of E 2 -instantons to Yukawa couplings on intersecting D 6 -branes, and show that they can provide a solution. In addition they have the potential to provide a geometric explanation for the hierarchies observed in the Yukawa couplings. In order to do this we provide the necessary <b>quantities</b> for instanton <b>calculus</b> in this class of background. We then explore how the IR pathologies of noncommutative field theory are resolved when the theory is realized as open strings in background B-fields: essentially, since the IR singularities are induced by UV/IR mixing, string theory brings them under control {{in much the same way}} as it does the uv singularities. We show that at intermediate scales (where the Selberg-Witten limit is a good approximation) the theory reproduces the noncommutative field theory with all the (un) usual features such as UV/IR mixing, but that outside this regime, in the deep infra-red, the theory flows continuously to the commutative theory and normal Wilsoman behaviour is restored. The resulting low energy physics resembles normal commutative physics, but with additional suppressed Lorentz violating operators. We also show that the phenomenon of UV/IR mixing occurs for the graviton as well, with the result that, in configurations where Planck's constant receives a significant one-loop correction (for example brane-induced gravity), the distance scale below which gravity becomes non-Newtonian can be much greater than any compact dimensions.
