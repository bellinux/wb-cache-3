5|$|A {{key element}} of quantum {{mechanics}} is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the <b>quantization</b> of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's 1905 {{predictions}} were verified experimentally {{in several}} ways {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan's Nobel lecture. However, before Compton's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy <b>quantization</b> resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where it was much more difficult not to ascribe <b>quantization</b> to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E
5|$|Since the Maxwell {{theory of}} light allows for all {{possible}} energies of electromagnetic radiation, most physicists assumed initially {{that the energy}} <b>quantization</b> resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbs or emits the radiation. In 1905, Einstein {{was the first to}} propose that energy <b>quantization</b> was a property of electromagnetic radiation itself. Although he accepted the validity of Maxwell's theory, Einstein pointed out that many anomalous experiments could be explained if the energy of a Maxwellian light wave were localized into point-like quanta that move independently of one another, even if the wave itself is spread continuously over space. In 1909 and 1916, Einstein showed that, if Planck's law of black-body radiation is accepted, the energy quanta must also carry momentum , making them full-fledged particles. This photon momentum was observed experimentally by Arthur Compton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1927. The pivotal question was then: how to unify Maxwell's wave theory of light with its experimentally observed particle nature? The answer to this question occupied Albert Einstein {{for the rest of his}} life, and was solved in quantum electrodynamics and its successor, the Standard Model (see Second <b>quantization</b> and The photon as a gauge boson, below).|$|E

We construct a universal family of Uh(g) invariant <b>quantizations</b> of the sheaf of functions on M and describe all such <b>quantizations.</b> We also describe all two parameter Uh(g) invariant <b>quantizations</b> on M, which {{can be considered as}} Uh(g) invariant <b>quantizations</b> of the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau (KKS) Poisson bracket on M. We also consider how those <b>quantizations</b> relate to the natural polarizations of M with respect to the KKS bracket.

5|$|While the {{electromagnetic}} field {{together with the}} gravitational field are the only classical fields providing accurate descriptions of nature, other types of classical fields are important too. In the approach to quantum field theory (QFT) referred to as second <b>quantization,</b> the starting point is one or more classical fields, where e.g. the wave functions solving the Dirac equation are considered as classical fields prior to (second) <b>quantization.</b> While second <b>quantization</b> and the Lagrangian formalism associated with {{it is not a}} fundamental aspect of QFT, it is the case that so far all quantum field theories can be approached this way, including the standard model. In these cases, there are classical versions of the field equations following from the Euler–Lagrange equations derived from the Lagrangian using the principle of least action. These field equations must be relativistically invariant, and their solutions (which will qualify as relativistic wave functions according to the definition below) must transform under some representation of the Lorentz group.|$|E
