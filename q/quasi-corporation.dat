50|$|A <b>quasi-corporation</b> is {{an entity}} that {{exercises}} {{some of the}} functions of a corporation, but has not been granted separate legal personality by statute. For example, a public corporation with limited authority and powers such as a county or school district is a <b>quasi-corporation.</b> In the United States, such entities are {{often referred to as}} quasi-municipal corporations.|$|E
5000|$|In practice, all unincorporated {{enterprises}} {{owned by}} households {{that are not}} <b>quasi-corporations</b> fall in this category, except for the [...] "imputed rental value of owner-occupied housing" [...] and paid domestic staff employed by households, an activity that is considered to generate no surplus.|$|R
30|$|Private unincorporated {{enterprises}} (excluding <b>quasi-corporations)</b> such as enterprises {{owned by}} individuals or households {{that are not}} constituted as separate legal entities independently of their owners, and for which no complete accounts are available that would permit a financial separation of the production activities of the enterprise from the other activities of its owner(s).|$|R
50|$|Volume 5 (companies) {{is devoted}} entirely to company law, and forms a {{treatise}} of 768 pages on that subject. After a general {{consideration of the}} nature and domicile of companies, the work considers briefly the history of company legislation. Then follows an elaborate treatise on the Companies Act 1908. Special companies, like banking, insurance and public service companies, are considered; as well as chartered companies, the livery companies of the city of London, <b>quasi-corporations,</b> and illegal companies; and a few pages are devoted to foreign companies. The reviewer in the Harvard Law Review thought the table of cases cited must contain at least five thousand cases. He said the importance of this treatise was at once apparent; and that to the commercial lawyer in the Eastern cities of the United States it would be exceedingly useful.|$|R
40|$|From an {{economic}} perspective {{the value of}} a group of related businesses under one management is derived from the potential for synergy, based on the exploitation of underlying economies of scope. To realise this inherent economic value, organisational theorists have argued that a purposively cooperative pattern of structures, systems and processes must be put in place. Divisions of modem multidivisional companies are internal, <b>quasi-corporations</b> of related businesses and, as such, theoretical economic/organisational rationales would posit divisions as cooperative enterprises. Using a sample of divisions purposively chosen to comprise businesses that were highly related, this thesis set out to explore the extent to which divisional managing directors expressed views and initiated organisational dynamics consistent with a cooperative perspective. Semi-structured interviews with senior divisional personnel in 12 divisions and with business and functional level staff in 2 of these provided the prime source of data which served as a basis from which a case study was written for each division. The cases were analysed in terms of the membership benefits (value) the divisional managing director was attempting to optimise for the component businesses {{and the extent to which}} he expressed a cooperative orientation and was overseeing cooperative structures, processes and systems. Two categories of division are identified. The 'cooperative' grouping is consistent with the theoretical view of economies of scope and cooperative structures but a larger number of divisions are categorised as 'non-cooperative' with perspectives, systems etc. consistent with a traditional M-form orientation of autonomous, non-interacting businesses. Reasons for this mismatch of theory and practice are discussed with the existence of non-cooperative divisions being explained as the consequence of a variety of organisational contingencies. Implications for divisional management and practice in multidivisional firms are suggested...|$|R
