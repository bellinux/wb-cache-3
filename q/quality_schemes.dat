5000|$|Under {{the heading}} of “Product of my farm” the European Commission has started to take an {{interest}} in promoting farmgate sales and is contemplating a policy which would encourage farmers to engage in direct marketing schemes for their produce. A specific labelling scheme is in development as the so-called “Quality Regulation” - Art. 55 of Regulation (EU) No. 1151/2012 on <b>quality</b> <b>schemes</b> for agricultural products and foodstuffs [...] - required a study on the benefits of a ‘farmgate label’ to be completed until 2014. This study was presented on 6 December 2013 (Commission fosters debate on potential‘local food’ labelling scheme: http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/newsroom/150_en.htm) (Local farming and direct sales: http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/local-farming-direct-sales/index_en.htm) but remains non-committal toward the launch of labelling scheme rather relying on existing tools to promote farmgate sales (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2013:0501:FIN:EN:PDF).

40|$|Research PaperWithin the French {{fish farming}} sector, {{both in the}} {{freshwater}} sector (trout, carps) and in the marine sector (seabass, seabream, turbot), during the last years have emerged a number of <b>quality</b> <b>schemes.</b> These <b>quality</b> <b>schemes</b> show various forms (national charters with third part certification, standard, official quality labels, private certification, collective trademarks), they correspond to various levels of constraints in the specifications, {{and they have been}} initiated by diverse types of operators (producers, processors, distributors), as individuals or groups. Using the results of interviews of operators in the supply chain for the different sectors, we analyse the effects of the setting up of <b>quality</b> <b>schemes,</b> for the enterprises (production, processing), for the collective organization, and for the product enhancement. In the enterprises, the importance of induced changes varies greatly depending on their initial situation, the main changes being brought by setting traceability. In the case of collective <b>quality</b> <b>schemes,</b> an overall improvement of quality is recognized by the actors, but the expectations by the producers of a premium is hardly satisfied, in the present organization of the chain. At present, the small number of companies officially certified for labels show generally good results, but those can hardly be generalised.

Before the Reform, European Union market intervention for food quality was confined to the regulatory ground. The paper discusses the economic justifications for financial aid {{in the case of}} quality improvement {{and in the case of}} information circulation and provision of assurance to consumers. The possibility to add new <b>Quality</b> <b>Schemes</b> at the existing ones is criticized because of the information overcrowding. Furthermore, it is argued that a race to the bottom mechanism could be enforced as a result of the introduction of the possibility to settle <b>Quality</b> <b>Schemes</b> on a national basis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the changes which the new Regulation No 1151 / 2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) of 21 November 2012 on <b>quality</b> <b>schemes</b> for agricultural products and foodstuffs brings to the Czech law system. This Regulation cancelled and replaced the hitherto valid EU regulation {{in the area of}} protection of Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) with agricultural products and foodstuffs. This regulation reflects the effort of the EU to support the development of PDO, PGI and TSG at Union level and to ensure their protection in third countries within the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The producers of foodstuffs and agricultural products labelled PDO, PGI and TSG meet the demands of consumers for quality foodstuffs with clearly declared geographical origin. The <b>quality</b> <b>schemes</b> for foodstuffs can thus {{contribute to the development of}} rural areas, provide producers with the right tools to better identify and promote their products and protect those producers against unfair practice...|$|E
