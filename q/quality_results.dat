25|$|The {{contamination}} of both groundwater and nearby streams {{may be for}} long periods of time. Deterioration of stream <b>quality</b> <b>results</b> from acid mine drainage, toxic trace elements, high content of dissolved solids in mine drainage water, and increased sediment loads discharged to streams. When coal surfaces are exposed, pyrite comes in contact with water and air and forms sulfuric acid. As water drains from the mine, the acid moves into the waterways; as long as rain falls on the mine tailings the sulfuric-acid production continues, whether the mine is still operating or not. Also waste piles and coal storage piles can yield sediment to streams. Surface waters may be rendered unfit for agriculture, human consumption, bathing, or other household uses.|$|E

2500|$|Water {{services}} {{authorities were}} historically {{responsible for the}} monitoring of drinking water. Local authorities were responsible for testing the quality of water, {{in conjunction with the}} Local Health Office (HSE). Under the 2007 Drinking Water Regulations, the EPA had supervisory powers for public water supplies, and could direct a water services authority to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. Where the EPA found deficiencies, it would make recommendations as to what action the water services authority needs to take to remedy any deficiency. Likewise, water services authorities had a supervisory role in relation to group water schemes and private supplies, and would notify the EPA of drinking water non-compliances or risks to public health from a public water supply. Since the formation of Irish Water, it is legally obliged to [...] "submit all drinking water <b>quality</b> <b>results</b> for compliance testing to the EPA on an annual basis".|$|E
2500|$|Chromolithography {{became the}} most {{successful}} of several methods of colour printing developed by the 19th century; other methods were developed by printers such as Jacob Christoph Le Blon, George Baxter and Edmund Evans, and mostly relied on using several woodblocks with the colors. Hand-coloring also remained important; elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were colored by hand by boys until 1875. [...] Chromolithography developed from lithography and the term covers various types of lithography that are printed in color. The initial technique involved {{the use of multiple}} lithographic stones, one for each color, and was still extremely expensive when done for the best <b>quality</b> <b>results.</b> Depending on the number of colors present, a chromolithograph could take months to produce, by very skilled workers. [...] However much cheaper prints could be produced by simplifying both the number of colors used, and the refinement of the detail in the image. [...] Cheaper images, like the advertisement illustrated, relied heavily on an initial black print (not always a lithograph), on which colors were then overprinted. To make an expensive reproduction print as what was once referred to as a [...] "’chromo’", a lithographer, with a finished painting in front of him, gradually created and corrected the many stones using proofs to look as much as possible like the painting in front of him, sometimes using dozens of layers.|$|E

40|$|Leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) is {{a theory}} of leadership that specifically focuses {{on the quality of}} the relationship between a manager and his/her subordinates. Previous research has shown the link between LMX quality and employee attitudes and behaviours at work. However, to the authors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge, research is yet to specifically investigate the link between LMX quality and employee emotions. Also little understood are the social exchanges that lead to and maintain LMX quality ("currencies of exchange" in LMX theory). We introduce the notion of currency of exchange quality - whether the currency is present to a good enough extent or not (either in absence or excess) - and theoretically link this to employee emotions. A field study was designed and conducted to investigate the links. The study supported the propositions that high LMX relationships with good enough currency <b>quality</b> <b>resulted</b> in more positive employee emotions; low LMX with an absence of currency <b>quality</b> <b>resulted</b> in more negative emotions; and low LMX with an excess of currency <b>quality</b> <b>resulted</b> in mixed emotions. An unexpected finding was that high LMX was also associated with excess currency quality and mixed emotions. The affective evaluations and discrete emotions experienced varied according to the currency and its quality...|$|R
