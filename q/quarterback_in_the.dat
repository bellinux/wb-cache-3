40|$|Despite the {{prominence}} of professional football in U. S. culture, {{little research has been}} conducted examining the social construction of race <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. People have a cultural perception of race; what effect does this perception have on the players? There has been research on the historical struggles of Black athletes in collegiate football, as well as lasting issues of racism. To add to this body of literature, this analysis will focus on the institutional racism embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drafting practices of <b>quarterbacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> National Football League (NFL). This paper finds that institutional racism has a lasting effect on the hiring of Black <b>quarterbacks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFL.

5|$|The Browns' first game, {{against the}} Miami Seahawks, {{took place on}} a warm late-summer evening in September. The crowd was the second-largest ever for a {{professional}} football game.

Miami's team, drawn mainly from the Southern United States, was overmatched by Cleveland. The score was 27–0 at halftime and the final was 44–0. Browns end Mac Speedie scored the team's first points on a 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cliff Lewis.
