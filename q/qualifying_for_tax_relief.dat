40|$|The German Retirement Saving Act {{instituted a}} new funded system of {{supplementary}} pensions {{coupled with a}} general reduction {{in the level of}} state pay-as-you-go old-age pensions. In order to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>tax</b> <b>relief,</b> the providers of supplementary savings products must offer a guarantee of the nominal value at retirement of contributions paid into these saving accounts. This paper explores how this "money-back" guarantee works and evaluates alternative designs for guarantee structures, including a life cycle model (dynamic asset allocation), a plan with a pre-specified blend of equity and bond investments (static asset allocation), and some type of portfolio insurance. We use a simulation methodology to compare hedging effectiveness and hedging costs associated with the provision of the money-back guarantee. In addition, the guarantee has important implications for regulators who must find an appropriate solvency system for such saving schemes. This version June 17, 2002.

50|$|If any R&D revenue {{expenditure}} is capitalised in a company's accounts, it {{may still}} <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> R&D <b>Tax</b> <b>Relief</b> {{or it may}} only qualify under RDAs.

HMRC give details on how to distinguish between the two categories on their website and in their CIRD manual. Further detail can also be found in section 1308 of Corporation Tax Act 2009 (which in turn updated section 53 of Finance Act 2004) in relation to the revenue treatment of capitalised costs which relate to intangible assets.|$|R
50|$|Lara Croft was financed through Tele München Gruppe (TMG), a German tax shelter. The tax law of Germany allowed {{investors to}} take an instant tax {{deduction}} even on non-German productions {{and even if the}} film has not gone into production. By selling them the copyright for $94 million and then buying it back for $83.8 million, Paramount Pictures made $10.2 million.

40|$|Small {{businesses}} form {{an essential}} part of any country’s economy and these businesses are essential for growth and employment opportunities. It is however recognised that the success of small businesses are dependent on a few factors of which <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures are one. The South African Government is supporting small businesses in our country through various initiatives and current small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures form part of these initiatives. This study focuses on only two such <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures namely section 12 E of the Income <b>Tax</b> Act <b>for</b> entities that <b>qualify</b> as a small business corporation and Turnover <b>Tax</b> <b>for</b> entities that <b>qualify</b> as micro businesses. These two <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures aim to give small businesses reduced tax rates to assist them to grow and contribute towards job creation in South Africa. The unemployment rate in South Africa {{in the second quarter of}} 2013 was 25. 6 %. This is thus one indication that the <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures per section 12 E of the Income Tax Act and Turnover Tax are possibly not meeting the objectives of assisting small businesses to grow and alleviate unemployment. This study focuses on researching the current small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures in South Africa. The study thus commences with a literature review regarding the small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures per section 12 E of the Income Tax Act and Turnover Tax. It also includes detailed discussions regarding the criteria which should be met by small businesses to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> per section 12 E and Turnover Tax. The study then proceeds to obtain and analyse data through a questionnaire to accountants regarding their opinion of the current small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures. Finally the study researches the objectives set out by SARS for section 12 E of the Income Tax Act and Turnover Tax to determine whether these objectives have been met or not and to critically compare this to the responses from the accountants on the same subject. As a result this study will assist the South African Government to determine areas for possible improvement in the current small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures. Improvements in such <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures could then contribute positively towards the economy of South Africa as a whole. The small business <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures were however limited to those already implemented in South Africa and further research could possibly be conducted regarding such <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> measures in other developing countries similar to South Africa.
