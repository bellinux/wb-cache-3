5|$|Bill McGinnis <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> {{homeotic}} gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in the genes that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5/6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 2nd Battalion disengaged from the North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00 on September 6. The North Koreans <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Moving by itself and completely cut off from all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit.|$|E

5|$|On January 2, 2007, {{the author}} posted the 1.0 {{version of the}} BackupHDDVD utility, which {{included}} support for the decoding of discs using volume keys. For several weeks following the utility's release no success using the author's key extraction technique was reported. In mid-January 2007, a volume key was published by {{another member of the}} Doom9 forum along with an explanation of the technique used to obtain it. Other forum members <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> keys for different titles. Keys for many discs are now readily available on the internet.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan of Oman ordered six Mercedes 450 limousines in 1977, but <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that they}} were not as safe as he had been led to believe. His ex-SAS bodyguards tested one of the cars in the desert in July 1977, by firing at it, but a bullet hit an {{emergency}} air cylinder, which led to the petrol tank blowing up, burning the whole car. The remaining cars were immediately sent back, with a demand to refund the money spent.|$|E
5|$|This unorthodox {{deployment}} {{gave the}} Smith Gun 360 degrees of rotation which, {{combined with a}} maximum 40-degree elevation, produced a basic firing-plate-mounted field weapon light enough to be towed behind a civilian vehicle, despite not being designed for this. (Home Guard units <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> this fact, having to be prohibited from doing so as it would damage the weapon's wheels (and possibly the axle), inhibiting or even preventing traverse.) Happily, ammunition shortages made the similarly-constructed limber redundant and so a source of spare parts.|$|E
2500|$|Years later, Isaac {{tells the}} same lie {{regarding}} his wife, Rebekah, but Abimelech <b>quickly</b> <b>discovers</b> the truth. [...] Appalled, he confronts Isaac, saying, [...] "Whoever touches this man or his wife shall surely {{be put to}} death." ...|$|R

5|$|Euler's formal {{education}} started in Basel, {{where he was}} sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the University of Basel, and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of Descartes and Newton. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from Johann Bernoulli, who <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics. At that time Euler's main studies included theology, Greek, and Hebrew at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.|$|E
5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or Young Soldiers) Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Battalion {{disengaged}} {{from the}} North Korean and began its withdrawal at 03:00, September 6. The battalion abandoned {{two of its}} own tanks, one because of mechanical failure and the other because it was stuck in the mud. The battalion moved to the rear in two main groups: G Company to attack Hill 464 {{and the rest of}} the battalion to seize Hill 380, farther south. The North Koreans <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> that the 2nd Battalion was withdrawing and attacked it. The battalion commander, Major Omar T. Hitchner, and his operations officer, Captain James T. Milam, were killed. In the vicinity of Hills 464 and 380 the battalion discovered at daybreak that it was virtually surrounded by North Koreans. Nist thought that the entire battalion was lost.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making {{their way down the}} hill to meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> the bodies of the American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E
5|$|As the GTA and PVE launch further {{attacks on}} the Shivans, it is <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> that what is left is unorganised, leading the {{alliance}} to co-ordinate a full invasion of their main strongholds, as other systems they occupied slowly return under Terran and Vasudan control. But as the last remaining threat from the Shivans is crushed, officers in the highest echelons of the GTI effect an attempt to cover-up plans for a coup against the GTA by going after the Krios, the only ship aware of the plot and thus {{a threat to their}} plans. However, the pilots sent out by the Krios during the final fight with the Shivans, return early, arriving in time to discover the treason and alert GTA command. Realising that much of the GTI has gone rogue and fighting against the alliance, the remnants of the GTI loyal to the GTA cause is merged with its battle-groups and begins conducting operations to bring down the ringleaders, including the capture of the Repulse.|$|E

50|$|Philip <b>quickly</b> <b>discovers</b> {{that the}} mine is {{inhabited}} by an ecosystem of abnormally large and hostile animals: dogs, giant spiders, and gargantuan earthworms among others. Abandoned outposts and various scattered papers {{found throughout the}} mine indicate that a secret society is studying some unusual phenomena inside the mines.|$|R
5|$|Colpoys {{immediately}} {{ordered his}} squadron to give chase and at 12:00 the strange ships {{were identified as}} a squadron of French frigates. The French ships were the 36-gun Gloire, Gentille and Fraternité, led by Captain Beens of Gloire and on a three-month raiding cruise from Brest in the Bay of Biscay that had so-far been uneventful: the only prize taken had been a small Spanish merchant brig. Beens <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> the danger his squadron was in, and gave orders for them to sail westwards away from the British squadron. However, the wind favoured Colpoys and his vastly superior squadron rapidly gained on the French frigates. The first British ship to come within range was the 74-gun HMS Colossus under Captain John Monkton, which managed to exchange distant gunfire with the rearmost French ship before the gap widened once more.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} Schmitt {{established}} radio {{communication with the}} 1st Battalion, 9th infantry. When daylight came Schmitt and his group {{saw that they were}} surrounded by North Koreans. One force occupied the higher knob half a mile above them, formerly held by B Company. Below them, North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units, some of them already several miles eastward. The North Koreans <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> Task Force Manchu group. They first attacked it at 14:00 that afternoon, and were repulsed. That night an estimated company attacked three times, pressing the fight to close quarters, but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter. Daylight of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter.|$|E
5|$|In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg {{set out for}} the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a {{doctoral}} degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor's dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who <b>quickly</b> <b>discovered</b> that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.|$|E
