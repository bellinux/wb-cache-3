5|$|Al-Tabari's account {{does not}} mention the Romans, Odaenathus, Vaballathus or the Sassanians; {{focusing}} on the tribes and their relations, it is immersed in legends. Although the account is certainly based {{on the story of}} Zenobia, it is probably conflated with the story of a semi-legendary nomadic Arab queen (or queens). Al-Zabba' fortress was probably Halabiye, which was restored by the historic Palmyrene <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> named Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, <b>queen,</b> <b>and</b> their son.|$|E
5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> her son to parade her in his planned triumph.|$|E

5|$|France officially annexed Madagascar on January 1, 1896. That August, the French officially {{declared}} Madagascar to {{be their}} colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. The <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony's exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister {{would need to be}} selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on the <b>queen</b> <b>and</b> would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen's minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.|$|E

2500|$|To mate, M. mexicanus winged <b>queens</b> <b>and</b> males {{emerge from}} an {{existing}} colony and swarm in nuptial flights. These flights occur in late July in the evening, typically {{at about the}} same time of day when the colony workers begin foraging. The flights usually occur the day after a rain. A normal nuptial flight lasts about an hour and half. After the flight, unmated <b>queens</b> <b>and</b> males return to the nest. The fact that some <b>queens</b> <b>and</b> males return from these flights unmated suggests that aerial union is difficult. [...] The mated queens lose their wings, and the mated males die.|$|R

Swarm-founding evolved from independent-founding and Ropalidia is the only genus with both types, making it an excellent model system for understanding this dramatic shift in colony organization. We have isolated 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci from three species of Ropalidia, including two independent-founding and one swarm-founding species. These loci will allow us to reconstruct colony social and genetic structures in this important genus...|$|R
