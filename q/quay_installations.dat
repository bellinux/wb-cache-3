Thc proceeding angle is determined by measurning two minimum distances to the quay from two sound sources which obtained at the normal incident of ultrasound to the <b>quay.</b> The <b>installation</b> arrangment of these transducers is shown in Fig. 4 and the measuring systen in Fig. 5. The required proceeding angle to the quay {{can be obtained by}} the following equations sinθ=△d/ 1,△d=d 1 -d 2 θ≒△d/ 0. 017. 1 in degrees where, d 1 and d 2 are the two minimum distances and 1 is the distance between the two sound sources...|$|R
