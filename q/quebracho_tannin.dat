50|$|<b>Quebracho</b> {{produces}} <b>tannins</b> {{that can}} be extracted in quebracho sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and white quebracho (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the quebracho extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). <b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannins</b> give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited quebracho extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins</b> present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|R

40|$|Tannins {{have been}} largely studied as wood {{additives}} and wood adhesives. In a perspective of a desirably increased utilization of natural raw material in the wood timber industries, this study provides further and specific information {{on the use of}} condensed tannins to improve the heat resistance of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. The results obtained by thermomechanical and thermogravimetric analyses show that high percentage (33 and 50 %) of <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> in UF-tannin blend dramatically improves the overall UF thermal resistance, but 50 % of tannin decreases the maximum value of modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the bonded joint. The best balance between mechanical performance and decreased degradation at high temperature is obtained with 33 % of <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin.</b> The MOE value of UF + 33 % of <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> at 260 A degrees C is seven times greater than MOE of UF control. Thermograms show that <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> has a beneficial effect on increasing the resistance of glue-mix to degradation induced by temperature. When the content of tannin in the glue-mix is increased up to 50 %, the resin degrades completely at about 670 A degrees C, i. e. more than 50 A degrees C higher than neat UF resin. This improvement is related mainly to the resorcinol-type ring structure of tannin and the alkaline pH of UF + <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> glue mix that confer a higher resistance against joint degradation to UF even at elevated temperatures...|$|E

Thirteen lambs (45 days of age) were assigned to two dietary treatments: seven lambs were fed a barley-based concentrate (control group) while the other six lambs received the same concentrate with supplemental <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins</b> (9. 57 % of dry matter). At 122 days of age, the lambs were slaughtered, and the ruminal contents were subjected to fatty acid analysis and sampled to quantify popula- tions of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which converts C 18 : 2 c 9 -c 12 (linoleic acid [LA]) to C 18 : 2 c 9 -t 11 (rumenic acid [RA]) and then RA to C 18 : 1 t 11 (vaccenic acid [VA]); we also sampled for Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, which converts VA to C 18 : 0 (stearic acid [SA]). Tannins increased (P < 0. 005) VA in the rumen compared to the tannin-free diet. The concentration of SA was not affected by tannins. The SA/VA ratio was lower (P < 0. 005) for the tannin-fed lambs than for the controls, suggesting that the last step of the BH process was inhibited by tannins. The B. proteoclasticus population was lower (30. 6 %; P < 0. 1), and B. fibrisolvens and protozoan populations were higher (107 % and 56. 1 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) in the rumen of lambs fed the tannin- supplemented diet than in controls.

40|$|The {{vegetable}} tannins are {{the oldest}} tanning agents used in leather industry. They give their natural character and colour to the leathers {{which they are}} applied to, but they have the disadvantage of colour change when {{they are exposed to}} light for prolonged times. In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured.

Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins.</b> From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties.

40|$|Agriculture in {{semi-arid}} and arid regions {{is constantly}} gaining {{importance for the}} security of the nutrition of humankind because of the rapid population growth. At the same time, especially these regions are more and more endangered by soil degradation, limited resources and extreme climatic conditions. One way to retain soil fertility under these conditions in the long run is to increase the soil organic matter. Thus, a two-year field experiment was conducted to test the efficiency of activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract as stabilizers of soil organic matter on a sandy soil low in nutrients in Northern Oman. Both activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract were either fed to goats and after defecation applied to the soil or directly applied to the soil in combination with dried goat manure. Regardless of the application method, both additives reduced decomposition of soil-applied organic matter and thus stabilized and increased soil organic carbon. The nutrient release from goat manure was altered by the application of activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract as well, however, nutrient release was not always slowed down. While activated charcoal fed to goats, was more effective in stabilising soil organic matter and in reducing nutrient release than mixing it, for <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract the opposite was the case. Moreover, the efficiency of the additives was influenced by the cultivated crop (sweet corn and radish), leading to unexplained interactions. The reduced nutrient release caused by the stabilization of the organic matter might be the reason for the reduced yields for sweet corn caused by the application of manure amended with activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract. Radish, on the other hand, was only inhibited by the presence of <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> extract but not by activated charcoal. This might be caused by a possible allelopathic effect of tannins on crops. To understand the mechanisms behind the changes in manure, in the soil, in the mineralisation and the plant development and to resolve detrimental effects, further research as recommended in this dissertation is necessary. Particularly in developing countries poor in resources and capital, feeding charcoal or tannins to animals and using their faeces as manure may be promising to increase soil fertility, sequester carbon and reduce nutrient losses, when yield reductions can be resolved.

40|$|Endoparasitic {{control is}} still heavily reliant {{on the use}} of {{anthelmintic}} drugs, however, frequent use and mis-use of anthelmintics is leading to the development of multiple resistance. In the tropics and subtropics where marginal levels of nutrition lead to greater susceptibility to infection, animal death due to nematode infection remains widely apparent. Here, anthelmintics are either unaffordable, of inferior quality or extensive multiple resistance has made these drugs ineffective. Consequently, alternative methods of parasitic control are required that are practical and realistic for introduction into farm production systems. One such possibility could be the exploitation of forage species capable of reducing parasitic infection solely, or in conjunction, with limited drug use. In tropical and subtropical regions many plants contain condensed tannins due to stress induced by environmental conditions. Sheep fed forages containing condensed tannins have been reported to have reduced gastrointestinal nematode infections. The aim of the studies reported in this thesis was to determine whether the inclusion of a model condensed tannin, <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin,</b> and/or the elevation of dietary protein could reduce the establishment and persistence of small intestinal nematode infections. Initial work using the Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-rat model demonstrated that the inclusion of 40 g quebracho tannin/kg in both high and low protein diets significantly (p 0. 2) reduce total daily faecal egg counts. Haematological and serological parameters did not show any significant (p> 0. 2) differences between dietary treatments. Subsequent investigations showed that dietary <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> was not reducing worm establishment and persistence by elevating the host immune response. Further studies suggested that <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> was acting through a direct toxic effect against the worm, where the mucosal inhabiting nematode, Trichinella spiralis, was unaffected by the presence of dietary <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> and in vitro data where N. brasiliensis survival was compromised by incubating worms in quebracho tannin-containing media. Concentrations as low as 0. 01 % (w/v) <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> proved effective at accelerating worm death. Thus, dietary <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> may be an alternative to increasing dietary protein concentration, which increases the hosts' capacity to mount an immune response and expel the worm burden from the small intestine. These data suggest that feeding condensed tannins may be a suitable alternative to anthelmintics, especially in the areas of the tropics and subtropics. However, the potential anthelmintic dietary properties of condensed tannins may be limited to parasites that are in direct contact with digesta and/or feed on intestinal contents, mucus and mucosal cells. Similarly, the diverse nature of condensed tannins may result with anthelmintic properties being restricted to a specific condensed tannin structure...|$|E

The pH, chemical composition, aerobic stability and in situ rumen degradation of DM, nitrogen (N) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) after 112 days of ensilage were measured. The average pH at silo opening was 4. 0, suggesting that the silages were well fermented. There were no significant effects of additive treatment on water-soluble carbohydrate, total N, soluble N, ammonia N and NDF. Lactic acid and acetic acid were the main fermentation products. High concentrations of acetic acid were found in all the treatments, indicating a heterofermentative pathway. Although FA treatment gave the most aerobically stable silage, the Control and QT-treated silages did not heat up by more than 1 ?C until after 6 days of exposure to air.

40|$|Tannins are a {{heterogeneous}} group of phenolic polymers that can induce detrimental effects when consumed by herbivores.

The main objective was to verify if <b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> ingestion could modify intestine morphology. Since gut lengthening is beneficial to increase the absorptive surface in intestine in free range birds, the inhibitory effect of tannin compounds on intestinal digestion could be compensated.

Data on feed consumption and body weight gain was collected twice a month till the end of the experimental trial, at the age of 176 days. Blood samples were collected twice (age 64 and 172 days) to verify plasma total protein level. At 70 and 174 days of age excreta samples were used to determine parasite load. At the end of the trial, 6 birds per treatment were sacrificed to collect data on slaughtering traits and length measurements of small intestine and caeca. Body weight of group receiving the highest <b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> level was significantly lower than the other two groups till 147 days of age. After one month of dietary treatment, plasma total protein level was similar among groups.

High-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene was used to analyze the impact of dietary supplementation with a blend of chestnut and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins</b> on the rumen microbiota of Holstein steers. Bacterial richness was lower in tannins treated animals, while the overall population structure of rumen microbiota was not significantly disturbed by tannins. The ratio of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a parameter associated with energy harvesting function, was increased in tannins supplemented animals, essentially due to the selective growth of Ruminococcaceae over members of genus Prevotella. Fibrolytic, amylolytic, and ureolytic bacterial communities in the rumen were altered by tannins, while methanogenic archaea were reduced. Furthermore, ruminal pH was significantly higher in animals supplemented with tannins than in the control group, while urease activity exhibited the opposite pattern. Further work is necessary to assess the relation between tannins impact on rumen microbiota and alteration of rumen fermentation parameters associated with bovine performance...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-eight male lambs {{were divided}} into two groups at age 45 d. Fourteen lambs were given fresh herbage (vetch); the {{remaining}} lambs were fed a concentrate-based diet. Within each treatment, seven lambs received a supplementation of <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins.</b> At slaughter (age 105 d) the ruminal content and the muscle longissimus dorsi (LD) were collected. Ruminal fluid and LD fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography. Among the concentrates-fed lambs, tannins supplementation reduced (P < 0. 05) the concentration of C 18 : 0 (- 49 %) and increased vaccenic acid (VA; + 69 %) in the ruminal fluid. When tannins were included into the concentrate, the LD contained double levels of rumenic acid (RA) as compared to the LD of the lambs fed the tannins-free concentrate (0. 96 vs. 0. 46 % of total extracted fatty acids, respectively; P < 0. 05). The concentration of PUFA was higher (P < 0. 05) and SFA (P < 0. 01) lower in the LD from lambs fed the tannin diets as compared to the animals receiving the tannin-free diets. In conclusion, tannins reduce the biohydrogenation of the PUFA in the rumen. This implies that tannins supplementation could be a strategy to increase the RA and PUFA content and to reduce the SFA into ruminant meats...|$|R

40|$|<b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> wood {{adhesive}} in a nonformaldehyde {{approach has}} a low hardening rate and needs more pressing time than formaldehyde-based wood adhesives during wood composites production. In this study, boric acid (BA) was used to increase autocondensation rate of tannin to make poplar plywood. The main ingredients of the adhesives included <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannin,</b> NaOH, hexamine, BA and polymeric isocyanate (PMDI). Thermomechanical analysis of without BA adhesives showed that maximum modulus of elasticity increased with increasing the initial tannin concentration from 40 % to 50 % (w/w), whereas no significant effect has been found by adding PMDI. Moreover, the addition of BA lowered time and temperature of hardening and increased modulus of elasticity of the adhesive. Also, tensile shear strength increased significantly with increasing the tannin concentration and the BA content (from 2 % to 4 %). Interestingly, applied BA in the glueline not only improved bonding quality of the panels but also provided good preservative performance against fungal attack even after mild leaching test.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} paid to the use of natural adhesives as a binder in the wood-based panel industry. Nowadays, two German companies are using <b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> and Wattle tannin for the production of particleboards and medium density fiberboards (MDF), respectively. To date no serious attention has been given to bond fiberboards using tannin derived from spruce bark. Results of research work on the use of spruce tannin as a binder for medium density fiberboards carried out in the last two years are presented. The results reveal that spruce tannin can be used to partially substitue <b>Quebracho</b> <b>tannin</b> in MDF up to about 60 %. Such boards still meet the specification of moisture resistant MDF (according to EN 319 und EN 321). Moreover, spruce tannin can be used to 100 % as a binder for the production of MDF for indoor use (type MDF EN 622 - 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Ruminants derived {{products}} have {{a prominent role}} in diets and economy worldwide; therefore, the capability to control the rumen microbial ecosystem, for ameliorating their quality, is of fundamental importance in the livestock sector. e aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the e ect of dietary supplementation with chestnut and <b>quebracho</b> <b>tannins</b> on microbial community and fatty acid pro le, in the rumen uid of dairy ewes. Multivariate analysis of PCR-DGGE pro les of rumen microbial communities showed a correlation among the presence of chestnut or quebracho in the diet, the speci c Butyrivibrio group DGGE pro les, the increase in 18 : 3 cis 9, cis 12, and cis 15; 18 : 2 cis 9 and cis 12; 18 : 2 cis 9 and trans 11; 18 : 2 trans 11 and cis 15; and 18 : 1 trans 11 content, and the decrease in 18 : 0 concentration. Phylogenetic analysis of DGGE band sequences revealed the presence of bacteria representatives related to the genera Hungatella, Ruminococcus, and Eubacterium and unclassi ed Lachnospiraceae family members, suggesting that these taxa could be a ected by tannins presence in the diets. e results of this study showed that tannins from chestnut and quebracho can reduce the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids through changes in rumen microbial communities...|$|R
30|$|<b>Quebracho</b> {{colorado}} <b>tannin</b> extract {{was used}} as a coagulant raw material for water and wastewater treatment. The chemical synthesis follows a Mannich reaction mechanism and provides a fully working coagulant that can remove several pollutants from water. This paper addresses the optimization of such synthesis and confirms the feasibility of the coagulant by testing it in a preliminary screening for the elimination of dyes and detergents. The optimum combination of reagents was 6.81 g of diethanolamine (DEA) and 2.78  g of formaldehyde (F) per g of tannin extract. So obtained coagulant was succesfully tested on the removal of 9 dyes and 8 detergents.|$|R
