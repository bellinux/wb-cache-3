40|$|Qualitative {{research}} is very useful in undergraduate biology education. As {{we are dealing}} with adult students, we can constructively use their input on how to make improvements to course instructional systems. In a freshman biology course, we implemented a Calibrated Peer Review system to introduce students to the experimental, ethical and <b>quantitative</b> aspects of <b>biology.</b> Students were involved in writing assignments, followed by grading peer work based on criteria, pre-determined by the instructors. At the end of the course, students were interviewed in focus groups to take their feedback on aspects of CPR like benefits, improvements, challenges, relevance to their educational goals and their learning about ethical and <b>quantitative</b> aspects of <b>biology.</b> Upon data analysis, the need for improvements in the qualitative focus group methodology became apparent. To encourage use of qualitative research to improve undergraduate biology education this project shows the need to consider concise, unbiased and probing questions, and trained interviewers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{significant improvements}} of Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) {{which is a}} bivariate statistical representation of texture, based on the co-occurrences of size/intensity of each flat zone (connected pixels of the same gray level). The first improvement is a multi-scale extension of the matrix which merges various quantizations of gray levels. A second alternative is proposed {{to take into account}} radial distribution of zone intensities. The third variant is a generalization of the matrix structure which allows to analyze fibrous textures, by changing the pair intensity/size for the pair length/orientation of each region. The interest of these improved descriptors is illustrated by texture classification problems arising from <b>quantitative</b> cell <b>biology...</b>|$|R
