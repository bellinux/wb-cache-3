This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> consciousness states.|$|E
5|$|The BDI was {{originally}} developed {{to provide a}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the intensity of depression.

The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa.|$|E

25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb apraxia through the qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, {{the reliability and}} validity of TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger on top of your nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Considering phylogenetic methods, several {{approaches}} to validating individual HGT inferences and benchmarking {{methods have been}} adopted, typically relying on various forms of simulation. Because the truth is known in simulation, the number of false positives {{and the number of}} false negatives are straightforward to compute. However, simulating data do not trivially resolve the problem because the true extent of HGT in nature remains largely unknown, and specifying rates of HGT in the simulated model is always hasardous. Nonetheless, studies involving the comparison of several phylogenetic methods in a simulation framework could provide <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> their respective performances, and thus help the biologist in choosing objectively proper tools.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} placebos is a {{standard}} control component of most clinical trials, which attempt to {{make some sort of}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a placebo-controlled study, and its control is of the negative type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather than no treatment, is called a positive-control study, because its control is of the positive type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients respond to them, but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting more patients, by affecting responders more strongly, or both).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{distribution}} of organic forms is clumpy at any scale from populations {{to the highest}} taxonomic categ-ories, and whether considered within clades or within eco-systems. The fossil record provides little support for expectations that the morphological gaps between species or groups of species have increased through time as it might if the gaps were created by extinction of a more homogen-eous {{distribution of}} morphologies. As the <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> morphology have replaced counts of higher taxa as a metric of morphological disparity, numerous stud-ies have demonstrated the rapid construction of morpho-space early in evolutionary radiations, and have emphasized the difference between taxonomic measures of morphologi-cal diversity and <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> disparity.

2500|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{discussion in the}} scientific literature on what policies might be effective in responding to climate change. Some scientific bodies have recommended specific policies to governments (refer to the later sections of the article). The natural and social sciences {{can play a role}} in informing an effective response to climate change. However, policy decisions may require value judgements. For example, the US National Research Council has commented:The question of whether there exists a [...] "safe" [...] level of concentration of greenhouse gases cannot be answered directly because it would require a value judgment of what constitutes an acceptable risk to human welfare and ecosystems {{in various parts of the}} world, as well as a more <b>quantitative</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the risks and costs associated with the various impacts of global warming. In general, however, risk increases with increases in both the rate and the magnitude of climate change.|$|E

Material: we used systemic-structural analysis; functioning of military higher educational establishment faculty was simulated; quantitative values of faculty functioning integral rating, connected with organization and conducting of sport measures, were obtained. Results: on the base of hierarchic model of faculty functioning we offered model of faculty rating.
