Items in stock are assumed to belong to one of a finite number of <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> that are ordered {{in such a way that}} Class 1 contains the best quality and the last class contains the pre-perishable quality. By the end of each epoch, items in each inventory class either stay in the same <b>class</b> or lose <b>quality</b> and move to a lower class. The movement between classes is not observed. Samples are drawn from the inventory and based on the observations of these samples, optimal estimates for the number of items in each <b>quality</b> <b>classes</b> are derived...|$|R
