50|$|The {{pressure}} release valve is often one {{of a variety of}} commercially available types such as a plumbing ball valve, an irrigation sprinkler valve or a <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve. Experienced builders often make their own valves for this purpose to gain greater flow and faster actuation. The most common custom design used is the piston valve. Multiple valves arranged to be triggered together are occasionally used as an alternative to a single larger valve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>Exhaust</b> Valve (QEV): a {{commercial}} piston or diaphragm valve {{in a metal}} body intended for the quick venting of pneumatic cylinders. In spudgunning they are ideal barrel sealing valves with faster opening times than custom piston valves and high flow rates. They can be commonly found in sizes from ⅛ inch to 1½ inches (3-40 mm) and sometimes even larger models. It provides an easy option for inexperienced spud-gun builders but the cost is usually greater than for any other valve type.|$|E
50|$|A {{piston valve}} can also {{refer to a}} 2-way 2-position, {{pilot-operated}} spool valve. The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back {{by the force of}} the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> valves.|$|E
50|$|In 1908 The Manchester Guardian {{reviewed}} Der Weg zur Holle ("The Road to Hell"), his farce {{over three}} acts, then {{playing at the}} Midland Theatre. While chiding the lack of originality, the reviewer praised the pace - neither too <b>quick</b> to <b>exhaust</b> nor too slow to see the chinks.|$|R
5000|$|The Maserati GranSport is a {{modified}} version of the Coupé and Spyder that was first unveiled at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show. [...] It is equipped with aerodynamic body cladding, a chrome mesh grille, carbon fiber interior trim, and special 19 in wheels. It uses the Skyhook active suspension, with a 0.4 inch (10 mm) lower ride height, and the Cambiocorsa transmission is recalibrated for <b>quicker</b> shifts. The <b>exhaust</b> is also specially tuned to [...] "growl" [...] on start-up and full throttle.|$|R
5000|$|The house lizards {{belong to}} a {{peculiar}} family, the Geckos, and are found even in the best-kept chambers, most frequently {{on the walls and}} ceilings, to which they cling motionless by day, being active only at night. They are of speckled grey or ashy colours. The structure of their feet is beautifully adapted for clinging to and running over smooth surfaces; the underside of their toes being expanded into cushions, beneath which folds of skin form a series of flexible plates. By means of this apparatus they can walk or run across a smooth ceiling with their backs downwards the plated soles, by <b>quick</b> muscular action, <b>exhausting</b> and admitting air alternately. The Geckos are very repulsive in appearance. Bates, chapter 1.|$|R
50|$|When the Ion is fired, the air {{in front}} of the bolt that holds it back is drained back through the solenoid, which causes {{the air in}} the rear of the firing chamber to blow the bolt forward. In order to {{expedite}} the draining of air from the front of the bolt, many users add a <b>quick</b> <b>exhaust</b> valve (QEV) to their marker. The QEV replaces a fitting on the Ion's body and allows the draining air to vent into the body cavity instead of passing all the way back through the solenoid. By allowing the air to vent faster, this allows the bolt to close faster and with more force, which permits lower operating pressure and dwell (the time the solenoid valve is open). The QEV also acts as a trap for excess grease that might otherwise enter the solenoid and cause problems.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a <b>Quick</b> <b>Exhaust</b> Valve, or QEV and hose barb. The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} Cu- 8 (at. %) Cr- 4 %Nb alloy {{developed at}} NASA's Glenn Research Center, and designated as GRCop- 84, {{is currently being}} considered for use as liners in combustor chambers and nozzle ramps in NASA s future generations of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). However, past experience has shown that unprotected copper alloys undergo an environmental attack called "blanching" in rocket engines using liquid hydrogen as fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Potential for sulfidation attack of the liners in hydrocarbon-fueled engines is also of concern. As a result, protective overlay coatings alloys are being developed for GRCop- 84. The oxidation behavior of several new coating alloys has been evaluated. GRCop- 84 specimens were coated with several copper and nickel-based coatings, where the coatings were deposited by either vacuum plasma spraying or cold spraying techniques. Coated and uncoated specimens were thermally cycled in a furnace at different temperatures in order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} coatings. Additional studies were conducted in a high pressure burner rig using a hydrocarbon fuel and subjected to a high heat flux hydrogen-oxygen combustion flame in NASA s <b>Quick</b> Access Rocket <b>Exhaust</b> (QARE) rig. The performance of these coatings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} effect of a heated plume within vented enclosures. The characteristics of a heated plume within enclosures are studied using controlled and systematic experiments, simulating the movement of heated air due to the development of fire within a room. A short enclosure (Case CS 1) and a tall enclosure (Case CS 2) were subjected to two heating configurations representing natural and forced convection heat transfer. The cross-sectional dimension of the enclosures, and the heating power were maintained the same for both cases in order to compare the plume effects due to the change of height. For each case, different combinations of top ventilation were also considered for the present experiments. The air temperature and pressure within the enclosure were measured with suitable thermocouples and pressure probes, specially fabricated and mounted on racks that were positioned at three locations: (i) at 100 mm above the base of the enclosure; (ii) middle of the enclosure; and (iii) at 100 mm below the ceiling of the enclosure. The ceiling temperature profile was also obtained to determine the ceiling jet impingement. The experimental results show that for both case studies – CS 1 and CS 2, for the same heat transfer mechanism (natural or forced convection), the hot air temperature within the enclosure is decreased due to {{an increase in the number}} and size of vents. Hot air is <b>exhausted</b> <b>quicker</b> into the ambient and the exchange rate of hot air inside the enclosure and cool air from the ambient is increased. It was found that natural convection mechanism led to a higher ceiling and air temperature distribution than forced convection. The short enclosure had a higher ceiling temperature compared to the tall enclosure. Correlations for ceiling temperature distribution for short and tall enclosures are also provided. The study has resulted in obtaining valuable conclusions for the effect of a heated plume within a vented enclosure...|$|R
