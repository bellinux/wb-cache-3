Assimilative capacity specifically refers to the capacity for a water body to absorb constituents without exceeding a specific concentration, such as a water <b>quality</b> <b>objective.</b> Water quality objectives are set and periodically revised by regulatory agencies, such as the EPA, to define the limits of water quality for different uses, which include human health, but also other ecologically important functions, wildlife habitat, irrigated agriculture, etc. For example, if the irrigation water <b>quality</b> <b>objective</b> for salt is 450 mg/L of total dissolved solids, the assimilative capacity of a water body would be the amount of salt that could {{be added to the}} water such that it's concentration would not exceed 450 mg/L.|$|E

To ensure effective and efficient measuring of <b>quality</b> <b>objectives</b> the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.|$|R

5000|$|Conversion of belite to alite {{requires}} partial melting, {{the resulting}} liquid being the solvent {{in which the}} reaction takes place. The amount of liquid, and hence {{the speed of the}} finishing reaction, is related to temperature. To meet the clinker <b>quality</b> <b>objective,</b> the most obvious control is that the clinker should reach a peak temperature such that the finishing reaction takes place to the required degree. A further reason to maintain constant liquid formation in the hot end of the kiln is that the sintering material forms a dam that prevents the cooler upstream feed from flooding out of the kiln. The feed in the calcining zone, because it is a powder evolving carbon dioxide, is extremely fluid. Cooling of the burning zone, and loss of unburned material into the cooler, is called [...] "flushing", and in addition to causing lost production can cause massive damage.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, {{a review}} of the NAAQOs {{suggested}} that many air pollutants had no effect thresholds (e.g. tropospheric ozone or very low effect thresholds). As such, scientifically defensible effect levels could not be identified. In 2000, the revised NAAQOs framework specifies a Reference Level, above which there are demonstrated effects on human health and/or the environment, and an Air <b>Quality</b> <b>Objective</b> (AQO), which is meant to be protective for the general public and environment and which also considers aspects of technical feasibility. This approach is different from how the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are set in the US, where cost is explicitly not considered in the proposal to strengthen the air quality standards to protect human health and the environment. In addition, the US NAAQS are periodically reviewed, frequently strengthened, commonly enforced and allow serious legal penalties if the standards are not met. In contrast, the Canadian NAAQOs are infrequently reviewed, rarely strengthened, not enforced, and the only penalty for not meeting the Canadian NAAQOs is shame.|$|E
50|$|Light from an {{origin point}} O is {{collimated}} (made parallel) {{by a high}} <b>quality</b> <b>objective</b> lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians.Light from an illuminated target graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the Autocollimator and passes through the beam splitter, forming {{an image of the}} target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece.The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the Autocollimator and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the Autocollimator. This will result in a restricted measuring range.|$|E
