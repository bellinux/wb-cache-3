40|$|This {{is one of}} my {{original}} works in physics specially to present periodic table of physical elements which is invented with help of rule of STC, rule of STV and SI units. All of physical realities designated by physical units possess an common nature of space time structure that can be exclusively described by space time configuration(STC) and space time value (STV). Any physical reality bearing such kind of common nature is called as physical element, such as, space element, time element, mass element, energy element, momentum element, angular moment element, electric <b>quantity</b> <b>element,</b> magnetic moment element, temperature element, mol element and so on. By rule of STC and rule of STV, all of physical elements known and unknown have been counted statistically and summarized in form of tables entitled Periodic Table of Physical Elements, abbreviated PTPE. PTPE is consists of 13 tables, among which the 13 th table is irregular coefficient ones, while other 12 tables are regular coefficient ones. For regular coefficient tables, each of them contains 36 physical elements, and each of 36 physical elements exhibits by its space time configuration, space time value, name of physical unit, its sign in SI units and serial No. in PTPE.

Readily available drill preparation manuals are therefore essential, alongside assessment methods to ensure quality. Here, we propose email text analysis as a manual assessment method, and investigate its validity. Methods: The preparation status of two similar large-scale disaster medical response drills were compared. All email texts exchanged during the preparation stage were analyzed, and frequently appearing words (quality element) and word counts (<b>quantity</b> <b>element)</b> were compared between Drill 1, which was organized without a manual, and Drill 2, organized with a manual. Results: Word frequency analysis revealed that the key components of the manual (visualization of necessary work, preparation of documents in a certain format, and clarification of aims of the drill) contributed {{to the effectiveness of}} the preparation process for Drill 2. Furthermore, work volume during the preparation for Drill 2 was decreased by 41. 9 % from that during the preparation for Drill 1. Conclusion: Preparation of a high-quality manual is crucial so that emergency physicians can plan and execute a disaster medical response drill. Email text analysis can serve as an objective method assessing the quality of manuals. Keywords: disaster medicine, textual analysis, database, quality assessment ...|$|E

These are the minerals that occur as trace impurities in the caliche, found in Chile, whose main product is sodium nitrate. In total, they can contain at least 0.02% and at most 1% iodine by weight. Sodium iodate is extracted from the caliche and reduced to iodide by sodium bisulfite. This solution is then reacted with freshly extracted iodate, resulting in comproportionation to iodine, which may be filtered off.|$|R

Raw natural eggs {{present a}} {{fundamental}} quality of living, organic molecules {{and a wonderful}} left-handed bioradiative structure, being a natural product that does not involve killing the manufacturer.

From the 22 elements analyzed, 15 not have been detected in yolk and egg white, and 13 in egg shell; among these were the main heavy metals, suggesting the absence of heavy metal contamination of these types of food in the study area. In general, in all egg components analyzed essential <b>quantity</b> <b>elements</b> – sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations were increased compared to the other mineral elements determined, the highest average levels were recorded in yolk, as also the maximum levels of essential microelements detected – iron and zinc.
