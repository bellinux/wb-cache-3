I II Abstract In the last few years we have {{assisted}} to an enormous progress in the communication networks, characterized by an ever growing bandwidth availability, coupled with an increasing attention to <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>requirements</b> by end users. In particular, the transition of the Internet from a research network to a commercial network has pushed the research world to exploit the huge bandwidth offered by the new optical technologies, while at the same time trying to fulfill the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>of</b> the emerging applications. The introduction <b>of</b> multimedia <b>services,</b> and the outbreak of electronic commerce have finally declared the success of the Internet as an integrated network. The dissemination of the optical technology as an inexpensive, high capacity transmission infrastructure, but with limited information processing capabilities, has carried to its technological limit the development of electronic switching systems, where new scheduling algorithms must guarantee high performance with limited complexity. At the same time, the optimization of the transmission resources becomes of fundamental importance, given the competitive market and the cost to install new equipments...|$|R

With the huge development of computers, stored program control of network nodes and computer communication, the traditional teletraffic science field naturally extended to computer networks, mobile and wireless/optical networks, and for a wide spectrum of new applications. The convergence between the voice network, the Internet, the television and mobility raiseed new questions that request new models and tools to be developed. In addition, the development of community networks, home networking, multiple access networking technologies, and the advent of pervasive and ambient communications dictates new challenges to be addressed.Today, ITC addresses the emerging paradigms such as an increasing diversity of distributed applications and services over various media like mobile/optical networks, enabling new markets and economy.|$|E
