5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives <b>quietly,</b> <b>on</b> good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E

25|$|The Boy Who Followed Ripley is a 1980 {{psychological}} thriller by Patricia Highsmith, {{the fourth}} in her series about career criminal Tom Ripley.

His idyll is shaken when he meets a teenaged boy who is hiding from the police.|$|E
25|$|He {{was twice}} briefly {{returned}} {{to power in}} 1185 and 1189, but even within his home kingdom of Connacht he had become politically marginalized. He lived <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> his estates, and died at the monastery of Cong in 1198 and was buried at Clonmacnoise. With {{the possible exception of}} Brian Ua Néill (Brian O'Neill; died 1260), no other Gaelic king was ever again recognised as king or high king of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The Kemp-Welch {{twins were}} educated at Charterhouse School, and George {{went on to}} Cambridge University, where he won Blues for both cricket and {{association}} football, being captain in both sports. He came down from Cambridge in 1931. A brief announcement in The Times on 24 February 1934 indicated that a wedding would take place between Kemp-Welch and a Mrs Diana Lucy Munro (Baldwin); a further announcement on 26 February indicated that the deed had been done <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> 24 February at Kensington Registry Office. The cause for discretion was that the bride {{was not only the}} daughter of {{one of the leaders of}} the National Government, Stanley Baldwin, but also that the bride, some twelve years Kemp-Welch's senior, had divorced her previous husband Richard Gordon Munro.|$|E
25|$|The Curia Urbis or the Vicariate of the City of Rome {{was divided}} into four {{departments}} (officia), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (officium) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the diocese. The second department watches over the behaviour of the clergy and the Christian people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department {{is devoted to the}} economic administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the cardinal who is the vicar-general of the pope in Rome. His office and the extent of his power are always the same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he is called, for the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the same way it is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise what is done on account of the conclave or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes <b>quietly</b> <b>on.</b> Formerly {{this was not the case}} to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 December 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi.|$|E
500|$|In the pandemonium that followed, Bellingham sat <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> a bench as Perceval {{was carried}} into the Speaker's quarters. In the lobby, {{such was the}} {{confusion}} that, according to a witness, had Bellingham [...] "walked quietly out into the street, he would have escaped, and the committer of the murder {{would never have been}} known". As it was, an official who had seen the shooting identified Bellingham, who was seized, disarmed, manhandled and searched. He remained calm, submitting to his captors without a struggle. When asked to explain his actions, he replied that he was rectifying a denial of justice {{on the part of the}} government.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{its large}} number (17) of {{generally}} short components, Part II {{is the most}} diffuse of the three parts, texturally and harmonically. The narrative is driven largely [...] by alternating choruses and comments from the Narrator, with two brief operatic scenas in which the four soloists participate. Kemp finds {{in one of the}} choruses an allusion to [...] "Sei gegrüsset" [...] from Bach's St John Passion, and hears traces of Elgar in the soprano's solo [...] "O my son!" [...] which begins the first scena. The narrative climax is reached with the [...] "Spiritual of Anger": [...] "Go Down, Moses", which Tippett arranges {{in the form of a}} chorale. This is followed by three short meditations from tenor, soprano and alto soloists, before a possible redemption is glimpsed in the spiritual which ends the Part, [...] "O by and by", with a soprano descant which Steinberg describes as [...] "ecstatic". Part III consists of only five numbers, each rather more extensive than most of those in the earlier sections of the oratorio. The Part has, on the whole, a greater unity than its predecessors. The musical and emotional climax to the whole work is the penultimate ensemble: [...] "I Would Know my Shadow and my Light". Kemp writes: [...] "The whole work has been leading to this moment ... the ensemble flows into a rapturous wordless benediction [...] a modulation leads into 'Deep River'". In this final spiritual, for the first time the full vocal and instrumental resources are deployed. The oratorio ends <b>quietly,</b> <b>on</b> an extended pianissimo [...] "Lord".|$|E
500|$|... "You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves. The number was cut from the musical before the official Broadway opening and wasn't performed again until the movie version was under consideration, 3 years later. [...] The producers resurrected the song as a solo for Michael Jackson to replace [...] "I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday", which had been Scarecrow's solo in the Broadway musical. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] and its corresponding scene in the movie allude to mistreatment of African Americans. Jackson stated in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that the lyrics to [...] "You Can't Win" [...] are about humiliation and helplessness, feelings, he stated, that many people have experienced {{at one point in}} their life. The singer added that the song was also about [...] "the feeling that {{there are people out there}} who don't actively hold you back as much as they work <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> your insecurities so that you hold yourself back". [...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same." [...] William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made [...] "You Can't Win" [...] a [...] "black message song". Musically, the track has been described as an R, pop and soul song by Renée Graham of The Boston Globe. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80beats per minute. It adds that the song is composed in E with a range from B3 to C5.|$|E

2500|$|The writer Colette, who was 67 {{when the}} war began, worked <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> her mémoires in her {{apartment}} at 9 rue du Beaujolais, next the gardens of the Palais-Royal.

In 1944, she published one of her most famous works, Gigi.|$|E

Here [...] was surprised... remarked that no one stood <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> the corners, no door was shut an instant, no man was quiet. [...] stopped self, [...] looked respectfully on this people, and [...] said goodbye forever to that lazy life and poetical inutility of our European countries".|$|E

[...] Massow has had his portrait painted nearly 30 times, including a double nude diptych by Jonathan Yeo, son of Conservative MP Tim Yeo, and a portrait by Darren Coffield of Massow in full foxhunting attire, which was exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery. Massow has personally provided regular financial support for some artists, {{to assist them in}} their lives and work.|$|E
2500|$|Girty had his Indian scouts {{out along}} both {{banks of the}} river, and {{the news of the}} landing was {{immediately}} communicated to his now larger force of 648 warriors. [...] Some of these men took up positions <b>quietly</b> <b>on</b> a bluff overlooking the sand bar where the Pennsylvania Rangers were located. [...] Others approached stealthily from the opposite bank of the river. Once in position, they took the militia by surprise with a sudden volley of shots. The soldiers seized their arms and fought for their lives as long as they had ammunition. They then tried to escape in their boats but the Indians pursued and closed in on them before they could get away. [...] Unable to escape or defend themselves, Col. Lochry surrendered. [...] Every member of the expedition not already killed, was captured.|$|E
