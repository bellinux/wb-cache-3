Earlier Kahn systems utilized various methods to reduce the second-order term through the insertion of a predistortion component. [...] One example of this method was also used to generate one of the Kahn independent-sideband (ISB) AM stereo signals. [...] It was known as the STR-77 exciter method, having been introduced in 1977. [...] Later, the system was further improved by use of an arcsine-based modulator that included a 1-0.52E term in the denominator of the arcsin generator equation.

[...] A multi-loop modulator/demodulator feedback approach was used to generate an accurate arcsin signal. [...] This approach was introduced in 1984 and became known as the STR-84 method. [...] It was sold by Kahn Research Laboratories; later, Kahn Communications, Inc. of NY. [...] An additional audio processing device further improved the sideband structure by selectively applying pre-emphasis to the modulating signals.

[...] In a practical receiver, some distortion may be present, usually at a low level (in AM broadcast, always below 5%), due to sharp filtering and nonlinear group delay in the IF filters of the receiver, which act to truncate the compatibility sideband – those terms that are not the result of a linear process of simply envelope modulating the signal as would be the case in full-carrier DSB-AM – and rotation of phase of these compatibility terms such that they no longer cancel the <b>quadrature</b> <b>distortion</b> term caused by a first-order SSB term along with the carrier.

40|$|Certain deghosters {{suffer from}} the {{presence}} of distortion caused by the quadrature forming nature of the IF VSB filter operating on a ghosted IF signal. By analysing this a priori effect, a specific deghoster solution is found by using the phase quadrature detected IF signal to cancel the VSB induced ghost <b>quadrature</b> <b>distortions</b> from the detected inphase signal before deghosting takes place...|$|R

MER includes all imperfections including deterministic amplitude imbalance, <b>quadrature</b> error and <b>distortion,</b> while noise is random by nature.|$|R
50|$|After graduation, Henson went to {{work for}} Burr-Brown Research, now merged into Texas Instruments, in Tucson, Arizona. While there, he worked on {{extremely}} low <b>distortion</b> <b>quadrature</b> oscillators and non-linear function modules (multipliers, vector adders and root-mean-square). His first patent was a design for a 4-quadrant log-antilog multiplier. He claims to have been fired (not from Burr-Brown) in 1972 for refusing to certify an electronic module for a nuclear power plant that failed to meet a required MTBF specification. Henson then set up his own company, Analog Precision Inc., producing specialized computer interface equipment and related industrial control devices.|$|R
