40|$|Motivation: Mathematical {{models of}} {{biological}} systems {{often have a}} large number of parameters whose combinational variations can yield distinct <b>qualitative</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Since it is intractable to examine all possible combinations of parameters for nontrivial biological pathways, it is required to have a systematic strategy to explore the parameter space in a computational way so that dynamic behaviors of a given pathway are estimated. Results: We present PSExplorer, a computational tool for exploring <b>qualitative</b> <b>behaviors</b> and key parameters of molecular signaling pathways. Utilizing the Latin hypercube sampling and a clustering technique in a recursive paradigm, the software enables users to explore the whole parameter space of the models to search for ro-bust <b>qualitative</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The parameter space is partitioned into sub-regions according to behavioral differences. Sub-regions show-ing robust behaviors can be identified for further analyses. The parti-tioning result presents a tree structure from which individual and combinational effects of parameters on model behaviors can be assessed and key factors of the models are readily identified.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>behaviors</b> of scalar-tensor cosmologies with an {{arbitrary}} monotonic ω(Φ) function. In particular, {{we are interested}} on scalar-tensor theories distinguishable at early epochs from General Relativity (GR) but leading to predictions compatible with solar-system experiments. After extending the method developed by Lorentz-Petzold and Barrow, we establish the conditions required for convergence towards GR at t→∞. Then, we obtain all the asymptotic analytical solutions at early times which are possible {{in the framework of}} these theories. The subsequent qualitative evolution, from these asymptotic solutions until their later convergence towards GR, has been then analyzed by means of numerical computations. From this analysis, {{we have been able to}} establish a classification of the different <b>qualitative</b> <b>behaviors</b> of scalar-tensor cosmological models with an arbitrary monotonic ω(Φ) function.
