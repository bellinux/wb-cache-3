Above all {{a significant portion}} of the arable land is degraded. Deforestation is a serious problem in Tach Gayint, and it has been increasing rapidly. Once all of the trees had been cut for firewood, locals then turned to extracting the roots, which has critically damaged the soil in this woreda.

Bountys complement now comprised nine mutineers—Christian, Young, <b>Quintal,</b> Brown, Martin, John Williams, William McCoy, John Mills, and John Adams (known by the crew as [...] "Alexander Smith")—and 20 Polynesians, of whom 14 were women.|$|E

At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets), and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh [...] "called as loudly as [...] could in hopes of assistance".

50|$|Before the Ethiopian Revolution, pulses and {{oilseeds}} {{played an}} important role, second only to coffee, in the country's exports. In EFY 1974/75, pulses and oilseeds accounted for 34% of export earnings (about 163 million Birr), but this share declined to about 3% (about 30 million Birr) in EFY 1988/89. Three factors contributed to {{the decline in the}} relative importance of pulses and oilseeds. First, the recurring droughts had devastated the country's main areas where pulses and oilseeds were grown. Second, because peasants faced food shortages, they gave priority to cereal staples to sustain themselves. Finally, although the production cost of pulses and oilseeds continued to rise, the government's price control policy left virtually unchanged the official procurement price of these crops, thus substantially reducing net income from them. In EFY 2007/2008, the CSA reported that 17,827,387.94 <b>quintals</b> of pulses were produced on 1,517,661.93 hectares, an increase from the 15,786,215.3 <b>quintals</b> produced on 1,379,045.77 hectares.
