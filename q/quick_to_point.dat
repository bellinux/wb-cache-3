5|$|Humphrey {{moved to}} his new home with an elderly couple in {{suburban}} London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced {{until the next day}} {{to reduce the risk of}} kidnap attempts. The Conservatives were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power.|$|E
5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was {{under the control of the}} Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E

25|$|This {{novel is}} based on the idea of {{traveling}} to another time period. However, it is not about basic time travel. The author is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist {{at the same time as}} ours, each existing in another time and place.|$|E
25|$|It {{also seems}} {{that people who}} are more {{creative}} {{are also more likely to}} show a similar pattern of brain activation. Some researchers have been <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness, as it is still not clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.|$|E
25|$|Google {{introduced}} in-app subscriptions to Google Play in May 2012. In June 2016, Google {{announced that}} subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, {{a change from}} the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.|$|E
5000|$|The M100 Elan's {{cornering}} {{performance was}} undeniable (on release the Elan {{was described by}} Autocar magazine as [...] "the <b>quickest</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> car available"). Press reaction was not uniformly positive, as some reviewers found the handling too secure and predictable compared to a rear-wheel-drive car. However, the Elan's rigid chassis minimised roll through the corners and has led to its description as 'the finest front wheel drive car bar none'. Unlike the naturally aspirated version, the turbocharged SE received power steering as standard, as well as tyres with a higher ZR speed rating.|$|R

25|$|Engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, , Gustave-Adolphe Hirn and Marc Seguin {{recognized}} that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and {{made use of}} Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. Academics such as John Playfair were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries {{the fate of the}} lost energy was still unknown.|$|E
25|$|Davis won the World Billiards Championships in June 1980, beating Rex Williams 5978-4452, and in {{so doing}} became the only player except for Joe Davis to have lifted both the World Snooker and World Billiards titles. However, he was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that {{standards}} differed markedly from those of the 1930s when the top players made such large breaks that they killed the game as popular entertainment. He would receive £1500 plus a cheque for £500 for the highest break (583); this was presented to him by 94-year-old Willie Smith, World Billiards champion in 1920 and 1923. Davis also retained the title later in November the same year, when the championship was restored to a knock-out basis {{for the first time since}} 1934. Davis beat Paddy Morgan 1907-978, John Barrie 1253-1153 and Mark Wildman 3037-2064 in the final to pocket £4000, then a record for a billiards event.|$|E
25|$|In early August, the {{seemingly}} inevitable came to pass, and Stapleton {{confirmed that the}} sponsor search had proven fruitless and the team would not continue in 2012. From the time the team first assumed the Highroad moniker in 2007 to the time its disbanding was announced, they had accumulated 484 victories among the men's and women's teams, including 54 Grand Tour stages. By the end of 2011, that number increased to 513 wins. The cycling world reacted with shock and sadness to {{the announcement of the}} team's demise. Cavendish was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> that HTC Corporation's sponsorship had kept the team from folding two years prior, but most reactions were based on disbelief that a team which won so frequently could fail to find a sponsor. Lewis was described as taking the announcement particularly hard, as he was still injured from his Giro d'Italia crash and unable to race at the time. All team riders eventually found new contracts.|$|E
5000|$|Broken Record {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. In the United Kingdom, Mary Palmer from MovieScramble said [...] "This {{really is an}} enjoyable short. It is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> the <b>point</b> and I genuinely laughed out loud at the ridiculousness {{of some of the}} scenes." [...] Internationally, the film received high praise with Mark Bell of Film Threat in the United States saying [...] "It’s a pretty straightforward tale, the film looks great, and sounds pretty good overall. Broken Record is an amusing short about what happens when big dreams and grand plans don’t match up with what life has planned for you".|$|R
25|$|The Pledge was {{supposed}} <b>to</b> be <b>quick</b> and <b>to</b> the <b>point.</b> Bellamy designed {{it to be}} recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words equality and fraternity but decided against it, knowing that the state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.|$|R

25|$|Sakura Wars 4 {{was first}} {{announced}} in June 2001; when announced, Hiroi was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{out that while}} {{it was the last}} series entry for the Dreamcast, it was not the final entry in the Sakura Wars series. A preview disc was released with Sakura Wars Online, featuring promotional images and trailers released up to that point. Running up to the game's release, Sakura Wars 3 and the Dreamcast ports of the first two Sakura Wars games were reissued at reduced prices by Sega. The game was released on March 21, 2002. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). It was released for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP on March 3, 2005. This version required multiple CD-ROMs due to the game's size. A DVD-ROM version for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007. Wider localization efforts for the series were prevented due to Sega's uncertainly as to whether the game's blend of genres would find a profitable audience outside Japan.|$|E
500|$|The Genesis {{version of}} Mortal Kombat was well {{received}} by gaming press, {{as well as}} fans, outselling the SNES version three- or four-to-one, while Nintendo was criticized for censoring the SNES version of the game.

500|$|Despite the {{similarities}} between Somari and the original game, reviewers were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out the many differences between them. Commentators on the Russian TV program Dendy: The New Reality stated that [...] "Somari for Dendy {{is not the same}} as Sonic for SEGA. ... Everything's different." [...] Contemporary criticism of the game emphasized its difficulty relative to the original Sonic title, and the game was characterized as having complex controls (although reviews claimed that these could be mastered in time).|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel magazine #93, Emma Caulfield stated that she was okay with her character's abrupt death, stating, [...] "She didn't get a big, maudlin send-off, it was very <b>quick</b> and <b>to</b> the <b>point</b> - very Anya in that respect."

500|$|In October, 2017, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, {{predicted}} {{the arrival of}} Nibiru for November 19; a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a [...] "black star" [...] {{at the edge of}} our Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though The Washington Post, quoting the United States Geological Survey, was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Piłsudski's plan was {{strongly}} criticized, {{and only the}} desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders {{to go along with}} it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including decrypted Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed [...] "amateurish" [...] by high-ranking army officers and military experts who were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander Mikhail Tukhachevsky thought it a ruse and disregarded it. Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for this when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident Red Army suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.|$|E
500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience. As Carole Hillenbrand wrote, it would be [...] "dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value." ...|$|E

McVicar tested a new patent compass in July and wrote a testimonial letter on 13 June. Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Leith, and McVicar used it for some nine weeks, finding it {{better than the other}} compasses on Apelles.

25|$|Trey Burke scored seven <b>quick</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> get Michigan out to {{an early}} 7-3 lead. But then he picked up two fouls and {{would be forced to}} sit on the bench. Spike Albrecht, {{replacing}} him, made four consecutive three pointers leading to a 17-point 1st half performance and Michigan would be up 35-23. But, Luke Hancock made four consecutive three-pointers to cut the Michigan lead to 38-37 at halftime.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the tense}} {{political}} circumstances {{during which the}} murder occurred, some English-language Western media outlets like The Guardian and the Los Angeles Times were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> indirectly <b>point</b> out a possible connection to similar events in Serbia at the time (Serbia was going through its own wave of assassinations {{in the first part}} of 2000). They went as far as to cautiously suggest Žugić's assassination was an attempt by Belgrade to destabilize Montenegro ahead of its first elections after the 78-day 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia. Others, like the Italian Corriere della Sera went even further, saying that [...] "Montenegro and Serbia have for months been at the edge of separation" [...] and that [...] "this tragic event brought the possibility of a compromise between them down to a minimum" [...] before ominously exclaiming: [...] "If another war flares up in the Balkans we will have known its start date in advance as well its detonator".|$|R

He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'.

500|$|Hartley is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{out that}} before [...] "Justice", the series did {{not focus on}} [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise {{you look like a}} standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated {{that he was one of}} the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E

5000|$|The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion is a 2012 social {{psychology}} book by Jonathan Haidt, in which Haidt describes human morality {{as it relates}} to politics and religion. Haidt attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. Haidt argues that people are too <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> denigrate other <b>points</b> of view without giving those views full consideration. He makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations, and {{said in an interview that}} morality [...] "is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that" [...] and [...] "and politics are ... expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature". Haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life, he is now more open <b>to</b> other <b>points</b> of view.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{assessment}} method {{is based on}} {{years of experience in}} overhead crane visual inspection and analysis. The main concern of the technique is to identify and fix the lateral and diagonal displacement of cranes originating from miscellaneous causes. The {{assessment method}} describes the steps to follow when a displacement problem is observed on an overhead crane. The analysis includes runways visual inspection, visual inspection of the runways substructures, visual analysis with cameras, monitoring of the runways substructure and runways displacement with indicators and acquisition system. The method is working by elimination to converge toward the cause of the abnormal displacement. It includes a few techniques of telemetry and traditional precision measurements. The method is in accordance with the ASME 1, 2 and CSA 3 standards and with the practices of the industry. On site anecdotes and experiences are presented in conjunction with the applicable standards <b>to</b> provide <b>quick</b> tips <b>to</b> <b>point</b> out a massive amount of interrelated problems...|$|R
