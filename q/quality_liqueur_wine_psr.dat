40|$|Interlaboratory {{studies are}} decisive tools {{to help the}} {{validation}} of a specific analytical methodology or to assess the reproducibility {{of the use of}} different methods to analyze a given compound or compounds in certain sample matrices. In this work, homogeneous samples of two white wines (“White Wine” and “White Liqueur Wine”) and one red wine (“Red Fortified Wine”) from Portugal with different production techniques and characteristics, namely in alcohol strength (10. 5 %, 16. 0 % and 19. 0 % ethanolic content, respectively), were analyzed for their contents in ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin generated from fungal contamination. White <b>Liqueur</b> <b>Wine</b> was naturally contaminated, whereas the other two wine type were spiked with ethanolic OTA solutions. The participation of 24 laboratories from 17 countries of five continents was ensured for this study. Although with no restrictions in terms of analytical methodology to employ, 75 % of the laboratories resorted to immunoaffinity columns clean-up followed by high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD), most of them in accordance with the European Standard EN 14133. For White Wine samples, the general mean OTA concentration was 1. 96 μg/l (two outliers) with interlaboratorial standard deviation (sL) of 0. 53 μg/l; for White <b>Liqueur</b> <b>Wine,</b> mean of 1. 59 μg/l (one outlier), with sL = 0. 59 μg/l; and for Red Fortified Wine, mean of 2. 73 μg/l (no outliers), with sL = 0. 96 μg/l. Outliers were determined by Cochran and Grubbs tests. The Horrat index, recommended by the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) for the quality assurance of the collaborative study was, on average, 1. 7.

The increasing segregation of more popular drinking places such as pulquerías and vinaterías into poorer, more peripheral parts of Mexico City and of cafés, as more elite social spaces, into wealthier, more central parts of the city contributed to the demarcation of social boundaries within Mexico City and conceptual boundaries of class within the imagined Mexican nation.

It was Cloete's dedication (and later that of his son, also named Hendrik) that raised the prestige of the estate and led to its prompt discovery by the invading British. In his 1816 work, Topographie de Tous les Vignobles Connus, the French oenologist André Jullien included the wines of Constantia in the highest category of his expansive quality classification of the world's wine.
