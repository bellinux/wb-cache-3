40|$|<b>Quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> {{represent}} the earliest (ca. 540 Ma) and most primitive plutonic {{rocks in the}} Pan African Damara belt and they pre-date the main phase of high-T regional metamorphism. Two suites of synorogenic <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> are unusual among Damaran intrusive rocks in their elemental and isotopic features. Comparison of the diorite compositions with melts from amphibolite-dehydration melting experiments points to a garnet-bearing meta-tholeiite, probably enriched in K 2 O, as a likely source rock. Partial melting processes generated mafic (ca. 50 wt% SiO 2) <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> in the deep crust at temperatures of between 1, 000 and 1, 100 degreesC, based on comparison with experimental results and similar temperature estimates based on P 2 O 5 solubility in mafic rocks. Subsequently, the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> evolved by multistage, polybaric differentiation processes including fractional crystallization of mainly hornblende and plagioclase and assimilation of felsic basement gneisses. Although their chemical characteristics (high LILE, low HFSE) resemble those of other <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> with calc-alkaline affinities, they differ in their enriched Sr (initial Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 70943 - 0. 71285), Nd (initial epsilon Nd: - 9. 1 to - 15. 2) and O (delta(18) O : 6. 8 - 8. 1 parts per thousand) isotope compositions. Neodymium model ages (T-DM) that range from 1. 7 to 2. 2 Ga and large variation in Pb- 207 /Pb- 204 relative to Pb- 206 /Pb- 204 indicates involvement of ancient crustal material.

It is proposed that the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> originated by synorogenic high temperature melting of mafic lower crust.

Intrusion of the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> is constrained by a U-Pb zircon age of 540 Ma. <b>Quartz</b> <b>diorites,</b> granodiorites and granites display heterogeneous initial Nd- and O isotope compositions (eNd (540 Ma) =+ 6. 3 to + 19. 8; d 18 O= 9. 0 - 11. 6 permil) but rather low and uniform initial Sr isotope compositions (87 Sr/ 86 Srinitial = 0. 70794 - 0. 70982). Two leucogranites and one aplite have higher initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (0. 70828 - 0. 71559), but similar initial eNd (+ 11. 9 to + 15. 8) and oxygen isotope values (10. 5 - 12. 9 permil). The geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the Bandombaai Complex are distinct from other granitoids of the Kaoko Belt and the Central Zone of the Damara orogen. Our study suggests that the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> of the Bandombaai Complex are generated by melting of heterogeneous mafic lower crust. Based on a comparison with results from amphibolite-dehydration melting experiments, a lower crustal garnet- and amphibole-bearing metabasalt, probably enriched in K 2 O, is a likely source rock for the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites.</b> The granodiorites/granites show low Rb/Sr (1) and are most likely generated by biotitedehydration melting of heterogeneous felsic lower crust. All segments of the lower crust underwent partial melting during the Pan-African orogeny at a time (540 Ma) when the middle crust of the central Damara orogen also underwent high T, medium P regional metamorphism and melting.

The quartz monzonites belong to a hybridgranitoid association, including monzonites, syenites and quartz syenites, all with abundant mafic magmatic enclaves.

Uranium-Pb zircon data obtained on the granodiorites and leucogranites indicate concordia upper intercept ages of 553 +/- 40 Ma although Pb- 207 /Pb- 206 ages of ca. 650 Ma in zircon from the granodiorites suggest some inheritance of older material.

These ages {{are similar to the}} Rb- 87 /Sr- 86 whole rock age of 584 +/- 35 Ma obtained on the granodiorites and leucogranites although the Rb-Sr age seems to be biased towards older ages due to limited assimilation of older material. In contrast to other plutonic complexes from the Kaoko Belt, the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites,</b> granodiorites and granites show a restricted range in their initial Nd, Sr and O isotope compositions (quartz diorites: epsilon(Nd) ((init.)) : - 5. 4 to - 6. 7; delta O- 18 : 8. 3 - 9. 4 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7081 - 0. 7098; granodiorites: epsilon(Nd) ((init.)) : - 6. 1 to - 7. 7; delta O- 18 : 9. 9 - 10. 9 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7071 - 0. 7105; leucogranites: epsilon(Nd) ((init)) : - 4. 9 to - 8. 7; delta O- 18 : 9. 8 - 11. 3 parts per thousand; Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 : 0. 7060 - 0. 7125). Enclaves are found in the granodiorites and leucogranites but not in the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites.</b> They have a granodioritic composition with quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar and hornblende and some have additional garnet. Relative to the country rock gneisses (the so called Nk Formation), enclaves are depleted in SiO 2, Na 2 O, K 2 O, Sr, Ba and enriched in CaO, FeO(total), MgO, TiO 2, Sc, V, Cr, Ni, Rb and Y. Rare garnet-bearing enclaves are additionally depleted in LREE and enriched in HREE relative to the granodiorites. These features are qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that these enclaves may represent moderately depleted melting residues of Nk Formation gneisses. In comparison with experimentally derived melts and based on low Al 2 O 3 / (FeO + MgO + TiO 2) ratios and high Al 2 O 3 + FeO + MgO + TiO 2 values it is suggested that the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> are generated by dehydration melting of a mafic, amphibole- and plagioclase-bearing lower crustal source of Pan-African age. The granodiorites likely represent fractionation products of the <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites.</b> However, {{it is also possible that}} the granodiorites represent partial melting products of a mafic to intermediate lower crustal source but experienced likely slightly lower degrees of melting probably at water present conditions. The leucogranites display higher Al 2 O 3 / (FeO + MgO + TiO 2) ratios but lower Al 2 O 3 + FeO + MgO + TiO 2 values and are most likely generated by biotite dehydration melting of felsic crustal sources. Major and trace element and isotope variations indicate that fractional crystallization with only limited crustal contamination was the major rock-forming mechanism. it is suggested that most of the isotope variation reflects pre-existing heterogeneities of the sources. Consequently, interpretation of geochemicaland isotope data from the complex suggests that the Pan-African igneous activity in this part of the Damara-Kaoko Belt was not a major crust-forming episode and all rock types represent reprocessed crustal material.

40|$|Eoarchaean crust in West Greenland (the Itsaq Gneiss Complex, 3870 - 3600 Ma) is > 80 % {{by volume}} orthogneisses derived from {{plutonic}} tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) suites, 3850, c. 3810 and c. 3710 Mahave some compositional similarities to modern island arc basalts (IAB), suggesting their origin by hydrous fluxing of a suprasubduction-zone upper mantle wedge. Most of the Eoarchaean tonalites match in composition high- silica, low-magnesian adakites, whose petrogenesis {{is dominated by}} partial melting of garnetiferous mafic rocks at high pressure. However, associated with the tonalites are volumetrically minor more magnesian <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites,</b> whose genesis probably involved melting of depleted mantle to which some slab-derived component had been added. This assemblage is evocative of suites of magmas produced at Phanerozoic convergent plate boundaries in the case where subducted crust is young and hot. Thus, Eoarchaean 'subduction' first gave rise to short-lived episodes of mantle wedge melting by hydrous fluxing, yielding IAB- like basalts ± boninites. In the hotter Eoarchaean Earth, flux-dominated destructive plate boundary magma generation quickly switched to slab melting of ('subducted') oceanic crust. This latter process produced the voluminous tonalites that were intruded into the slightly older sequences consisting of tectonically imbricated assemblages of IAB-like pillow lavas + sedimentary rocks, gabbros and upper mantle peridotite slivers. Zircon datingshows that Eoarchaean TTG production in the Itsaq Gneiss Complex was episodic (3870, 3850 - 3840, 3820 - 3810, 3795, 3760 - 3740, 3710 - 3695 and 3660 Ma). In each case, emplacement of small volumes of magma was probably followed by 10 - 40 Maquiescence, which allowed the associated thermal pulse to dissipate. This explains why Greenland Eoarchaean crustal growth did not have granulite-facies metamorphismdirectly associated with it. Instead, 3660 - 3600 Ma granulite-facies metamorphism(s) in the Itsaq Gneiss Complex were consequential to collisional orogeny and underplating, upon termination of crustal growth. Similar Eoarchaean crustal history is recorded in the Anshan area of China, where a few well- preserved rocks as old as 3800 Ma have been found including high-MgO <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites.</b> For 3800 Ma rocks, this is a rare, if not unique, situation outside of the Itsaq Gneiss Complex. The presence of volumetrically minor 3800 Mamantle-derived high-MgO <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> in both the Itsaq Gneiss Complex and the Anshan area indicates either that Eoarchaean 'subduction' zones were overlain by a narrow mantlewedge or that the shallow subduction trapped slivers of upper mantle between the conserved and consumed plates...|$|R

The studied example has an age of 711 Ma +- 7 Ma, and is characterized by very low initial Sr ratio (8 ~Sr/S 6 Sr = 0. 7026) and very low abundances of K 20 and re-lated large-ion lithophile trace elements. REE contents are low (less than 20 × chondritic abundances). Abundance patterns show only moderate light rare-earth enrichment (La/Yb = 4. 5). These characteristics are inconsistent with any models requiring fractional fusion of pre-existing continental crustal material. Granitic and arkosic cobbles occur in rare conglomerate beds within volcanoclastic:an...|$|R
40|$|Silicic Fe-Ti-oxide magmatic {{series was}} the first {{recognized}} in the Sierra Leone axial segment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near 6 °N. The series consists of intrusive rocks (harzburgites, lherzolites, bronzitites, norites, gabbronorites, hornblende Fe-Ti-oxide gabbronorites and gabbronorite-diorites, <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites,</b> and trondhjemites) and their subvolcanic (ilmenite-hornblende dolerites) and, possibly, volcanic analogues (ilmenite-bearing basalts). Deficit of most incompatible elements in the rocks of the series suggests that parental melts derived from a source {{that had already been}} melted. Correspondingly, these melts could not be MORB derivatives. Origin of the series is thought to be related to melting of the hydrated oceanic lithosphere during emplacement of an asthenospheric plume (protuberance on the surface of large asthenospheric lens beneath MAR). Genesis of different melts was supposedly controlled by ascent of a chamber of hot mantle magmas thought this lithosphere in compliance with the zone melting mechanism. Melt acquired fluid components from heated rocks at peripheries of the plume and became enriched in Fe, Ti, Pb, Cu, Zn, and other components mobile in fluids...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Rb-Sr {{isochron}} ages {{recorded by}} the Ashgillian ignimbrites from Deerlijk and Harelbeke and the Caradocian <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> from Quenast and Bierghes significantly post-date their emplacement. At Quenast, two mineral isochrons (biotite-WR-plagioclase: 372 f 13 Ma; K-feldspar-WR-epidote: 375 f 14 Ma) reveal that the Brabantian branch of the Caledonian belts was affected by a post-Siegenian, pre-Tournaisian event. This overprint {{turns out to be}} contemporaneous with the development of the Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone which is dated to 373 f 11 Ma and 379 f 13 Ma on foliated rocks from Bierghes, Deerlijk and Harelbeke. This c. 375 Ma cluster of events is interpreted as representing late Givetian stresses developed along the Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone for which the balance of geological data favours strike-slip movements. Since this compressive phase of deformation is posterior to the Givetian opening of the Borain trough, the Brabant Massif appears to have been affected by successive crustal extension and shortening events in the Middle Devonian. Petrological evidence demonstrates the very low-grade character of the metamorphism in the metasediments {{on both sides of the}} Oudenaarde-Bierghes fault zone. From this, we deduce that Sr isotopic homogenization of whole-rock ignimbrite and the loss of radiogenic Sr fro...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe EW-striking Variscan Mérens {{shear zone}} (MSZ), {{located on the}} {{southern}} border of the Aston dome (Pyrenees), corresponds to variously mylonitized gneisses and plutonic rocks that are studied using the Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) technique. The plutonic rocks form EW-striking bands with, from south to north, gabbro-diorites, <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites</b> and granodiorites. The MSZ underwent a mylonitic deformation with an intensity progressively increasing from the mafic to the more differentiated rocks. The foliations are EW to NW–SE striking and subvertical. A first set of lineations shows a moderate WNW plunge, with a dextral reverse kinematics. More recent subvertical lineations correspond to an uplift of the northern compartment. To the east, the MSZ was cut by a N 120 °E-striking late shear band, separating the MSZ from the Quérigut pluton. The different stages of mylonitization relate to Late Variscan dextral transpression. This regime allowed the ascent of magmas along tension gashes in the middle crust. We interpret the MSZ as a zone of magma transfer, which fed a pluton now eroded that {{was similar to the}} Quérigut and Millas plutons located to the east. We propose a model of emplacement of these plutons by successive pulses of magmas along en-échelon transfer zones similar to the MSZ...|$|R
40|$|Eoarchaean {{juvenile}} crust {{formed as}} ‘proto-arcs’. The northern {{side of the}} Isua supracrustal belt is an archetypal proto-arc, with ≥ 3720 Ma boninites, c. 3720 Ma basalts and gabbros, 3720 – 3710 Ma andesites, diorites and mafic tonalites, 3710 – 3700 Ma intermediate-felsic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and 3700 – 3690 Ma chemical sedimentary rocks. On its northern side there is an extensive body of 3700 – 3690 Ma tonalite. During its evolution, the c. 3700 Ma Isua volcanic–sedimentary assemblage was partitioned into tectonic slices, with intercalation of mantle dunites with pillow basalts, prior to intrusion of c. 3710 Ma <b>quartz</b> <b>diorites.</b> Partitioning also occurred at 3690 – 3660 Ma, when the 30 – 20 million years life of the c. 3700 Ma Isua proto-arc was terminated by juxtaposition with the c. 3800 Ma terrane that occurs along {{the south of the}} Isua supracrustal belt. The trace element chemistry for all the ≥ 3720 – 3700 Ma mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks indicates fluid-fluxing mantle melting. The c. 3690 Ma tonalites have signatures showing melting of garnet-bearing mafic (eclogite) sources. The Isua c. 3700 Ma assemblage developed at an intra-oceanic convergent plate boundary, and it has a life-cycle broadly analogous to (but not identical to) an oceanic island arc eventually accreted against older crust...|$|R
