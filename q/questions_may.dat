5|$|Members {{who wish}} to ask general or themed {{questions}}, or questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer. Written <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> also be submitted by members to ministers. Written questions and answers are published in the Official Report.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> also be {{referred}} to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure will apply to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five of these <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> still leave to be settled as to the kind and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

25|$|Question Period in Canada, as an {{instance}} of Question time in Westminster tradition, {{is similar to the}} Prime Minister's Questions practice of the Parliament of the United Kingdom; however {{it is important to note}} that the Canadian version occurs daily as opposed to weekly, runs 45 minutes instead of 30 and <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> be asked to any cabinet member, not just the Prime Minister.|$|E
25|$|Reflecting {{the nature}} of Bilingualism in Canada, Question Period is bilingual. <b>Questions</b> <b>may</b> be posed in either English or French and {{responses}} may be in either official language. Although English was the primary language in parliament in its early days, French is now spoken {{just as much as}} English. Simultaneous interpretation is provided on English and French broadcasts of Question Period, on many news networks, as well as the Cable Public Affairs Channel (CPAC). Transcripts of Question Period are published in both official languages in the Canadian Hansard, as with any other proceedings in the House of Commons and its committees.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of a typical Question Period, the Speaker recognizes the Leader of the Opposition to ask the lead question. It is {{possible}} for the question to be asked by a designee of the Leader of the Opposition, yet this Member of Parliament must {{be a member of the}} Official Opposition. Following the answer to the lead question, the lead questioner has two more questions permitted, referred to as supplementary questions. These <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> be asked by the same Member of Parliament to follow up on the answer provided to the lead question, or they may be given to another member of the Official Opposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} these <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> be {{sufficiently}} answered through {{the study of}} formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also {{run the risk of}} inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over {{whether or not they are}} sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.|$|E
25|$|After check-in, all {{checked baggage}} is {{screened}} using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners {{and put in}} a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Qatar) will be subject to further questioning.|$|E

25|$|A crucial {{reason why}} {{governmental}} powers are separated among three {{branches of government}} – the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary – is so that the exercise of power by one branch may be checked by the other two branches. In addition to approving the Government's expenditure of public funds, Parliament exercises a check over the Cabinet through the power of MPs to question the Prime Minister and other Ministers regarding the Government's policies and decisions. MPs may put questions to Ministers relating to affairs within their official functions, or bills, motions or other public matters connected with the business of Parliament for which they are responsible. <b>Questions</b> <b>may</b> also be put to other MPs relating to matters that they are responsible for. However, this is a weak check when most of the MPs are members of the political party in power, as they are constrained by party discipline to adhere to the policies it espouses.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review of 3 out of 4 stars, appreciating [...] "the in-jokes and the self-aware characters", but was confused {{over whether the}} level of violence was [...] "defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it". The New York Times Janet Maslin was not as appreciative, saying [...] "not much of 'Scream' is that gruesome". She wrote that Craven [...] "wants things both ways, capitalizing on lurid material while undermining it with mocking humor. Not even horror fans who can answer all this film's knowing trivia <b>questions</b> <b>may</b> be fully comfortable with such an exploitative mix." [...] Despite being critical of the film itself, calling it [...] "one experiment that needed more lab time", Variety complimented the [...] "strong" [...] ensemble cast, singling out the performances of Campbell and Ulrich as [...] "charismatic". The BBC claimed that the film had promise, saying [...] "It appeared to be clever, dangerous, witty, and fresh" [...] but went on to label it as derivative of the films it satirized: [...] "Scream runs out of humour, and in turn robs itself of the chance to get the audience to take the thrills and gut-spills it offers seriously." ...|$|E
