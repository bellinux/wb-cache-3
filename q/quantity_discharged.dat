One single trip {{of a large}} cruise ship on average produces 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1,000,000 gallons of greywater, 125 gallons of toxic chemicals and hazardous waste, 8 tons of garbage and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Although there have been attempts to regulate this kind of discharge, most of this waste is still dumped into the sea (Tourism in the Caribbean, Duval 2004). Some cruise ships are managing their waste by reducing the impact through advanced sewage systems, shipboard recycling programs, and increased use of biodegradable alternatives to plastic. However, their industry has increased about 60% from the 1980s to 2003. Therefore, they reduce the damage of their discharge but increase the <b>quantity</b> <b>discharged.</b>|$|E

It was found that similar discharges took place from the two valves at all pump speeds when the valve-opening pressures, the nozzle-orifice diameters, and the injection-tube lengths were the same for both valves. Under these conditions, the effects of changing the pump speed, the pump throttle setting, or the nozzle orifice diameter were {{very similar to those}} occurring with a single-injection valve. By a proper selection of discharge-orifice areas and valve-opening pressures it was possible to obtain a great many combinations of discharge quantities, discharge rates, and injection timings for the two valves.

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{adoption}} of more and more accurate preventive techniques, hazardous release still represents a serious concem in the process industry. In particular, flammable release can give rise {{to the formation of}} flammable mixtures and, when an ignition source is available, to flash fires or even to explosions. Even if the application of Inherently Safer Technology principles is the best choice to achieve hazard reduction and prevent the effects of domino scenarios in process plants, this option cannot be fully applied in many contexts and the probability of the formation of explosive mixtures cannot be excluded at all. So the safe operation is accomplished by the application of active and passive strategies. The traditional safety approach has focused on adding protective measures and mitigation systems to the process to reduce the risk and improve safety. Mitigation of this kind of risk takes many forms and the most idoneous interventions depend upon different factors, e. g. : • characteristics of the accident and of the equipment/plant section involved in the loss of containment (rupture/brake in a pipeline, hole in a storage vessel/ tank etc.); • release definition (rate of discharge or <b>quantity</b> <b>discharged)</b> and hazardous properties ofthe involved materials (including physico-chemical characteristics and energy content); • characteristics ofthe environment (confined, semi-confined, open air). The main focus of protective measures is to limit the mass of the explosive mixture under formation within a threshold value corresponding to acceptable consequences in case of ignition. Clearly, the optimal strategy to cope with this target must be selected and designed according to the specific case under examination. In this paper, it is investigated the peculiar case of lighter than air flammable releases in partially confined environment, by developing ad-hoc an analytical dispersion model...|$|E

There are four main alternative methods including single sequential coal discharge, single alternated coal discharge, multi-round sequential coal discharge and multi-round alternated coal discharge. The geological conditions for different coal seams are different, and their capabilities are also different, thus, different coal discharge methods must be used, and the recovery of top coal is also varied.|$|R

However, larger and denser cities, and wealthier cities in the eastern part of China tended to have larger <b>quantities</b> of pollutant <b>discharge,</b> resource consumption, and changes in land use (i. e., expansion of the built environment). The discharge increase occurred despite these cities having increased their investment in pollution control and construction of municipal environmental infrastructure.

By 1998, Iran has started to exploit from the largest dam on Karkheh River, this river {{is one of the largest}} watery sources in Hoor-Alazim wetland. To supply with water of the dam caused to decline the quantity of entering water to the wetland and following it, the wetland extend has been reduced remarkably.

Given that cost benefit analyses of the CWA have yielded favorable conclusions, the chapters in this dissertation collect empirical evidence on whether NPDES permit writers pay attention to downstream water quality, if plants are sensitive to ambient pollution, and finally if pollutant discharges {{have an impact on}} downstream quality. Previous empirical studies incorporating ambient water quality in effluent limit or abatement choice, or pollutant inputs as a determinant of downstream water quality could not be found. These intermediate relationships are studied with Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) as the primary pollutant and hence Dissolved Oxygen (DO) as the main indicator of water quality. Monthly panel data comprising a sample of 100 plants from Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania and 79 pairs of (downstream and upstream) water quality monitoring stations over a period of about 14 years, from 1990 to February 2004, was used. Positive evidence on efficacy of the NPDES regulation is found in all the three aspects investigated. On how regulation is implemented: if average water quality prevailing during past permit cycle is increased by one percent, then limits on BOD concentration (quantity) in the 'new' cycle would be made less stringent by 0. 617 (0. 322) percent. On how polluters respond to downstream water quality: if average DO prevailing during past three years is reduced by one percent, then concentration (<b>quantity)</b> <b>discharges</b> relative to effluent limits is reduced by 1. 301 (1. 558) percent.
