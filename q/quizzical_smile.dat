60|$|She {{moved toward}} the closed door that {{connected}} the two rooms, but stopped, and half turned and bestowed upon Goodwin a grave, searching look that ended in a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The brother's {{thin lips}} drew apart in a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "You must become a Catholic {{and help us}} to {{preserve}} the crumbling architecture of the good fathers," [...] he suggested.|$|E
6000|$|He favoured {{me with a}} <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> “Hump, I {{have studied}} some grammar in my time, and I think your tenses are tangled. ‘Was mine,’ you should have said, not ’is mine.’” ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a hearty}} supper Hayes joined the smokers about the fire. His {{appearance}} did not settle {{all the questions}} {{in the minds of}} his brother rangers. They saw simply a loose, lank youth with tow-coloured, sun-burned hair and a berry-brown, ingenuous face that wore a <b>quizzical,</b> good-natured <b>smile.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fairy tales are {{handed down}} from mothers to daughters, and from fathers to sons. As they are passed on, the tales grow in the telling – or {{gradually}} depart from the original, as new elements get added, or others get cut. Steeped in memories of childhood, nursery rhymes and other bedside stories seem {{to speak with the}} authentic voice of pre-history, and forge a direct link to that bygone past. Although this is an enchanting notion, the reality is that these age-old fables are always something of a patchwork: the product of different authors, at different times. The party line about Kurt Schwitters was that he was many things: poet, performer, painter, prankster (and permutations of the above). It’s less often noted that he was also a writer of children’s stories – a playful, avuncular spirit with a penchant for the macabre and the absurd. A number of Schwitters’ captivating children’s tales form the basis of Andrea Luka Zimmerman’s Merzschmerz, a series of short videos in which children revisit what they remember of each recently-read story, and relay it in the company of an adult (family member, neighbour, guardian or friend). As the children furrow their brows in concentration, or smirk in advance at the funny things they are about to impart, their excited faces are echoed by the indulgent, <b>quizzical</b> <b>smiles</b> of the adults, creating a moment of togetherness, and adding to the pieces’ infectious charm.

40|$|You {{must love}} working with kids!" is the {{standard}} response I get from people when I tell them I am a children's librarian, right after the "Oh," and the nodding, <b>smiling,</b> <b>quizzical</b> look that says, "Is she an intellectual or a nerd?" If I did not think I would be ostracized for taboo honesty, I would always tell them, "No, I do not love working with kids, I love my job. " My job just happens to involve working with kids sometimes, {{but that is not}} what I do all the time. In fact, I only work with kids the percentage of hours that I work the reference desk and during programming time. The remainder of the time is spent in hours on other tasks and responsibilities such as program planning, department or library planning, publicity, collection development (which includes more long hours over selection aids and weeding), networking, evaluation, scheduling, outreach, etc. Children's librarianship revolves around kids: their parents, their caregivers, their social workers, and their teachers. All the materials we buy, all the programs we execute, and all the planning we do is a means to an end, and that end is to serve this specific "brand" of library user. Serving this brand of user can be extremely difficult, because it engages, as demonstrated, a variety of people that have extremely different needs and desires...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had it hot, eh, captain," [...] {{said the}} North Dakota man to Ben {{as he came}} up with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> on his round face, from which the {{perspiration}} was pouring in a stream.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess I can, Mr. Latham," [...] {{answered}} the stranger, with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile,</b> offering {{one of his}} stout hands to Lydia's grandfather. [...] "You don't seem to remember your friends very well, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the trains}} are still running," [...] he assured her, with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "How about it, little girl?" [...] It was {{a term of}} endearment derived, undoubtedly, from a {{theatrical}} source, in which he sometimes indulged.|$|E
60|$|The Story Girl {{joined us}} with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> on her face. Dan whistled. Cecily's pale cheeks flushed with {{understanding}} and gratitude. The Story Girl wore her school print dress and hat also, and was gloveless and heavy shod.|$|E
6000|$|With {{a sort of}} vehemence {{the single}} word [...] "No" [...] passed out. A faint, a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> flitted over her face; she shrugged her {{shoulders}} ever so gently. That gesture--he had seen it before! And in desperate desire to make her understand, {{he put his hand}} on her lifted arm.|$|E
6000|$|He {{said this}} with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile,</b> for he had been reading my novel of Colorado, and {{recognized}} in my scene the splendors of the San Juan country. [...] "Your friend Ehrich is coming," [...] he added, [...] "and I expect Sterling Morton {{for a day or}} two. Why not all come down together?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you think}} I'm mad, do you?" [...] asked the girl, with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Well, I'm {{not going to}} satisfy your curiosity, even to prove my sanity; and I'm not anxious to pose as your lost Lucy. So please pass the sugar {{and try to be}} sociable, instead of staring at me as if I scared you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are they {{arrangements}} that couldn't possibly be altered?" [...] asked Mr. Perkins, with his <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I shall be very sorry to lose you. In schools the rather stupid boys who work always {{do better than}} the clever boy who's idle, but when the clever boy works--why then, he does what you've done this term." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Murray couldn't be a farmer, {{that was}} {{all there was to}} it. I told Uncle Abimelech so, firmly, and I talked to him for days about it, but Uncle Abimelech never wavered. He sat and listened to me with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> on that handsome, clean-shaven, ruddy old face of his, with its cut-granite features. And in the end he said, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he {{said with}} a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "If you can stand the expense, I can." [...] A little later he said, [...] "What a change my life has witnessed. I helped to grade the first railway in the State of Maine, and now here I am {{whirling}} along through 'the Great American Desert' eating a steak and drinking my coffee in a flying hotel. I wish your mother could be here with us." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Campbell's {{housekeeper}} ushered us {{into his}} parlour and left us. Presently Mr. Campbell himself {{was standing in}} the doorway, looking us over. We took heart of grace. It seemed to be one of his good days, for there was a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> on his broad, clean-shaven, strongly-featured face. Mr. Campbell was a tall man, with a massive head, well thatched with thick, black hair, gray-streaked. He had big, black eyes, with many wrinkles around them, and a thin, firm, long-lipped mouth. We thought him handsome, for an old man.|$|E
6000|$|Tarzan of the Apes smiled. As unmistakably {{as though}} a human voice had spoken, the lion had said to him [...] "I am hungry, even more than hungry. I am starving," [...] and the ape-man looked down upon the lion beneath him and smiled, a slow <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile,</b> and then he shifted the carcass from his {{shoulder}} to the branch before him and, drawing the long blade that had been his father's, deftly cut off a hind quarter and, wiping the bloody blade upon Bara's smooth coat, he returned it to its scabbard. Numa, with watering jaws, {{looked up at the}} tempting meat and whined again and the ape-man smiled down upon him his slow smile and, raising the hind quarter in his strong brown hands buried his teeth in the tender, juicy flesh.|$|E
60|$|Indeed we didn’t {{present a}} neat appearance, our faces unshaven, with {{the traces of}} dried salt sprays on our smarting skins and the sleeplessness of full forty hours filming our eyes. At least it was so with me who saw as through a mist Madame Léonore moving with her mature nonchalant grace, setting before us wine and glasses with a faint swish of her ample black skirt. Under the {{elaborate}} structure of black hair her jet-black eyes sparkled like good-humoured stars and even I {{could see that she}} was tremendously excited at having this lawless wanderer Dominic within her reach and as it were in her power. Presently she sat down by us, touched lightly Dominic’s curly head silvered on the temples (she couldn’t really help it), gazed at me for a while with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile,</b> observed that I looked very tired, and asked Dominic whether for all that I was likely to sleep soundly to-night.|$|E
60|$|He {{had spent}} part of his student life in Europe, and he looked back to his travel there with a fondness that the Old World inspires less and less in Americans. This, with his {{derivation}} {{from one of the}} unliterary Boston suburbs, and his unambitious residence in a place like Hatboro', gave her a sense of provinciality in him. On his part, he apparently found it droll that a woman of her acquaintance with a larger life should be willing to live in Hatboro' at all, and he seemed incredulous about her staying after summer was over. She felt that she mystified him, and sometimes she felt the pursuit of a curiosity which was a little too like a psychical diagnosis. He had a way of sitting beside her table and playing with her paper-cutter, while he submitted with a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> to her endeavours to turn him to account. She did not mind his laughing at her eagerness (a woman is willing enough to join a man in making fun of her femininity if she believes that he respects her), and she tried to make him talk about Hatboro', and tell her how she could be of use among the working people. She would have liked very much to know whether he gave his medical service gratis among them, and whether he found it a pleasure and a privilege to do so. There was one moment when she would have liked to ask him to let her be at the charges of his more indigent patients, but with the words behind her lips she perceived that it would not do. At the best, it would be taking his opportunity from him and making it hers. She began to see that one ought to have a conscience about doing good.|$|E
5000|$|Hubert {{warmed up}} with a long tribute to the President, then hit his stride as he began a rhythmic jabbing and {{chopping}} at Barry Goldwater. [...] "Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate voted for an $11.5 billion tax cut for American citizens and American business," [...] he cried, [...] "but not Senator Goldwater. Most Democrats and Republicans in the Senate - in fact four-fifths {{of the members of}} his own party - voted for the Civil Rights Act, but not Senator Goldwater."Time after time, he capped his indictments with the drumbeat cry: [...] "But not Senator Goldwater!" [...] The delegates caught the cadence and took up the chant. A <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile</b> spread across Humphrey's face, then turned to a laugh of triumph. Hubert was in fine form. He knew it. The delegates knew it. And no one could deny that Hubert Humphrey would be a formidable political antagonist in the weeks ahead.|$|E
40|$|In his book, Whatever, Michel Houellebeque wrote: “I observe {{right away}} that people {{generally}} go around in bands, or in little groups [...] - Next I notice that all these people seem satisfied with themselves and the world; it's astonishing, even a little frightening. They quietly saunter around, this one displaying a <b>quizzical</b> <b>smile,</b> that one a moronic look. Some of the youngsters are dressed in leather jackets with slogans borrowed from the more primitive kind of hard rock; you can read phrases on their backs like Kill them all!or Fuck and destroy!; but all commune in the certainty of passing an agreeable afternoon devoted primarily to consumerism, and thus to contributing to the consolidation of their being. ”i The quote illustrates the condition of our current time where culture and meaning has been negated {{by the process of}} consumption. From the quote we can clearly see ambivalence towards identity. Houellebecq's book has captured perfectly the pervasive emptiness of human life. Fashion has always been a mirror of the society, and what does it says about our society today when fashion has turned so banal that {{it is almost impossible to}} tell one from another. What does it say about our society when people's identity changes as the season changes with exponential acelleration. The idea of this project is to create a critical commentary on how the fashion world and the world in general has changed. During the last decades, fashion changes so fast, seasons come and go and the old Spring/Summer, Fall/Winter collections are not enough anymore. Now we have Resort and Pre-Fall as an addition to the original instalment. Customers expect new goods at least every month if not every week. Trends changes so fast to the point if you observed a fashionista she will look schizophrenic because of how often she changes her persona. Fashion has ceased to become creative or critical. The pressure on commercialism has led the industry into a machine with no substance geared to churn up more products with little regards to creativity, sustainability and the environment. The direction this change is going is frankly alarming, yet, with all the rigid system and the pressure on commercialism there is only so much that one can do. Referring to Michel Houellebeqc and his book Whateverii, with this project I'm trying to bring more awareness to the state of our time. iMichel Houellebeqc, Paul Hammond (translator), Whatever, Serpent's Tail, London, 1998 iiMichel Houellebeqc, Paul Hammond (translator), Whatever, Serpent's Tail, London, 199...|$|E
