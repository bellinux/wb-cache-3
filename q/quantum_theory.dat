5|$|If general {{relativity}} {{were considered to}} be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then <b>quantum</b> <b>theory,</b> the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics, would be the other. However, how to reconcile <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> with {{general relativity}} is still an open question.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} quantum gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics. However, nongravitational forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics, a radically different formalism for describing physical phenomena based on probability. A <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> to the force of gravity.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the concept}} of curved spacetime in Einsteinian General Relativity, the field <b>theories</b> and their <b>quantum</b> <b>theories</b> in the curved octonion spaces etc are discussed.

40|$|We {{show that}} many {{well-known}} <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories</b> emerge as representations {{of a single}} ^∗-algebra. These include free <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories</b> in flat and curved space-times, lattice <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories,</b> Wightman <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories,</b> and string theories.

40|$|According to a regnant {{criterion}} of physical equivalence for <b>quantum</b> <b>theories,</b> a <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> (QFT) typically admits continuously many physically inequivalent realizations. This, {{the second of}} a two‐part introduction to topics {{in the philosophy of}} QFT, continues the investigation of this alarming circumstance. It begins with a brief catalog of quantum field theoretic examples of this non‐uniqueness, then presents the basics of the algebraic approach to <b>quantum</b> <b>theories,</b> which discloses a structure common even to ‘physically inequivalent’ realizations of a QFT. Finally, it introduces and evaluates a handful of strategies for interpreting <b>quantum</b> <b>theories</b> {{in the face of the}} non‐uniqueness of their Hilbert space representations...|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies set up by the Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on <b>quantum</b> <b>theory,</b> the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{makes use}} of {{matrices}} in various ways, particularly since the use of <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> to discuss molecular bonding and spectroscopy.

5|$|Following a {{brief summary}} of the {{experimental}} crises (such as the ultraviolet catastrophe) which motivated <b>quantum</b> <b>theory,</b> Herbert identifies four major formulations of quantum theory: Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics, Paul Dirac's transformation theory, and Richard Feynman's sum-over-histories formulation.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He disagreed with Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory.

5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of <b>quantum</b> <b>theory.</b> Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{features}} {{of general relativity}} and <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts {{to arrive at a}} viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge Calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology.|$|E

50|$|In {{mathematical}} physics, constructive <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> is {{the field}} whose {{objective is to}} establish existence theorems for models of <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory.</b> Such theorems were proved in the 1960s and 1970s for <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> models in two and three dimensional space-times in the papers by James Glimm, Arthur Jaffe, Irving Segal, Edward Nelson, and others. The main goal of constructive <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory,</b> an existence proof of non-trivial <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> models in a four dimensional space-time, has not been reached. In the meantime, the theoretical physics community came to believe that {{the current state of the}} art <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> models are merely effective models rather than fundamental theories, whose mathematical status is of little practical relevance, and interest in constructive <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> has waned.|$|R
5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the <b>quantum</b> <b>theory</b> of molecular band spectra. He developed a method to carry out calculations of its transition probabilities. He calculated the photoelectric effect for hydrogen and X-rays, obtaining the absorption coefficient at the K-edge. His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations were indeed correct.|$|E
5|$|Quantum Reality is a 1985 popular science book by {{physicist}} Nick Herbert, {{a member}} the Fundamental Fysiks Group which {{was formed to}} explore the philosophical implications of <b>quantum</b> <b>theory.</b> The book attempts to address the ontology of quantum objects, their attributes, and their interactions, without reliance on advanced mathematical concepts.

40|$|Braided <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories</b> {{proposed}} by Oeckl {{can provide a}} framework for defining <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories</b> having Hopf algebra symmetries. In <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories,</b> symmetries lead to non-perturbative relations among correlation functions. We discuss Hopf algebra symmetries and such relations in braided <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories.</b> We give the four algebraic conditions between Hopf algebra symmetries and braided <b>quantum</b> field <b>theories,</b> which are required for the relations to hold. As concrete examples, we apply our discussions to the Poincare symmetries of two examples of noncommutative field theories. One is the effective <b>quantum</b> field <b>theory</b> of three-dimensional <b>quantum</b> gravity coupled with spinless particles given by Freidel and Livine, and the other is noncommutative field theory on Moyal plane.

5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of <b>quantum</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E
