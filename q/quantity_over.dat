5|$|Although American {{units were}} usually able to {{replenish}} their numbers quickly, the replacements rarely had sufficient tactical training. Many junior officers were short on tactical and leadership abilities. Some tankers were shipped to Europe without {{having so much}} as driven a car before; some tank commanders were forced to teach their men how to load and fire their tank guns in the field prior to missions. The American replacement system, which focused on <b>quantity</b> <b>over</b> quality, ensured {{that the majority of}} fresh troops reaching the front lines were not properly trained for combat. It was not unusual for half of a unit's replacements to become casualties within {{the first few days of}} combat. These tremendous frontline losses required ever-more troops to be fed into the fighting; for instance, a freshly reinforced battalion of the US 28th Infantry Division was immediately thrown into direct assaults against Aachen to buttress the depleted US 1st Infantry Division during the final stages of the battle on 18–21 October.|$|E
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the delay is gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in <b>quantity</b> <b>over</b> immediacy preference.|$|E

500|$|For Darwin and his contemporaries, natural {{selection}} was in essence synonymous with evolution by {{natural selection}}. After {{the publication of}} On the Origin of Species, educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form. However, natural selection remained controversial as a mechanism, partly because it was perceived to be too weak to explain the range of observed characteristics of living organisms, and partly because even supporters of evolution balked at its [...] "unguided" [...] and non-progressive nature, a response that has been characterised as the single most significant impediment to the idea's acceptance. However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase survival of the fittest, which became a popular summary of the theory. The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase {{as an alternative to}} natural selection, with credit given: [...] "But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient." [...] Although the phrase is still often used by non-biologists, modern biologists avoid it because it is tautological if [...] "fittest" [...] is read to mean [...] "functionally superior" [...] and is applied to individuals rather than considered as an averaged <b>quantity</b> <b>over</b> populations.|$|E

2500|$|For most of {{its history}} in the modern era, the Israeli wine {{industry}} was based predominantly on the production of Kosher wines which were exported worldwide to Jewish communities.

2500|$|The late 19th century saw {{a period}} of {{economic}} and political upheaval. First came oidium and then the phylloxera epidemic would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the Risorgimento heralded the beginning of the Italian diaspora that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands. Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like Trebbiano and Sangiovese clones such as the Sangiovese di Romagna from the nearby Romagna region.
