2500|$|The Poisson point {{process is}} often defined {{on the real}} line, {{where it can be}} {{considered}} as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in <b>queueing</b> <b>theory</b> [...] to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store or phone calls at an exchange, distributed in time. [...] In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network, [...] particles colliding into a detector, or trees in a forest. In this setting, the process is often used in [...] mathematical models and in the related fields of spatial point processes, stochastic geometry, spatial statistics [...] and continuum percolation theory. On more abstract spaces, the Poisson point process serves as an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. [...] Despite its wide use as a stochastic model of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction.|$|E

A RSS-based mechanism is considered to avoid the Ping-Pong effect. Also the network architecture is regulated to manage the wireless resource effectively.
