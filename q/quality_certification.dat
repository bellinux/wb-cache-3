25|$|Changes {{in section}} 404 {{jurisdiction}} would diminish use of one tool {{used by many}} states to control activities affecting wetlands. In recent years, most states have used CWA section 401 water <b>quality</b> <b>certification</b> programs in addition to or in lieu of specific regulatory statutes. Section 401 requires that before a federal permit or license is issued, states must certify that the project complies with water quality standards. That authority effectively gives states a veto power on the federal permit {{or the ability to}} require conditions that become part of a permit. State water <b>quality</b> <b>certification</b> has been used by a number of states to control activities affecting wetlands without having to independently establish state permitting and enforcement programs. However, if federal jurisdiction does not exist and no section 404 or other federal permit is required, section 401 certification also is not required and so is not available as a tool for the state to evaluate the proposed activity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water <b>quality</b> <b>certification</b> programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E

Such sections include those governing oil spill cleanup (section 311), the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program (section 402), and state water <b>quality</b> <b>certification</b> (section 401).|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of private <b>quality</b> <b>certifications</b> in agrifood supply chains often requires specific investments by producers {{which can be}} safeguarded by choosing specific contractual arrangements. Based on a survey data from avocado producers in Mexico, this paper aims to analyze the impact of transaction costs and relationship characteristics of the joint choice of contractual arrangements and <b>quality</b> <b>certifications.</b> Using a bivariate probit model, it shows that a producer’s decision to adopt private <b>quality</b> <b>certifications</b> is directly linked {{to high levels of}} asset specificity and price. In order to ensure the high level of specificity under the presence of low levels of price uncertainty, producers have relied on relational governance supported by the expectation of continuity in their bilateral relationships with buyers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{studies have}} shown that firms that have adopted {{environmental}} standards and those that have obtained official <b>quality</b> <b>certifications</b> achieve higher labour productivity than firms that have not done so. Unlike previous studies, this paper analyzes the combined effect of implementing environmental good practices and obtaining <b>quality</b> <b>certifications</b> on apparent labour productivity using a sample of 106 hotels in Andalusia (Spain). To this end, a descriptive analysis and an econometric estimation of a production function were conducted based on data obtained from the Quality, Productivity and Competitiveness in the Hospitality Industry for Andalusia project. We applied a standard Cobb-Douglas production function to this data, and extended the function by introducing an indicator of the implementation of good environmental practice by hotels and four different types of <b>quality</b> <b>certifications</b> as additional explanatory variables. The econometric results indicate that labour productivity increases only when both the Q-mark is awarded and environmental good practices are implemented (by 18. 74 % and 7. 51 %, respectively). In conclusion, the positive response of consumers towards improving environmental and quality measures may be an incentive to invest in these measures...|$|R
