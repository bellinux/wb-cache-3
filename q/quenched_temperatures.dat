Relaxation {{and local}} {{structure}} changes of a molten TiAl alloy film during quenching {{have been investigated}} by molecular dynamics simulations {{within the framework of}} embedded atom method (EAM). The details of atom motions are analyzed using mean square displacement (MSD). Accompanying with massive atom rearrangement at a certain quenched temperature and time, local structural patterns are identified by decomposing peaks of pair distribution functions (PDFs) according to the pair analysis(PA) technique. The relaxation factor clearly reveals two relaxation processes involving in slow relaxation and fast relaxation of the quenched liquid TiAl film.

40|$|We report here on {{the first}} {{hydrogen}} determinations in the volcanic gas plume of Mount Etna, in Italy, which we obtained during periodic field surveys on the volcano’s summit area with an upgraded MultiGAS. Using a specific (EZT 3 HYT) electrochemical sensor, we resolved H 2 concentrations in the plume of 1 – 3 ppm above ambient (background) atmosphere and derived H 2 ‐SO 2 and H 2 ‐H 2 O plume molar ratios of 0. 002 – 0. 044 (mean 0. 013) and 0. 0001 – 0. 0042 (mean 0. 0018), respectively. Taking the above H 2 ‐SO 2 ratios in combination with a time‐averaged SO 2 flux of 1600 Gg yr− 1, we evaluate that Etna contributes a time‐averaged H 2 flux of ∼ 0. 65 Gg yr− 1, suggesting that the volcanogenic contribution to the global atmospheric H 2 budget (70, 000 – 100, 000 Gg yr− 1) is marginal. We also use our observed H 2 ‐H 2 O ratios to propose that Etna’s passive plume composition is (at least partially) representative of a <b>quenched</b> (<b>temperatures</b> between 750 °C and 950 °C) equilibrium in the gas‐magma system, at redox conditions close to the nickel‐nickel oxide (NNO) mineral buffer. The positive dependence between H 2 ‐SO 2, H 2 ‐H 2 O, and CO 2 ‐SO 2 ratios suggests that H 2 is likely supplied (at least in part) by deeply rising CO 2 ‐rich gas bubbles, fluxing through a CO 2 ‐depleted shallow conduit magma...|$|E

30|$|In our calculations, the {{following}} assumptions were used. (1) Products {{are always in}} a chemical equilibrium. (2) Vapor plumes cool adiabatically. Thus, the temperature and pressure of the vapor plumes change along isentropic paths, whose entropies are determined by laser ablation. The composition of products is estimated along those pressure-temperature paths. (3) The composition of products is determined by a single quenching; all reactions quench at one <b>quenching</b> <b>temperature.</b> <b>Quenching</b> <b>temperature</b> is the temperature where chemical reaction rate and cooling rate of vapor plume become the same. Since the cooling rate of vapor plumes decreases as the scale of a vapor plume increases, <b>quenching</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases as the scale of a vapor plume increases.

The {{effect of}} {{alloying}} elements, heating rate and <b>quenching</b> <b>temperature</b> on the hardness of steel 42 CrMo after induction hardening were investigated by thermal simulation tests, hardness tests, optical microscopy(OM) and scanning electronic microscopy(SEM). The steel No. 2 {{was obtained by}} adding 1. 49 % Ni and reducing 0. 32 % Cr in steel No. 1. Experimental {{results show that the}} hardness of steel No. 1 decreases while that of steel No. 2 slightly increases under the <b>quenched</b> <b>temperature</b> of 900 °C when the heating rate increases from 100 °C/s to 300 °C/s. When the heating rate is 300 °C/s, the hardness of steel No. 1 increases sharply with the elevating of the <b>quenched</b> <b>temperature.</b> However, the hardness of steel No. 2 increases gently with the <b>quenched</b> <b>temperature</b> increasing below 900 °C but keeps constant above 900 °C. It is interesting that the hardness of steel No. 2 is obviously higher than that of steel No. 1 under the same heating process. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} following aspects: firstly, the Ac 1 and Ac 3 temperatures can largely decrease and the dissolution of carbide proceeds further; secondly, the addition of alloying element and the dissolution of carbide in the austenite can improve the hardenability of steel and thus increase the volume percentage of martensite in the quenched microstructure; in addition, the quenched microstructure of steel No. 2 is finer than that of steel No. 1 which undoubtedly helps the increase of hardness.

For a wide range of Ce concentrations (between 0. 033 % and 3. 3 %) the temperature dependence of the emission intensity and the luminescence lifetimes are reported.

The sharp decrease in measured strength is accompanied by unstable crack propagation. Material containing a significantly larger CBN grain size, exhibited a gradual decrease in strength above the critical quench conditions. The experimental observations agreed with an established theory developed for thermal shock of alumina. The theoretically calculated critical temperatures agree well with the observed experimental data for each material when a aw size equal to the CBN grain size is employed...|$|R
