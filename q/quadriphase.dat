The antenna can be folded down or erected by a motor-driven mechanism and the assembling and disassembling of the system {{can be accomplished by}} a crew of eight men within one hour. This advanced radar incorporates the state-of-the-art techniques. The excellent low sidelobe antenna employed in the system has greatly enhanced the radar's anti-clutter capability and ECCM performance, giving improved low-altitude detection performance. Three AMTI processing channels are used, each equipped to handle a particular environmental condition, thereby providing maximum low-altitude target detection. The wideband and highly stable TWT+CFA transmitter guarantees a super-clutter visibility in excess of 40 dB in the presence of ground clutter. The <b>quadriphase</b> Taylor code ensures a desirable consistency, high reliability and high stability. Meanwhile, the waveform agility can be realised. The JY-9F radar is characterised by high reliability and maintainability with an MTBF of more than 400 hours and MTTR of less than 30 minutes. Due to extensive BITE adopted in the system, troubleshooting probability reaches 95 per cent while 85 per cent of faults can be isolated to PCB level and all faults can be isolated to the replaceable unit level.|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} by formulating the problem in a discrete form. This leads to the representation of a <b>quadriphase</b> code by discrete Fourier transform and inverse discrete Fourier transform. The coefficients of a mismatched filter are then calculated from (7) by exploiting the discrete Fourier transform representation of the code. The mismatched filter designed in this manner eliminates the sidelobes as we have shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 6. A mismatched filter has three drawbacks when compared to the matched filter. The first drawback is that a mismatched filter has infinitely many coefficients. However, we have explained and also shown in Fig. 3 that the values of these coefficients go to zero rapidly. Hence, this may not be problematic in practice. The second drawback is that the discrete Fourier transform of the code might have zeros in the frequency domain and we have shown that this is improbable. The third problem is that its output SNR is less than the output SNR of the respective matched filter. However, one can choose codes with minimum SNR losses. We have presented the noise enhancement factors for the best codes in Table I. These codes have been selected from 1 : 466 1012 number of investigated codes based on their k vs values. The <b>quadriphase</b> codes, which have smaller values of k vs than the respective binary-phase codes, were selected.
