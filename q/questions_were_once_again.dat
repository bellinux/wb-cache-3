Drawing on research undertaken at that time by Ray Pahl, it is suggested that four <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> revealing {{in the study of the}} current economic downturn: 'How have we come to be where we are currently?', 'Who gets what?', 'How do we know what we claim to know?', and 'What sorts of lessons can be drawn to inform thinking about the future?'

40|$|The diversity-stability {{question}} {{seemed like}} {{a classic case of}} intuitive conventional wisdom overturned by mathematical theory. However, this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> a live issue in ecology and much broader than originally realised. Several recent insights are converging to provide a new framework for a comprehensive understanding of the diversity-stability relationship. First, there is not one type of stability but many, and their definitions and distinctions are now more clearly understood. Second, not only does stability at one level of the biological hierarchy from populations to communities to ecosystems not guarantee stability at another level, they may be unrelated or even negatively related. In particular, instability of populations, and therefore community composition, may generate stability of aggregate ecosystem processes such as productivity. The field is now ripe for a new synthesis through widespread testing of the new hypotheses generated by recent theory and experiment...|$|R

40|$|Not so {{long ago}} {{sensible}} discussion about nuclear energy was often marginalised, especially in anti-nuclear countries. In fact it was, {{and to some extent}} still remains, a no-go issue; a taboo subject banished from the mainstream of conversation. The tragic events of Chernobyl stirred up a whirlpool of understandably emotional reactions and created {{in the minds of many}} a view of nuclear energy that was largely coloured by irrational fears, inherited misconceptions and doomsday scenarios. The opponents of nuclear energy, skilled at exploiting the effects of emotive language and imagery, still encourage this mindset in order to keep nuclear energy off the agenda. They espouse a cause based more upon ideology than upon rational argument or fact. And yet, slowly but surely, as the scars but not the lessons of Chernobyl begin to fade, and as the strong security of supply and environmental credentials of nuclear energy have come to the fore, the whole nuclear energy <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> a legitimate and legitimised subject of debate. Even the anti-nuclear brigade now openly refer to the “dangers of the nuclear renaissance ” – recognition in itself that nuclear energy is back and no longer a taboo subject to be dismissed out of hand...|$|R

50|$|Most {{of these}} <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{examined}} <b>once</b> <b>again</b> in 1986 following investigations of a suspiciously similar major {{failure of the}} Bureau of Reclamation's Teton Dam in June, 1976, and a near failure of the Department of Water and Power's Lower Van Norman Dam in the 1971 San Fernando earthquake. Professor Ronald Scott of Caltech, {{who had participated in}} the Casagrande studies, noted at a follow-up 1987 conference on Baldwin Hills that Casagrande had ignored or been unaware of ground movements clearly unrelated to the reservoir (e.g. those at Stocker-LaBrea) in his analysis. Another engineer, Stanley Wilson—who had also worked with Casagrande on the 1972 studies and supported the claim that oilfield subsidence was an insignificant cause—now conceded that analogous ground offsets extended well outside the reservoir area, notably in the Stocker-LaBrea area, so that the reservoir and other fault movements could not be attributed to the reservoir itself—thus tacitly attributing responsibility for the failure to oilfield operations. Hence, there appeared to be convergence of opinion on the role of oilfield subsidence and repressurization.|$|R
50|$|The team of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) detectives {{investigating}} the murders {{was led by}} Detective Chief Inspector Nesbitt who headed C Division based at Tennent Street off the Shankill Road. However the police were overworked during this period and little progress {{was made in the}} investigation until one victim, Gerard McLaverty, survived his assault. Detectives were driving him down the Shankill Road {{on the way to the}} scene of his abduction when he recognised two of his assailants walking in the street. This identification of Sam McAllister and Benjamin Edwards led to the arrest of much of the gang in May 1977 and, in February 1979, they were imprisoned for long periods. Confessions of gang members had named Murphy as the leader but statements incriminating him were later retracted.

40|$|Throughout {{the whole}} 20 th Century, the urban issue is {{inextricably}} interwoven with the architectural research about new residential models. From the early formulations of the Utopist Socialists to the siedlungen of social-democratic Germany, from Le Corbusier and Russian Constructivists' projects {{to the new}} paradigms of the urban Dutch regeneration, the studies which were carried out around the typological and distributive aspects of housing propose and interpret new living ways, reflecting {{at the same time}} specific ideas for the city. In the latest years, it seems that the residential <b>question</b> has <b>been</b> <b>once</b> <b>again</b> playing {{a central role in the}} articulation of the political discourse about city building. The discipline deals again with collective housing, bringing back to the heart of the debate an issue which was abandoned at the end of the 20 th Century. The main approach oscillates in most cases between extolling the idea of environmental sustainability - identifying social housing as a privileged field for technological experimentation - and a political and programmatic approach concerning the opportunities that building development itself offers in terms of reactivation of economic cycles of production. From a strictly architectural perspective, typological-distributive aspects are rarely addressed, being the research about the ways of living the domestic and public spaces more often subordinated to romantic and evocative considerations about a communitarian and pre-urban life. This approximation is not surprising, given that the production of the last thirty years is consistent with a neoliberal model of privatization typical of the 80 s and 90 s which, coupled with the crisis of modern project, mechanically reproduces trivialized and stereotyped models of housing and urban living. If what we just said gives a general idea about the drift of the inevitable supremacy of speculation on disciplinary practice, this assumption represents only a superficial step and prompts us to further investigate the current state of architectural research on housing. The present study, proposes a systematic analysis of recent Portuguese housing production. It could be defined as an attempt to identify recurring and innovative models for defining space, retrieving a scientific knowledge which can offer operational tools for the projec...|$|R
2500|$|Both the Georgian {{language}} and Abkhaz <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> {{high on the}} agenda throughout the following years. Georgians living in Abkhazia protested about discrimination against them {{at the hands of}} the Abkhaz Communist Party élite and demanded equal access to the autonomous structures. Several Georgian intellectuals petitioned Shevardnadze and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to address the situation. During 1981, at least five mass demonstrations took place in Georgia at which the Abkhaz <b>question</b> <b>was</b> raised <b>once</b> <b>again</b> alongside broader issues connected with the defense of Georgian language, history, and culture. The protesters also demanded the release of Avtandil Imnadze, the only person who was arrested in connection with the events of 14 April 1978 for having filmed the student demonstrations in Tbilisi. Although Shevardnadze managed to comply with popular opinion without being punished or reprimanded by the centre, probably due to the success of his economic policy in Georgia, he still sought to neutralise the dissident movement in order to retain his reputation as a successful and loyal Communist leader. Under increasing pressure from the authorities, the national movement suffered a setback in April 1979, when the prominent Georgian dissident, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, was pardoned after having repented his views, admitting his [...] "errors of judgment" [...] on nationwide television. As Gamsakhurdia's close associate, Merab Kostava, refused to surrender, he remained an untainted leader of the Georgian dissident movement until his release in 1987 and his mysterious death in a car crash in 1989. The anti-nationalist measures also included the dismissal of , a popular professor who taught a course on Georgian literature at Tbilisi University and was known for his anti-Soviet feelings. In March 1981, over 1,000 students protested and achieved the restoration of Bakradze to his position. Later that month, large groups of students and intellectuals demonstrated in defence of Georgian national rights and submitted to the Georgian party leadership a document entitled [...] "The Demands of the Georgian People". The petition included proposals to protect the status of the Georgian language, improve the teaching of Georgian history and the preservation of Georgian historical monuments, and protect the Georgians in Abkhazia. Other Georgian protests took place in the town of Mtskheta in October 1981, when 2,000 people demonstrated in defence of their native language. Unrest continued, and, in 1982, intellectuals protested against the arrest of dissenters on trumped-up charges.|$|R
