25|$|The {{choice of}} {{orientation}} of the magnetic field used in the Stern-Gerlach experiment is arbitrary. In the animation shown here, the field is vertical and so the atoms are deflected either up or down. If the magnet is rotated a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn,</b> the atoms will be deflected either left or right. Using a vertical field shows that the spin along the vertical axis is quantised, and using a horizontal field shows that the spin along the horizontal axis is quantised.|$|E
25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, {{there will always be}} an even number of centre squares requiring a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn.</b> Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).|$|E
25|$|The vowels {{fall into}} two sets, the back vowels -a and -o, and the front vowels -e and -i. Each set {{consists}} of a lower vowel, -a or -e, and a higher vowel, -o or -i. In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical, vowel, p-, t-, sp-, are rotated 90 degrees (a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn)</b> counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-, are rotated 180 degrees (a half turn). The lower front-vowel (-e) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (a) syllables, and the high front-vowel (-i) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (-o) syllables.|$|E

2500|$|The glyph {{used today}} in the Western world to {{represent}} the number 1, a vertical line, often with a serif {{at the top and}} sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom, traces its roots back to the Indians, who wrote 1 as a horizontal line, much like the Chinese character [...] The Gupta wrote it as a curved line, and the Nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> to the right, this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the Gujarati and Punjabi scripts). The Nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small. This eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral, but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the Roman numeral [...] In some countries, the little serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke, sometimes as long as the vertical line, which can lead to confusion with the glyph for seven in other countries. Where the 1 is written with a long upstroke, the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line.|$|E

50|$|This {{argument}} was not improved upon for many years. Also, {{it is not}} a constructive proof: it does not exhibit a concrete position that needs this many moves. It was conjectured that the so-called superflip would be a position that is very difficult. A Rubik's Cube is in the superflip pattern when each corner piece is in the correct position, but each edge piece is incorrectly oriented. In 1992, a solution for the superflip with 20 face turns was found by Dik T. Winter, of which the minimality was shown in 1995 by Michael Reid, providing a new lower bound for the diameter of the cube group. Also in 1995, a solution for superflip in 24 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> was found by Michael Reid, with its minimality proven by Jerry Bryan. In 1998, a new position requiring more than 24 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> to solve was found. The position, which was called a 'superflip composed with four spot' needs 26 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1995 Michael Reid {{proved that}} using {{these two groups}} every {{position}} can be solved in at most 29 face turns, or in 42 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns.</b> This result was improved by Silviu Radu in 2005 to 40.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{rotation}} group is nonabelian. That is, {{the order in}} which rotations are composed makes a difference. For example, a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> around the positive x-axis followed by a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> around the positive y-axis is a different rotation than the one obtained by first rotating around y and then x.|$|E
50|$|For a cube of size :Every cube move can be {{considered}} as a permutation. The relationship between the cube state after a move with that before a move can be expressed mathematically using Group Theory to quantify permutations. Since every move can {{be considered}} as a sequence of <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> rotations, it is appropriate to examine what is involved in a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> rotation. Except for the absolute centre cubie for odd size cubes, during the <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> the cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories (also referred to as a 4-cycle movement since four quarter turns will restore the cubies in the specified trajectory to their original positions). A <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> of a 4-cubie set can be represented by three swaps as indicated below where swap 1-2 means the contents of cubicle 1 is swapped with the contents of cubicle 2, etc.|$|E
