It is reasonable to include consideration of quanta appearing or disappearing spontaneously in spacetime due to the most basic laws of conservation, hence, no area in spacetime is devoid of potential addition or subtraction of a least common denominator quanta element, causing [...] "noise" [...] in a given experiment. This could manifest as quantum decoherence in an entangled system, normally attributed to thermal differences in the conditions surrounding each entangled particle considered to be part of an entangled set. Because entanglement is studied intensely in simple pairs of entangled photons, for example, decoherence observed in these experiments could well be synonymous with [...] "quantum noise" [...] as to the source of the decoherence. e.g. If it were possible for a quanta of energy to spontaneously appear in a given field, a region of spacetime, then thermal differences must be associated with this event, hence, it would cause decoherence in an entangled system in proximity of the event.

In coherent quantum controller synthesis and optimization problems, the controller is required to be a physically realizable quantum system. This means that the equations describing the synthesized quantum controller must correspond to a meaningful quantum system. A tractable approach to such problems is to use established classical controller synthesis methods to obtain a classical solution and then modify this solution by introducing <b>quantum</b> vacuum <b>noise</b> channels to obtain a physically realizable quantum controller. <b>Quantum</b> vacuum <b>noise</b> channels in the controller place limits on the achievable controller performance. Hence it is desirable to minimize the number of these noises. The aim of this thesis is to improve on existing methods for implementing physically realizable quantum systems. We give a method to implement a strictly proper, linear time invariant system as a physically realizable quantum system. This method introduces a minimal number of <b>quantum</b> vacuum <b>noises.</b> We also give a condition, under which a strictly proper transfer function can be implemented as a physically realizable quantum system, where the number of introduced <b>quantum</b> <b>noises</b> {{is equal to the}} output dimension.
