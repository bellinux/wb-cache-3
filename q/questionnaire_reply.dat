Therefore, it's necessary to create the conditions that allow the ingestion of food during those periods, namely through the existence of automatic food dispensers. However, the available food and beverages might not always be compatible with a healthy diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate if the food and beverages available in automatic food dispensers in public Ambulatory Care Facilities (ACF) and Hospitals of the Portugal North Health Region were contributing to a healthy diet, during the year of 2007. A questionnaire was elaborated and sent to the Coordinators of the Health Sub-Regions and to the Hospital Administrators. The questionnaire requested information about the existence of automatic food dispensers in the several departments of each health care facility, as well as which food and beverages were available and most sold. Afterwards, the pre-processing of the results involved the classification of the food and beverages in three categories: recommended, sometimes recommended and not recommended. The <b>questionnaire</b> <b>reply</b> ratio was 71 % in ACF and 83 % in Hospitals. Automatic food dispensers were available in all the Hospitals and 86. 5 % of ACF. It wasn't possible to acquire food in 37 % of the health facility departments. These departments were all located in ACF. The more frequently available beverages in departments with automatic food dispensers were coffee, still water, tea, juices and nectars and soft drinks. Still water, coffee, yogurt, juices and nectars and soft drinks were reported as the most sold. The more frequently avaliable food items were chocolate, recommended cookies, not recommended cakes, recommended sandwiches and sometimes recommended croissants. The food items reported as being the most sold were recommended sandwiches, chocolate, recommended cookies, sometimes recommended croissants and not recommended cookies. The beverages in the recommended and sometimes recommended groups were the most frequently available and sold. The not recommended food items were reported as being the most available, while both the recommended and not recommended food items were equally reported as being the most sold.

40|$|A {{simulation}} model developed for prediction {{of the electric}} load profile of a residential area is briefly outlined in the paper. The model based on a "bottom-up" approach in order to reproduce customers' daily behaviour concerning elcctricity usage, has been applied for validation to reproduce load diagrams of a sample residential area where field measurements of power demand arid a combined mail survey had been previously conducted. Since the residential electric load was almost exclusively of the discretionary, weather-independent type, the survey ques tionnairc regarded mainly thc lifestyle of customers, thus evidencing the need for probabilistic processing of the data collected by the survey. To this end customers' presence at home and appliance usage have been considered as normal distributions around a incan value as ensued from the survey data. In the paper, a sensitivity analysis is performed on standard deviation values of the above distributions, which allows quite good matching of recorded data with simulation risults.

A history of wheezing was obtained in 16 · 2 per cent; 1 · 8 percent had had wheezing alone, while the majority (14 - 4 per cent) gave a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Productive cough alone was reported in a further 32 · 5 per cent The parents reported that 17 · 1 per cent of seven-year-old children had {{more than two or three}} colds a year, 5 - 7 per cent had 2 ̆ 7 hay fever’, and 6 - 8 per cent had both. There was a close association between upper and lower respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms ranging from 15 - 5 per cent in those with no lower respiratory symptoms to 60 · 4 per cent in those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Despite considerable overlap, “colds” tended to be associated with productive cough and 2 ̆ 7 hay fever 2 ̆ 7 with wheezing. According to the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies,</b> lower respiratory symptoms were commoner (48 · 6 percent) than upper respiratory symptoms (29 · 6 percent). Episodes of productive cough were longer in duration, less frequent and started later in life than episodes of wheezing.

40|$|Motor imagery (MI) is {{a mental}} {{representation}} of motor behavior {{that has been}} widely used as a control method for a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI based BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate EEG signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is time-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of {{the left or right}} hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22 - 25 years, mean 23. 6 +/- 1. 16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements following the sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain activity. Results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p< 0. 001). <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> indicated that most subjects thought the new paradigm was easier and more comfortable.

Highest risk was found for {{the most common type of}} glioma, astrocytoma, yielding in the> 10 year latency group for mobile phone use odds ratio (OR) = 2. 7, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 9 - 3. 7 and cordless phone use OR = 1. 8, 95 % CI = 1. 2 - 2. 9. In a separate analysis, these phone types were independent risk factors for glioma. The risk for astrocytoma was highest in the group with first use of a wireless phone before the age of 20; mobile phone use OR = 4. 9, 95 % CI = 2. 2 - 11, cordless phone use OR = 3. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 7 - 8. 7. In conclusion, an increased risk was found for glioma and use of mobile or cordless phone. The risk increased with latency time and cumulative use in hours and was highest in subjects with first use before the age of 20...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper presents {{results on the}} impact of regulation on credit unions in Ireland. The researcher seeks to answer following research question. How are credit unions in Ireland regulated and what is the impact of this regulation. To help answer this question it was necessary to simplify the research question further into research objectives. A critical review of the literature identified the answer to {{the first part of the}} question. The Financial regulator now regulates credit unions and the main piece of legislation is the Credit Union Act 1997. Following a review of the possible methods of primary research, it was decided that a questionnaire would be circulated to credit unions in order to determine the answer to the second part of the research question. Based on an analysis of 42 <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies,</b> the findings of this research indicate that credit unions believe that a change in the credit union movement is required and that regulation is both necessary and important. Credit unions also believe that regulation needs to be independent of the credit union movement. The findings of the research also indicate that credit unions feel particular areas within the movement are too restrictive. In particular the areas of investments and lending were evident. When size is the focus for analysis, the evidence provides that large credit unions are more aware of change and that they are more willing to change. This is evident from the fact that so many large credit unions have implemented new policies, procedures and controls. This suggests that large credit unions are more pro-active than small credit unions...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis considered the repercussions in higher education {{of the changes in}} the teaching and learning of mechanics in schools/colleges in England. Within the last decade there has been an abundance of reports detailing concerns about the insufficient mathematical ability of students entenng numerate degree programmes. In 2003, at an Engineering Professors Council meeting, Prof: Mike Savage indicated concern not only about students' knowledge of mathematics upon arrival, but also of mechanics. Thus, this thesis considered if there was now also a mechamcs problem. In this thesis, following a review of pre-university mathematics qualifications, three primary areas were considered: the schools' perspective; students' knowledge of mechanics upon arrival at university; and engineering academics' perspective. In addition, linear multiple regression models were created to predict students' first year performance. In both 2004 and 2006 questionnaires were sent to 497 schools to determine the availability and uptake of specific modules in Mathematics A-levels. Changes detected in these undoubtedly have repercussions for higher education educators lecturing first year students. Questionnaires, interviews and a mechanics diagnostic test were given to engineering students to establish the level to which they had studied mechanics prior to entry to university and to determine what knowledge of mechanics they had. Nearly a third of (1087) <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> gave indication that little or no mechanics had been studied, which has repercussions for those teaching a first year university module in mechanics. Questionnaires and interviews were also used to gain engineering academics' perspective and one of the major issues was found to be a misalignment between expectation and reality. Finally, linear multiple regression models, created to predict students' first year performance, highlighted variables such as a student's mathematics diagnostic test result and whether they made use of the mathematics learning support centre as being important...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Acute {{pelvic pain}} {{is a common}} reason for {{emergency}} room visits that can indicate a potentially life-threatening emergency (PLTE). Our objective here {{was to develop a}} triage process for PLTE based on a self-assessment questionnaire for gynecologic emergencies (SAQ-GE) in patients experiencing acute pelvic pain. Methods: In this multicenter prospective observational study, all gynecological emergency room patients seen for acute pelvic pain between September 2006 and April 2008 completed the SAQ-GE after receiving appropriate analgesics. Diagnostic procedures were ordered without knowledge of <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies.</b> Laparoscopy was the reference standard for diagnosing PLTE; other diagnoses were based on algorithms. In two-thirds of the population, SAQ-GE items significantly associated with PLTEs (P < 0. 05) by univariate analysis were used to develop a decision tree by recursive partitioning; the remaining third served for validation. Results: Of 344 derivation-set patients and 172 validation-set patients, 96 and 49 had PLTEs, respectively. Items significantly associated with PLTEs were vomiting, sudden onset of pain, and pain to palpation. Sensitivity of the decision tree based on these three features was 87. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI), 81 %- 94 %) in the derivation set and 83. 7 % in the validation set. Derivation of the decision tree provided probabilities of PLTE of 13 % (95 % CI, 6 %- 19 %) in the low-risk group, 27 % (95 % CI, 20 %- 33 %) in the intermediate-risk group and 62 % (95 % CI, 48 %- 76 %) in the high-risk group, ruling out PLTE with a specificity of 92. 3 %; (95 % CI, 89 %- 96 %). In the validation dataset, PLTE probabilities were 16. 3 % in the low-risk group, 30. 6 % in the intermediate-risk group, and 44 % in the high-risk group, ruling out the diagnosis of PLTE with a specificity of 88. 6 %. Conclusion: A simple triage model based on a standardized questionnaire may assist in the early identification of patients with PLTEs among patients seen in the gynecology emergency room for acute pelvic pain...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} set up to {{evaluate}} the food panel of a multiple specific IgE antibody assay in 67 atopic asthmatic children by comparing it to the conventional radioallergosorbent test (RAST) and skin-prick tests (SPT) and then comparing the results of these investigations with the parents perceptions of food related problems. Fifteen food specific IgE antibodies were measured using the multiple chemiluminescence assay (MAST-CLA). IgE antibodies to five of these food allergens were also measured by conventional RAST and SPTs were performed in 43 using 11 standardized food extracts matched to the multiple allergosorbent chemiluminescent assay (MASTCLA) profile. SPT and MAST-CLA results showed good agreement with one another, range 688 - 96. 7 % (average 87 %), with significant correlation for most allergens tested. MAST-CLA was discrepant with RAST and/or SPTs in 58 / 210 (27 6 %). A questionnaire was sent to the parents to determine their perception of food related symptoms. Sixty-two (92 %) <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> were received, of which 56 % reported symptoms with food. The most frequent symptom perceived to be due to food intolerance was behavioural disturbance. The commonest foods implicated were additives (39 %), egg (27 %), milk (26 %), chocolate (23 %) and orange (15 %). History, SPT, MAST-CLA and RAST were compared for live allergens in 42 patients (210 values). In 14 / 210 (6 · 7 %), all the tests were negative despite reported symptoms. Conversely in 49 / 210 (23 · 3 %) at least one test was positive without symptoms. This study did not support a benefit of multiple antibody testing instead of individually selected RASTs or SPTs. The frequent perception of food related symptoms in these asthmatic children was often not supported by SPT, RAST and/or MAST-CLA. This may be a reflection of the current public concern about food, or of non-IgE mechanisms. These uncertainties can only be resolved by double blind placebo controlled food challenge. The inclusion of food specific IgE antibodies together with inhalant antibodies in a multiple test system for use in atopic asthmatics may be misleading...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, good {{governance}} {{has been established}} as an overarching concept for the struggle against corruption and abuse of power in both international sports organizations and the hosting of major championships. Still, in Sweden, the concept is {{to a large extent}} unknown. This can partly be {{explained by the fact that}} Swedish sport is weakly represented in international sports organizations, and rarely hosts major sporting events. Further, a strong popular movement tradition and limited commercialization have fostered a notion that Swedish sport has been spared from such economic and democratic problems. However, a new study regarding economy and ethics in local sport clubs indicates the occurrence of financial irregularities and the need for increased awareness of the principles of {{good governance}}. Method The study was conducted by The Swedish National Centre for Research in Sports (CIF) and United Minds as part of CIF’s assignment to monitor government support to sport. A web-based questionnaire concerning financial management and ethics was sent to the treasurers of all local sports clubs within The Swedish Confederation of Sports. 5480 treasurers responded, repre- senting a response rate of 34 percent. A non-response analysis showed that the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> were evenly distributed across the country and that all sports were represented. Results The treasurer’s description of Swedish sports confirms the picture of a non-profit movement with low degree of professionalization and commercialisation. A majority of the sports clubs are small (fewer than 200 mem- bers) and primarily engaged in youth sports. Their turnover is low and member fees are their main source of revenue. Only three out of ten clubs have employees and a majority of the cashiers lack professional experience in the areas of finance and accounting. According to the cashiers, economic irregularities are common among Swedish sports clubs. Most common are unaware irregularities, caused by carelessness, ignorance or stress. But one out of four also state that it is common with conscious financial fouls with the aim to support the clubs non-profit endeavours. Discussion The study indicates a perception in Swedish club sports that financial irregularities can be justified if they serve a good purpose. Increased awareness of Good governance can be an important strategy to counteract such views. References Centrum för idrottsforskning 2014 : 3 Etik och ekonomi i idrottsföreninga...|$|R
