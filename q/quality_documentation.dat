40|$|Introduction. The <b>quality</b> of <b>documentation</b> can {{decrease}} {{because of}} bad admission filling of documentation. Workload {{is one of the}} factor that can influence admission filling of documentation. This study was aimed to analyze the correlation between nurse’s objective workload and the <b>quality</b> of nursing <b>documentation</b> in RSU Haji. Method. The design of this study was descriptive correlation with cross-sectional approach. The population on this study was the nurse that works in Marwah 3 and 4 inpatient care in RSU Haji Surabaya. The number of the sample was 14 respondents were selected by simple random sampling. The independent variable was nurse’s objective workload and the dependent variable was <b>quality</b> of nursing <b>documentation.</b> The data were analyzed by using regression logistic. Result. Nurse’s objective workload in RSU Haji was 72 %. There was no correlational between nurse’s objective workload with the completeness of nursing documentation (P= 0, 999), also nurse’s objective workload with accurate of nursing documentation (P= 0, 999). Discussion. This study concluded that nurse’s objective workload was low and <b>quality</b> of nursing <b>documentation</b> was accurate enough and complete enough. Next researcher should provide precise operational so the factors that affected the <b>quality</b> of <b>documentation</b> can be reached and the workload of the nurses in RSU Haji become ideal.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (hereinafter: CBS) in recent years was to {{establish}} a widely accepted general framework for quality assessment and quality improvement of CBS’s statistical processes and products.

The CBS also established a <b>quality</b> <b>documentation</b> system for statistical products and processes. This diabase of quality information became a key tool for quality assessment, <b>quality</b> <b>documentation</b> and quality reporting for CBS surveys. The database contains an exhaustive list of quality information, {{which is based on}} two widely accepted ESS structures, ESMS and ESQRS, divided in two parts: numerical information (quality indicators) and descriptive (textual) information.

40|$|<b>Documentation</b> <b>quality</b> is of high {{importance}} for any procurement method, however for a managing contract type procurement {{it is particularly}} important as there is limited time to issue and fine tune the finalised drawings for tender without the potential to halt concurrent works. It {{is the quality of}} the finalised documentation during this construction phase that generally dictates the final outcomes of a project. This research adopted a qualitative approach to investigate <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> issues in construction projects. Selected industry professionals in South Australia were interviewed, followed by a case study.

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} This {{research}} aims {{to examine the effects}} of inadequate documentation to the cost management & tendering processes in Managing Contractor Contracts using Fixed Lump Sum as a benchmark. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey was conducted with industry practitioners to solicit their views on <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> issues associated with the construction industry. This is followed by a series of semi-structured interviews with a purpose of validating survey findings. Findings and value The results showed that <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> remains a significant issue, contributing to the industries inefficiency and poor reputation. The level of satisfaction for individual attributes of <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> varies. Attributes that do appear to be affected by the choice of procurement method include coordination, build ability, efficiency, completeness and delivery time. Similarly the use and effectiveness of risk mitigation techniques appears to vary between the methods, based on a number of factors such as documentation completeness, early involvement, fast tracking etc. Originality/value of paper This research fills the gap of existing body of knowledge in terms of limited studies on the choice of a project procurement system has an influence on the <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> and the level of impact. Conclusions Ultimately research concludes that the entire project team including the client and designers should carefully consider the individual projects requirements and compare those to the trade-offs associated with <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> and the procurement method. While <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> is definitely an issue to be improved upon, by identifying the projects performance requirements a procurement method can be chosen to maximise the likelihood that those requirements will be met. This allows the aspects of <b>documentation</b> <b>quality</b> considered most important to the individual project to be managed appropriately...|$|R
