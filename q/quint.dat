5|$|Ann {{believes}} the {{figures to be}} the ghosts of <b>Quint</b> and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved {{in the activities of}} <b>Quint</b> and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as <b>Quint</b> and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between <b>Quint</b> and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront <b>Quint.</b> The pair are scared, but when <b>Quint</b> arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that <b>Quint</b> leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly <b>Quint</b> that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quint,</b> Brody, and Hooper {{set out on}} Quint's boat, the Orca, to {{hunt the}} shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, <b>Quint</b> waits for an {{opportunity}} to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. <b>Quint</b> examines the shark and harpoons a barrel into it, but it drags the barrel underwater and disappears.|$|E
5|$|At nightfall, as {{the three}} swap stories, the great white returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull and killing the power. The men work through the night, {{repairing}} the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but <b>Quint</b> smashes the radio. After a long chase, <b>Quint</b> harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line {{is tied to the}} stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backwards, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment before breaking the cleats off. He then heads toward shore, intending to lure the shark to shallower waters and suffocate it, but the overtaxed engine fails.|$|E
5000|$|The next morning, a shocked Randy {{finds the}} {{grandmother}} dead (after a night with Grandpa Marsh). After telling the <b>quints,</b> {{and with some}} persuasion from Cartman, Stan, and Kyle (who hope to use the <b>quints</b> for their circus, in which their performance is to do some contortions wearing only underpants with the <b>Quints</b> doing their performance), let the <b>quints</b> stay with them. The boys then decide to show the <b>quints</b> how great America is, taking them to, among other things, a sheep-shearing contest and a shopping mall, hoping they'll stay and do their circus. Meanwhile, the Romanian government seek Janet Reno to help get the <b>quints</b> back. Also, seeking to get to Romania for singing training, Kenny sings the aria [...] "La donna è mobile" [...] from Verdi's Rigoletto for {{money in order to}} acquire transport for him and his mother. In Romania, Kenny proves to be a sensational singer, and, after his mother realizes that the small amount of money that she brought from the US provides them with two months of food and housing due to the massive cost of living difference between Romania and the United States, the two decide to stay. Back in the US, the Marsh house is surrounded by protesters, hoping to let the <b>quints</b> stay. Reno dresses as the Easter Bunny and armed with a gun and an Easter Egg-shaped tear gas canister, captures the <b>quints.</b> Stan, Kyle and Cartman, who don't want to lose their circus, enlist the help of the protesters outside to get the <b>quints</b> back.|$|R

5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and <b>Quint</b> return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but <b>Quint</b> is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. <b>Quint</b> plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|Neal Gabler {{analyzed}} {{the film as}} showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by <b>Quint),</b> and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.|$|E
5|$|Their {{first two}} days at sea are {{unproductive}} and they return to port each night. On the third day, Hooper wants to bring along a shark proof cage. Initially <b>Quint</b> refuses, considering it a suicidal idea, but he relents when Hooper offers him a hundred dollars. On the ocean, the shark finally shows up. Hooper guesses the animal {{must be at least}} twenty feet long, and is visibly excited and in awe. After several unsuccessful attempts by <b>Quint</b> to harpoon the shark, Hooper goes underwater in the cage. He resolves to first take photos of the shark, before trying to kill it with a bang stick. However, the shark attacks the cage, and, after ramming the bars apart, kills and eats Hooper.|$|E
50|$|The poor Dionne {{family lives}} in rural Ontario, Canada. The mother, Elzire, collapses {{and goes into}} what {{everyone}} thinks is premature labor. Even though they have no money her husband, Oliva, races to get a doctor. Early {{on the morning of}} May 28, 1934 she gives birth to five daughters, the famous Dionne Quintuplets. The story soon develops into a media frenzy. Radio personality Helena Reid arrives on the scene. Oliva and the other children leave in order to save the <b>quints</b> from infections. After Americans take the lead in providing for the <b>quints,</b> the Ontario government finally starts to provide some assistance. Oliva signs a deal to have the <b>quints</b> displayed at the Chicago World’s fair and he is attacked for this by Helena Reid. The Canadian government moves to take the kids and they all develop high fevers, but are pulled through by Dr. Dafoe. The Ontario government declares the <b>quints</b> wards of the state and Dr. Dafoe is named their guardian. The kids are taken away and placed in a house built just for them across the road. Dr. Dafoe starts to profit from the kids, including taking them on tour. They kids are put on display and the area acquires a circus-like atmosphere. Finally, the parents are only allowed to visit with Dr. Dafoe’s permission. The Dionne parents try to tell their story and in response the government extends the guardianship until the <b>quints</b> are 18. Dr. Dafoe makes tons of cash in endorsement deals for the <b>quints.</b> The Dionnes have a baby boy. The <b>quints</b> are kept on a strict schedule isolated from everyone else and put on display for mobs of tourists, but only one of their nurses disapproves of this and is fired. The parents finally find a lawyer to help them get the girls back. He takes the tack that the <b>quints</b> were only taken away only because the parents were French-Canadians. They get French nurses and teachers hired. The parents get better access. The government finally gets ticked off at Dr. Dafoe excesses and remove him as guardian. Oliva finds out that the <b>quints</b> are paying for all their expenses out of their funds. Helena Reid returns and now sides with the Dionnes. It all comes to a head in a dramatic confrontation when Emilie goes to Dr. Dafoe instead of her mother. Ms. Reid gets Dr. Alfred Adler to condemn the regime that the children are living under. The <b>quints</b> and their parents meet the King and Queen. The guardianship is dissolved and the girls are returned to their parents.|$|R

Karen Prell led the animation team for Wheatley and the other personality cores.|$|E

Corin Redgrave, {{who played}} the professor, {{was the son of}} Michael Redgrave, who starred in The Innocents, a 1961 {{adaption}} of The Turn of the Screw. The children, Flora and Miles, were played respectively by Eva Sayer and Josef Lindsay. However, due to the sexual content of the film, the child actors did not attend the preview screenings.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing <b>Quint.</b> Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the mast, shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E

5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter <b>Quint</b> offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter <b>Quint</b> (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|Despite Spielberg's rejection, {{the studio}} {{went ahead with}} plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month {{pre-production}} process. Howard Sackler, who had contributed to the first film's script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on {{the sinking of the}} USS Indianapolis, the story relayed by <b>Quint</b> in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler's treatment for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea. On Sackler's recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture. Sackler later felt betrayed when Dorothy Tristan, Hancock's wife, was invited to rewrite his script.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, Johns Hopkins {{dominated}} the series, winning 12 of 13 games, including nine {{by an average}} margin of 5.6 points. During this period Hopkins, led by head coach Henry Ciccarone, won three national titles. By 1987, Maryland's fourth-year head coach Dick Edell had helped revitalize the Terrapins as a national power. Maryland posted an 11–0 record during the regular season, where the win over Hopkins, 11–7, was the only game decided by less than six goals. In the NCAA tournament, Maryland defeated Penn in the quarterfinals, 12–8, and advanced to again meet Hopkins in the semifinals. Despite having recorded its first three-loss season in over a decade, and having edged North Carolina in the quarterfinals, the Blue Jays upset the Terrapins, 13–8. Hopkins, led by goalkeeper <b>Quint</b> Kessenich, advanced to win the national title against then undefeated Cornell in the final.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the impact}} of the predatory deaths {{resemble}} Henrik Ibsen's play An Enemy of the People, with the mayor of a small town panicking over how a problem will drive away the tourists. Another source of comparison raised by critics was Moby-Dick, particularly regarding Quint's characterization and the ending featuring a confrontation with the shark; <b>Quint</b> even dies the same way as Captain Ahab. The central character, Chief Brody, fits a common characterization of the disaster genre, an authority figure who is forced to provide guidance to those affected by the sudden tragedy. Focusing on a working class local leads the book's prose to describe the beachgoers with contempt, and Brody to have conflicts with the rich outsider Hooper.|$|E
5|$|Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg {{and based on}} Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it {{with the help of}} a marine biologist and a professional shark hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as shark hunter <b>Quint,</b> Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.|$|E

5|$|Together, the Permanent Members {{form the}} North Atlantic Council (NAC), a body which meets {{together}} {{at least once}} a week and has effective governance authority and powers of decision in NATO. From time to time the Council also meets at higher level meetings involving foreign ministers, defence ministers or heads of state or government (HOSG) and it is at these meetings that major decisions regarding NATO's policies are generally taken. However, it is worth noting that the Council has the same authority and powers of decision-making, and its decisions have the same status and validity, at whatever level it meets. France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States are together referred to as the <b>Quint,</b> which is an informal discussion group within NATO. NATO summits also form a further venue for decisions on complex issues, such as enlargement.|$|E
5|$|When local {{fishermen}} catch a large tiger shark, {{the mayor}} proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes it being the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable great white shark's tooth {{embedded in the}} submerged hull. He drops it after finding a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists fill the beaches. Following a juvenile prank, the real shark enters a nearby estuary, killing a boater and causing Brody's son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody finally convinces a devastated Vaughn to hire <b>Quint.</b>|$|E
