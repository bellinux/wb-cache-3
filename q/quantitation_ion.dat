40|$|AbstractThe {{number of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) that can be purged from human blood {{is so great that}} they cannot be separated completely by capillary gas chromatography. As a result, the single-mass chromatograms used for quantitating the target compounds by mass spectrometry have many interferences at nominal (integer) mass resolution of a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The results of these interferences range from small errors in quantitation to completely erroneous results for the target VOCs. By using a magnetic sector mass spectrometer, these interferences at nominal mass can be removed at higher resolution by lowering the ion chromatogram windows around the masses of interest. At 3000 resolution (10 % valley definition), unique single-ion chromatograms can be made for the <b>quantitation</b> <b>ions</b> of the target VOCs. Full-scan mass data are required to allow the identification of unknown compounds purged from the blood. By using isotope-dilution mass spectrometry, most target VOCs can be detected in the low parts per trillion range for a 10 -mL quantity of blood from which the VOCs have been removed by a purge-and-trap method...|$|R
40|$|Metabolomics {{has been}} {{a useful tool for}} {{biomarker}} discovery, disease mechanism investigation, food safety research, and so on. It aims to unbiased quantification and identification of metabolites existed in body fluids or tissues. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), with its powerful ability for metabolites separation and identification, has been widely used for metabolic investigation. Traditionally, the GC-MS based metabolic investigation can be divided into the non-targeted profiling of the whole metabolome with a full scan MS data acquisition mode and the targeted analysis of the interested metabolites with a selected ion monitoring (SIM) acquisition mode. The full scan based GC-MS profiling method ensures the acquisition of quantitative and qualitative information simultaneously. However, data acquired with this mode have significant low sensitivity than those of SIM mode due to the low scan speed of the quadrupole MS, the most widely used detector of GC/MS instrument. The other kind of GC/MS detector, time of flight (TOF) MS, known for its high scan speed, has narrower dynamic range than quadrupole MS. As the concentration distribution of metabolites in an organism ranges several orders of magnitude, the response of the low or the high concentration metabolites can hardly be acquired quantitatively with a full scan acquisition method. The SIM method with better sensitivity can expand the quantitation limit of the MS detector. Nevertheless, the SIM method based non-targeted profiling method has not been published yet owning to the unknown of SIM targets and their <b>quantitation</b> <b>ions.</b> In this study, a new strategy based on the combination of full scan and SIM acquisition mode was developed for the metabolic profiling analysis. Firstly, the quality control (QC) sample, the mixture of evenly blended equal amounts of the samples to be analyzed, was analyzed using a full scan mode and the metabolites were identified. Then, an algorithm was developed and used for the <b>quantitation</b> <b>ions</b> selection of the initially identified metabolites. In the end, the SIM method was established and the quantitation data of the rest samples were acquired. The retention time locking technique used in the present method ensured the retention time of the eluted components constant in the process of the batch samples analysis so that the SIM time group could be constructed. The method for quantitative ions selection was discussed and the developed method was then compared with the full scan based metabolic profiling method. The comparison result show that the developed method is a better solution for GC-MS based non-targeted profiling. 中国化学会色谱专业委员会Metabolomics {{has been a}} useful tool for biomarker discovery, disease mechanism investigation, food safety research, and so on.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} of using metabolic labeling in quantitative proteomics. The early pooling of samples compared to post-labeling methods eliminates errors from different sample processing, protein extraction and enzymatic digestion. Metabolic labeling is also highly efficient and relatively inexpensive compared to commercial labeling reagents. However, methods for multiplexed quantitation in the MS-domain (or ‘non-isobaric’ methods), suffer from signal dilution at higher degrees of multiplexing, as the MS/MS signal for peptide identification is lower {{given the same}} amount of peptide loaded onto the column or injected into the mass spectrometer. This may partly be overcome by mixing the samples at non-uniform ratios, for instance by increasing the fraction of unlabeled proteins. We have developed an algorithm for arbitrary degrees of nonisobaric multiplexing for relative protein abundance measurements. We have used metabolic labeling with different levels of 15 N, but the algorithm is in principle applicable to any isotope or combination of isotopes. Ion trap mass spectrometers are fast and suitable for LC-MS/MS and peptide identification. However, they cannot resolve overlapping isotopic envelopes from different peptides, which makes them less suitable for MS-based <b>quantitation.</b> Fourier-transform <b>ion</b> cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is less suitable for LC-MS/MS, but provides the resolving power required to resolve overlapping isotopic envelopes. We therefore combined ion trap LC-MS/MS for peptide identification with FTICR LC-MS for quantitation using chromatographic alignment. We applied the method in a heat shock study in a plant model system (A. thaliana) and compared the results with gene expression data from similar experiments in literature...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic assays often {{suffer from}} a lack of {{robustness}} and reproducibility. We here describe a targeted mass spectrometric data acquisition strategy for affinity enriched subproteomes—in our case the kinome—that enables a substantially improved reproducibility of detection, and improved quantification via isobaric tags. Inclusion mass lists containing m/z, charge state, and retention time were created based on a set of 80 shotgun-type experiments performed under identical experimental conditions. For each target protein, peptides were selected according to their frequency of observation and isobaric tag for relative and absolute <b>quantitation</b> (iTRAQ) reporter <b>ion</b> quality. Retention times of selected peptides were aligned using similarity driven pairwise alignment strategy yielding 1. 5 -fold. We also show that a combination of higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with collisional induced dissociation (CID) outperformed pulsed-Q-dissociation (PQD) on the OrbitrapXL. With the CID/HCD based targeted data acquisition approach 10 % more quantifiable target proteins were identified and a 2 -fold increase in quantification precision was achieved. We have observed excellent reproducibility between different instruments, underlining the robustness of the approach...|$|R
40|$|A very {{sensitive}} analytical procedure based on LC-MS for determining trace {{amounts of the}} more relevant poly(naphthalenesulfonate) (PNS) contaminants present in environmental waters is presented. Extraction was performed on a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer resin solid-phase extraction cartridge after addition of ammonium acetate to the sample. Small amounts of ammonium acetate in the mobile phase allowed the determination and characterisation of the four shorter oligomers by liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry, Under such conditions the electrospray process generates fully ionised molecules which greatly simplifies interpretation of spectra and <b>quantitation.</b> Additionally, confirmatory <b>ions</b> can be generated by the in-source collision-induced decomposition process. The effectiveness of the method was assessed in recovery experiments from drinking and river water samples spiked with commercial mixtures of PNS concrete plasticizers also referred as naphthalenesulfonate-formaldehyde condensates. Moreover, the performance of this method was compared to methods using ion-pair chromatography coupled with fluorimetric and mass spectrometric detection. Method detection limits were in the low picomolar range (1 ng/l for the monomer) for each isomer. In order to evaluate the environmental relevance of PNS type compounds waste, river and ground water grab samples were analysed.

Using chromatographic time compression, a single expensive FTICR mass spectrometer can match the throughput of multiple relatively inexpensive ion trap instruments. Liquid chromatography (LC) -mass spectrometry data from {{the two types of}} spectrometers are aligned and combined to hybrid datasets, from which peptides are identified using accurate mass from the FTICR data and tandem mass spectra from the ion trap data.

40|$|We {{present a}} liquid chromatography/mass {{spectrometry}} (LC/MS) method for long-chain and very-long-chain fatty acid analysis and {{its application to}} 13 C-tracer studies of fatty acid metabolism. Fatty acids containing 14 to 36 carbon atoms are separated by C 8 reversed-phase chromatography using a water–methanol gradient with tributylamine as ion pairing agent, ionized by electrospray and analyzed by a stand-alone orbitrap mass spectrometer. The median limit of detection is 5 ng/mL with a linear dynamic range of 100 -fold. Ratios of unlabeled to 13 C-labeled species are quantitated precisely and accurately (average relative standard deviation 3. 2 % and deviation from expectation 2. 3 %). In samples consisting of fatty acids saponified from cultured mammalian cells, 45 species are quantified, with average intraday relative standard deviations for independent biological replicates of 11 %. The method enables <b>quantitation</b> of molecular <b>ion</b> peaks for all labeled forms of each fatty acid. Different degrees of 13 C-labeling from glucose and glutamine correspond to fatty acid uptake from media, de novo synthesis, and elongation. To exemplify {{the utility of the}} method, we examined isogenic cell lines with and without activated Ras oncogene expression. Ras increases the abundance and alters the labeling patterns of saturated and monounsaturated very-long-chain fatty acids, with the observed pattern consistent with Ras leading to enhanced activity of ELOVL 4 or an enzyme with similar catalytic activity.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{different}} aspects of gel free procedures for mass spectrometry based proteome analysis are addressed, with emphasis on labelling techniques. It is based on three original articles where the effects imposed onto peptides upon modification are investigated, {{and the development of}} a new type of labelling strategy is described. Chemical modification has been of great importance for the peptide based proteomics approach, as they provide a way to impose desired properties onto the peptides. One possibility is to improve ionisation efficiency by introducing an easily protonated entity. By strategic placement of such a label, favoured ionisation of certain fragments upon MS/MS analysis can work to simplify the fragmentation spectra, and consequently facilitate their interpretation. In this work, such a charge-directing fragmentation label and its effects using a new type of mass spectrometer was investigated. One of the main applications for the various labelling techniques however, has been the ability to produce isotopic counterparts of peptides, which enables quantification of the sample constituents. Several procedures to accomplish this, using a wide assortment of labels have, and are being developed. The Parent <b>Ion</b> <b>Quantitation</b> Scanning (PIQS) method described in this work, was developed aiming at more efficient global analysis of protein expression levels. The method was constructed to only sample peptides from differentially expressed proteins, thereby alleviating the large amounts of data usually generated, and only targeting relevant information, when aiming for analysis of differences in protein abundance...|$|R
40|$|Polymers {{were used}} to control {{selectivity}} and electroosmotic flow (EOF) in the capillary electrophoretic separation of small ions. Polymers used included cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes, polyethylene glycols, and oligomeric saccharides (cyclodextrins). In the presence of cationic polymers changes in migration order were possible due to ion-exchange interactions with anions. Enhancement of ion-exchange interactions was observed with large electrolyte anions, which could be more easily displaced by analyte species. Although increases in electrolyte concentration and pH led to improvements in resolution their effects on selectivity were minor. In the presence of organic solvents, ion-pairing interactions and changes in analyte/polylectrolyte solvation resulted in different migration orders, which depended on the concentration and solvating properties of the organic solvent. In the presence of cyclodextrins, different migration patterns were observed due to inclusion of relatively hydrophobic anions in the cyclodextrin cavity. Inhibition of such interactions, with an effect on selectivity, was observed {{in the presence of}} hydrophobic electrolyte anions. Depending on polythylene glycol molecular weight and concentration decreases in metal ion/cation migration rates were observed. Larger decreases were observed for species having a large affinity for the polyethylene glycols. Ion-exchange interactions between metal ions and anionic polyelectrolytes were relatively weak and capable of minor analyte differentiation. In the presence of anionic polysaccharides, which can complex metal ions, changes in migration order were observed in agreement with the relative complexing affinity of the metal ions for the dextran moieties. Adjustment of EOF direction and magnitude was possible with different types of polymers. Adsorption of cationic or anionic polyelectrolytes provided for anodal or cathodal EOF respectively, which was stable over a wide range of polyelectrolyte concentration and pH. Large decreases in EOF magnitude were possible depending on polyethylene glycol concentration and molecular weight. Application of the developed methodologies to the separation and <b>quantitation</b> of small <b>ions</b> in real or simulated samples of industrial and environmental significance were also shown...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of gastrin was investigated using cytochemical <b>quantitation</b> of hydroxyl <b>ion</b> production (HIP) in guinea pig gastric oxyntic mucosa. The reaction depends upon the trapping of OH ions produced during gastric stimulation and is blocked by the benzimidazole, Hassle 149 / 94, which inhibits the K+ + H+-ATPase and by acetazolamide, an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase activity. It is thus a measure of hydroxyl ions produced during stimulation of the oxyntic cell and reflects upon hydrogen ion production. Gastrin (2. 5 X 10 (- 16) - 2. 5 X 10 (- 12) M) caused a linear dose-dependent stimulation of HIP in the oxyntic cells. The response was biphasic, with an early peak at 90 s and a secondary rise at 240 s, which persisted for 10 min. Natural human gastrin (sulfated and nonsulfated) and the active COOH-terminal octapeptide fragment of gastrin stimulated HIP, whereas the biologically inert NH 2 -terminal (1 - 13) fragment of gastrin had no effect. The activation of oxyntic cell HIP by gastrin was neutralized by an antiserum directed towards the COOH-terminus of gastrin and not by nonimmune serum. Cimetidine (10 (- 5) M) blocked 25 % and atropine (10 (- 5) M) {{had no effect on}} gastrin-stimulated HIP. EGTA (10 (- 3) M) and LaCl 3 (10 (- 3) M) inhibited the action of gastrin by 67 and 52 %, respectively. The calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine (10 (- 5) M), pimozide (10 (- 5) M), and the naphthalene sulfonamides, W- 7 and W- 13 (10 (- 5) M), inhibited gastrin-stimulated HIP by 45. 6 38. 5, 42. 3, and 37. 2 %, respectively. Higher doses of W- 7 and W- 13 (10 (- 4) M) inhibited gastrin-stimulated HIP by 83 and 67 %. The Ca 2 + ionophore, A 23187 (10 (- 4) M), stimulated HIP. Thus, it appears that gastrin stimulation of HIP is complex. 25 % of its action is via a histamine-dependent pathway. 45 % of its action is dependent upon extracellular Ca 2 +. Its action is also in part dependent upon a Ca 2 +/calmodulin mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Liquid chromatography–mass {{spectrometry}} (LC–MS) with electrospray (ES) ionization in {{the positive}} ion mode {{was applied to}} drug analysis in forensic toxicology. Several types of screening and confirmation strategies were developed, based essentially on searching of comprehensive MS libraries and databases that were created in-house for the purpose. Two spectral libraries, both containing spectra for approximately 400 drugs, were created. Spectra for the LC–MS/in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) library were acquired by continuously switching between low (25  V) and high (90  V) orifice voltages during the run, and the summed mass spectra {{were added to the}} library. A library for liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was created by obtaining product ion spectra at a collision energy of 35  eV, and additionally at 20  eV or 50  eV, if the latter were more informative. The product ion spectra were reproducible in the long-term, based on a four-year experiment. Comparison of two libraries, independently created with similar instruments in different laboratories, showed that the libraries were fully compatible. Comparison of spectra obtained with different manufacturers' instruments suggested that after standardization of collision energy and gas pressure, LC–MS/MS spectral libraries are suitable for interlaboratory use. The libraries were utilized in two fully automated methods for selected drug groups, comprising screening and confirmation. Analysis of 16 β-blocking drugs in urine involved two-step MS analysis, including a screening step based on monitoring of protonated molecules and a confirmation step based on LC–MS/MS product ion spectra. A method for simultaneous screening and quantitation of 18 antihistamine drugs in blood involved multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) for screening and <b>quantitation</b> and product <b>ion</b> spectra for confirmation of the drugs. The antihistamines were identified and quantified at concentrations ranging from subtherapeutic to toxic in blood. A data-dependent experiment (DDE) was utilized for automation of both procedures, from starting the sample batch to printing of the library search results. Two different approaches for comprehensive screening of drugs were developed. A method for simultaneous screening of 238 drugs in blood was developed using LC–MS/MS with multiple-reaction monitoring. Identification was based on RT and the presence of protonated molecule and one representative fragment ion. The method was shown to be sufficiently selective and sensitive to allow the majority of the drugs to be detected at therapeutic concentrations. Another approach was based on accurate mass determination with liquid chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC–MS/TOF), using a target database of monoisotopic masses for 433 drugs. The method was tentatively suitable for rapid screening of drugs in urine even without referral to primary reference standards. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{insights}} {{derived from}} spatial localization of molecules in tissue sections are {{of great value}} for understanding and treating cancer and other diseases. These insights can relate to molecules linked to a disease {{as well as to}} drug molecules distributed across organs of interest. Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging can not only provide the molecular and spatial information of single molecules, but can do so for a broad range of substances, from elements to proteins. In one single measurement, the impact of these molecules in multiple physiological and pathological pathways can be analyzed. The value of MS imaging for cancer research is demonstrated by the insights in tumor malignancy generated with MS imaging in this research. Two breast cancer xenograft models, the nonmetastatic MCF- 7 and highly metastatic MDA-MB- 231 tumors, have been studied with MS imaging in combination with magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). This study focused on the distribution of phosphocholine (PC), total choline (tCho), free choline (Cho), sodium and potassium in the two different tumors. In vivo 3 -dimensional MRSI of MDA-MB- 231 tumors demonstrated that high tCho levels (Cho, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and PC), displayed a heterogeneous spatial distribution in the tumor. MS imaging data provided information about each individual molecule, with increased PC and Cho in viable tumor regions compared to necrotic regions in the highly metastatic MDA-MB- 231 tumor type. The same molecules were homogeneously distributed in the nonmetastatic MCF- 7 tumor type. Also, significant differences in the spatial distribution of Na+ and K+ in the these two tumor types suggested differential Na+/K+ pump functions and K+ channel expressions. The combined results provide a link to the impact of multiple pathways in tumor malignancy in one single study. In drug discovery research, {{it is important to know}} not only in which organs drug and drug metabolites can be found after drug administration, but also how much of drug and metabolites are present in each organ. However, quantification by MS imaging is challenging, with several factors affecting the results of quantitation of drugs in tissue sections. Therefore an experimental setting was specially designed to address the impact of several factors on drug <b>quantitation,</b> such as <b>ion</b> suppression, sample preparation and organ dependence on the mass spectrometric response of the drug using organ homogenates and drugs. Because sample handling is of such importance to the success of MS imaging experiments, a new method was developed for fragile tissue sections and localized washing, which consists of a wetted paper with the solvent of choice applied directly onto the biological tissue surface. The washing solution is spatially contained by the paper structure, thus the formation of a liquid film on the tissue surface is avoided. An additional advantage is that the paper used in the washing step can also be analyzed by MS imaging, providing additional information of components removed from the tissue surface while retaining their spatial organization...|$|R
