500|$|The {{developers}} {{knew that}} for the story they wanted to [...] "throw the player right in the action, with things {{he had to do}} without explanation" [...] in addition to creating a sense of urgency and mystery for the player. They developed an initial draft of the game's plot and gave it to script writer Sachie Hirano and scenario event planner Yukari Ishida to expand on. The returned version was very close to the initial vision for the game's story. However, there were still difficulties in filling out the story, only achieving some smooth development about halfway through the process, and even then, there were still changes made just prior to creating the master image for the game. Several inconsistencies with the game's story were found in the final <b>quality</b> <b>checks</b> that had to be resolved. The Square Enix localization team, while translating most of the dialog and interface items into English and other European languages, preserved many Japanese elements to avoid losing the culture of the game. The team was also limited {{by the size of the}} dialog balloons used within game, and took several steps to avoid losing the meaning of the story within the game.|$|E

A well-defined feature extraction algorithm makes the identification process more effective and efficient. <b>Quality</b> <b>checking</b> {{is one of the most}} prominent steps in many applications using Feature extraction. Several techniques exist for the <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials. However, image based <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials still remains a challenging task. Although trivial <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> methods are available, they do not give useful results in most situations. This paper addresses the issue of <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials using feature extraction techniques with high accuracy and reliability.

The PRT participated in key leader engagements, scouting areas for new projects and performing <b>quality</b> <b>checks</b> and site visits on existing projects. The key focus is on building roads, bridges, construction of schools and also improvements to power capabilities on existing infrastructure. [...] Composed of U.S. Air Force, Army, State Department, and USAID subject matter experts and mentors, the team sought to work closely with key leaders to facilitate development. The vision was to foster a stable and secure environment ready for transition to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan control and administration, and focus on sustainment.|$|E

We focus on supply chain collaboration between a hotel, and its {{food and beverage}} suppliers. The transaction costs found consist of the search cost and cost of <b>quality</b> <b>checking.</b> Search cost exists due to bounded rationality of the firm. This is influenced by asymmetric information. The cost of <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> incurs because the firm perceives that its suppliers may behave opportunistically. It is revealed that trust could reduce transaction cost of the tourist operators...|$|R
