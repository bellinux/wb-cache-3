40|$|I {{suggest that}} {{measurement}} in quantum theory {{should be regarded}} as a sense of time (of things happening), which {{is as important as the}} conventional relativistic notion of time. A key question [...] of basic physical interest whether one accepts the arguments here or not [...] is, What physical criteria determine when a measurement takes place? I suggest a way in which the answer to this may be bound up with the resolution of some pathologies associated with the stress-energy operator, and may at the same time determine the cosmic flow of time. The problem of reconciling the <b>quantum</b> <b>sense</b> of time (measurement) and the conventional relativistic one gives some indication that the the correct "quantization" of gravity is essentially different from that of other fields.

5000|$|The {{black hole}} {{information}} paradox is a puzzle {{resulting from the}} combination of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Calculations suggest that physical information could permanently disappear in a black hole, allowing many physical states to devolve into the same state. This is controversial because it violates a commonly assumed tenet of science - that in principle {{the value of a}} wave function of a physical system at one point in time should determine its value at any other time. A fundamental postulate of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is that complete information about a system is encoded in its wave function up to when the wave function collapses. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that information is conserved in the <b>quantum</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|R

50|$|Quantum imaging, {{is a new}} {{sub-field}} {{of quantum}} optics that exploits quantum correlations such as quantum entanglement of the electromagnetic field in order to image objects with a resolution or other imaging criteria that is beyond what is possible in classical optics. Examples of quantum imaging are quantum ghost imaging, quantum lithography, and <b>quantum</b> <b>sensing.</b> Quantum imaging may someday be useful for storing patterns of data in quantum computers and transmitting large amounts of highly secure encrypted information. Quantum mechanics has shown that light has inherent “uncertainties” in its features, manifested as moment-to-moment fluctuations in its properties. Controlling these fluctuations—which represent a sort of “noise”—can improve detection of faint objects, produce better amplified images, and allow workers to more accurately position laser beams.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "second quantum revolution", or [...] "quantum 2.0" [...] is a {{term that}} {{is often used to}} {{describe}} quantum technologies based on superposition and entanglement. Originally described in a 1997 book by Gerard J. Milburn, which was then followed by a 2003 article by Jonathan P. Dowling and Gerard J. Milburn, as well as a 2003 article by David Deutsch. These technologies use equipment such as highly stabilised laser systems, magneto-optical traps, cryogenic cooled solid state devices, ion traps and vacuum systems to create, manipulate and then use quantum effects for a number of different purposes.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of systems on networks from a linear algebraic perspective. The control theoretic concept of controllability describes the set of states that can be reached for these systems. Our main result says that controllability in the <b>quantum</b> <b>sense,</b> expressed by the Lie algebra rank condition, and controllability {{in the sense of}} linear systems, expressed by the controllability matrix rank condition, are equivalent conditions. We also investigate how the graph theoretic concept of a zero forcing set impacts the controllability property; if a set of vertices is a zero forcing set, the associated dynamical system is controllable. These results open up the possibility of further exploiting the analogy between networks, linear control systems theory, and quantum systems Lie algebraic theory. This study is motivated by several quantum systems currently under study, including continuous quantum walks modeling transport phenomena. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The dynamics, {{appearing}} after {{a quantum}} quench, of a trapped, spin-orbit coupled, dilute atomic gas is studied. The {{characteristics of the}} evolution is greatly influenced by the symmetries of the system, and we especially compare evolution for an isotropic Rashba coupling and for an anisotropic spin-orbit coupling. As we make the spin-orbit coupling anisotropic, we break the rotational symmetry and the underlying classical model becomes chaotic; the quantum dynamics is affected accordingly. Within experimentally relevant time-scales and parameters, the system thermalizes in a <b>quantum</b> <b>sense.</b> The corresponding equilibration time is found {{to agree with the}} Ehrenfest time, i. e. we numerically verify a ~log(1 /h) scaling. Upon thermalization, we find the equilibrated distributions show examples of quantum scars distinguished by accumulation of atomic density for certain energies. At shorter time-scales we discuss non-adiabatic effects deriving from the spin-orbit coupled induced Dirac point. In the vicinity of the Dirac point, spin fluctuations are large and, even at short times, a semi-classical analysis fails. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>sensing</b> is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} constrained optimization problem: maximize the information gained about an unknown quantity using {{a limited number of}} particles. Important sensors including gravitational-wave interferometers and some atomic sensors do not appear to fit this description, because there is no external constraint on particle number. Here we develop the theory of particle-number-unconstrained <b>quantum</b> <b>sensing,</b> and describe how optimal particle numbers emerge from the competition of particle-environment and particle-particle interactions. We apply the theory to optical probing of an atomic medium modeled as a resonant, saturable absorber, and observe the emergence of well-defined finite optima without external constraints. The results contradict some expectations from number-constrained <b>quantum</b> <b>sensing,</b> and show that probing with squeezed beams can give a large sensitivity advantage over classical strategies, when each is optimized for particle number.

40|$|We study a transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in a {{rotational}} reference frame. We {{find that}} the effective Hamiltonian of the TFIM of this system depends on the system's rotation velocity. Since the rotation contributes an additional transverse field, the dynamics of TFIM sensitively responses to the rotation velocity at the critical point of quantum phase transition. This observation means that the TFIM {{can be used for}} <b>quantum</b> <b>sensing</b> of rotation velocity that can sensitively detect rotation velocity of the total system at the critical point. It is found that the resolution of the <b>quantum</b> <b>sensing</b> scheme we proposed is characterized by the half-width of Loschmidt echo of the dynamics of TFIM when it couples to a quantum system S.
