40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a wireless network, where each transceiver {{is equipped with}} a directional antenna, and study two direction assignment problems, determined by the type of antennas employed. Given a set S of transceivers with directional antennas, located in the plane. We investigate two types of directional <b>antennas</b> â€” <b>quadrant</b> <b>antennas</b> and half-strip antennas, and show how to assign a direction to each antenna, such that the resulting communication graph is connected. ...|$|R

Low-Noise Block-converters {{translated}} RF to IF suitable for direct analog-to-digital conversion. Then all telemetry functions were performed digitally via parallel FPGAs for 10 independent sources. Monopulse tracking and optimal diversity combination was performed using 4 <b>antenna</b> <b>quadrants</b> at two orthogonal polarizations. Novel estimation approaches drove digital demodulation, symbol- and bit- synchronization. Final telemetry outputs include: digital, analog (video), and analog IF (e. g., for downlink relay). This program has incubated several concepts that we believe have the combined potential to significantly improve the future of telemetry...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} lobing technique, {{also known}} as monopulse technique, has been widely used for fast target localization and tracking purposes. Many works focused on accurately localizing one or two targets laying within a narrow beam centered around the monopulse antenna boresight direction. In this work, however, a new approach uses the outputs of a four <b>quadrant</b> <b>antenna</b> receiver to rapidly localize two point targets present in the hemisphere. A second set of antennas can be required to localize two targets sharing the same elevation or azimuth angles. To combine the outputs of both antenna sets and enhance the estimation performance of the algorithm, two methods are presented and compared...|$|E
