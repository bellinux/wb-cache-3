50|$|<b>Quinalphos</b> is an organothiophosphate {{chemical}} chiefly {{used as a}} pesticide. It is a reddish-brown liquid. The {{chemical formula}} is C12H15N2O3PS, and IUPAC name O,O-diethyl O-quinoxalin-2-yl phosphorothioate. Ranked 'moderately hazardous' in World Health Organization's (WHO) acute hazard ranking, use of <b>quinalphos</b> is either banned or restricted in most nations. <b>Quinalphos,</b> which is classified as a yellow label (highly toxic) pesticide in India, is widely used in the following crops: wheat, rice, coffee, sugarcane, and cotton.|$|E

30|$|The {{extensive}} {{usage of}} <b>quinalphos</b> in agriculture poses a health hazard because of severe inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in non-target organisms by <b>quinalphos</b> [11 – 15], an adverse influence on blood and brain esterase activity in chickens [16] and fertility efficiency in adult male rats [17] by <b>quinalphos.</b> Exposure of non-target organisms to <b>quinalphos</b> {{in the environment}} depends {{on the extent of}} persistence of <b>quinalphos</b> in natural resources which is, in turn, controlled by factors—abiotic and biotic. Influence of abiotic factors such as sun light, pH and TiO 2 on degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> in natural resources such as soil and water was examined [18 – 22]. Relatively, less attention was paid on biotic factors involved in the fate of <b>quinalphos</b> in natural resources [23]. A definite participation of factors, in particular biotic factors, in the degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> in natural resources such as soil and water can only be demonstrated with the isolation of biotic agents with degradation traits from natural resources. Isolation of Ochrobactrum sp. strain HZM with biodegradation of <b>quinalphos</b> from pesticide-contaminated samples has been recently reported [23]. This organism degraded <b>quinalphos</b> by hydrolysis. Strains of Bacillus thuringiensis appeared to be biotic agents for degradation of fipronil and a wide range of pyrethroids in sugarcane fields [24] and an activated sludge [25]. In view of less understanding of biotic factors in <b>quinalphos</b> degradation, the current study is aimed at isolating bacterial species capable of degrading <b>quinalphos</b> from soil samples collected from horticultural fields and hitting the potential bacterium for assessment of various environmental factors on biodegradation of <b>quinalphos</b> in liquid culture conditions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{extensive}} and intensive uses of organophosphorus insecticide—quinalphos in agriculture, pose a health hazard to animals, humans, and environment {{because of its}} persistence in the soil and crops. However, there is no much information available on the biodegradation of <b>quinalphos</b> by the soil micro-organisms, which {{play a significant role}} in detoxifying pesticides in the environment; so research is initiated in biodegradation of <b>quinalphos.</b> Results A soil bacterium strain, capable of utilizing <b>quinalphos</b> as its sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated from soil via the enrichment method on minimal salts medium (MSM). On the basis of morphological, biochemical and 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the bacterium was identified as to be Bacillus thuringiensis. Bacillus thuringiensis grew on <b>quinalphos</b> with a generation time of 28. 38 min or 0. 473 h in logarithmic phase. Maximum degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> was observed with an inoculum of 1. 0 OD, an optimum pH (6. 5 – 7. 5), and an optimum temperature of 35 – 37 °C. Among the additional carbon and nitrogen sources, the carbon source—sodium acetate and nitrogen source—a yeast extract marginally improved the rate of degradation of <b>quinalphos.</b> Conclusions Display of degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> by B. thuringiensis in liquid culture in the present study indicates the potential of the culture for decontamination of <b>quinalphos</b> in polluted environment sites...|$|E
30|$|Variable {{factors such}} as {{additional}} carbon and nitrogen sources, the size of inoculum density, medium pH, temperature and concentration of <b>quinalphos</b> were examined to optimize the biodegradation of <b>quinalphos</b> by B. thuringiensis.|$|E
30|$|<b>Quinalphos</b> was {{included}} in MSM as the sole source of carbon and energy for the cultivation of a bacterial culture in the current study. The proliferation of bacterial cells on <b>quinalphos</b> occurred in MSM up to 18  h as reflected {{by an increase in}} the viable cell count (Table  1). This indicates the use of <b>quinalphos</b> by bacterial culture as a sole source of carbon.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of various factors on the {{degradation}} of <b>quinalphos</b> by OP 1, appropriate modifications in the supplementation of additional nutrients to MSM and the growth conditions of the bacterial culture on <b>quinalphos</b> were made. For this purpose, MSM was spiked with 20  mg L− 1  of <b>quinalphos</b> and distributed into 250 -mL flasks (100  mL per flask). The flasks were supplemented with an additional carbon source, (glucose or sodium acetate), or additional nitrogen sources, NH 4 Cl, (NH 4) 2 SO 4, urea or yeast extract to a final concentration of 0.01 % (w/v). Flasks were inoculated with the bacterial suspension to get an initial OD of 1.0, and flasks devoid of inoculum were maintained as controls. These flasks were incubated at 37  °C and shaken at 175  rpm in an orbital shaker; samples were collected at 48 -h intervals; and the culture broth was extracted with dichloromethane solvent for residue analysis. The influence of the concentration of <b>quinalphos</b> on its degradation was assessed by growing the bacterial isolate on <b>quinalphos</b> in MSM at different concentrations (20 – 200  ppm) of <b>quinalphos.</b> In another experiment, flasks containing MSM (pH 7.5) were supplemented with 20  mg L− 1 of <b>quinalphos</b> inoculated with the bacterial cell suspension to an initial OD of 1.0 and incubated in a shaker at 175  rpm at different temperatures of 30 – 45  °C to study the influence of temperature {{on the degradation of}} <b>quinalphos.</b> In order to study the effect of pH on <b>quinalphos</b> degradation, OP 1 was cultured as described above and only the pH was varied from a pH of 5.5 – 8.5.|$|E
30|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>quinalphos</b> had no {{influence on the}} degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> by B. thuringiensis in this study (Table  2). Degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> occurred to the extent of 75 % in the culture of B. thuringiensis grown on MSM with the {{concentration of}} <b>quinalphos</b> at 20  mg L− 1 as against 98 % in the same culture with 200  mg L− 1 of <b>quinalphos</b> concentration. No appreciable degradation of <b>quinalphos</b> (1 %) was observed in respective inoculated controls in the corresponding period. This observation of the present study is in agreement with the result of degradation of chlorpyrifos at concentration from 10 to 500  mg L− 1 by Alcaligenes faecalis strain DSP 3 [32]. Anwar et al. [41] reported degradation of chlorpyrifos by B. pumilus C 2 A 1 at even relatively higher concentrations, i.e. 500 and 1000  mg L− 1, to the extent of 90 % after 2  weeks. The prolonged lag phase in the degradation of chlorpyrifos at higher concentration could be due to the time taken for the adaptation of microorganisms to produce the necessary enzymes [42].|$|E

30|$|Organophosphate (OP) {{compounds}} {{are part}} of the most common chemical classes used in the protection of crop and livestock and in the control of diseases transmitted through vectors and account for an estimated 34 % of worldwide insecticide sales [1]. In India, usage of OPs has also gradually been increasing with a consistent decline in application of organochlorines and currently makes up 27 % of the total sales of pesticides [2 – 4]. Andhra Pradesh is the biggest user of crop protection chemicals in India and uses 20 % of the total pesticides in the country [5]. Among OPs, <b>quinalphos</b> (QP: O,O-diethyl O-quinoxalin- 2 -yl phospharothioate) is used widely in agriculture in Andhra Pradesh because of its effective control of all pests over different crops, which is reflected by the 5 % of total sales of pesticides registered against <b>quinalphos</b> [5]. <b>Quinalphos</b> is a synthetic OP, non-systemic, broad spectrum insecticide, and acaricide extensively used in India owing to its action on inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in target pests [6, 7]. Being ranked as moderately hazardous by the World Health Organization (WHO) and classified as a yellow label (highly toxic) pesticide in India, <b>quinalphos</b> is either banned or restricted in its usage in most of the nations [8]. Nevertheless, <b>quinalphos</b> is still being used to treat the following crops: wheat, rice, groundnut, cotton, sugarcane, coffee and other ornamental crops. Only 1 % of the pesticides applied make contact with the target pest, while the remaining 99 % of the pesticide drifts into the environment contaminating soil, water and biota [9, 10]. Accidental spills/leaks occurring during transport and storage of industrial materials and agricultural chemicals have polluted areas that were never intended as sites for waste disposal. Thus, soil and water bodies serve as the ultimate receptacle/reservoir for all kinds of pesticides regardless of whether they are applied intentionally or unintentionally.|$|E
