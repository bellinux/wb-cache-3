5|$|The {{failure of}} Arctic Fox had a {{significant}} impact on the course of the war in the east. Murmansk was a major base for the Soviet Northern Fleet and it was also together with Arkhangelsk the main destination for Allied aid shipped to the Soviet Union. British convoys had traveled to Murmansk since the summer at the onset of the war, but with the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, the influx of Western Allied aid increased massively. The United States enacted the Lend-Lease pact in which they vowed to supply the Soviet Union with large quantities amounts of food, oil, and war materiel. One <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> aid was delivered via Murmansk. This included large amounts of raw materials like aluminum as well as large quantities of military goods for the Soviet war effort, including 5,218 tanks, 7,411 aircraft, 4,932 anti-tank guns, 473 million rounds of ammunition and various sea vessels. Those supplies benefited the Soviets significantly and contributed to their continued resistance.|$|E

25|$|Fiborgtangen {{had about}} 700 {{employees}} during the 1980s. From 1984 {{and the following}} years {{there was an increase}} in newsprint demand. Customers demanded better quality paper, particularly aimed at more advanced offset printing and color printing. To remain competitive Norske Skog needed both to improve quality and cut production costs. This was achieved through the rationalization program NT90, which ran from 1986 through 1991. Total costs reached NOK2 billion. A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was financed through issuing new shares.|$|E

25|$|The 25th Brigade {{was raised}} in July 1940 from AIF {{personnel}} in the United Kingdom. The brigade was created following the Fall of France, initially as a temporary formation that would defend southern England, {{in the event of}} an invasion by German forces. It had an foundational establishment of 1,759 personnel; a majority were drawn from service support corps of the 6th Division, although roughly a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> number were diverted from infantry reinforcements bound initially for AIF units in the Middle East.|$|E
25|$|The {{appropriation}} {{of land for}} both agriculture and mining placed renewed pressure on the Yaquis and other native peoples of Sonora. Previously, active resistance had given the Yaqui fairly autonomous control of {{a portion of the}} state and kept their agricultural system along the Yaqui River. Encroachment on this land led to uprisings and guerilla warfare by the Yaquis after 1887. By 1895, the federal and state governments began to violently repress the Yaquis and forcefully relocate captured Yaquis to the plantations in Mexico’s tropical south, especially the henequen plantations in the Yucatán Peninsula. The Yaqui resistance continued into the 20th century, with the expulsions reaching a peak between 1904 and 1908, by which time about one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> population had been deported. Still more were forced to flee into Arizona.|$|E

500|$|On 9 September 2006, BBC News {{reported}} that the Muslim boycott of Danish goods had reduced Denmark's total exports by 15.5% between February and June. This was attributed to an approximated 50% decline in exports to the Middle East. The BBC said, [...] "The cost to Danish businesses was around 134 million euros ($170m), {{when compared with the}} same period last year, the statistics showed." [...] However, The Guardian newspaper in the UK said, [...] "While Danish milk products were dumped in the Middle East, fervent right-wing Americans started buying Bang & Olufsen stereos and Lego. In the first <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year Denmark's exports to the US soared 17%." [...] Overall the boycott did not {{have a significant effect on}} the Danish economy.|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{interruption}} of Crawford's career by his dispute with Surrey, Neville Cardus wrote: [...] "His break with Surrey must {{be regarded as}} a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself, and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket. It is as certain as anything in a man's life can be confidently postulated, that had he continued to play in English county cricket... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England's captains." [...] The Times commented: [...] "It {{was one of the great}} disappointments of English cricket in the first <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized." [...] Hart observes that Crawford's on-field successes were many up to 1909 but after that, his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket. Hart notes Crawford's [...] "capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses. He could turn games around and agreements over, antagonise the powerful, endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as 'heroic'". He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life [...] "in comparative sporting obscurity". No-one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened, and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography.|$|E

The projected GDP growth rate of 2. 5 % for the year as a whole is primarily a result of a rapid spurt of growth in the latter half of 1983, with the higher level then being maintained, but scarcely improved on, in the first three <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year...|$|R
2500|$|The Native Land Acts of 1862 and 1865 {{established}} the Native Land Court, which {{was intended to}} transfer Māori land from communal ownership into individual household title {{as a means to}} assimilation and to facilitate greater sales to European immigrants. Māori land under individual title became available to be sold to the colonial government or to settlers in private sales. Between 1840 and 1890, Māori sold 95 percent of their land (63,000,000 of [...] in 1890). In total 4% of this was confiscated land, although about a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was returned. 300,000 acres was returned to Kupapa Māori mainly in the lower Waikato River Basin area. Individual Māori titleholders received considerable capital from these land sales, with some lower Waikato Chiefs being given 1000 pounds each. Disputes later arose over whether or not promised compensation in some sales was fully delivered. Some claim that later, the selling off of Māori land and the lack of appropriate skills hampered Māori participation in developing the New Zealand economy, eventually diminishing the capacity of many Māori to sustain themselves.|$|E

The Italian war was then creating an agitation in Europe upon nationality, as to which the people of the Ionian islands were sensitively alive, and the reports would have supplied a good deal of fuel. There was a separate fourth report upon the suppression of disorder in Cephalonia in 1848, which everybody afterwards agreed that it was not expedient to publish.
