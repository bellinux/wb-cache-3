However, the explicit point of view of matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} known protein–protein interactions, other <b>questions</b> <b>arise.</b> Genetic {{diseases}} (e.g., cystic fibrosis) {{are known to}} be caused by misfolded or mutated proteins, and there is a desire to understand what, if any, anomalous protein–protein interactions a given mutation can cause. In the distant future, proteins may be designed to perform biological functions, and a determination of the potential interactions of such proteins will be essential.|$|E
25|$|Animals in {{the wild}} appear to be {{relatively}} free from eating disorders although their body composition fluctuates depending on seasonal and reproductive cycles. However, domesticated animals including farm, laboratory and pet animals are prone to disorders. Evolutionary fitness drives feeding behavior in wild animals. The expectation is that farm animals also display this behavior, but <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> if the same principles apply to laboratory and pet animals.|$|E

25|$|Calculus is {{also used}} to gain a more precise {{understanding}} of the nature of space, time, and motion. For centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving division by zero or sums of infinitely many numbers. These <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> in the study of motion and area. The ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea gave several famous examples of such paradoxes. Calculus provides tools, especially the limit and the infinite series, that resolve the paradoxes.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> {{as to whether the}} tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people may be reluctant to take part in research, and if they do agree to take part, they may not say how much cannabis they actually smoke.|$|E
25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many {{feel that it is}} not fair to encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E

25|$|Because the AMPK {{response}} to exercise decreases with increased training duration, many <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> that would challenge the AMPK role {{with respect to}} biochemical adaptations to exercise and endurance training. This {{is due in part}} to the marked increases in the mitochondrial biogenesis, upregulation of GLUT-4, UCP-3, Hexokinase II along with other metabolic and mitochondrial enzymes despite decreases in AMPK activity with training. Questions also arise because skeletal muscle cells which express these decreases in AMPK activity in {{response to}} endurance training also seem to be maintaining an oxidative dependent approach to metabolism, which is likewise thought to be regulated to some extent by AMPK activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. Difficult <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E

2500|$|This {{statement}} {{summarizes the}} {{role for the}} court envisioned by Originalists, that is, that the Court parses what the general law and constitution says of a particular case or controversy, and when <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> as {{to the meaning of}} a given constitutional provision, that provision should be given the meaning it was understood to mean when ratified.

2500|$|Critics also {{charge that}} {{standardized}} tests encourage [...] "teaching to the test" [...] {{at the expense}} of creativity and in-depth coverage of subjects not on the test. Multiple choice tests are criticized for failing to assess skills such as writing. Furthermore, student's success is being tracked to a teacher's relative performance, making teacher advancement contingent upon a teacher's success with a student's academic performance. Ethical and economical <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> for teachers when faced with clearly underperforming or underskilled students and a standardized test.|$|E

[...] One of those questions is the origin of the shared agricultural vocabulary, and the earliest dates for agriculturalism in areas settled by the Indo-Europeans. Those dates seem to be too late too account for the shared vocabulary, and raise the question what their origin is. In 2016, publications are expected on DNA-analysis of Harappans, which may answer the question to which non-Indian populations they were related.|$|E

Would it help to treat emulations as adolescents {{for a few years}} so that the biological creator would maintain temporary control? Would criminal emulations receive the death penalty, or would they be given forced data modification as a form of [...] "rehabilitation"? Could an upload have marriage and child-care rights? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} {{is devoted}} to Mother Teresa's acceptance of an award from the government of Haiti, which Hitchens uses to discuss her relationship to the Duvalier regime. From her praise of the country's corrupt first family, he writes, [...] "Other <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> … all of them touching on matters of saintliness, modesty, humility and devotion to the poor." [...] He adds other examples of Mother Teresa's relationships with powerful people with what he considers dubious reputations. He quickly reviews Mother Teresa's saintly reputation in books devoted to her and describes the process of beatification and canonization under Pope John Paul II. Finally, he disclaims any quarrel with Mother Teresa herself and says he {{is more concerned with}} the public view of her: [...] "What follows here is an argument not with a deceiver but with the deceived." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the section 404 program, <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> about impacts of the SWANCC ruling on {{other parts of the}} CWA, especially its principal permit program, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program under section 402. It requires permits for pollutant discharges from point sources (industrial facilities and municipal sewage plants) into the nation's waters. Another provision, section 311, concerns liability for oil discharges into the nation's waters. Neither was at issue in this case but might be challenged through extension of the ruling. The January 19 joint Corps-EPA memorandum states that federal implementation of any other CWA provision that involves [...] "waters of the United States" [...] will be governed by the same interpretation that applies to section 404. As a result, federal jurisdiction to require NPDES permits or assess oil spill liability in some isolated waters could be limited. Such impacts will become clearer in time.|$|E
2500|$|Love of God and Love of Neighbor. Two main <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> from {{reflecting}} {{on the nature of}} love and its meaning in biblical faith: is it possible to love God without seeing him, and is it possible for love to be commanded? Before answering the question, it is quickly grounded that one must love their neighbor before they can love God, otherwise they are hypocritical. 1 Jn 4:20 says [...] "If anyone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen". We can, therefore, love God whom we cannot see by loving our neighbor whom we can see. Loving our neighbor is loving God. In the same manner it shows that love can be and is demanded of us. God demands that we love others before we love God so that our love is blameless and pure and not hypocritical.|$|E
2500|$|After the June 5 sentencing, Walton {{said he was}} {{inclined}} to jail Libby after the defense laid out its proposed appeal, but the judge told attorneys he was open to changing his mind"; however, on June 14, 2007, Walton ordered Libby to report to prison while his attorneys appealed the conviction. [...] Libby's attorneys asked that the order be stayed, but Walton denied the request and told Libby {{that he would have}} 10 days to appeal the ruling. In denying Libby's request, which had questioned Fitzgerald's authority to make the charges in the first place, Walton supported Fitzgerald's authority in the case. He said: [...] "Everyone is accountable, and if you work in the White House, and if it's perceived that somehow (you're) linked at the hip, the American public would have serious questions about the fairness of any investigation of a high-level official conducted by the attorney general." [...] The judge was also responding to an Amicus curiae brief that he had permitted to be filed, which had not apparently convinced him to change his mind, as he subsequently denied Libby bail during his appeal. His [...] "order grant the [...] scholars permission to file their brief..." [...] contained a caustic footnote questioning the motivation of the legal academics and suggesting he might not give a great deal of weight to their opinion ... It is an impressive show of public service when twelve prominent and distinguished current and former law professors are able to amass their collective wisdom in the course of only several days to provide their legal expertise to the court on behalf of a criminal defendant. The Court trusts that this is a reflection of these eminent academics' willingness in the future to step to the plate and provide like assistance in cases involving any of the numerous litigants, both in this Court and throughout the courts of this nation, who lack the financial means to fully and properly articulate the merits of their legal positions even in instances where failure to do so could result in monetary penalties, incarceration, or worse. The Court will certainly not hesitate to call for such assistance from these luminaries, as necessary in the interests of justice and equity, whenever similar <b>questions</b> <b>arise</b> in the cases that come before it." [...] Moreover, when the hearing started, [...] "in the interest of full disclosure," [...] Walton informed the court that he had [...] "received a number of harassing, angry and mean-spirited phone calls and messages. Some wishing bad things on me and my family... hose types of things will have no impact... I initially threw them away, but then there were more, some that were more hateful... hey are being kept." ...|$|E
