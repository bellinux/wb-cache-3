During the TRIPS transition period and afterwards the privileged position of an LDC is likely to serve both the ends of meeting survival needs and making economic progress with the supply of reverse-engineered products to home and abroad. However, to capitalize on such privileges, Bangladesh needs to streamline its existing IPR legislation, especially in defining patentable inventions with rigid <b>qualifying</b> <b>clauses,</b> broadening the extent of compulsory licensing and sticking with the TRIPS by adopting flexible interpretation and not going beyond the TRIPS.

40|$|Abstract. Syntactic and {{semantic}} characteristics canonically {{associated with}} main clauses {{do not always}} go together. This paper discusses two puzzling construction types from this perspective: appositive relative clauses (ARCs) and quasi-relatives. I argue that ARCs and appositions are related, and that relativization as such and parenthesis are independent effects. Specifically, an analysis of attributive construal as restrictive relativization of an abstract specific indefinite head explains the syntactically subordinated status of ARCs; on the other hand, the semantic main clause effects attested in ARCs are due to their construal as parenthetical specifications of the anchor, comparable to identificational appositions. Like ARCs, quasi-relatives seem to involve an E-type link with the anchor, but they lack a relative operator, and <b>qualify</b> as main <b>clauses</b> that are either coordinated to the host at the sentence level or inserted as regular parentheticals...|$|R

While without express wording they are presumed not binding between the union and employer, a collective agreement may give rise to individual rights. The test applied by the courts is to ask loosely whether its terms are ‘apt’ for incorporation, and not statements of ‘policy’ or ‘aspiration’. Where the collective agreement’s words are clear, a [...] "last in, first out" [...] rule was held to potentially <b>qualify,</b> but another <b>clause</b> purporting to censure compulsory redundancies was held to sound like it was binding ‘in honour’ only.|$|R

Die Schwerpunkte der Dissertation liegen dabei auf dem in Art. 28 Abs.

His tenure of office, however, was brief. [...] In 1663 a statute was passed requiring all public officials to subscribe a declaration, affirming the duty of passive obedience, and renouncing the solemn league and covenant. Being unable conscientiously to sign the declaration, Dundas sent in his resignation. It was signed by ten of the Judges on 10 November 1663, Dundas being absent. Though the time for signature was extended in his case until 8 January 1664, and then for a further period of eighteen months, and though he was frequently pressed to reconsider the matter, Dundas steadily refused to sign unless he were permitted to <b>qualify</b> the <b>clause</b> in the declaration abjuring the covenant by the words, [...] "in so far as it led to deeds of actual rebellion". The compromise was not accepted, but it was notified to him that if he would sign the declaration as it stood the king would permit him to make reservation in private audience. To this Dundas replied: [...] "If my subscription is to be public, I cannot be satisfied that the salvo should be latent".

40|$|The {{research}} work {{carried out on}} the CP-structure within the cartographic framework {{has led to the}} identification of restrictions in the relative sequence of elements appearing in the left periphery, which on the one hand <b>qualify</b> the <b>clause</b> type or mark the kind of subordination, and on the other attract operators and elements carrying information tied to the speaker's point of view and his individual evaluation of the event. The contributors were asked to identify the precise positions of functional heads already postulated in the literature, or identify new functional projections; the authors were also encouraged to discuss – on the basis of substantial empirical evidence – general or specific parts of the theoretical framework, or to submit the richly articulated CP structure to further typological checking. The universal restrictions on ordering have been discovered in an inductive way; the papers in this volume, even those that appear to be predominantly descriptive, have the empirical value of reinforcing the general hypothesis; new generalizations take form that raise new questions, in general about the relation between form and function, between visible elements (particles, derivational and inflectional morphology) and syntactic phenomena. Although the main aim of the present volume is to promote further research on the rich functional articulation of the highest structural layer of sentence structure, the so-called complementizer system, the papers can be subdivided into two main groups. Some of the papers present evidence in favor of ordering restrictions among projections located within the CP layer proper and analyze their semantic content and syntactic properties (Aboh & Pfau, Badan & Del Gobbo, Hernanz, Lipták, Munaro). Others discuss phenomena that illustrate the evident solidarity among points of the structure that are not adjacent and do not belong to the same 'field' (Damonte, Haegeman, Ledgeway, Poletto & Zanuttini); this is an area that deserves further investigation, and perhaps also new creative hypotheses, concerning the design of the structure as a physical object, in some sense...|$|R
40|$|Shaken baby {{syndrome}} (SBS) ’s shortcomings {{include the}} debatable science behind SBS theory and diagnosis—the questioning {{of which has}} grown more vociferous—and the arguably biased, discriminatory treatment of the accused. Professor Deborah Tuerkheimer notes that the evolving SBS skepticism and contentious debate has resulted in 2 ̆ 2 chaos 2 ̆ 2 in many SBS adjudications and within the medical and biomechanical fields, with the same SBS proponents and opponents continually crusading for and clashing over their beliefs. The issues surrounding the medical and biomechanical components of SBS diagnoses have been repeatedly examined and discussed, and are not {{the focus of this}} Note. This Note recounts those issues primarily to evidence the substantial tension surrounding SBS in the context of misdiagnoses and the treatment of the accused parties. The solution proposed here is to remove the <b>qualified</b> immunity <b>clause</b> in each state’s reporter statute and provide automatic reimbursement for economic damages incurred if any investigation is deemed 2 ̆ 2 unfounded 2 ̆ 2 (meaning the CPS investigation concluded there was no evidence substantiating child abuse).

However, this Note also propose that if there is evidence any medical provider, law enforcement, or CPS personnel acted in bad faith or engaged in ethically suspect behavior, any wrongly accused party may pursue non-economic damages. If there is evidence of manipulation or intentional nondisclosure of medical evidence, or unethical or other forms of unscrupulous treatment of the accused, the strict economic damages cap should be voidable and the medical providers, law enforcement, and CPS personnel would become exposed to non-economic damages claims. This should be determined on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies from}} a synchronic-diachronic {{perspective}} the formal and semantic-discursive properties of adverbial expressions {{with a negative}} quantifier + wonder (henceforth ‘no’ wonder). They are used as mirative qualifiers which assess a proposition as ‘not surprising’, typically motivated by an explicit justification. As a result, the ‘no’ wonder adverbials function in a larger rhetorical structure, within which they convey the ‘causally justified expectedness’ of a state-of-affairs. We point out that in Present-day English, {{there are two types}} of ‘no’ wonder adverbials that are in different ways ‘outside of the clause’ they assess. On the one hand, there are disjunct uses of ‘no’ wonder, which in our data always occur in sentence-initial position, scoping over the following proposition, with the justification either preceding or following the miratively qualified proposition. On the other hand, there is the anaphoric adverbial ‘no’ wonder, which retrospectively qualifies a proposition in a preceding clause or sentence, but is itself part of a separate complex containing the justification. We argue that historically these two adverbial subtypes are related to different multi-clausal patterns involving clauses with be + no wonder: disjuncts to extraposition constructions and anaphoric adverbials to <b>clauses</b> that <b>qualify</b> a preceding <b>clause.</b> We also show that in Present-day spoken data the anaphoric mirative qualifier is prosodically more independent, while the disjunct uses tend to be prosodically integrated with the proposition.

40|$|Should Deut 28, 69 (MT) be {{regarded}} as a subscript to the preceding section of the book or as a superscript for the following section? The general opinion is currently that it is a superscript, in conjunction with Deut 29, 1. 1 It is, however, possible to re-evaluate the current position by using a semantic approach. The verse consists of one sentence with a core - 'lh dbry hbryt - and a subordinate clause (a relative clause) defining the bryt. The method employed is to study all the occurrences of the expression to define the referential meaning of the expression in these cases. With this semantic information as starting point, a new look can be taken at Deut 28, 69. The expression dbry hbryt occurs in Deut 28, 69; 29, 8; II Reg 23, 3 = II Chr 34, 31; Jer 11, 2. 3. 6. 8; 34, 18; Ex 34, 28. The related expression dbry spr hbryt occurs in II Reg 23, 2 + II Chr 34, 30. The only instance where the expression occurs in a nominal sentence is in Deut 28, 69.

40|$|A {{photograph}} of an original painting that reproduces it as faithfully as possible {{can make the}} painting’s image available to a much wider audience than can visiting the museum where the painting hangs. If the painting is in the public domain, then a photographer needs no copyright permission to photograph it, but the question arises whether copyright protects the resulting photograph. In 1998, the court in the Bridgeman Art Library case answered that question in the negative. That decision has been subject to some resistance from museums and art reproduction photographers. And because museums, even without any copyright protection, control access to the paintings themselves, the court’s ruling {{does not necessarily mean}} that making a photo of a public domain painting is significantly easier than before Bridgeman. This article considers anew what protection, if any, should be granted to art reproduction photographs of public domain paintings. It weighs the possible need for incentives to invest in producing such photographs, as well as the impediments that granting exclusive rights in them would present to using the underlying public domain work. Given the incentive and access concerns, it examines whether art reproduction photographs should perhaps receive some sui generis protection against copying, but not complete copyright protection. The article then explores whether Congress could enact a sui generis regime if it were desirable. If art reproduction photographs come within Congress’s Copyright Clause power, then Congress could likely exercise that power to adopt a sui generis regime. But doing so would likely run afoul of international copyright obligations, which could significantly constrain Congress’s ability to grant art reproduction photographs less generous protection than ordinary copyright law. If art reproduction photographs are not proper subjects for protection under the Copyright Clause, Congress would face the question of whether it can use some other constitutional power to grant exclusive rights in works that do not <b>qualify</b> for Copyright <b>Clause</b> protection. The law on that question remains quite unclear, but constitutional constraints, like international ones, might preclude the adoption of a sui generis regime for art reproduction photographs. In sum, international and constitutional constraints might limit Congress either to providing full copyright protection or no protection at all—possibly equally unattractive options for mediating the incentive and access interests at stake...|$|R
60|$|De Maistre {{has been}} surpassed by no thinker {{that we know}} of as a defender of the old order. If anybody could rationalise the idea of supernatural {{intervention}} in human affairs, the idea of a Papal supremacy, the idea of a spiritual unity, De Maistre's acuteness and intellectual vigour, and, above all, his keen sense of the urgent social need of such a thing being done, would assuredly have enabled him to do it. In 1817, when he wrote the work in which this task is attempted, the hopelessness of such an achievement was less obvious than it is now. The Bourbons had been restored. The Revolution lay in a deep slumber that many persons excusably took for the quiescence of extinction. Legitimacy and the spiritual system that was its ally {{in the face of the}} Revolution, though mostly its rival or foe when they were left alone together, seemed to be restored to the fulness of their power. Fifty years have elapsed since then, and each year has seen a progressive decay in the principles which then were triumphant. It was not, therefore, without reason that De Maistre warned people against believing 'que la colonne est replacée, parcequ'elle est relevée.' The solution which he so elaborately recommended to Europe has shown itself desperate and impossible. Catholicism may long remain a vital creed to millions of men, a deep source of spiritual consolation and refreshment, and a bright lamp in perplexities of conduct and morals; but resting on dogmas which cannot by any amount of compromise be incorporated with the daily increasing mass of knowledge, assuming as the condition of its existence forms of the theological hypothesis which all the preponderating influences of contemporary thought concur directly or indirectly in discrediting, upheld by an organisation which its history for the last five centuries has exposed to the distrust and hatred of men as the sworn enemy of mental freedom and growth, the pretensions of Catholicism to renovate society are among the most pitiable and impotent that ever devout, high-minded, and benevolent persons deluded themselves into maintaining or accepting. Over the modern invader it is as powerless as paganism was over the invaders of old. The barbarians of industrialism, grasping chiefs and mutinous men, give no ear to priest or pontiff, who speak only dead words, who confront modern issues with blind eyes, and who stretch out a palsied hand to help. Christianity, according to a well-known saying, has been tried and failed; the religion of Christ remains to be tried. One would prefer to <b>qualify</b> the first <b>clause,</b> by admitting how much Christianity has done for Europe even with its old organisation, and to restrict the charge of failure within the limits of the modern time. To-day its failure is too patent. Whether in changed forms and with new supplements the teaching of its founder is destined to be the chief inspirer of that social and human sentiment which seems to be the only spiritual bond capable of uniting men together again in a common and effective faith, is a question which it is unnecessary to discuss here. 'They talk about the first centuries of Christianity,' said De Maistre, 'I would not be sure that they are over yet.' Perhaps not; only if the first centuries are not yet over, it is certain that the Christianity of the future will have to be so different from the Christianity of the past, as to demand or deserve another name.|$|R
