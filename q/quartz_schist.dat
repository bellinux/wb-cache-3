40|$|<b>Quartz</b> mica <b>schist,</b> {{which is}} a highly {{anisotropic}} metamorphic rock, usually presents a geotechnical challenge in construction projects. To ensure a safe and economical design, a comprehensive in situ and laboratory investigation scheme is necessary for projects {{to be built in}} <b>quartz</b> mica <b>schist.</b> In this study, such a comprehensive laboratory study of the engineering behavior of <b>quartz</b> mica <b>schist</b> has been carried out. The P-wave velocity tests, tensile and uniaxial compressive strength tests, and creep deformation tests conducted on specimens with differently oriented schistose planes all reveal the strong anisotropic characters of the rock. The relevant crack-initiation stress and crack-damage stress analysis in uniaxial compression test, which has not been previously applied to studying schistose rock, has been performed in the present study. When loading is parallel to schistose planes, crack initiation stress and crack damage stress are lower than those in other loading directions. As the compressive loading is applied parallel to schistose planes, local tensile stresses are preferentially induced normal to the relatively weak schistose planes. Cracks are thus easier to develop than in any other loading directions. Since schistose plane orientation {{is one of the key}} factors to control the formation of macro-cracks and hence failures of unloading test specimens, these engineering geological characters should be taken into consideration in engineering design. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|In the Sambagawa schist, {{southwest}} Japan, while ductile deformation pervasively {{occurred at}} D 1 phase during exhumation, low-angle normal faulting was locally intensive at D 2 phase under {{the conditions of}} frictional-viscous transition of quartz (c. 300 ℃) during further exhumation into the upper crustal level. Accordingly, the formation of D 2 shear bands was overprinted on type I crossed girdle quartz c-axis fabrics and microstructures formed by intracrystalline plasticity at D 1 phase in some quartz schists. The quartz c-axis fabrics became weak and finally random with increasing shear, accompanied by the decreasing degree of undulation of recrystallized quartz grain boundaries, which resulted from the increasing portion of straight grain boundaries coinciding with the interfaces between newly precipitated quartz and mica.

The Rio Preto Group, involved in the eponymous fold-thrust belt along the northwestern cratonic boundary, comprises the Formosa (garnet schist, quartz-mica schist, quartzite, chlorite-sericite schist and ferriferous <b>quartz</b> <b>schist)</b> and Canabravinha (quartzite, micaceous quartzite, metarhytmite, phylite, schist and metaturbidite) formations. The Santo Onofre Group occurs exclusively in the Paramirim corridor, and is composed of quartzite and minor carbonaceous or Mn-rich phylite. These units record sedimentation in shallow to deep-water marine settings related to rift basins, and were deformed and metamorphosed under greenschist facies conditions during the Brasiliano orogeny. Here we present 427 new detrital zircon U-Pb ages, which constrain the maximum depositional ages of ca. 971 Ma for the Santo Onofre Group, ca. 912 Ma for the Canabravinha Formation, and ca. 965 Ma for the Formosa Formation of the Rio Preto Group. Our data suggests that the Santo Onofre and the Rio Preto Groups accumulated in two distinct basin settings. The latter, composed mostly of sandy rocks, would represent a relatively stable, shallow-marine shelf environment. The Rio Preto Group, with metadiamictite, quartzite, pelitic and rhythmitic rocks, represents a shallow to deep marine environment influenced by gravity flows. Both groups were probably deposited in the Late Tonian, and are potential correlatives of the lower (pre-glacial) units of the Macaúbas Group of the Araçuaí belt...|$|E
