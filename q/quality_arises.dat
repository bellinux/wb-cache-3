6000|$|In 1855, at {{the close}} of this period of nine years, there {{appeared}} a collection of fifty-one poems entitled Men and Women. In [...] "fundamental brain power," [...] insight, beauty, and mastery of style, these poems show Browning at the highest level of his poetic achievement. It is in these remarkable poems that he brought to perfection a poetic form which he practically invented, the dramatic monologue, a form in which there is but one speaker but which is essentially dramatic in effect. The dramatic <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> partly from the implied presence of listeners whose expressions of assent or dissent determine the progress or the abrupt changes of direction of the speaker's words. In [...] "Andrea del Sarto," [...] for example, Lucrezia's smiles and frowns and gestures of impatience are a constant influence, and the poem presents as vivid an interplay of personalities as any scene in a drama. But the implied listener is hardly more than a secondary dramatic element, the chief one being that the speaker talks, as do the characters in a play, out of the demands of the immediate experience, gradually and casually disclosing all the tangled web of influence, all the clashes of will with destiny, of desire with convention, that have led to the crisis depicted. Fra Lippo Lippi gives no consecutive history of his life, only such snatches of it as partially account for his present mad freak, but the strife between his own nature and instinct {{on the one hand and}} the conventions and traditions of religious art on the other could hardly be more vividly presented. In a Balcony, the one drama in Men and Women, has but a fragment of a plot, but in intensity, reality, and passion it excels most of Browning's dramas, and, in spite of its long speeches, has proved effective on the stage.[5] In variety of theme, subject-matter, and verse-form, the poems of Men and Women defy classification. Whatever page one turns, there is something novel, stimulating, captivating. All of Browning's Florentine interests are represented here--his love of old pictures and little-known music, his delight in Florence, Venice, Rome, in all Italy, her skies and her landscapes, the vagrants of her streets, her religious ceremonies, her church dignitaries, her scholars. Then there are love-poems in all tones and tempers, the noblest of them all, [...] "One Word More," [...] being Browning's most direct and personal tribute to his wife. And we see in its keenest form his intellectual delight in subtle disquisition. The doctrine of immortality as it appeals to the mind of the cultured, dissatisfied pagan Cleon; the miracle of Lazarus as it is brooded over by the Arab physician Karshish; the balancing of faith and doubt in the clever casuistry of Bishop Blougram--these are topics to Browning's taste and are treated with skill and mastery. Taken all in all these poems give to the reader a full impression of Browning's characteristic force, the darting, penetrating power of his phrase, the rush and energy and leap of his thought. It is by Men and Women, the somewhat similar Dramatis Personæ, and the earlier Dramatic Lyrics and Dramatic Romances, that Browning is most widely and most favorably known.|$|E
50|$|According to National Family Health Survey-3, {{the private}} medical sector remains {{the primary source}} of health care for 70% of {{households}} in urban areas and 63% of households in rural areas. Reliance on public and private health care sector varies significantly between states. Several reasons are cited for relying on private rather than public sector; the main reason at the national level is poor quality of care in the public sector, with more than 57% of households pointing to this as the reason for a preference for private health care. Most of the public healthcare caters to the rural areas; and the poor <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> from the reluctance of experienced health care providers to visit the rural areas. Consequently, the majority of the public healthcare system catering to the rural and remote areas relies on inexperienced and unmotivated interns who are mandated to spend time in public healthcare clinics as part of their curricular requirement. Other major reasons are distance of the public sector facility, long wait times, and inconvenient hours of operation. The study conducted by IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics in 2013, across 12 states in over 14,000 households indicated a steady increase in the usage of private healthcare facilities over the last 25 years for both Out Patient and In Patient services, across rural and urban areas.|$|E

He unlocks its senses one by one, beginning with smell, as the sense that contributes least to human knowledge. At its first experience of smell, {{the consciousness of the}} statue is entirely occupied by it; and this occupancy of consciousness is attention. The statue's smell-experience will produce pleasure or pain; and pleasure and pain will thenceforward be the master-principle which, determining all the operations of its mind, will raise it by degrees to all the knowledge of which it is capable. The next stage is memory, which is the lingering impression of the smell experience upon the attention: [...] "memory {{is nothing more than a}} mode of feeling." [...] From memory springs comparison: the statue experiences the smell, say, of a rose, while remembering that of a carnation; and [...] "comparison is nothing more than giving one's attention to two things simultaneously." [...] And [...] "as soon as the statue has comparison it has judgment." [...] Comparisons and judgments become habitual, are stored in the mind and formed into series, and thus arises the powerful principle of the association of ideas. From comparison of past and present experiences in respect of their pleasure-giving <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> desire; it is desire that determines the operation of our faculties, stimulates the memory and imagination, and gives rise to the passions.

50|$|Seeds stored {{hermetically}} {{have shown}} to exhibit prolonged quality. Researches in Ghana investigated {{the effectiveness of}} storing seeds using three different types of grain storage. The three methods used in the research included the jute, polypropylene and triple layer hermetic storage. Two destructive insects pests, Adult Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus were infested in each bag. These two insects pests are common in Africa and are very destructive to maize. Unprotected maize in storage can be totally annihilated by these organisms. Of these three methods, the triple layer hermetic storage offered outstanding results of seed quality with prolonged germination rate and viability despite insect infestation. Additionally, to ensure that grain maintains its natural quality in storage, {{it has to be}} stored at optimal moisture contents of approximately 12 -14% and preferably low moisture content. The bags have to be sealed for the entire period of storage and regular check ups need to be down to ascertain that the seal remains intact i.e. very air tight bags. Another study investigated the efficacy of controlling bean pests i.e. Acanthoscelides obtectus on the quality of beans by employing the hermetic storage system (silo bags and plastic bottles) and non-hermetic glass containers. Beans were stored at high moisture contents of 15%, temperature 25 C and relative humidity 70± 5%. In the study the hermetic method showed no alteration in quality.Deterioration in grain <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> from several factors (1) high moisture content at the time of storage. High grain moisture content promotes development of molds which renders the grains unusable or unsafe for consumption. (2) failure to keep storage bags air tight from oxygen which would otherwise accelerate insect infestation leading to total destruction of grain. In this phenomenon, hermetic conditions are not met to secure the grain from insects. (3) Failure to keep the bags water tight to prevent moisture infiltration, (4) high temperatures leading to grain discoloration and largely insect infestation.|$|E

Organizations adopting cloud services expect not only improvements in flexibility and scalability, {{but also a}} means of outsourcing IT tasks. In contrast to custom or packaged applications, {{software as a service}} offerings help to reduce the technical expertise required to provide the necessary IT resources. Software quality models help organizations to assess the state of their application systems and have been subject to research for a couple of decades. However, the stakeholder of the existing quality models is mainly concerned with the internal structure of software components. With the shift towards cloud based service offerings, a different conception of <b>quality</b> <b>arises.</b> Current quality models consider resource owner and provider as a single entity. Thus, most of the quality characteristics covered in the models reflect the internal view of a software service.

40|$|Quality ’ {{features}} in all initiatives for better regulation {{launched by the}} OECD and the European Union. Yet policy-makers {{who have tried to}} import RIA from its original Anglo-Saxon context to other European contexts have found it difficult to scratch below the surface of new public management rhetoric and implement successful RIA programmes. One reason for that is that the notions of quality that circulate in the current debate are insensitive to context. This paper argues that quality is intrinsically linked to four dimensions of context. The first (obvious) dimension deals with the role played by the institutional and administrative context in the diffusion of RIA. The paper shows some non-obvious implications of this dimension. The second dimension is territorial. In the European Union, the territorial dimension of RIA is associated to multilevel governance. Quality in this context is the challenge of coordination (and when useful competition) of RIA systems that operate at two (domestic and EU) and often three (sub-national, national, and EU) different levels of governance. The third contextual dimension refers to the theory of the policy process. The fourth dimension of <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> out of the problematic (and often misunderstood) balance between methodology, efficiency, and legitimacy. The conclusion is that success may be more difficult to achieve than it seems at first glance, but a realistic assessment of context improves the chances of getting significant results. 1...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to extend these results to speakers with laryngeal pathologies and to conduct tests using connected speech in addition to sustained vowels. Breathiness ratings were obtained from a sustained vowel and a 12 -word sentence spoken by 20 pathological and 5 nonpathological talkers. Acoustic measures were made of (a) signal periodicity, (b) first harmonic amplitude, and (c) spectral tilt. For the sustained vowels, a frequency domain measure of periodicity provided the most accurate predictions of perceived breathiness, accounting for 92 % of the variance in breathiness ratings. The relative amplitude of the first harmonic and two measures of spectral tilt correlated moderately with breathiness ratings. For the sentences, both signal periodicity and spectral tilt provided accurate predictions of breathiness ratings, accounting for 70 %- 85 % of the variance.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the response of complex structural systems requires {{the description of the}} material constitutive relations by means of an appropriate material model. The level of abstraction of such model may strongly affect the quality of the prognosis of the whole structure. In context to this fact, it is necessary to describe the material in a convenient sense as exact but as simple as possible. All material phenomena of crystalline materials e. g. steel, affecting the behavior of the structure, rely on physical effects which are interacting over spatial scales from subatomic to macroscopic range. Nevertheless, if the material is microscopically heterogenic, it might be appropriate to use phenomenological models for the purpose of civil engineering. Although constantly applied, these models are insufficient for steel materials with microscopic characteristics such as texture, typically occurring in hot rolled steel members or heat affected zones of welded joints. Hence, texture is manifested in crystalline materials as a regular crystallographic structure and crystallite orientation, influencing macroscopic material properties. The {{analysis of}} structural response of material with texture (e. g. rolled steel or heat affected zone of a welded joint) obliges the extension of the phenomenological material description of macroscopic scale by means of microscopic information. This paper introduces an enrichment approach for material models based on a hierarchical multiscale methodology. This has been done by describing the grain texture on a mesoscopic scale and coupling it with macroscopic constitutive relations by means of homogenization. Due to a variety of available homogenization methods, the question of an assessment of coupling <b>quality</b> <b>arises.</b> The applicability of the method and the effect of the coupling method on the reliability of the response are presented on an example...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how a {{disadvantaged}} context {{impacts on}} secondary school organisation and processes, {{and how this}} affects quality, as measured by OFSTED inspection. OFSTED data indicates a school quality problem in disadvantaged areas. This is often interpreted as arising from factors internal to the school. Policy interventions have concentrated on generic school improvement measures. However, it may be argued that if poor <b>quality</b> <b>arises</b> from context {{as well as from}} internal factors, policy responses should also be contextualised. Earlier work (Gewirtz 1998; Thrupp 1999) has begun to reveal process effects of disadvantaged contexts. This thesis builds on that work by exploring differences between disadvantaged areas, making an explicit link to quality measures, and using wider literatures from the fields of neighbourhood studies and organisation theory to develop an understanding of schools as contextualised organisations. The thesis begins with a quantitative analysis of context/quality relationships, but is principally based on four qualitative case studies. These consider context objectively, analysing socio-economic, market and institutional factors, and also explore staff’s subjective interpretations. Process implications for schools are examined, as are the schools’ responses, in terms of the design and delivery of schooling. These findings are discussed in relation to OFSTED quality measures. The research reveals that the quality problem in poor areas is partly an artefact of the inspection system but also reflects contextual effects. It also finds that there are significant differences between the contexts of schools in disadvantaged areas, and that these are not captured by typical context measures. The study concludes that changes are needed in school funding and inspection to recognise contextual effects, and that specific practices need to be developed to enable school improvement in poor areas. Relying on schools to apply generic ‘good practice’ within existing constraints will not be sufficient to eliminate the quality problem. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
