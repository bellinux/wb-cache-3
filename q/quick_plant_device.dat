40|$|The {{underlying}} {{reason for}} mechanizing tree planting in southern Sweden is the biologically good planting results produced by today's tree planting machines. Nevertheless, {{the productivity of}} these tracked excavators with crane-mounted tree <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> is too low for them to compete economically with manual planting. The objective of this thesis was to investigate concepts for 1) seedling packaging, 2) base machines, 3) <b>planting</b> <b>devices,</b> and 4) seedling carousels that could cost-efficiently increase the productivity of today's planting machines in southern Sweden. Article I analyzed the cost-efficiency of two seedling packaging concepts that decrease {{the time needed to}} reload <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> with seedlings. The analysis showed, however, that machine-specific seedling packaging was costlier than delivering the seedlings in their cultivation trays, although band-mounted seedlings will probably be the most flexible and cost-efficient packaging system as mechanized planting becomes more common. Article II and III used a discrete-event simulation tool and detailed terrain, machine, and <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> models to simulate the productivity of conceptual two-armed excavators and multi-headed crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices.</b> Two arms per excavator proved to be an inefficient concept for increasing the productivity of today's planting machines when compared to multi-headed <b>planting</b> <b>devices.</b> Although four <b>planting</b> heads per <b>device</b> was the most productive configuration on easy to moderate terrain, three-headed devices were best at combining high productivity with acceptable silvicultural results on all terrain types. Article IV used a test-rig to study the feasibility of tray-wise seedling reloading on today's most common <b>planting</b> <b>device.</b> Seedling reloading was twice as fast when done tray-wise rather than seedling-wise, and deplugging proved to be a reliable method of extracting seedlings from suitable cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. Overall, this thesis confirms that there is high potential for technical improvements that increase the productivity and lower the planting costs of today's tree planting machines. Such improvements will likely include faster seedling reloading via tray-wise-loaded carousels or band-mounted seedlings, multi-headed <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> that produce high quality planting spots using adapted soil preparation methods, and sensors that aid the operator in choosing microsites...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} at the CSIR-Crops Research Experimental station at Kumasi Ghana {{to determine the effects}} of seed sorting and <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> on yield of maize in the 2014 major growing season. Two jab planters were used to plant sorted and unsorted seeds. The control treatment was cutlass planting of unsorted seed. One of the jab planters was imported from China and the other was fabricated in Ghana. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with 3 replications. Planting one hectare of maize with the Chinese planter took about 10 hours 36 minutes the local planter took 12 hours 39 minutes whilst cutlass took 29 hours 36 minutes. Seed sorting and <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> had no significant effect on maize yield. However it was faster cheaper and economically more viable to plant with jab planter than with cutlass...|$|R

40|$|On Nordic clearcuts, today’s tree {{planting}} machines produce high-quality but costly regenerations. Much of {{this high}} cost {{is attributable to}} the planting machines’ low productivity. One promising way of raising productivity is to lessen the time spent manually reloading seedlings onto the carousels of crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices.</b> Using MagMat, a carousel test-rig designed by engineering students, we studied how much faster tray-wise seedling reloading is on the Bracke Planter compared to reloading with today’s seedling-wise-loaded carousel. The MagMat test-rig held eight Hiko cultivation trays from which seedlings were deplugged individually and dropped into the planting tube. The time study confirmed that seedling reloading was on average twice as fast with MagMat compared to today’s seedling carousel, thereby increasing assumed planting machine productivity by 8 - 9 % depending on the <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> used. MagMat’s cost-efficiency was analysed to be particularly reliant on its added investment cost, mechanical availability and how quickly trays can be switched automatically. Nevertheless, MagMat’s field performance illustrated the overall potential of tray-wise loading compared to piecewise seedling loading for increasing the productivity of crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices.</b> Also, deplugging {{proved to be a}} reliable method of extracting seedlings from the rigid, copper-painted Hiko cultivation trays even when performed at the excavator’s boom-tip during mounding work. We conclude that, rather than piecewise seedling loading, tray-wise loading combined with deplugging seedlings from suitable cultivation trays is a reliable and much more time-efficient method to feed seedlings on probably any type of tree planting machine...|$|R
40|$|Mechanized tree {{planting}} {{is presently}} enjoying a revival in Fennoscandia with increased focus on further technical development. To explore the productivity effect of multiple heads on crane-mounted tree <b>planting</b> <b>devices,</b> {{we used a}} discrete-event simulation tool in which excavator-mounted one- to four-headed devices reforested clearcuts with variable frequencies of obstacles. During the simulations, the device models either mounded or inverted soil and then planted seedlings. A planting head could be hindered by stones and roots from performing these tasks, thus causing queuing delays for multi-headed devices. Surface boulders, stumps, and humus layers also slowed down the work. The results showed that productivity increased significantly with increasing numbers of planting heads on terrain with sparse or moderate obstacles, regardless of using faster or slower soil preparation methods or seedling reloading systems. However, on obstacle-rich terrain, three-headed <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> were more productive than four-headed, while one-headed were as equally productive as twoheaded devices. Obstacle-rich terrain sometimes inhibited those large four-headed <b>devices</b> from <b>planting</b> even one seedling at a given machine stationary point. Therefore, we conclude that three planting heads per cranemounted device {{seems to be the}} most realistic configuration for combining high productivity with good silvicultural results on all the terrain types that a planting machine might work on in Fennoscandia. Future studies should investigate the silvicultural effects of different tree spacing geometries and the corresponding suitable geometrical design of three-headed crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

40|$|When reforesting clearcuts in {{southern}} Sweden, the Bracke Planter has shown to plant seedlings with better planting quality than operational manual tree planting (Ersson and Petersson 2011). Consequently, {{there is an}} increasing demand for intermittently advancing tree planting machines with crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> {{in southern}} Sweden. Nevertheless, regardless of using one- (Bracke Planter) or two-headed <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> (M-Planter), today’s average planting machine productivity is still too low (Rantala and Laine 2010, Ersson et al. 2011) for planting machines to cost-wise compete with manual tree planting in southern Sweden (Ersson 2010). There is, therefore, a need to develop new planting machines concepts that are significantly more productive on Nordic terrain, i. e. clearcuts on moraine soils with varying prevalences of stones and stumps where the slash has been harvested for bioenergy. For over 40 years, simulation studies have proven useful for testing prospective forest machine concepts (e. g. (Sjunnesson 1970)), including different types of planting heads (Andersson et al. 1977). In particular, simulations studies can nowadays help to cost-efficiently evaluate new ideas before real world implementation (Jundén 2011). However, previous forest machine simulations simplified terrain characteristics like stumps, roots and stones {{to the extent that}} these models are too simplistic for meaningful planting machine simulations. For this reason, we have built several terrain, base machine and <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> models for use during discrete-event simulations to test potential solutions that realistically might increase Nordic planting machine productivity. These simulations were performed using a simulator built with the SimPy discrete-event simulation language (Jundén 2011). TERRAIN MODELS Presently, our terrain models encompass stumps, roots and underground stones. To delineate the clearcuts, we used Herlitz’s (1975) type stands for clearcutting. These type stands also provided theinput data necessary for sizing and spatially allocating the stumps. To all stumps, we attached a root plate according to the deterministic data from Björkhem et al. (1975) and a stochastic root architecture inspired by Kalliokoski et al. ’s (2010) root models. As concluded already during the 1960 s (Bäckström 1978), the presence of non-visible, underground stones and boulders is what makes mechanized reforestation on moraine soils so difficult. To model this difficulty, we used parameter values from Andersson et al. (1977) to define incidences of stones and boulders (boulder quota or stoniness) and mean stone sizes. Then, we chose an exponential distribution to link stone frequency to stone diameter. In accordance with Eriksson and Holmgren (1996), our modelled stones are spherical in shape and are spatially allocated in a random manner. BASE MACHINE MODELS Today’s planting machines use excavators as base machines. If using standard components, it might be techno-economically feasible to add another arm to the excavator; thereby creating two- (Fig. 2) or four-headed planting machines where planting head interdependence is minimized. We hypothesized that the productivity of two-armed planting machines, compared to normal one-armed machines, might especially be higher on obstacle-rich terrain since one arm could be free to move while the other arm is busy working. Moreover, two-armed machines might particularly benefit from additional task automation. Preliminary results, however, show that this productivity increase might not be high enough to warrant further development of our two-armed planting machine concept. PLANTING DEVICE MODELS We modelled today’s two most common <b>planting</b> <b>devices,</b> the one-headed Bracke Planter and the two-headed M-Planter. During simulation, the planting machine operator searches sequentially for microsites free from visible obstacles (stumps and main lateral roots). However, both devices can be impeded by underground roots or stones during mounding, and by stones during the planting phase. Striking obstacles with the M-Planter can result in delays for one or both heads. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT We are currently expanding the terrain models to include humus layers and surface boulders, on which new multi-headed <b>planting</b> <b>device</b> concepts (with two to four planting heads) with obstacle-avoiding capabilities are being tested. Those simulation results will provide guidance as to how future crane-mounted <b>planting</b> <b>devices</b> should behave and be designed in order to increase planting machine productivity...|$|R
