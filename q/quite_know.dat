5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
500|$|Construction of Yamato {{began in}} secrecy at the Kure naval base in 1937. She was {{completed}} {{soon after the}} Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, but had already been rendered obsolete by the Japanese themselves after their successful carrier-based attacks at Pearl Harbor and elsewhere. Yamato, the largest battleship in the world, with nine 18.1-inch guns {{with a range of}} over 22 miles, became, {{in the words of a}} [...] Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reviewer, a [...] "70,000-ton white elephant the Japanese did not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what to do with".|$|E
500|$|Although Alice in Chains {{has been}} labeled grunge by the {{mainstream}} media, Jerry Cantrell identifies the band as primarily heavy metal. He told Guitar World in 1996, [...] "We're {{a lot of different}} things... I don't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what the mixture is, but there's definitely metal, blues, rock and roll, maybe a touch of punk. The metal part will never leave, and I never want it to". The Edmonton Journal has stated, [...] "Living and playing in Seattle might have got them the grunge tag, but they've always pretty much been a classic metal band to the core." ...|$|E

500|$|Nicholas Shakespeare {{stated that}} part of Chatwin's impact was that his work was {{difficult}} to categorise and it helped [...] "set free other writers... conventional boundaries. Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist. ("I don't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> {{the meaning of the}} word novel," [...] he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, [...] "He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable." ...|$|E
500|$|Hughes first {{pitched the}} series {{to the network}} through Mike Lazzo at Adult Swim {{sometime}} after late 2009, after producing a video mixtape that would be projected behind musical performers for the network's 2010 Carnival Tour event. He compiled footage for the mixtape using the Prelinger Archives, as well as various online sources, and applied visual effects to them [...] "until you didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what you were looking at." [...] He originally imagined for it to exist as a [...] "bizarre collection" [...] of Internet and archival footage intertwined with clips from Adult Swim shows, [...] "set to good music." [...] He ultimately had to omit the latter material, however, as the network {{would still have to}} acquire licenses for their own series in derivative works. He found that once they were gone, [...] "the show really opened up." ...|$|E
500|$|Daphne {{is one of}} {{the twelve}} {{original}} characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. When it came to casting, Waston had initially wanted actress Rebecca Gibney to play the role. However, she joined the cast of children's television series Zoo Family instead. Elaine Smith had previously made several small appearances in various established television series. In 1984, she came in to Neighbours to audition for a guest role and her short, spiky haircut caught the attention of the casting director. Smith told Hilary Kingsley, author of Soap Box, [...] "The casting director of Neighbours was looking some outrageous image for Daphne, this stripper – he didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what, but my haircut was it!" [...] Smith revealed that the idea of playing a stripper amused her and quipped that Daphne was the only stripper who never had to take her clothes off.|$|E

500|$|Greno and Howard wanted Flynn to {{be funny}} and sarcastic as opposed to snarky. One {{occasion}} in particular involved an animator having Flynn respond to Rapunzel's excitement by simply walking away from her in silence. The directors did not like this because, according to Greno, Flynn [...] "did this reaction where [...] treated her like she's nuts". Although both directors agreed that Flynn's reaction was funny, Greno and Howard wanted the characters to [...] "connect" [...] emotionally during this scene. Screenwriter Dan Fogelman said that Flynn is [...] "at his best ... when he's playing little mind games with other people and entertaining himself along with them", likening him to English actor Cary Grant. Fogelman concluded, [...] "At his heart, he's really kind of a lost soul who doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what he wants and who he is." [...] Howard cited fictional characters Ferris Bueller and Indiana Jones as influences because these characters, like Flynn, [...] "are skilled but have a human side to them". Flynn is considered an antihero because [...] "He is quick-witted and agile, stealing to survive" [...] and [...] "he is also extremely narcissistic".|$|E
500|$|Her {{performance}} in The Dreamers led Ridley Scott to cast Green in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), {{a film about}} the Crusades where she played Sibylla of Jerusalem. Green performed six screen tests and was hired only a week before principal photography began. Green found the atmosphere of coming onto a film so late tense and exciting, and she liked the film's ambiguity in approaching its subject matter. To her disappointment, much of her screen time was cut. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised her performance: [...] "She doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> {{what to do with}} her character's stilted dialogue, but she carries herself so regally that you barely notice." [...] Nev Pierce of the BBC, however, called her character [...] "limp". Green was satisfied when her character's complex subplot was restored in the director's cut. Total Film said the new scenes completed her performance: [...] "In the theatrical cut, Princess Sibylla sleeps with Balian and then, more or less, loses her mind. Now we understand why. Not only does Sibylla have a young son, but when she realizes he's afflicted with leprosy just like her brother Baldwin, she decides to take his life shortly after he's been crowned king." ...|$|E
500|$|When [...] "talkies" [...] {{began to}} gain {{momentum}} in the film industry, the Hollywood studios recruited the best talent from Broadway to make musical films. These films included Broadway Melody, which was promoted as the first [...] "all singing, all talking, all dancing" [...] film and had music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, and Berkley's 42nd Street, his first major success. These films established the backstage musical, a subgenre in which the plot revolves around a stage show and {{the people involved in}} putting on the show. These first musicals set the standard for the genre, placing their musical numbers either {{within the context of a}} stage performance or tacked on and gratuitous, without furthering the story or developing the characters. Donen stated that he disliked them and that his own films were [...] "a reaction against those backstage musicals." [...] Donen credits producer Freed as the driving force behind the transition, adding that Freed [...] "had some sort of instinct to change the musical from a backstage world into something else. He didn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what to change it into, just that it had to change." [...] Kelly stated that Donen was the only person he knew that understood how musicals could progress and better suit the film medium.|$|E

500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out {{the corner of his eye}} and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E
500|$|Bleed Like Me {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 18 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair rated the album a B+, complimenting the [...] "humongous hooks", and Kerrang! gave Bleed Like Me 4 out of 5, describing {{it as the}} [...] "most exciting, touching, and most painfully human material they’ve put out in years". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke awarded the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, writing that [...] "the first two-thirds of Bleed Like Me is easily the best sustained run of studio Garbage since the opening half of their 1995 debut", but that the final tracks had [...] "a samenessa feeling of roaring in circles". Sal Cinquemani of Slant also awarded it three and a half stars out of five; he praised the new sound and wrote that [...] "a few of the songs ("Run Baby Run" [...] and [...] "Right Between the Eyes" [...] in particular) have all the right ingredients but lack the venom present on the group's first two releases". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Bleed Like Me three stars out of five, writing that the album was enjoyable if outdated in its musical approach [...] "as if the band doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> how to do anything else but sound like it's the heyday of post-grunge alt-rock." [...] This opinion was shared by Yahoo! Music's Sharon O’Connell, who wrote that despite the intelligent songs with expertise in [...] "muscly, alt. rock lick or the bubblegum pop hook", Bleed Like Me [...] "strikes a depressingly dated note".|$|E
500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being twisted into poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. You may not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. But one thing is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|As one {{experiment}} {{to test for}} personal survival of bodily death, in the 1960s Stevenson set a combination lock using a secret word or phrase {{and placed it in}} a filing cabinet in the department, telling his colleagues he would try to pass the code to them after his death. Emily Williams Kelly told The New York Times: [...] "Presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which {{there seemed to be a}} word or a phrase that kept being repeated—I don't <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> how it would work—if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested."

A possible influence to the album was Adams' involvement of the six-city [...] "Amnesty International Conspiracy of Hope" [...] tour in 1986. Adams says in the [...] "Into the Fire" [...] songbook that the album's title track refers to a man who is at a crossroads and does not <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> what to do with his life, which is how Adams felt when he started recording the album after the massive success of Reckless.|$|E
2500|$|Young's {{grandfather}} was a pioneer rancher in the Texas Panhandle. Young was the third of four children (John Stinson Young, b. 1890; Kenneth Moody Young, b. 1893; Robert Ralph Young, b. 1897; Florence Edith Young Exum, b. 1904) born to David John Young and the former Mary Arabella Moody in Canadian, the seat of Hemphill County in the eastern Panhandle. He {{was born in a}} house built by Temple Lea Houston, youngest son of Sam Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas and a later governor of Texas.

2500|$|Christopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had {{not killed}} or {{attacked}} an American: [...] "Moore asserts that Iraq under Saddam had never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never <b>quite</b> <b>know</b> whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, {{or even if}} that would be humanly possible." [...] Hitchens writes that Palestinian terrorists Muhammad Zaidan and Abu Nidal had been free to {{move in and out}} of Baghdad, and that Saddam's armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first Gulf War. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein's regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: [...] "That isn't what I said. Quote the movie directly. Murdered. The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen." [...] His narration is reproduced verbatim in The Official Fahrenheit Reader, including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.|$|E
