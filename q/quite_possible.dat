5|$|Finally, it is <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> {{that the}} sail or hump {{combined}} these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, {{being used to}} cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating. It is <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> that the sails or humps of these dinosaurs were used for courtship, in a way similar to a peacock's tail. Stromer speculated that males and females may have differed {{in the size of the}} neural spine.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now <b>quite</b> <b>possible,</b> even in real time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the root of the quarrel between Cnut and Malcolm lies in Cnut's pilgrimage to Rome, and the coronation of Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, where Cnut and Rudolph III, King of Burgundy had the place of honour. If Malcolm were present, and the repeated mentions of his piety in the annals make it <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> that he made a pilgrimage to Rome, as did Mac Bethad mac Findláich ("Macbeth") in later times, then the coronation would have allowed Malcolm to publicly snub Cnut's claims to overlordship.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} ankylosaur osteoderms was {{published}} in 2000, and reviewed the armour of Struthiosaurinae. The group was represented by the single genus Struthiosaurus, known from head, cervical, dorsal, sacral, and caudal scutes. Only a few head osteoderms were identified, so it is unknown {{how much of the}} skull was armoured. Many cervical and dorsal scutes have been preserved alongside species of Struthiosaurus. They include cervical bands, which are groups of osteoderms fused together and attached to the vertebrae, and large spines found on the shoulders of nodosaurids like Sauropelta and Edmontonia, although it is not known if the spines were fused like the later of separate like the former. It is <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> that small ovoid scutes found on Struthiosaurus could have formed a pelvic shield like polacanthids. The caudal scutes of struthiosaurines are small and rough. Even though osteoderms are well-known, it is not certain where they were positioned on the body.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium {{in the body}} mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution is <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E
5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and it is <b>quite</b> <b>possible</b> that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him {{for the rest of his}} life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the exciton states in two coupled {{conjugated}} polymer chains which are modeled individually by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian and coupled by an interchain electron-transfer term. Both the intra- and interchain long range Coulomb interactions are taken into account. The properties of the lowest symmetric and antisymmetric exciton states are extensively discussed for both the parallel and anti-parallel ordering between these two chains. It is found that, for these two kinds of ordering, the features of excitons are <b>quite</b> different. <b>Possible</b> implications for the experiment of luminescent polymers are also addressed. 2 I...|$|R
50|$|The writer {{seems to}} have begun by {{confusing}} Saint Placidus with the earlier Placitus or Placidus, who, with Euticius and thirty companions, was martyred in Sicily under Diocletian, their feast occurring in the earlier martyrologies on 5 October. Having thus made Saint Placidus a martyr, he proceeds to account for this by attributing his martyrdom to Saracen invaders from Spain - an utter anachronism in the sixth century but <b>quite</b> a <b>possible</b> blunder if the Acta were composed after the Moslem invasions of Sicily. The whole question is discussed by the Bollandists.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{some possible}} ways {{how to improve}} Olympiads in Informatics. Tasks in Olympiads are small models of programming tasks in software industry and in the limited amount of competition time contestants need to complete several software production phases – coding, testing and debugging. Currently, only coding effort is adequately graded, but grading of other activities may be improved. Ways to involve contestants in overall testing process are investigated and ways to improve solution debugging process are described. Possible scoring schemas are discussed. In International Olympiads tasks with real numbers are <b>quite</b> rare. <b>Possible</b> reasons are investigated and a way how to return such tasks back to competition arena is suggested...|$|R

Trim brakes are present just before the next turn, which leads to the first drop; however, these are rarely used. Even if the brakes are working, the car launches itself into the steep first drop, with the proximity of the structure giving a real feeling of speed.|$|R
50|$|There are two <b>quite</b> {{separate}} <b>possible</b> origins for the surname MacLaren. One {{of these}} {{comes from the}} county of Perthshire while the other comes from the island of Tiree in Argyll. In Argyll the MacLaren family {{is said to be}} descended from Fergus MacErc, founder of the kingdom of Dál Riata. In Scottish Gaelic the clan name is Clann Labhruinn. However the ancestor of the MacLarens is generally given as Laurence, Abbot of Achtow in Balquhidder, who lived during the thirteenth century. Balquhidder was part of the ancient princedom of Strathern whose heraldry is shown in the heraldry of the MacLarens. The heraldry borne by the clan suggests that they descend from a cadet branch of the dynasty of the Earls of Strathearn.|$|R
