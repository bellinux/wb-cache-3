5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as writings on law and administration.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Espejo's {{first three}} works was the {{intellectual}} improvement of Quito. El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system {{maintained by the}} clergy. Espejo argued {{that the people of}} Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way. Marco Porcio Catón exposed the ignorance of the pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and affectation. All three works caused polemic.|$|E

5|$|The source {{material}} {{comes from the}} works of three Roman historians, who were all born after the events of 52 AD. Suetonius (c.69–75 to after 130, probably writing around AD 121), and Cassius Dio (around 155–164 to after 229, probably writing 200–22) both wrote about the event and quoted the phrase. Tacitus (c.56–117, writing from around 98 to 117) mentions the event but does not <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> phrase.|$|E
5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is largely because the band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|Yichang was keen for {{his eldest}} son to gain a basic {{education}} rooted in Confucianism, the dominant moral ideology of Chinese society; he deemed a knowledge of Confucian teaching to be essential in allowing his son to develop key business and administrative skills. His hope was that Zedong would gain an apprenticeship with a Xiangtan rice merchant before taking over the family business and supporting his parents during their old age. Yichang was particularly adamant {{on the need to}} learn about Confucianism after losing a lawsuit over a parcel of land; he believed that his opponent had been victorious in the dispute {{as a result of their}} ability to <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> sayings of ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius throughout their argument.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
25|$|White House staffers {{exchanged}} email {{with religious}} advisors about biblical passages, settling on the Book of Job and Psalms 46.

25|$|Schneerson {{would finish}} almost every public talk of his {{with a prayer}} for the {{imminent}} arrival of the Messiah. As early as the 1970s, he sought {{to raise awareness of}} the Messianic age by encouraging people to learn and become knowledgeable in the laws of the Holy Temple, laws that will only apply when the Messiah actually comes. In this connection, he quoted from earlier rabbinic opinion that learning about the redemption would raise awareness of and could actually bring the Messiah sooner. Rabbi Schneerson would frequently <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> many sages who stated that this generation was the last generation of the exile and would be the first generation of redemption and would <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Chafetz Chaim and others, who stated that actively asking for the Messiah's coming is crucial.|$|E

25|$|In this field, for {{historical}} reasons it is customary to <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> helium-4 fraction by mass, symbol Y, so that 25% helium-4 means that helium-4 atoms account for 25% of the mass, {{but less than}} 8% of the nuclei would be helium-4 nuclei. Other (trace) nuclei are usually expressed as number ratios to hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E

25|$|Linear {{magnification}} M is {{not always}} the most useful measure of magnifying power. For instance, when characterizing a visual telescope or binoculars that produce only a virtual image, one would be more concerned with the angular magnification—which expresses how much larger a distant object appears through the telescope compared to the naked eye. In the case of a camera one would <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> plate scale, which compares the apparent (angular) size of a distant object {{to the size of the}} real image produced at the focus. The plate scale is the reciprocal of the focal length of the camera lens; lenses are categorized as long-focus lenses or wide-angle lenses according to their focal lengths.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
25|$|Why {{does the}} Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not <b>quote</b> <b>the</b> magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E
