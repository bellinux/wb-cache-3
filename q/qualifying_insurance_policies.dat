Most recently, Fondren founded DelphX, a new SEC-regulated Alternative Trading System.|$|R
50|$|An uninsured {{motorist}} clause is {{a provision}} {{commonly found in}} United States automobile <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> that provides for a driver to receive damages for any injury he or she receives from an uninsured, negligent driver. The owner of the policy pays a premium to the insurance company to include this clause. Although not exclusive, this coverage is typically added to an automobile <b>insurance</b> <b>policy.</b> In {{the event of a}} <b>qualifying</b> accident, the <b>insurance</b> company pays the difference between what the uninsured driver can pay and what the injured driver would be entitled to as if the uninsured motorist had proper insurance.|$|R

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are {{traditionally}} classified as unilateral or “reverse-unilateral” contracts, a characterization we find largely incorrect, with problematic consequences for adjudication of insurance coverage disputes. In {{addition to the}} general difficulties attending the unilateral classification, the concept as applied to <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> is not only unhelpful but incorrect. <b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are more accurately viewed as bilateral contracts. In addition, the unilateral characterization of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> introduces error and inconsistency into the litigation of insurance controversies. In particular, the unilateral view tends toward excessive formalism and focus on so-called “conditions” precedent to coverage, eschewing material breach analysis and encouraging needless forfeitures as well as unwisely removing the concept of anticipatory repudiation and corresponding remedy from insurance law. Categorizing <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> as unilateral fails to appreciate the ongoing, iterative nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and the insurer-policyholder relationship. Recognizing the bilateral nature of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> holds substantial potential for improving insurance coverage adjudication...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The {{treatment}} of life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> in deceased estates {{and the effect}} thereof on marriages in community of property {{is the cause of}} various problems for executors. In terms of section 3 (3) of the Estate Duty Act 45 of 1955 life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets of the deceased. Consequently life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the estate duty addendum of the deceased estate. Life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> however are not always reflected in the liquidation account of the deceased estate as assets, notwithstanding the fact that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are deemed to be assets for estate duty purposes. In this regard a distinction should be made between two situations: firstly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured estate and secondly where life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured. For spouses married in community of property this creates a problem especially when you keep in mind that life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are in many instances a person's biggest monetary asset. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has a claim on half of the policy proceeds. When life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are not reflected in the liquidation account of the insured, the surviving spouse has no claim on the policy proceeds. The problem that arises in this regard {{is that there is no}} certainty as to what extent life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should be included in the calculation of estate duty, and how these policies must be reflected in the estate of the deceased. This uncertainty has been perpetuated by courts. This research will illustrate how the courts came to different conclusions where the facts were more or less similar. Master...|$|R

40|$|Many {{insurance}} law commentators believe that judges should regulate {{the substance of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> by refusing to enforce <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> terms that are exploitive or otherwise unfair. The most common guide for the judicial regulation of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> is the 2 ̆ 2 reasonable expectations doctrine, 2 ̆ 2 which requires courts to disregard coverage restrictions that are beyond insureds 2 ̆ 7 reasonable expectations unless the insurer specifically informed the insured about the restriction {{at the time of}} purchase. This Article argues that although the judiciary has a potential role to play in policing <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> terms, that role should not be defined by reference to consumers 2 ̆ 7 reasonable expectations. Instead, by drawing on the parallels between <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and ordinary consumer products, this Article advances a products liability framework for understanding how and why courts should regulate <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> It proposes that, just as firms that make defective products must pay for the resulting injuries, insurers that issue 2 ̆ 2 defective 2 ̆ 2 <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> should have to provide coverage to insureds. The Article argues that the usefulness of the analogy to products liability law goes well beyond understanding the normative basis for the judicial regulation of <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> Products liability law offers important insights into how courts can efficiently correct failures in insurance markets by encouraging effective disclosure to consumers and appropriately setting penalties so that insurers take an optimal amount of care in drafting policy terms...|$|R

25|$|The insured {{receives}} a contract, called the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> which details the conditions and {{circumstances under which}} the insured will be financially compensated.

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are {{classified}} as a species of contract. Although this characterization is correct, it is unduly narrow if used as the exclusive lens for assessing <b>insurance</b> <b>policies,</b> which are not merely contracts but also are designed to perform particular risk management, deterrence, and compensation functions important to economic and social ordering. Recognizing this has significant implications regarding {{the manner in which}} <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are construed in coverage disputes and suggests that policy construction can be improved by not only performing traditional contract analysis of disputed policies but also by appreciating the particular function of the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> in question as part of the insurance product’s larger role as a social and economic instrument or institution. This insight is in some tension with the predominately text-centered approach to <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> construction and suggests that much of the contract-based resolution of <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> disputes is based on an unduly crabbed view of contract law as well as an impoverished view {{of the degree to which}} the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> is not only a contract and not only a product or a type of private legislation but also part of a web of socioeconomic organization that attempts to manage risk in prudent ways.

40|$|Abstract – The global {{insurance}} industry provides investment and supportive insurance services such as: motor/vehicle, fire, home, personal accident, product liability, public liability and professional indemnity. These services are very beneficial to private individuals and companies and critically {{depend on the}} actual factors and risks involved in the <b>insurance</b> <b>policy.</b> There are risks involved in taking up or embarking on <b>insurance</b> <b>policies.</b> To analyse all the factors involved in providing insurance to individual or companies is a difficult and time consuming job. Through a design-based research approach, this paper therefore proposes an Underwriting Expert System Advisor (UESA) that allows a less experienced individual judge a particular <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> before endorsement. The proposed UESA helps an individual calculate all factors and risks involved in taking on a particular <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> and advices which policy is best to be chosen in accordance to the individual’s interests and finance ability. From an insurance perspective of Ghana, the UESA in the paper examines three <b>insurance</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive assessment of premiums, reserves and solvency capital requirements (SCRs) {{for long-term care}} (LTC) <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> using Activities of Daily Living and US data. We compare stand-alone <b>policies,</b> whole life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> with LTC benefit riders (LTC insurance combined with whole life insurance), life care annuities (LTC insurance combined with annuities) and shared LTC insurance in terms of net premium cost and SCRs. Net premiums and best-estimate reserves for base LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> are determined using Thiele’s differential equation. Product features such as the elimination period and the maximum benefit period are compared using a simulation-based model. We show how a maximum benefit period can reduce costs and risks for LTC insurance products. SCRs for longevity risk and disability risk {{are based on the}} Solvency II standard formula. We quantify the extent to which whole life <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> with LTC benefit riders and life care annuities provide lower SCRs than stand-alone LTC <b>insurance</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R
