25|$|In 2011 about 2.5billion {{people did}} {{not have access to}} a proper toilet and onebillion defecate outside. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the poorest access to toilets. Pit latrines are often {{promoted}} by government agencies and NGOs in rural areas as a low-cost <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> solution (even in areas where other types of toiles, such as dry toilets, might be the better solution for example due to high groundwater table).|$|E
25|$|Though still {{a matter}} for debate, the {{indemnity}} deal has complicated the question of ultimate blame. For decades the Government and Department of Education were to blame for lack of oversight, {{various parts of the}} Catholic Church refused to reform internal systems, the police generally ignored complaints, and the courts sent small children to the institutions with little concern for their rights. The 2002 deal has appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at a <b>quick</b> <b>fix.</b> In May 2009 CORI agreed to contribute more to the envisaged higher compensation amounts.|$|E

500|$|In 1924 a small pipehead dam {{was built}} [...] {{downstream}} {{from the present}} Canning Dam. It was only intended as a <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> to the water supply problem and it soon became apparent that a major reservoir was needed, although it would be nine years before work on the current Canning Dam would begin.

[...] However, other journalists have countered this criticism of New Urbanist principles, citing that developments like Victory Park build on a classic, centuries old formula and [...] "are not a <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> but the slow weaving together of smart, sometimes big, often small, urban solutions" [...] to create viable and enduring community destinations.|$|E

2500|$|Daspit's cruise raised {{enough of}} an issue that tests were carried out by COMSUBPAC's gunnery and torpedo officer, Art Taylor. Taylor, [...] "Swede" [...] Momsen, and others fired warshots into the cliffs of Kahoolawe, {{beginning}} 31August. Additional trials, supervised by Taylor, used a crane to drop warheads filled with sand instead of high explosive from a height of [...] (the height was chosen so the velocity at impact would match the torpedo's running speed of 46 knots). In these drop tests, 70% of the exploders failed to detonate {{when they hit the}} target at 90 degrees. A <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> was to encourage [...] "glancing" [...] shots (which cut the number of duds in half), until a permanent solution could be found.|$|E
2500|$|To avoid [...] "shaking {{hands with}} St. Peter" [...] (as Lockwood put it), E.A. Johnson, USNR, {{supervised}} by Taylor, dropped dummy warheads filled with sand from a crane raised to {{a height of}} [...] In 7 out of 10 of these trials, firing mechanisms bent, jammed, and failed with the high inertia of a straight-on hit (the prewar ideal). A <b>quick</b> <b>fix</b> was to encourage [...] "glancing" [...] shots (which {{cut the number of}} duds in half), until a permanent solution could be found. Lightweight aluminum alloy (from propellers of Japanese planes shot down during the attack on Pearl Harbor) was machined {{to take the place of}} the Mark6's heavy pin block so inertial forces would be lower. Electrical switches, developed by Johnson, were tried as well. Both fixes worked and were relatively easy to implement. In September 1943, the first torpedoes with new contact pistols were sent to war. [...] "After twenty-one months of war, the three major defects of the Mark14 torpedo had at last been isolated. ... Each defect had been discovered and fixed in the field—always over the stubborn opposition of the Bureau of Ordnance." ...|$|E

50|$|Technological fix is {{the idea}} that all {{problems}} can find solutions in better and new technologies.
