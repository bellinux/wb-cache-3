40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the long-term power demand behaviour {{under the influence}} of air-conditioning (A/C) systems in Kuwait. An artificial neural network- (ANN-) based simulation model has been developed to forecast the long-term power demand considering different A/C-system <b>quantity</b> <b>import</b> scenarios. Beside the A/C factor, four socio-economic factors are utilized as inputs for the simulation model, including gross national product, population, number of buildings, and historic peak power demand. The baseline scenario shows that the peak power demand will reach 27 440 MW by the year 2025, with an average annual power growth rate of 5. 9 per cent. The A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> scenario shows that an average A/C <b>import</b> <b>quantity</b> change of 1 per cent is proportionate to an 1. 1 per cent change in power demand...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the relationship between maritime trade and transport cost in Latin America. The data available are disaggregated (SITC 5 digit level) maritime trade flows on trade routes within Latin America over the period 1999 - 2004. The contribution to the literature is to disentangle the effects that transport costs have on the extensive margin (number of products imported) and the intensive margin (<b>quantity</b> <b>imported</b> of each product) of international trade in order to test some of the predictions of the trade theories that introduce firm heterogeneity in productivity, as well as fixed costs of exporting. Recent investigations show that spatial frictions (distance) reduce trade mainly by reducing the number of shipments and that most firms ship only to geographically proximate customers, instead of shipping to many destinations in quantities that decrease in distance. Our findings confirm this result for intra-LA trade and show that the opposite pattern is observed for ad-valorem freight rates that reduce aggregate trade values mainly by reducing the <b>quantity</b> <b>imported</b> (intensive margin) ...|$|R

The analysis aimed also at observing the impact of alternative livestock support policy on the demand for corn. 	Import demand model for corn is specified and statistically estimated using time series data for the period 1976 - 1990. Some literature for related studies in the U. S., Egypt, and Saudi Arabia is reviewed in this research. 	Results showed that about 94 % of the variation in <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn is due to the variations in real import price of corn, real per capita GDP, real price of local chicken meat, and the per animal unit government support to the livestock sector. 	The estimated demand model was tested for its projection ability using the (U-theil). <b>Imported</b> <b>quantity</b> demanded of corn is then forecasted up to the year 2000 with a 95 % confidence interval. The paper also analyzed the impact of a 10 % increase or decrease in the per animal unit government support on the <b>imported</b> <b>quantity</b> of corn to Saudi Arabia. 	It is expected that <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn will be around 504 thousand tons by the year 2000, a 10 % increase (decrease) in the per animal unit government support will result in an increase (decrease) of the forecasted <b>imported</b> <b>quantities</b> of corn by 9 %, and 33 %, respectively...|$|R

Price and quantity indices are produced for a number of individual commodities and for aggregate imports. Three different index number formulae are employed in the paper, namely the Laspeyres, Paasche, and Fisher. Overall indices are constructed using two alternative methods: first using the basic specification of each of the three methods, and then using yearly updated expenditure weights - the chain-linked method. Although the data set is simple and uncomplicated by today's standards, one notes that the indices provide an excellent insight in the computation of the price level of imported goods and standard of living in Malta during the British rule. peer-reviewe...|$|R
