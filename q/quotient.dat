5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the <b>quotient</b> q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the <b>quotient</b> is large and many subtractions will be required. On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given <b>quotient</b> q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a <b>quotient</b> of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

40|$|Perfect Gabriel filters {{of right}} ideals and their {{corresponding}} right rings of <b>quotients</b> have the desirable feature that every module of <b>quotients</b> is determined solely {{by the right}} ring of <b>quotients.</b> On the other hand, symmetric rings of <b>quotients</b> have a symmetry that mimics the commutative case. In this paper, we study rings of <b>quotients</b> that combine these two desirable properties. We define the symmetric versions of a right perfect ring of <b>quotients</b> and a right perfect Gabriel filter – the perfect symmetric ring of <b>quotients</b> and the perfect symmetric Gabriel filter and study their properties. Then we prove that the standard construction of the total right ring of <b>quotients</b> Q r tot(R) {{can be adapted to}} the construction of the largest perfect symmetric ring of <b>quotients</b> – the total symmetric ring of <b>quotients</b> Q σ tot (R).
