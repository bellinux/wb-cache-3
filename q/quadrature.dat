25|$|<b>Quadrature</b> is a {{historical}} mathematical term that means calculating area. <b>Quadrature</b> problems have served {{as one of the}} main sources of mathematical analysis. Mathematicians of Ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood calculation of area as the process of constructing geometrically a square having the same area (squaring). That is why the process was named <b>quadrature.</b> For example, a <b>quadrature</b> of the circle, Lune of Hippocrates, The <b>Quadrature</b> of the Parabola. This construction must be performed only by means of compass and straightedge.|$|E
25|$|Students of {{integral}} calculus know that f(x) = x'p has an algebraic antiderivative {{except in the}} case p = –1 corresponding to the <b>quadrature</b> of the hyperbola. The other cases are given by Cavalieri's <b>quadrature</b> formula. Whereas <b>quadrature</b> of the parabola had been accomplished by Archimedes in the third century BC (in The <b>Quadrature</b> of the Parabola), the hyperbolic <b>quadrature</b> required the invention in 1647 of a new function: Gregoire de Saint-Vincent addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a hyperbola. His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the hyperbolic logarithm since it is obtained by integrating, or finding the area, under the hyperbola.|$|E

40|$|Recently, kinetic theory-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) {{models have}} been {{developed}} to model nonequilibrium gas flows. Depending on the order of <b>quadratures,</b> a hierarchy of LB models can be constructed which we have previously shown to capture rarefaction effects in the standing-shearwave problems. Here, we further examine the capability of high-order LB models in modeling nonequilibrium flows considering gas and surface interactions and their effect on the bulk flow. The Maxwellian gas and surface interaction model, which has been commonly used in other kinetic methods including the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, is used in the LB simulations. In general, the LB models with high-order Gauss-Hermite <b>quadratures</b> can capture flow characteristics in the Knudsen layer and higher order <b>quadratures</b> give more accurate prediction. However, for the Gauss-Hermite <b>quadratures,</b> the present simulation results show that the LB models with the <b>quadratures</b> obtained from the even-order Hermite polynomials perform significantly better than those from the odd-order polynomials. This may be attributed to the zero-velocity component in the odd-order discrete set, which does not participate in wall and gas collisions, and thus underestimates the wall effect...|$|R

40|$|We use {{generalized}} Gaussian <b>quadratures</b> for exponentials {{to develop}} a new ODE solver. Nodes and weights of these <b>quadratures</b> are computed for a given bandlimit c and user selected accuracy ϵ, so that they integrate functions e^ibx, for all |b|< c, with accuracy ϵ. Nodes of these <b>quadratures</b> do not concentrate excessively near the end points of an interval as those of the standard, polynomial-based Gaussian <b>quadratures.</b> Due to this property, the usual implicit Runge Kutta (IRK) collocation method may be used with a large number of nodes, as long as the method chosen for solving the nonlinear system of equations converges. We show that the resulting ODE solver is symplectic and demonstrate (numerically) that it is A-stable. We use this solver, dubbed Band-limited Collocation (BLC-IRK), in the problem of orbit determination. Since BLC-IRK minimizes the number of nodes needed to obtain the solution, in this problem we achieve speed close to that of explicit multistep methods. Comment: 25 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
