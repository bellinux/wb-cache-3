40|$|A dual {{functional}} chain transfer agent (CTA) capable of highly efficient sequential thermal and photo-induced ligation, generating alpha,omega-functional polymers, is introduced. The newly designed CTA (1 -(4 -((2 -formyl- 3 -methyl phenoxy) methyl) phenyl) ethyl (diethoxyphosphoryl) methane dithioate) fuses thermally triggered hetero Diels-Alder chemistry with rapid light-induced photoenol chemistry. The versatility of the CTA is exemplarily demonstrated via {{the preparation of}} an amphiphilic triblock <b>quaterpolymer</b> poly-(isoprene-co-styrene) -block-poly(ethyl acrylate) -block-poly(ethylene oxide) (P(I-co-S) -b-PEA-b-PEO). Subsequent to the homopolymerization of ethyl acrylate (PEA), a Cp-functional poly(isoprene-co-styrene) (P(I-co- 5)) is conjugated with the electron-deficient C=S double bond (dienophile) of the CTA end group, generating a P(I-co-S) -b-PEA diblock terpolymer. The triblock <b>quaterpolymer</b> P(I-co-S) -b-PEA-b-PEO is generated by photoligation of a macromolecular dienophile, i. e., the fumarate-terminated poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-fum) to the photoenol-functional P(I-co-S) -b-PEA. The new dual functional ligation RAFT agent constitutes a technology platform for generating alpha,omega-reactive building blocks from one single chain transfer agent...|$|E
40|$|Dithienyldiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP 2 T) and thieno[3, 2 -b]thiophene (TT) {{building}} blocks, enabling a large intermolecular overlap through π-π stacking, into an amorphous-like polymer {{composed of}} benzo(1, 2 -b: 4, 5 -b′) dithiophene (BDT) and fluorinated thieno[3, 4 -b]thiophene (QTT), are introduced. Herein, through the variation of relative compositions of DPP 2 T-TT and BDT-QTT in the polymer backbone, the synthesis and characterization {{of a series}} of condensed random 2 D- 2 A quarterpolymers with two reference alternating copolymers are reported. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9. 45 % is achieved for the optimum composition due to the synergistic effects such as improved photon absorption and reduced recombination loss, and optimized blend morphology via a change in the crystallinity and orientation of the blend films compared to the alternating copolymers. Moreover, by isolating higher molecular weight and narrower polydispersity fractions of the quarterpolymer via a marginal solvent-soaking technique, the PCE is further boosted to 10. 30 %, which is among the highest PCE reported to date for random polymer-based PSCs. Therefore, this simple 2 D- 2 A strategy, reported for the first time, should be extended to numerous <b>quaterpolymer</b> systems, greatly accelerating random polymer systems toward further improving PSCs...|$|E
40|$|Field-theoretic {{models have}} been used {{extensively}} to study the phase behavior of inhomogeneous polymer melts and solutions, both in self-consistent mean-field calculations and in numerical simulations of the full theory capturing composition fluctuations. The models commonly used can be grouped into two categories, namely species models and exchange models. Species models involve integrations of functionals that explicitly depend on fields originating both from species density operators and their conjugate chemical potential fields. In contrast, exchange models retain only linear combinations of the chemical potential fields. In the two-component case, development of exchange models {{has been instrumental in}} enabling stable complex Langevin (CL) simulations of the full complex-valued theory. No comparable stable CL approach has yet been established for field theories of the species type. Here we introduce an extension of the exchange model to an arbitrary number of components, namely the multi-species exchange (MSE) model, which greatly expands the classes of soft material systems that can accessed by the complex Langevin simulation technique. We demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the MSE-CL sampling approach using numerical simulations of triblock and tetrablock terpolymer melts, and tetrablock <b>quaterpolymer</b> melts. This method should enable studies {{of a wide range of}} fluctuation phenomena in multiblock/multi-species polymer blends and composites. Comment: 22 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

40|$|Two {{well-defined}} heptablock <b>quaterpolymers</b> of the ABCDCBA type [Α: polystyrene (PS), B: poly(butadiene) with ∼ 90 % 1, 4 -microstructure (PB 1, 4), C: poly(isoprene) with ∼ 55 % 3, 4 -microstructure (PI 3, 4) and D: poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) ] were synthesized {{by combining}} anionic polymerization high vacuum techniques and hydrosilylation/chlorosilane chemistry. All intermediates and final products {{were characterized by}} size exclusion chromatography, membrane osmometry, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to further verify the chemical modification reaction of the difunctional PDMS. The self-assembly in bulk of these novel heptablock quarterpolymers, studied by transmission electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering, revealed 3 -phase 4 -layer alternating lamellae morphology of PS, PB 1, 4, and mixed PI 3, 4 /PDMS domains. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to further confirm the miscibility of PI 3, 4 and PDMS blocks. It {{is the first time}} that PDMS is the central segment in such multiblock polymers (≥ 3 chemically different blocks). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of linear ter- quater- and quintopolymers of ethylenoxide is {{reported for the}} first time. The synthesis was made via anionic polymerization by sequential addition of monomers. The key factor that made the {{synthesis of}} copolymers of ethylenoxide, with more than two blocks possible, {{was the use of}} benzyl potassium as the initiator. Benzyl potassium is the best initiator for the polymerization of ethylenoxide but is also capable of initiate polymerization reactions of the most common monomers. To prove its ability, a triblock terpolymer PI-P 2 VP-PEO, a tetrablock <b>quaterpolymer</b> PS-PI-P 2 VP-PEO and a pentablock quintopolymer was synthesized. The DSC measurements of these copolymers showed that the crystallization of PEO was very slow. The presence of amorphous blocks in the melt, that are face separated, did not allow the PEO chains to relax and form the crystals. Within the time table of the experiment, the crystallization was indicated by a very broad peak and one crystallization point could not be observed, even though the melting point is very clear. As the number of amorphous blocks was increased the crystallization was more difficult to detect. The differences in the glass transition temperatures of the amorphous blocks were also mentioned. A model four-arm star homopolymer of ethylenoxide, with well defined molecular characteristics (number of arms, molecular weight of arm and molecular weight of star), was synthesized for the first time. 1, 2, 4, 5 tetra(bromomethyl) benzene (TBMB) was used as the coupling agent and the reaction conditions were carefully planed to prevent PEO crystallization. Fractionation of the reaction product was accomplished with conditions that assures separation due to molecular weight difference and not crystallization of PEO arm or star. Synthesis of miktoarm stars of the AB 3 type (A: PS or PI and B:PEO) were synthesized for the first time. The effect of the halogen-metal exchange reaction, the solvent, the counter ion and the light is studied for optimizing the reaction yield of coupling the non polar chain with TBMB. We consider this method general because the non polar arm could be any of the well known polymers. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of well-defined polycyclohexadiene (PCHD) homopolymers with different microstructures {{was achieved by}} anionic polymerization of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene with the n-BuLi/TMEDA (~ 55 % 1, 2 -PCHD) or the sec-BuLi/DABCO (~ 90 % 1, 4 -PCHD) initiating systems. 1, 2 -PCHD and 1, 4 -PCHD {{were found to have}} different thermal properties (Tg 1, 2 -PCHD ~ 150 oC, Tg 1, 4 -PCHD ~ 100 oC) and different solubility in common organic solvents (1, 4 -PCHD was more soluble than 1, 2 -PCHD). By using the above initiating systems and sequential addition of monomers we managed to synthesize well-defined linear block co-, ter- and quaterpolymers of styrene (S), butadiene (B) and isoprene (I) with 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene (CHD). The combined characterization results obtained using size exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering, osmometry and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy, as well as the good agreement between the dn/dc values determined experimentally and calculated, indicate a high degree of molecular and compositional homogeneity. The microstructure of polycyclohexadiene obtained in the presence of DABCO was mainly 1, 4 (90 % wt), while with TMEDA the 1, 2 microstructure was predominate (~ 55 % wt). The microstructure of PI was also altered {{in the presence of the}} above additives, but in both cases a high percentage of the 3, 4 microstructure was found (64 % wt with TMEDA and 49 % wt with DABCO). Different solution properties were observed between the copolymers containing 1, 4 -PCHD and 1, 2 -PCHD. Due to the limited solubility of 1, 2 -PCHD in THF and CHCl 3 its copolymers formed micelles and thus revealed extra peaks in the SEC chromatograms in these solvents. Model miktoarm stars containing one arm of PCHD and two or three arms of PB were prepared by anionic polymerization of 1, 3 -cyclohexadiene with the sec-BuLi/DABCO initiating system and by using controlled chlorosilane chemistry. Both PCHD and PB arms had about the same percentage of 1, 4 microstructure (~ 90 % wt 1, 4). The complete hydrogenation of these miktoarm stars led to model miktoarm stars with two or three arms of crystalline polyethylene (Tm ~ 90 oC) and one arm of amorphous polycyclohexylene (Tg ~ 195 oC). The morphology of all block copolymers was studied by transmission electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. Only in the case of the copolymers containing 1, 4 -PCHD there is microphase separation, maybe due to the strongest interaction parameter of 1, 4 -PCHD with the other blocks. The following results concerning the different families of block copolymers were obtained. Diblock Copolymers The PI-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or IC 1, 4) and the PB-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or BC 1, 4) diblock copolymers with φPCHD= 0, 55 and φPCHD= 0, 57 formed PCHD cylinders. The PS-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or SC 1, 4) with φPCHD= 0, 54 formed core-shell or hollow PCHD cylinders. In this case due to the lower flexibility (mobility) of PS compared to PB and PI (Tg,PS ~ 100 oC, Tg,PB ~ - 90 oC, Tg,PI ~ - 50 oC) a very curved interface of PCHD cylinders cannot be created. The SC 1, 4 is preferring to make a less curved interface, leading to core-shell or hollow PCHD cylinders. The formation of cylinders at this volume fraction is predicted by theoretical studies for rod-coil diblock copolymers, leading to the conclusion that these copolymers are consisting from a coil (PS, PI, PB) and a rod block (1, 4 -PCHD). Triblock Terpolymers In two PS-b-PB-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or SBC 1, 4) linear triblock terpolymers the three phase four layer lamellar and the coaxial cylinders with hexagonal shape at hexagonal lattice morphologies were observed. The PB-b-PI-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or BIC 1, 4) linear triblock terpolymer formed PCHD cylinders at hexagonal lattice in a mixed 1, 4 -PB/ 3, 4 -PI matrix. A three phase six layer lamellar morphology was found for a PB-b-PS-b-(1, 4 -PCHD) (or BSC 1, 4) linear triblock terpolymer, never observed before. Tetrablock Quaterpolymers A three phase four layer lamellar morphology was observed for the SBIC 1, 4 linear <b>quaterpolymer,</b> due to the partially mixing of 1, 4 -PB with the 3, 4 -PI. The SBCI linear <b>quaterpolymer</b> formed a core-shell cylinders in hexagonal lattice morphology where PS was the core, PB was the shell and PI was the matrix. Only three phases were observed in this case, due to the very low volume fraction of PCHD. Miktoarm Stars While the linear BC 1, 4 diblock copolymer was forming PCHD cylinders, both the PCHD(PB) 2 and PCHD(PB) 3 miktoarm stars formed disordered PCHD cylinders. The formation of PCHD spheres is predicted from the Milner’s theoretical phase diagram for coi-coil miktoarm stars, but for rod-coil diblock copolymers the formation of spheres of the rod block is not favored. This leads to the conclusion that the miktoarm stars are rod-coil copolymers which prefer to form disordered cylinders than spheres because they are consisting of one rod-like arm and two or three coil-like arms. ...|$|E
