40|$|Abstract—Milk is {{considered}} {{as an essential}} and complete food. The present study was conducted at Milk Plant Mohali especially {{in reference to the}} procurement section where the cash inflow was maximum, with the objective to achieve higher productivity and reduce wastage of milk. In milk plant it was observed that during the month of Jan- 2014 to March- 2014 the average procurement of milk was Rs. 4, 19, 361 liter per month and cost of procurement of milk is Rs 35 /- per liter. The total cost of procurement thereby equal to Rs. 1 crore 46 lakh per month, but there was mismatch in procurement-production of milk, which leads to an average loss of Rs. 12, 94, 405 per month. To solve the procurement-production problem <b>Quality</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Tools</b> like brainstorming, Flow Chart, Cause effect diagram and Pareto analysis are applied wherever applicable. With the successful implementation of <b>Quality</b> <b>Control</b> <b>tools</b> an average saving of Rs. 4, 59, 445 per month is done.

50|$|The impulse {{excitation}} technique {{can be used}} in a {{wide range}} of applications. Nowadays, IET equipment can perform measurements between -50 °C and 1700 °C in different atmospheres (air, inert, vacuum). IET is mostly used in research and as <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>tool</b> to study the transitions as function of time and temperature.A detailed insight into the material crystal structure can be obtained by studying the elastic and damping properties. For example, the interaction of dislocations and point defects in carbon steels are studied. Also the material damage accumulated during a thermal shock treatment can be determined for refractory materials. This can be an advantage in understanding the physical properties of certain materials.Finally, the technique can be used to check the quality of systems. In this case, a reference piece is required to obtain a reference frequency spectrum. Engine blocks for example can be tested by tapping them and comparing the recorded signal with a pre-recorded signal of a reference engine block.|$|E

40|$|Swedish {{school has}} for the last decades been using quality {{management}} as a method for improvement. Quality management is an enormous work and the whole school staff needs to be involved. The management consists of several parts like planning, surveys and interviews, analysis of the replies and setting up new goals. Parents, children and teachers are nowadays accustomed with quality surveys. The last few years these quality surveys have been computerized, but they still look almost the same, using little interaction with the respondent. I {{have had the opportunity}} to work with the company KMF Ventures, which has a vision that entails a more interactive web survey. This web survey gives both the school board and the pupils a possibility to compare their school with others. Hopefully this make them more interested in responding. The web survey is always open and the pupils can respond whenever they change opinion. This report describes the development process of the <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>tool</b> for the web survey. The web tool has furthermore been evaluated in two Swedish gymnasium schools. Interviews have been held with teachers, school board and pupils. The purpose was to see how their quality management system works and how it has been changed when they starts to use this <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>tool.</b> I also wanted to see how the schools handle problems with for example teachers. The questions in the web survey are few but they look practically the same as the ones already being used by the schools. They questions differ however from other surveys in the way it use only “yes” and “no” as responses. The quality web tool indicated that there were some problems in the schools. The lack of experience made however the schools to take little notice, even less to take action. This shows that education and planning of a new <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>tool</b> is of great importance. The comparison option was nevertheless highly valued. This <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>tool</b> could have a future, but it requires significant improvements. The company needs for example to consider the possibilities of a more well-known method for surveys.
