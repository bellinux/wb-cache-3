50|$|In the past, the {{dominant}} supplier was DuKane near St Louis in the US, {{who made the}} Ionovac; also sold in a UK variant as the Ionophane. Electro-Voice made {{a model for a}} short time under license from DuKane. These early models were finicky and required regular replacement of the cell in which the plasma was generated (the DuKane unit used a precision machined <b>quartz</b> <b>cell).</b> As a result, they were expensive units in comparison to other designs. Those who have heard the Ionovacs report that, in a sensibly designed loudspeaker system, the highs were 'airy' and very detailed, though high output wasn't possible.|$|E
50|$|In {{defense against}} the {{combined}} assault of the Avengers and the X-Men, Cyclops kills Xavier and attacks Emma Frost, absorbing her portion of the Phoenix Force and elevating to Dark Phoenix. In pitched battle, the Avengers and X-Men weaken Cyclops enough for Hope to absorb the Phoenix Force into herself. She undoes the changes to the world caused by Cyclops and she and the Scarlet Witch then spread out the Phoenix Force across the globe, causing thousands of people to become mutants. Cyclops is held captive in a ruby <b>quartz</b> <b>cell</b> and while guilt-stricken over killing Xavier, he is happy over the mutant race restarted and claims {{he would do it}} all over again.|$|E

40|$|Spectroscopic methods {{provide a}} {{powerful}} tool for studying the properties of proteins at interfaces. The protein accumulated in one adsorbed layer is frequently less than the minimum mass of protein required by a detection method. In such a case (as is the case in circular dichroism spectroscopy) the sorbent material is usually supplied as dispersion. However, light scattering by the dispersed particles often interferes with the measurement of the circular dichroism of the protein. Therefore, there is a strong need for an experimental setup that enables these measurements to be made using flat surfaces.
