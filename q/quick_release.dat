5|$|Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith was {{developed}} and published by LucasArts as an expansion to Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. Mysteries of the Siths development team was led by Stephen Shaw, the lead programmer for LucasArts titles Full Throttle and Outlaws. Development commenced immediately after Outlawss completion in 1997, which ensured the game's <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> following that of Dark Forces II.|$|E
5|$|Warner {{had both}} halfbacks {{close to the}} line and {{flanking}} the defensive tackles. That {{was the start of}} the double wingback offense, which enjoyed tremendous popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion. The double wing became the most effective of all systems for effective forward passing since it permitted the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> of four receivers down the field.|$|E
5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain {{to lobby for}} his release from prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and Orrery, and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was {{closely associated with the}} group, gave priority to the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> of the war criminals remaining in British custody.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party software developers {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, {{the company}} faced {{significant}} criticism when it filed patent applications for designs that some claimed had been invented {{by members of}} its community and published to Thingiverse, such as the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> extruder. Community members accused MakerBot of asserting ownership over their designs when those designs had been contributed {{with the understanding that}} they would remain open source. Then-CEO Bre Pettis released a statement dismissing these critics, citing patents that had been filed for unique inventions prior to any community-created designs, namely that the patent for the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> extruder was originally filed in 2012 while the open source design was first published to Thingiverse in 2013.|$|E
50|$|A hinge in {{the frame}} may allow the rear {{triangle}} and wheel to be folded down and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the Bike Friday, Brompton Mezzo Folder, and Swift Folder. Such a flip hinge may be combined with a folding front fork, as in the Birdy. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and Dahon, which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve latches and <b>quick</b> <b>releases,</b> which affect {{the speed of the}} fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the Tikit, featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no <b>quick</b> <b>releases</b> or latches, for increased folding speed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>releases</b> {{tend not}} to be used on certain types of {{bicycles}}, such as utility bicycles (with a single speed or hub gears) or track bicycles, partly because of tradition and partly because there is less need for quick removal of wheels without using tools.|$|R
50|$|Among the {{improvements}} in the new FIFA are improved responsiveness that allows for <b>quicker</b> <b>release</b> of the ball, greater urgency in off-the-ball running, a new jostle system {{that takes into account}} the strength of the players when going shoulder-to-shoulder, and subtle animations that enable players to take first-time shots.|$|R
25|$|Most {{drill bits}} for {{consumer}} use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with tapered shanks are sometimes used. Other types of shank used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Early scuba {{sets were}} usually {{provided}} with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> buckles. Many harnesses {{did not have a}} backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.|$|E
25|$|Another {{advance in}} dinghy sailing was {{introduced}} in the 1930s, when the technique of trapezing was introduced. This involves using the crew to provide more leverage (than possible by hiking out) to keep the sails vertical and the boat balanced, doing this can prevent the boat from capsizing, by hanging outside the boat on a harness and rope attached to the 'hounds' or upper mast. As a result, the boat is easier to keep upright, and the sails can deliver maximum power most of the time. While trapezing can be helpful and increase speed, it can also be very dangerous if the crew is not wearing a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> harness or is inexperienced. The <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> harness allows the crew to unstrap themselves quickly so as to not get forced under the boat if it were to capsize.|$|E
5000|$|Bone meal (or Bone manure) is {{a mixture}} of finely and {{coarsely}} ground animal bones and slaughter-house waste products. [...] It is used as an organic fertilizer for plants and as a nutritional supplement for animals. As a slow-release fertilizer, bone meal is primarily used as a source of phosphorus and protein. Finely ground bone meal may provide a <b>quicker</b> <b>release</b> of nutrients than the coarser ground version of bone meal.|$|R
2500|$|Its more {{pronounced}} oxidation and a <b>quicker</b> <b>release</b> of aromas help wines {{to lose their}} astringency and harshness faster; which makes this the wood of choice for shorter maturations - six to ten months. Because of American oak’s modest tannin contribution, the perfect first fill is a wine with abundant tannins and good texture; it allows the fruit to interact harmoniously with the wood, which contributes {{a wide array of}} complex aromas and soft, yet very palatable tannins.|$|R

25|$|Weight belts are {{the most}} common {{weighting}} system currently in use for recreational diving. Weight belts are often made of tough nylon webbing, but other materials such as rubber can be used. Weight belts for scuba and breathhold diving are generally fitted with a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.|$|E
25|$|The main {{change from}} {{previous}} missions {{is the change}} of the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate (GUCP) vent housing. The <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> vents exhibited leaks during STS-119 and STS-127, which were determined {{to be due to}} a misalignment in the vent. This led to the one part rigid seal in the external tank being replaced with a two part flexible seal.|$|E
50|$|Mozilla Firefox 4 is {{a version}} of the Firefox web browser, {{released}} on March 22, 2011. The first beta was made available on July 6, 2010; Release Candidate 2 (a base for the final version) was released on March 18, 2011. It was codenamed Tumucumaque, and was Firefox's last large release cycle. The Mozilla team planned smaller and <b>quicker</b> <b>releases</b> following other browser vendors. The primary goals for this version included improvements in performance, standards support, and user interface.|$|R
50|$|Dobler {{was drafted}} in the fifth round out of the University of Wyoming in the 1972 NFL Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He played right {{offensive}} guard for the Cardinals from 1972-77, next to Hall-of-Famer Dan Dierdorf at right tackle. In those years, the Cardinals had solid offensive lines, especially for pass blocking; they allowed just eight sacks in all of 1975, then a record (though helped by <b>quick</b> <b>releases</b> from quarterback Jim Hart). Dobler was an important cog of this success, making three consecutive Pro Bowl appearances from 1975-77.|$|R

25|$|The {{only time}} the diver {{may want to}} be {{positively}} buoyant is when on the surface or during a limited range of emergencies where uncontrolled ascent is less life-threatening than remaining under water. Surface-supplied divers generally have a secure supply of breathing gas, and {{there are very few}} occasions where weighs should be jettisoned, so in most cases the surface-supplied diver weighting arrangement does not provide for <b>quick</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E

50|$|After Moore's injury, Prescott {{competed with}} second-year quarterback Jameill Showers for the backup job to {{established}} starter Tony Romo. Several reports from August training camp indicated that Showers outperformed Prescott, showing greater accuracy and a <b>quicker</b> <b>release.</b> However, the Cowboys coaching staff {{made the decision}} to start Prescott in the team's preseason opener at the Los Angeles Rams. Working with the Cowboys' first-team offense, Prescott completed 10 of 12 passes for 139 yards and two touchdowns in one half of action, though Dallas would lose the game 28-24. Prescott continued his hot streak {{throughout the rest of the}} preseason, impressing all with his veteran-like pocket poise and decision making.|$|R

The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|E
25|$|Morin {{was known}} as a goal scorer in juniors. He has the ability to shoot from {{anywhere}} and find open space to shoot, often going {{to the front of the}} net and finding space to score. He possesses a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> that accompanies a solid shot. Morin is considered a gritty player for a goal scorer, he plays hard and has a bit of an edge in his game. He plays a solid all-round game, possesses a high hockey IQ, and competes every shift.|$|E
25|$|Dexlansoprazole is an (R)-(+)-enantiomer of lansoprazole, {{marketed as}} Dexilant. After oral {{appliance}} of the racemic lansoprazole, the circulating drug is 80% dexlansoprazole. Moreover, both enantiomers have similar {{effects on the}} proton pump. Consequently, the main advantage of Dexilant is not {{the fact that it}} is an enantiopure substance. The advantage is the pharmaceutical formulation of the drug, which is based on a dual release technology, with the first <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> producing a blood plasma peak concentration about one hour after application, and the second retarded release producing another peak about four hours later.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{increasingly}} physical nature of low post basketball, the [...] "jump hook" [...] {{has become a}} more popular style of hook shot, and has been employed by many players including centers Shaquille O'Neal and Dwight Howard. The player jumps off using two feet, instead of taking steps and then jumping off using one foot. The jump hook provides for better balance {{as well as a}} <b>quicker</b> <b>release,</b> though the shot will not be released from as high in the air.

40|$|After the {{successful}} run 1 of the LHC, the LHCb Core software team has {{taken advantage of}} the long shutdown to consolidate and improve its build and deployment infrastructure. Several of the related projects have already been presented like the build system using Jenkins, as well as the LHCb Performance and Regression testing infrastructure. Some components are completely new, like the Software Configuration Database (using the Graph DB Neo 4 j), or the new packaging installation using RPM packages. Furthermore all those parts are integrated to allow easier and <b>quicker</b> <b>releases</b> of the LHCb Software stack, therefore reducing the risk of operational errors. Integration and Regression tests are also now easier to implement, allowing to improve further the software checks...|$|R
