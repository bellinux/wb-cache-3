500|$|This {{focus on}} {{accuracy}} {{was a challenge}} for Staten, as he believes his audience is highly intelligent, willing, and able to report flaws; fellow Bungie employees cross-referenced his drafts with the [...] "Halo Story Bible" [...] to ensure canonical agreement. One example of fans taking Staten to task over the novel occurred soon after the novel's cover was revealed in July 2007. The cover depicts the protagonist, Sergeant Avery Johnson holding a weapon known as the Battle Rifle. As the weapon was first introduced in the video game Halo 2 and the events of Contact Harvest take place decades before the game, fans were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Staten had made a mistake. Staten later pointed out he had good reasons for including the offending weapon in the book, and justified the inclusion by stating that the weapon is a prototypical form of the version players use in the game.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was too <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> who he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E

The scheduling change {{would have been}} implemented on February 28 after the 2010 Winter Olympics (which preempted much of NBC's primetime and late-night lineup). Leno himself commented on the rumors during his January 7 monologue, joking that NBC stands for [...] "Never Believe your Contract." [...] According to Broadcasting & Cable, [...] "most [...] are hopeful Jay—and Conan—sticks with NBC, and most, if not all, desperately {{want to see a}} change in terms of the lead-in they're getting to their lucrative late news; the affiliates [...] "remain fiercely loyal to Leno and were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the rookie program's struggles don't reflect the funnyman's work ethic or comedic chops.

5000|$|In English, WWW is {{the longest}} {{possible}} TLA to pronounce, typically requiring nine syllables. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is <b>quicker</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the acronym instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires {{three times as many}} syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, [...] "www" [...] is sometimes abbreviated as [...] "dubdubdub" [...] in speech.|$|R
50|$|In {{ordinary}} fluent conversation people pronounce roughly four syllables, ten {{or twelve}} phonemes and two to three words out of their vocabulary (that can contain 10 to 100 thousand words) each second. Errors in speech production are relatively rare occurring {{at a rate of}} about once in every 900 words in spontaneous speech. Words that are commonly spoken or learned early in life or easily imagined are <b>quicker</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> than ones that are rarely said, learnt later in life, or are abstract.|$|R

6000|$|Some mothers may perhaps {{say that}} they have not time thus to enter into the ideas and occupations of their children. They are engrossed with the serious cares of life, or busy with its various occupations. But it does not require time. It is not a {{question}} of time, but of manner. The farmer's wife, for example, is busy ironing, or sewing, or preparing breakfast for her husband and sons, who are expected every moment to come in hungry from their work. Her little daughter, ten years old, comes to show her a shawl she has been making from a piece of calico for her doll. The busy mother thinks she must say, [...] "Yes; but run away now, Mary; I am very busy!"--because that is the easiest and quickest thing to say; but it is just as easy and just as <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "What a pretty shawl! Play now that you are going to take Minette out for a walk in it!" [...] The one mode sends the child away repulsed and a little disappointed; the other pleases her and makes her happy, and tends, moreover, to form a new bond of union and sympathy between her mother's heart and her own. A merchant, engrossed all day in his business, comes home to his house at dinner-time, and meets his boy of fifteen on the steps returning from his school. [...] "Well, James," [...] he says, as they walk together up stairs, [...] "I hope you have been a good boy at school to-day." [...] James, not knowing what to say, makes some inaudible or unmeaning reply. His father then goes on to say that he hopes his boy will be diligent and attentive to his studies, and improve his time well, as his future success in life will depend upon the use which he makes of his advantages while he is young; and then leaves him at the head of the stairs, each to go to his room.|$|E

Topher and Ivy work together to hack into the D.C. Dollhouse. They are able to upload their own imprint to an active in the D.C. Dollhouse, which then enable Ballard and Anthony to get inside.

50|$|One {{criticism}} {{of the book is}} that it is riddled with typographical errors. But Wilwayco and the publisher were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> defend this, <b>saying</b> How I Fixed My Hair After a Rather Long Journey was intended as a gritty social commentary. The errors were deliberate {{in much the same way}} that typographical errors were deliberate in Jack Kerouacs On the Road.|$|R

Leaving Brisbane at 8.00am on the Bundaberg Mail and {{travelling}} north {{to meet the}} train travelling west meant arrival in Kingaroy at 9.45pm. A rail motor service ran {{three times a week}} between Maryborough and Kingaroy from 1929 to 1967, and a sleeping car was provided twice per week.|$|E
