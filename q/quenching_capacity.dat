The order hydroxytyrosol > oleuropein > tyrosol was observed among the antioxidants for both oxidation potential and radical quenching activity.

Quenching of Chl excited states in PSI submembrane fractions by exogenous quinones slowed down the rate of P 700, primary electron donor of PSI, photooxidation measured at limiting actinic light irradiances thus revealing a reduced photochemical capacity of absorbed quanta.

As in other species, rapidly reversible photoprotection (measured as non-photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching) is initiated within the time frame of sun-flecks (minutes), before detectable conversion of violaxanthin to antheraxanthin or zeaxanthin. Photoprotection is stabilized within hours of exposure to strong light by simultaneously engaging the reversible violaxanthin cycle and a slowly reversible conversion of lutein-epoxide to lutein. It is proposed that this lutein 'locks in' a primary mechanism of photoprotection during photoacclimation in this species, converting efficient light-harvesting antennae of the shade plant into potential excitation dissipating centres.

40|$|Each photoexcited {{rhodopsin}} (R*) molecule catalyzes binding of GTP to many {{copies of}} the guanine nucleotide-binding protein transducin, which, in its GTP-binding form, then activates cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEase). Subsequent deactivation of this light-activated enzyme cascade involves hydrolysis of the GTP bound to transducin, as well as decay of the activating capacity of R*. We report here that deactivation of PDEase in rod outer segment suspensions is highly enhanced by addition of ATP and purified 48 -kDa protein, which is an intrinsic rod outer segment protein that is soluble in the dark but binds to photolyzed rhodopsin that has been phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase and ATP [Kühn, H., Hall, S. W. & Wilden, U. (1984) FEBS Lett. 176, 473 - 478]. To analyze the mechanism by which ATP and 48 -kDa protein deactivate PDEase, we used an ATP-free system consisting of thoroughly washed disk membranes, whose rhodopsin had been previously phosphorylated and chromophore-regenerated, and to which purified PDEase and transducin were reassociated. Such phosphorylated membranes exhibited a significantly lower (by a factor {{less than or equal}} to 5) light-induced PDEase-activating capacity than unphosphorylated controls. Addition of purified 48 -kDa protein to phosphorylated membranes further suppressed their PDEase-activating capacity; suppression could be as high as 98 % (as compared to unphosphorylated membranes), depending on the amount of 48 -kDa protein and the flash intensity. Addition of ATP had little further effect. In contrast, PDEase activation or deactivation with unphosphorylated control membranes was not influenced by 48 -kDa protein, even in the presence of ATP, provided rhodopsin kinase was absent.

40|$|AbstractThe {{xanthophyll}} cycle apparently aids the photoprotection of photosystem II by {{regulating the}} nonradiative dissipation of excess absorbed light energy as heat. However, it is a controversial {{question whether the}} resulting nonphotochemical quenching is soley dependent on xanthophyll cycle activity or not. The xanthophyll cycle consists of two enzymic reactions, namely deepoxidation of the diepoxide violaxanthin to the epoxide-free zeaxanthin and the much slower, reverse process of epoxidation. While deepoxidation requires a transthylakoid pH gradient (ΔpH), epoxidation can proceed irrespective of a ΔpH. Herein, we compared the extent and kinetics of deepoxidation and epoxidation to the changes in fluorescence {{in the presence of}} a light-induced thylakoid ΔpH. We show that epoxidation reverses fluorescence quenching without affecting thylakoid ΔpH. These results suggest that epoxidase activity reverses quenching by removing deepoxidized xanthophyll cycle pigments from quenching complexes and converting them to a nonquenching form. The transmembrane organization of the xanthophyll cycle influences the localization and the availability of deepoxidized xanthophylls is to support nonphotochemical <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity.</b> The results confirm the view that rapidly reversible nonphotochemical quenching is dependent on deepoxidized xanthophyll...|$|E

They damage the frescoes, mortar, marble, and tufa rock wherever artificial lighting is installed. During the past two decades, the conservation strategies have evolved gradually; rather than restricting the illumination time and intensity, the latest approach is to use strong light to reduce their growth.

40|$|Benthic diatoms are {{dominant}} primary {{producers in}} intertidal marine sediments and are roughly {{divided into two}} main growth forms: the epipelon comprises mainly larger raphid motile diatoms and dominates silty sediments, whereas the epipsammon mainly consists of small motile and non-motile species that live in close association with single sand particles. As intertidal sediments are characterized by rapidly fluctuating and often extreme light conditions, benthic diatoms display behavioural as well as physiological photoprotection mechanisms. Vertical migration into the sediment (behavioural photoprotection), however, is largely restricted to epipelic diatoms, whereas epipsammic diatoms have to undergo changes in light conditions. As in natural communities (in situ studies) {{it is hard to}} characterize the photoprotective strategies of diatom growth forms (as natural communities can contain both epipelic and epipsammic growth forms), we studied the photoprotection capacity of unialgal isolates belonging to the main growth forms under controlled lab conditions. v One of the major physiological photoprotection mechanisms is to dissipate excess light energy as heat which can be measured as Non-Photochemical <b>Quenching</b> (NPQ). The <b>capacity</b> of this mechanism is mainly defined by the xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigment diatoxanthin and Light-harvesting Complex X (LHCX) proteins. We show that epipelic and epipsammic diatoms show fundamentally different photoprotective responses: epipsammic diatoms have a higher NPQ and associated XC capacities compared to epipelic diatoms. In the latter group, the behavioural response (vertical migration) is more important which may alleviate the need for strong physiological photoprotection. The regulation and performance of NPQ was further studied using model representatives of each functional group during and after exposure to high light. The epipsammic species Opephora guenter-grassii could rapidly switch NPQ on and off by relying on fast XC kinetics. This species also demonstrated high de novo synthesis of xanthophylls within {{a relatively short period of}} time (1 h), including significant amounts of zeaxanthin, a feature not observed before in other diatoms. In contrast, the epipelic representative Seminavis robusta showed slower NPQ and associated XC kinetics, partly relying on NPQ conferred by de novo synthetized diatoxanthin molecules and synthesis of Light-Harvesting Complex X (LHCX) isoforms. The genome of S. robusta contains fourteen LHCX genes. For eight LHCX genes we could show distinct upregulation during (strong) light exposure. While overall our results support the a trade-off between behavioural and physiological photoprotection mechanisms other factors besides growth form, such as environmental factors, cell size, substrate type and photoacclimation, may influence photoprotective strategies and explain species-specific photoregulation traits in intertidal benthic diatoms...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Genetics. Plant Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Plants are {{constantly}} exposed to {{adverse environmental conditions}} including variations in light intensity {{and the availability of}} water resources. These abiotic factors are expected to worsen as the changing global climate places additional daily and seasonal demands on plant growth and productivity. As plants are incapable of avoiding stress they have developed a number of mechanisms to manage and adapt to the unfavourable conditions. Carotenoids represent one of these mechanisms; with the xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenes) playing an essential role in photoprotection following exposure to excess light energy. They are also precursors to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) which plays a known role in stomatal regulation and thus drought tolerance. Carotenoids have been identified as potential targets for genetic manipulation to meet the existing nutritional demands (particularly vitamin A) and to enable plants to survive the climatic variations predicted. Thorough investigations into the regulation and functioning of each carotenoid biosynthetic gene in vivo as well as the roles of their encoded proteins are prerequisite. Within the Grapevine Biotechnology Programme, a number of isoprenoid biosynthetic genes have been isolated from Vitis vinifera L. cv. Pinotage. From this vast resource two genes were chosen; namely a lycopene b-cyclase (b-LCY) and 9 -cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) for detailed in planta analyses to address knowledge gaps in our current understanding of carotenoid biosynthesis in general, its regulation and the roles of the two target genes in these processes. Currently, the role of b-LCY within the chloroplasts is not well known. Although the relationship between NCED overexpression, ABA levels, reduced stomatal conductance and increased tolerance to water stress has been well-established, comprehensive physiological analysis of the resulting mutants during conditions of both water availability and shortage is not well documented. To assess their in planta role, functional copies of both genes were isolated from Vitis vinifera (cv. Pinotage), characterised and independently transformed into the genome of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, in the sense orientation under a constitutive promoter. In order to investigate these pertinent scientific questions and thus to evaluate the physiological role of each gene in vivo, a number of technologies were developed and/or adopted. These included a high-performance liquid chromatography method for profiling the major plant pigments in leaf tissue, a combination vapour phase extraction and electron impact-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method for the phytohormone profiling as well as various physiological analyses including the use of chlorophyll a fluorescence to assess the photosynthetic and non-photochemical <b>quenching</b> (NPQ) <b>capacities</b> of the plants. Overexpression of grapevine b-LCY (Vvb-LCY) decreased lutein levels due to preferential partitioning of lycopene into the b-branch. This decrease was not met by an increase in either b-carotene or the xanthophyll cycle pigments implying that Vvb-LCY is not able to regulate the flow of carbon through the pathway and provides additional evidence to the fluidity of this pathway whereby pigment levels are continually balanced. The decreased lutein levels observed under low light (LL) did not compromise the plants’ ability to induce and maintain NPQ over a wide actinic light range. Vvb-LCY transgenics also had lower neoxanthin levels (and specifically the cis-isomer) under both LL and following exposure to high light (HL), which could be correlated to an increase in malondialdehyde. Although not corroborated, a novel and unexpected finding was an essential role for neoxanthin, and potentially lutein, in preventing or at least reducing lipid peroxidation under HL stress. The lower neoxanthin amounts may be due to silencing of the Arabidopsis b-LCY by the Vvb-LCY, as the former may function as a NSY paralog as NSY is not encoded for in the Arabidopsis genome. Clearly, this study has confirmed that Vvb-LCY partitions the carbon flux between the a- and b-branches, however, the catalytic action of this enzyme is dependent on the amount of substrate available and is thus not a regulatory step directing the flux within the pathway. Enzyme kinetic and detailed transcriptional analyses would confirm the above findings. Overexpression of grapevine NCED 1 (VvNCED 1) increased ABA concentrations, delayed seed germination and resulted in a slight to severe reduction in the overall plant growth rate. NCED cleaves the 9 -cis xanthophylls regulating ABA synthesis. However, contrary to expectations, constitutive levels of this regulatory enzyme did not deplete the total and individual chlorophylls and carotenoids in well-watered plants. Instead the VvNCED 1 transgenics simply exhibited a lower chloroplastic pigment complement with no concomitant effects on their photosynthetic capacity. Of particular interest, well-watered plants overexpressing the VvNCED 1 gene had an increased NPQ capacity of which the thermal energy dissipation component (qE) was the most significant. It has been speculated that this NPQ is associated with the phenotype conferred by VvNCED 1 overexpression and occurs independently of the xanthophyll cycle, and specifically zeaxanthin. This study confirmed that VvNCED 1 functions during drought tolerance via ABA regulation of stomatal conductance. A detailed study was done to understand the plants’ response during water deficit. Typically, decreases in total and individual carotenoids and the maximum efficiency of photochemistry (Fv/Fm) as well as the relative water and soil moisture content were recorded. No changes were recorded in salicylic acid (SA) levels, while indole acetic acid (IAA) was positively correlated to ABA or vice versa. In contrast, the physiology of VvNCED 1 overexpressing lines was largely unaffected, indicating that a reduced stomatal conductance protects the plants against water stress. This study has resulted in the isolation and characterisation of a carotenoid biosynthetic gene (b-LCY) and an abscisic acid synthesising gene (NCED). Significant advancements in our existing knowledge of the in planta role of both genes have been achieved. We have also reaffirmed that strict regulatory control and fluidity exists within the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway whereby individual pigment levels {{are constantly}} brought back into balance despite constitutive expression of one of the pathway gene members. These analyses provide valuable baseline information about individual genes which can be extended upon with other omic technologies in order to comprehend the full complexity involved in carotenogenesis...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{label-free}} colorimetric {{strategy was}} developed for ultrasensitive detection of heparin by using the super color <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity</b> of graphene oxide (GO). Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) -stabilized gold nanorods (AuNRs) could easily self-assembly {{onto the surface of}} GO through electrostatic interaction, resulting in decrease of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) absorption and consequent color quenching change of the AuNRs from deep to light. Polycationic protamine was used as a medium for disturbing the electrostatic interaction between AuNRs and GO. The AuNRs were prevented from being adsorbed onto the surface of GO because of the stronger interaction between protamine and GO, showing a native color of the AuNRs. On the contrary, in the presence of heparin, which was more easily to combine with protamine, the AuNRs could self-assembly onto the surface of GO, resulting in the native color disappearing of AuNRs. As the concentration of heparin increased, the color of AuNRs would gradually fade until almost colorless. The amounts of self-assembly AuNRs were proportional to the concentration of heparin, and thereby the changes in the SPR absorption and color had been used to monitor heparin levels. Under optimized conditions, good linearity was obtained in a range of 0. 02 - 0. 28 mu g/mL (R = 0. 9957), and a limit of detection was 5 ng/mL. The simultaneous possession of high sensitivity and selectivity, simplicity, rapidity, and visualization enabled this sensor to be potentially applicable for ultrasensitive and rapid on-site detection toward trace heparin.

Methods: Methanol extracts of Vayasthapana Rasayana formulation (VRF) were studied for in vitro total antioxidant activity along with phenolic content and reducing power. In vitro assays like DPPH, FRAP, ABTS scavenging to evaluate radical quenching potential were performed. Results: The formulation has shown 94 % at 0. 1 mg/ml DPPH free-radical scavenging activity as against 84 % at 0. 1 mg/ml for standard ascorbic acid (IC 50 value 5. 51 μg/ml for VRF and 39 μg/ml for standard). It has a significant higher ferric reducing potential also (OD 0. 87 at 700 nm & 0. 21 at 0. 1 mg/ml for VRF and standard, respectively). The total phenolic content (gallic acid equivalent) of the VRF is 8. 3 mg per g of dry mass. Total antioxidant capacity of the formulation, estimated by FRAP was 1150 ± 5 μM Fe(II) /g dry mass.

40|$|Drought {{is a major}} {{limiting}} factor for crop production. To identify critical genes for drought resistance in rice (Oryza sativa), we screened T-DNA mutants and identified a drought-hypersensitive mutant, dsm 2. The mutant phenotype {{was caused by a}} T-DNA insertion in a gene encoding a putative β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH). BCH is predicted for the biosynthesis of zeaxanthin, a carotenoid precursor of abscisic acid (ABA). The amounts of zeaxanthin and ABA were significantly reduced in two allelic dsm 2 mutants after drought stress compared with the wild type. Under drought stress conditions, the mutant leaves lost water faster than the wild type and the photosynthesis rate, biomass, and grain yield were significantly reduced, whereas malondialdehyde level and stomata aperture were increased in the mutant. The mutant is also hypersensitive to oxidative stresses. The mutant had significantly lower maximal efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry and nonphotochemical <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity</b> than the wild type, indicating photoinhibition in photosystem II and decreased capacity for eliminating excess energy by thermal dissipation. Overexpression of DSM 2 in rice resulted in significantly increased resistance to drought and oxidative stresses and increases of the xanthophylls and nonphotochemical quenching. Some stress-related ABA-responsive genes were up-regulated in the overexpression line. DSM 2 is a chloroplast protein, and the response of DSM 2 to environmental stimuli is distinctive from the other two BCH members in rice. We conclude that the DSM 2 gene significantly contributes to control of the xanthophyll cycle and ABA synthesis, both of which play critical roles in the establishment of drought resistance in rice...|$|E

40|$|As a neutrophilic bacterium, Helicobacter pylori is growth {{deficient}} under extreme acidic conditions. The gastric pathogen {{is equipped}} with an acid survival kit, regulating urease activity by a pH-gated urea channel, opening below pH 6. 5. After overcoming acid stress, the bacterium's multiplication site is situated at the gastric mucosa with near neutral pH. The pathogen exhibits exceptional genetic variability, mainly due to its capability of natural transformation, termed competence. Using single cell analysis, we show here that competence is highly regulated in H. pylori. DNA uptake complex activity was reversibly shut down below pH 6. 5. pH values above 6. 5 opened a competence window, in which competence development was triggered by the combination of pH increase and oxidative stress. In contrast, addition of sublethal concentrations of the DNA-damaging agents ciprofloxacin or mitomycin C did not trigger competence development under our conditions. An oxygen-sensitive mutant lacking superoxide dismutase (sodB) displayed a higher competent fraction of cells than the wild type under comparable conditions. In addition, the sodB mutant was dependent on adenine for growth in broth and turned into non-cultivable coccoid forms in its absence, indicating that adenine had radical <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity.</b> Quantification of periplasmically located DNA in competent wild type cells revealed outstanding median imported DNA amounts of around 350 kb per cell within 10 min of import, with maximally a chromosomal equivalent (1. 6 Mb) in individual cells, far exceeding previous amounts detected in other Gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the synthesis and evaluation of regenerable chalcogen containing antioxidants. Variously substituted 2, 3 -dihydrobenzo[b]selenophene- 5 -ol antioxidants were evaluated in order to gain information about structure/reactivity-relationships. Within the series explored, the most regenerable unsubstituted compound inhibited lipid peroxidation for more than 320 minutes when assayed in a two-phase lipid peroxidation model in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC). α-Tocopherol which could inhibit lipid peroxidation for 90 minutes under similar conditions was therefore easily outperformed. The antioxidant activity of the parent was also documented in an aqueous environment. The best catalyst quenched/inhibited ROS production by neutrophils and PMA-stimulated macrophages more efficiently than Trolox. In addition, over a period of seven days, no disruption in proliferation for the cell lines used was observed when exposed to our synthetic compound or Trolox at a concentration of 60 µM. 3 -Pyridinols substituted with alkyltelluro groups in the ortho-position were more regenerable in the two-phase model than their corresponding para-substituted analogues in the presence of NAC and also inhibited autoxidation of styrene in a catalytic fashion in homogenous phase in the presence of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl cysteine methyl ester (LipCys), a lipid-soluble analogue of NAC. The best inhibitors quenched peroxyl radicals more efficiently than α-tocopherol. They could also catalyze reduction of organic hydroperoxides in the presence of thiols and therefore mimic the action of the glutathione peroxidase enzymes. Mechanisms for the catalysis are proposed. Octylthio, octylseleno and octyltelluro analogues of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) were synthesized and evaluated. Among these, the tellurium compound was superior to α-tocopherol in the presence of NAC both when it comes to <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity</b> and regenerability.   Organochalcogen substituent effects in phenolic compounds were studied by using EPR, IR and computational methods...|$|E

These plants {{have been used as}} traditional medicines by local ethnic groups, where they are prepared as decoction, pastes for wound infections, and some have been eaten as salad. This paper focused on the assessment of antioxidant potential, antibacterial activity and classes of phytochemicals of nine plants from the Leguminosae family. Methods Acacia auriculiformis, Bauhinia kockiana, Bauhinia purpurea, Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Calliandra tergemina, Cassia surattensis, Leucaena leucocephala, Peltophorum pterocarpum, and Samanea saman were extracted with aqueous methanol and dichloromethane:methanol mixture to test for antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The Folin-Ciocalteu assay was conducted to quantify the total phenolic content and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was used to determine the free radical <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity.</b> Antibacterial activity was assessed using disc diffusion (Kirby-Bauer) assay. Screening for major classes of phytochemical was done using standard chemical tests. Results B. kockiana flowers and C. pulcherrima leaves contained high total phenolic content (TPC) and strong DPPH radical scavenging ability with TPC of 8280 ± 498 mg GAE/ 100 g, IC 50 of 27. 0 ± 5. 0 μg/mL and TPC of 5030 ± 602 mg GAE/ 100 g, IC 50 of 50. 0 ± 5. 0 μg/mL respectively. Positive correlation was observed between TPC and free radical scavenging ability. Most extracts showed antibacterial activity against Gram positive bacteria at 1 mg, while none showed activity against Gram negative bacteria at the same dose. All extracts (except Samanea saman flower) showed antibacterial activity against two strains of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with MID values ranging between 100 μg/disc and 500 μg/disc. Conclusion The potential source of antioxidant and antibacterial agents, especially for MRSA infection treatments were found in B. kockiana, C. pulcherrima, C. tergemina and P. pterocarpum.

40|$|The flu mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana overaccumulates in {{the dark}} the {{immediate}} precursor of chlorophyllide, protochlorophyllide (Pchlide), a potent photosensitizer, that upon illumination generates singlet oxygen (1 O 2). Once 1 O 2 has been released in plastids of the flu mutant, mature plants stop growing, while seedlings die. Several suppressor mutations, dubbed singlet oxygen-linked death activator (soldat), were identified that specifically abrogate 1 O 2 -mediated stress responses in young flu seedlings without grossly affecting 1 O 2 -mediated stress responses of mature flu plants. One of the soldat mutations, soldat 8, was shown to impair a gene encoding the SIGMA 6 factor of the plastid RNA polymerase. Reintroduction of a wild-type copy of the SOLDAT 8 gene into the soldat 8 /flu mutant restored the phenotype of the flu parental line. In contrast to flu, seedlings of soldat 8 /flu did not bleach when grown under non-permissive dark/light conditions, despite their continuous overaccumulation of the photosensitizer Pchlide {{in the dark}}. The activity of SIGMA 6 is confined primarily to the very early stage of seedling development. Inactivation of SIGMA 6 [*]in soldat 8 mutants disturbed plastid homeostasis, drastically reduced the non-photochemical <b>quenching</b> <b>capacity</b> and enhanced the light sensitivity of young soldat 8 seedlings. Surprisingly, after being grown under very low light, soldat 8 seedlings showed an enhanced resistance against a subsequent severe light stress that {{was significantly higher than}} in wild-type seedlings. In order to reach a similar enhanced stress resistance, wild-type seedlings had to be exposed to a brief higher light treatment that triggered an acclimatory response. Such a mild pre-stress treatment did not further enhance the stress resistance of soldat 8 seedlings. Suppression of 1 O 2 -mediated cell death in young flu/soldat 8 seedlings seems to be due to a transiently enhanced acclimation at the beginning of seedling development caused by the initial disturbance of plastid homeostasi...|$|E
