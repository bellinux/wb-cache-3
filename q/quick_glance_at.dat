25|$|Loweswater {{is unique}} amongst the major lakes of the District in {{emptying}} toward {{the centre of}} the National Park. Its waters flow out eastwards into Crummock Water before beginning their northward journey as the Cocker. Loweswater does not therefore represent any watershed between the fells on either side of its valley, as might be supposed from a <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the map. A low ridge circuiting the western end of the lake joins Burnbank Fell to Low Fell and Fellbarrow, confirming them as the last outpost of the Western Fells.|$|E
25|$|When one is {{learning}} another language, vocabulary presents difficulties. One must continuously search for unknown words, and consequently interest is lost. In the elementary part, however, this {{problem has been}} overcome, because the relevant translation of each word appears below the Volapük words. A selection of readings follows, and {{it is suggested that}} the Volapük words be read out loud. The grammar and a basic vocabulary have already been done in the introduction; nevertheless, a <b>quick</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> the translation is recommended to ensure that the overall meaning has been acquired. There is a maxim which states that a little study a day is better than a lot of study all at once.|$|E

2500|$|A rider posts to one [...] "diagonal" [...] or {{the other}} at the trot; when the rider is on the correct diagonal, the rider sits as the horse's inside hind leg and outside foreleg {{are on the ground}} and rises as the outside hind leg and inside foreleg are on the ground.
