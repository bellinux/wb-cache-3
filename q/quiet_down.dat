5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer <b>quiet</b> <b>down.</b> Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
25|$|Bells ring as Elisabeth and Eboli enter. The crowd pushes its {{way into}} the prison and threatens the King, {{demanding}} the release of Carlos. In the confusion, Eboli escapes with Carlos.

500|$|After {{stopping}} at the Cumberland, Hendrix and Dannemann accompanied Harvey to his apartment, arriving around 5:30p.m. Hendrix and Dannemann smoked hashish and drank tea and wine with Harvey {{and two of his}} female companions while discussing their individual careers. Sometime around 10 p.m., Dannemann, apparently feeling left out of the conversation and jealous of the attention Hendrix was giving Harvey's female friends, became visibly upset and stormed out of the flat. Hendrix followed her, and an argument ensued between them during which Dannemann reportedly shouted: [...] "you fucking pig". Harvey, concerned that their yelling would draw unwanted attention from the police, asked them to <b>quiet</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "It {{starts off}} {{with a bit of}} {{keyboards}} that lead to a series of rapid but somewhat quiet beats over which she sings softly, almost whispering, until she reaches the chorus and fulminating beats drop. [...] "What is life?" [...] she asks during the bilingual chorus, which simply ends with the word [...] "contrail." [...] After the chorus the beats <b>quiet</b> <b>down</b> again and she once again whisper-sings. It's really quite intoxicating, the way her airy vocals gently glide over the hypnotic but subtle beats. [...] "I didn't know then, what I know now," [...] a loud, robotic voice sings -- well, it's more like it just says the words about two thirds into the song. And that somehow makes it more intense when Namie sings the chorus again and asks [...] "What is life?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Every {{year the}} Friday before final exams, Taylor University has the Silent Night Men's Basketball game. In it, {{students}} remain quiet until the 10th point is scored and then erupt in cheering. In the late {{moments of the}} game, [...] "Silent Night" [...] is sung. A former assistant coach {{came up with the}} idea in the late 80s and it was a packed event by the mid-to-late 1990s. Afterward, students can go to [...] "Habecker's Hollapalooza", which is a campus-wide party involving live Christmas music, making and eating Christmas cookies, and making gingerbread houses. The 2010 game was more formally named the 27th Annual Ivanhoe Classic and resulted in a 112–67 win over Ohio State-Marion. This was the most scored by the Taylor men's basketball team since the 1993–94 squad scored 139 points in a victory over Robert Morris University (Illinois). This allowed Taylor students to <b>quiet</b> <b>down</b> and erupt in celebration again after the 100th point. Casey Coons scored the 10th point in the 2009 Silent Night, the 2010 Silent Night, and 2011 silent night on free throws. Casey Coons received the NAIA Mid-Central College Conference Division II Player of the Week award for the week of the 2010 game. Coach Paul Patterson coached without shoes for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 games to raise money for Samaritan's Feet (400 pairs of shoes were raised at the 2009 event for the Dominican Republic and 170 pairs of shoes were raised for Guatemala at the 2010 event). Sports Illustrated paid tribute to the Silent Night Event in its December 27, 2010, issue. The 2011 game received significant media attention as well.|$|E
