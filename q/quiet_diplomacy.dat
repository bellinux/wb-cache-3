5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H. Seward {{that there would be}} no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would {{continue}} to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber-rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace treaty}} of the First Kappel War did not define {{the right of}} {{unhindered}} preaching in the Catholic states. Zwingli interpreted this to mean that preaching should be permitted, but the Five States suppressed any attempts to reform. The Burgrecht cities considered different means of applying pressure to the Five States. Basel and Schaffhausen preferred <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> while Zurich wanted armed conflict. Zwingli and Jud unequivocally advocated {{an attack on the}} Five States. Bern took a middle position which eventually prevailed. In May 1531, Zurich reluctantly agreed to impose a food blockade. It failed to have any effect and in October, Bern decided to withdraw the blockade. Zurich urged its continuation and the Burgrecht cities began to quarrel among themselves.|$|E

25|$|The 'ASEAN Way' {{refers to}} a {{methodology}} or approach to solving issues that respects the cultural norms of Southeast Asia. Masilamani and Peterson summarise it as: A working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilize compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritizes a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. <b>Quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view.

25|$|Schneerson, {{who had an}} {{intimate}} knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics, opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews. Instead he advocated <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> which he said would be more effective. Schneerson did whatever was {{in his power to}} push for the release of Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.|$|E
25|$|From 1612 onwards, and {{certainly}} by 1617, the Lerma administration was crumbling. The monopoly {{of power in}} the hands of the Lerma's Sandoval family had generated numerous enemies; Lerma's personal enrichment in office had become a scandal; Lerma's extravagant spending and personal debts was beginning to alarm his own son, Cristóbal de Sandoval, Duke of Uceda; lastly, ten years of <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> by Fathers Luis de Aliaga, Philip's confessor, and Juan de Santa Maria, Philip's daughter's confessor and a former client of Queen Margaret, had begun to apply personal and religious pressure on the king to alter his method of government. Philip remained close to Lerma, however, and supported him in becoming a cardinal in March 1618 under Pope Paul V, a position which would offer Lerma some protection as his government collapsed.|$|E
50|$|In {{his account}} of the campaigns of Gnaeus Julius Agricola (governor 78 - 84), Tacitus offers no {{specific}} information on the peoples then living in Scotland. He says that after a combination of force and <b>diplomacy</b> <b>quieted</b> discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay, campaigning against the peoples there. He did not return until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the lands that he had conquered. The Novantae were later said to have caused trouble along Hadrian's Wall, and the Gatehouse of Fleet fortlet was presumably used to subdue them.|$|R
50|$|Overseas aid {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important tool for Brazil's foreign policy. Brazil provides aid through the Brazilian Agency of Cooperation (Abbreviation: ABC; Agência Brasileira de Cooperação), in addition to offering scientific, economical, and technical support. More than half of Brazilian aid is provided to Africa, whereas Latin America receives around 20 % of Brazilian aid. The share of aid allocated to the Asian continent is small. Within Africa, more than 80 % of Brazilian aid is received by Portuguese-speaking countries. Brazil concentrates its aid for Portuguese-speaking countries in the education sector, specially in secondary and post-secondary education, {{but it is more}} committed to agricultural development in other countries. Estimated to be around $1 billion annually, Brazil is on par with China and India and ahead of many more traditional donor countries. The aid tends to consist of technical aid and expertise, alongside a <b>quiet</b> non-confrontational <b>diplomacy</b> to development results. Brazil's aid demonstrates a developing pattern of South-South aid, which has been heralded as a 'global model in waiting'. Some studies have suggested that, by giving aid, Brazil could be trying to get access to mineral and energy resources.|$|R
50|$|Tacitus {{says that}} after a {{combination}} of force and <b>diplomacy</b> <b>quieted</b> discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the Firth of Tay (some historians hold that he stopped along the Firth of Forth in that year), not returning south until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the new lands that he had conquered, and in the rebellious lands that he had re-conquered. In 82 he sailed to either Kintyre or the shores of Argyll, or to both. In 83 and 84 he moved north along Scotland's eastern and northern coasts using both land and naval forces, campaigning successfully against the inhabitants, and winning a significant victory over the northern British peoples led by Calgacus at the Battle of Mons Graupius.|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Bronfman, the new Secretary General Israel Singer (who took over from Gerhart Riegner in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: “For a long time, the World Jewish Congress {{was meant to be}} the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy.</b> This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Both he and Stephen Wise, {{working closely}} together, had been exponents of the 'democratization of Jewish life', that is, [...] "an {{informed}} and assertive public," [...] {{but under the}} stress of wartime conditions, and {{on the eve of}} the 1940 American presidential elections, they came to doubt the efficacy of public pressure, preferring a <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> behind the scenes as the more effective means of pursuing viable goals. It was this view, shared by Goldmann and Wise, which led them to strongly oppose Hillel Kook's (Peter Bergson) more aggressive and public methods of attempting to rescue Jews.|$|E

Some American Jews, including Louis Brandeis and Felix Frankfurter, did try their hands at <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> with some success, such that the quotas were being filled by 1939.

Jewish emigration rose from 700 a year in 1969 to near 40,000 in 1972. The total in Nixon's first term was more than 100,000. To maintain this flow by <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> we never used these figures for political purposes. ... The issue became public because of the success of our Middle East policy when Egypt evicted Soviet advisers. To restore its relations with Cairo, the Soviet Union put a tax on Jewish emigration. There was no Jackson-Vanik Amendment until there was a successful emigration effort. Sen. Henry Jackson, for whom I had, and continue to have, high regard, sought to remove the tax with his amendment. We thought the continuation of our previous approach of <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy</b> was the wiser course. ... Events proved our judgment correct. Jewish emigration fell to about a third of its previous high.|$|E

Instead he advocated <b>quiet</b> <b>diplomacy,</b> which he said would be more effective. Schneerson did whatever was {{in his power to}} push for the release of Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.|$|E

Historians mostly ignored Grant's decisive role in engineering the compromise. He was not a lame duck but took a deep interest in the behind-the-scenes negotiations.
