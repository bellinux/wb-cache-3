The 2010 Census of Population and Housing {{was conducted}} between 16 October and 15 November 2010, with all parts of the country covered by 30 November 2010. It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> used for data collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office. Optical Mark Reading (OMR) and Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) technology were used for data capture. The census was funded by United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Kingdom AID (UKAID-formerly DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), who contributed close to 60 per cent of the total expenditure and rest contributed by the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Zambia.|$|E

Owing to the limitations encountered in the TPQ, in that the three dimensions’ clinical utility was not readily apparent to many clinicians, Cloninger revamped the questionnaire and produced the TCI scale, which incorporates four dimensions of “temperament” and three dimensions of “character”.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: An HIV-specific {{version of}} the QUOTE <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} to measure {{the quality of care}} of patients infected with HIV from the patients' perspective. The consistency and validity of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> assessed. METHODS: Focus group discussions were held to select aspects for inclusion in the <b>questionnaire</b> that <b>are</b> important to patients with HIV. Item and inter-item analysis, factor analysis, and reliability analysis were performed to test the internal consistency and validity of the questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty seven items (13 generic and 14 HIV specific) were used in the QUOTE-HIV questionnaire. Separate factor analyses of the generic and HIV specific aspects indicated that each loaded onto a single factor. The internal consistency of the total <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> good (Cronbach's alpha >/= 0. 80). Feasibility of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> shown by the diversity of importance and performance scores for general practitioners as well as for HIV specialists and AIDS nursing consultants. CONCLUSION: The QUOTE-HIV <b>questionnaire</b> <b>is</b> a useful instrument for measuring the quality of care from the perspective of HIV infected patients. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
25|$|People could {{complete}} and submit their questionnaire online, or fill it in {{on paper and}} post it back in a pre-addressed envelope. Guidance was provided online and through the census helpline. Completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> electronically tracked and field staff followed up with households that did not return a questionnaire. Special arrangements were made to count people living in communal establishments such as; boarding schools, prisons, military bases, hospitals, care homes, student halls of residence, hotels, royal apartments and embassies, {{as well as for}} particular communities; rough sleepers, travellers and those living on waterways. In these cases field staff delivered and collected questionnaires and, where needed, provided advice or assistance in completing the questionnaire.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} members {{surveyed the}} history of execution and sent out a fact-finding questionnaire to government officials, lawyers, and medical experts all around the state asking for their opinion. The <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> a bit skewed because they pushed forward electrocution and {{did not include the}} choice of abolishing the death penalty, but, despite that, a slight majority of respondents recommended hanging over electrocution, and a few recommended the abolition of capital punishment. The commission also contacted electrical experts, including Thomson-Houston Electric Company's Elihu Thomson (who recommended high voltage AC connected to the head and the spine) and the inventor Thomas Edison (who also recommended AC, as well as using a Westinghouse generator). They also attended electrocutions of dogs by George Fell who had worked with Southwick in the early 1880s experiments. Fell was conducting further experiments, electrocuting anesthetized dissected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject.|$|E

500|$|Children were {{encouraged}} to submit their good deeds to the comic; those that had their stories printed were called MUGs, a not-so-subtle dig at the [...] "spivs" [...] who made fun of them. [...] The best of these stories were awarded the title of [...] "MUG of the Month", or [...] "MUG of the Year". [...] Readers were also invited to join an Eagle club. [...] Upon payment of a subscription, members would be given a gilt Eagle badge, a rulebook, {{and a list of}} privileges. [...] The club proved extremely popular, attracting within months a membership of about 100,000, but it also served as a research tool for Hulton; <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> sent to a random selection of members, asking each to rate certain aspects of the comic. [...] Eagles production costs were funded partly by advertising revenue, although advertisers were required to integrate their designs so as to match the comic's high standards. [...] Another of Hampson's strips, Tommy Walls, was the first commercial cartoon in any comic, and an obvious advertisement for Wall's ice cream. [...] Eagle also spawned a large range of merchandise, which included toothpaste, pyjamas, and toy ray guns. [...] Several annuals were printed; the first was announced in a September 1951 issue, in Morris's regular letter to his readers.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{studies have}} tested the {{possibility}} that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales. Moser (2009) created an Autogynephilia Scale for Women based on items used to categorize MtF transsexuals as autogynephilic in other studies. A questionnaire that included the ASW was distributed {{to a sample of}} 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of [...] "frequent" [...] arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic. However, Anne Lawrence criticized these studies' methodology and conclusions and asserted that genuine autogynephilia occurs very rarely, if ever, in natal women.|$|E
