5|$|Following {{his visit}} to Valley Forge, Allen {{traveled}} to Salisbury, arriving on May 25, 1778. There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week, and that his brother Zimri, who had been caring for Allen's family and farm, {{had died in the}} spring following his capture. The death of Heman, with whom Allen had been <b>quite</b> <b>close,</b> hit him quite hard.|$|E

5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves {{before reaching the}} target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and {{would be used to}} ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
5|$|The Blackdown Hills are crossed by {{a network}} of minor roads. There are several major roads {{including}} the A30, A303 and A35. The M5 motorway is at the northwestern boundary of the AONB. The Bristol to Exeter line {{and the remains of}} the Grand Western Canal run, <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> in places, {{to the west of the}} M5 motorway but do not pass through the Blackdown Hills. The West of England Main Line passes through the southern part of the hills between Axminster and Honiton, including a tunnel section east of Honiton.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to a much less impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
50|$|Shellls of Pseudocrioceras duvalianum {{can reach}} a diamenter of about 17 - 23 cm. These ammonites are {{tripartite}} with ancyloceratid-like coiling and <b>quite</b> <b>closed</b> spirals. The {{section of the}} horl is subrectangular. They show at first fine radial ribs with ventral tubercles, then groups of 2-3 ribs.|$|R

5|$|Upon heating, α-berkelium {{transforms}} {{into another}} phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group Fmm and {{the lattice constant}} of 500pm; this fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at room temperature. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that occur on the island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get <b>quite</b> <b>close.</b> The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the council}} broke up, {{and when the}} last had gone Mowbray joined his wife on the veranda, where he sat looking with tired eyes toward the pale red glow on the skyline left by the setting sun.

5|$|Arsenal Women are {{the most}} {{successful}} team in English women's football. In the 2008–09 season, they won all three major English trophies– the FA Women's Premier League, FA Women's Cup and FA Women's Premier League Cup, and, as of 2017, were the only English side to have won the UEFA Women's Cup or UEFA Women's Champions League, having won the Cup in the 2006–07 season {{as part of a}} unique quadruple. The men's and women's clubs are formally separate entities but have <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> ties; Arsenal Women are entitled to play once a season at the Emirates Stadium, though they usually play their home matches at Boreham Wood. At present the women have won 46 trophies in their 30-year history.|$|E
5|$|Arthur {{was served}} by sons of English, Irish and Welsh nobility, such as Gearoid Óg FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare, {{who had been}} brought to the English court as a {{consequence}} of the involvement of his father, Gerald Fitzgerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, in the crowning of pretender Lambert Simnel in Ireland during Henry VII's reign. Other servants were Anthony Willoughby, a son of Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, Robert Radcliffe, the heir of the 9th Baron FitzWalter and Maurice St John, a favourite nephew of Arthur's grandmother Lady Margaret Beaufort. He was brought up with Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas, the son of powerful Welsh nobleman Thomas ap Rhys, Gruffydd grow <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to Arthur and was buried in Worcester Cathedral upon his death in 1521, alongside the Prince's tomb.|$|E
5|$|Correspondence between Chesney and {{his nephew}} Gilbert Foliot {{suggests}} {{their relationship was}} <b>quite</b> <b>close.</b> Foliot strongly supported his uncle's candidacy for Lincoln, writing to Pope Eugene III to encourage papal approval of the election. Foliot later ordered {{a copy of the}} Digest for his uncle, which demonstrates Chesney's interest in Roman law. Some of Archbishop Theobald's letters, written to Chesney and recorded in John of Salisbury's collection of letters, contain the earliest recorded quotations from Gratian's Decretum in an English source. They were part of a letter sent by Theobald to Chesney discussing difficult legal cases, and giving advice on how to resolve them.|$|E
60|$|At last Farfrae's man, who {{had been}} agape on the doorstep, came up; then the cook.

While Elizabeth was undressing her she {{recovered}} consciousness; {{but as soon as}} she remembered what had passed the fit returned.|$|R
50|$|Borgo Vanchiglia is the {{historical}} district: a little triangle next to downtown, situated between Corso San Maurizio, Corso Regina Margherita and the Po river. District is quite popular nowadays because being <b>quite</b> <b>closer</b> {{to the heart}} of Turin nightlife Piazza Vittorio Veneto, a lot of bar and restaurants opened recently in this area. However, Vanchiglia also includes the area called Vanchiglietta, northern of Borgo Vanchiglia.|$|R

5|$|Dacre Castle was {{probably}} built by Margaret Multon, {{the wife of}} Ralph Dacre, {{in the middle of}} the 14th century. The Dacre family had risen in prominence in Cumbria during the 12th and early 13th centuries, and William Dacre, Ralph's father, had acquired a licence to crenellate the property of Dunmallogt in 1307, <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to the future site of Dacre Castle. Ralph married Margaret in 1317, becoming extremely wealth as a result, and received permission to found Naworth Castle in 1335. Margaret built Dacre Castle at some point between Ralph's death in 1339 and 1354, with the intention of creating a fortified home. Many tower houses were built across the region during the period in response to the threat of Scottish raids and invasions. There may have been an older building already on the site, possibly moated, but this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive and bold, {{especially}} {{in the presence of}} food, the silvertip shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. Often, several Silvertip sharks will rush up from deep water to inspect divers when they first enter the water, which can be a very intimidating experience, as the sharks may approach <b>quite</b> <b>close.</b> This species has also been known to circle or pursue divers. In one experiment involving bait, a large silvertip shark tore the leg off a dummy dressed in SCUBA gear, demonstrating that this species is capable of inflicting lethal injuries. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed four provoked attacks attributable to this species, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio but they say that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E

30|$|There {{are many}} {{electromechanical}} oscillation modes with similar frequency in inter-connected power systems. Practically, only several lightly damped modes {{which can be}} found by first-principle modeling are of interest. However, many estimated modes are <b>quite</b> <b>closer</b> so that one cannot determine the mode corresponding to the one of interest. The importance of mode matching is to ensure the correctness of the estimates, i.e., the estimated mode should correspond to the mode of interest.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{describe}} {{surface shape}} of the dust particle comprehensively, uses the bidirectional CCD to shoot picture of dust particle, through recognizing the bidirectional particle picture, matching the particle, computing the fractal results of identical particle in two pictures, and integrating two fractal results, obtains the dust particle bidirectional fractal. The results indicated that three fractal dimensions of spherical particle are <b>quite</b> <b>closed,</b> but the three fractal dimensions of flat type particle are significantly different...|$|R
5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to one another.|$|E
5|$|The brolga breeds {{throughout}} its range in Australia and New Guinea. The {{start of the}} breeding season is largely determined by rainfall rather than the time of year; thus the season is February to May after the rainy season in the monsoonal areas, and September to December in southern Australia. The flocks split up and pairs establish nesting territories in wetlands. In food-rich habitats, nests can be <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> together, and are often found {{in the same area}} as those of the sarus crane. The nest, which is built by both sexes, is a raised mound of sticks, uprooted grass, and other plant material sited on a small island in shallow water, or occasionally floating. If no grasses are available, mud or roots unearthed from marsh beds are employed. Sometimes the birds make hardly any nest, take over a disused swan nest, or simply lay on bare ground.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow is less social {{than other}} sparrows while breeding, {{due to its}} dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it {{sometimes}} breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, {{it has not been}} recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be <b>quite</b> <b>close</b> to the ground, especially when they are built in trees.|$|E
