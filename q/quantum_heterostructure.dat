40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2008. major: Electrical Engineering. Advisor: Joseph J. Talghader. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF). ix, 106 pages. Band-gap engineering of semiconductor heterostructures has become commonplace for laser diodes and photodetectors. However, the quantum states {{of these devices}} are largely fixed during crystal growth. This thesis presents a novel method to control the energy of electron states of surface wells. In essence the method adjusts the thickness of a surface quantum well through controlled interaction with a second well. A cantilever with a <b>quantum</b> <b>heterostructure</b> on its underside collapses {{on top of an}} identical heterostructure. The air gap between the well serves as a potential barrier and its width determines the interaction between the wells. At the tip the electron gases of both wells overlap to form a well of their combined width. Along the cantilever, the varying air gap dictates the interaction between the wells. A transition zone forms where the electronic configuration changes from the fully coupled case to the case of two individual wells. After successfully releasing cantilevers, interferometric measurements showed that the shape of the collapsed cantilevers matches with theoretical calculations. Van-der-Waals forces across the 125 nm wide air gap do not affect its shape. An actuator to adjust the well separation is demonstrated. It provides vertical deflections from 17 nm towards to 5 nm away from the surface with atomic resolution. Photoluminescence experiments at 4. 2 K investigate the energy of electron states. Quantum coupling is demonstrated in 200 Å wide surface quantum wells. The energy shift of up to 12 meV matches well with theoretical calculations...|$|E

The method has been proved numerically efficient and accurate by comparing with some results of the APM approach.

First, the band structure and band offset of the InGaAs/InAlAs QW heterostructures can be flexibly tailored for different application purposes by varying either the composition or {{the thickness of the}} InGaAs active layer and the InAlAs barrier layer accordingly [11, 12]. Second, the wavelength of InGaAs/InAlAs QW inter-band transitions can cover the standard 1.31 - and 1.55 -μm optical communication wavelengths [13]. Third, the large conduction-band offset of the InGaAs/InAlAs system enables a strong electron confinement and subsequently a high-temperature stability and a high-speed modulation capability for InGaAs/InAlAs devices [14, 15]. This makes these structures very attractive and suitable for quantum cascade lasers, inter-subband detectors, and devices based on nonlinear optical properties [16 – 18].
