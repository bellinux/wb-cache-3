To avoid conflicts of interest, Pritzker {{agreed to sell}} her interest in at least 221 companies and resign from 158 entities, including the Hyatt Board of Directors and the Chicago Board of Education. Later that month, on May23, the Senate held its confirmation hearing, which covered a variety of topics. Although Pritzker's family business dealings had been a target of Republican criticism when Obama announced her nomination, only three <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hearing related to her family. Pritzker was confirmed by the full Senate on June25, {{by a vote of}} 97 to 1. Pritzker was sworn in as Secretary on June26, 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Reader (Der Vorleser) is a {{novel by}} German law {{professor}} and judge Bernhard Schlink, published in Germany in 1995 and in the United States in 1997. The story is a parable, dealing with the difficulties post-war German generations have had comprehending the Holocaust; Ruth Franklin writes that it was aimed specifically at the generation Bertolt Brecht called the Nachgeborenen, those who came after. Like other novels in the genre of Vergangenheitsbewältigung, the struggle {{to come to terms}} with the past, The Reader explores how the post-war generations should approach the generation that took part in, or witnessed, the atrocities. These are the <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of Holocaust literature in the late 20th and early 21st century, as the victims and witnesses die and living memory fades.|$|E

25|$|Montoto {{went on to}} be the {{president}} of Metropolitano, a railway consortium. During Montoto's tenure in this position, the General Audit Office and ARI both issued reports stating that the awarding of this concession to him had led to deterioration in the railway service. Montoto's partnership in this and other early ventures with Sergio Tasselli, a leading K-businessman, also raised <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. In 2003, La Nación said that Tasselli, whose businesses, according to the newspaper, are always under “a pall of suspicion,” was “quietly building an economic empire” that was growing “in the shadows,” and that his “associates generally do not come from the world of business but from the world of politics, such as former Montoneros leader Mario Montoto.” Instead of improving the train service provided by Metropolitano, Montoto reportedly directed Alejandra Rafuls to film train operations and to edit the film {{in such a way as}} to make it look as if customers were themselves responsible for the service problems.|$|E

Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for him, and that he hopes they all die.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{went through}} several changes in production: working titles {{included}} [...] "Old Friends" [...] and [...] "Black Ops", {{the latter being}} set in an army base. Davies requested that Whithouse set it in a school instead, mainly for simplicity, but also for a desire for the Doctor to masquerade as a school teacher. Additionally, the Krillitanes were to be named [...] "Krillians" [...] until the BBC found the name was trademarked, and Finch's forename was originally Hector, until the BBC found a real teacher by the same name, and renamed him Lucas. K9's eye grill was initially filmed flashing in sync with his lines, not unlike the Daleks, until Phil Collinson saw the footage and nixed the practice (which was inconsistent with the robot dog's past appearances). A scene that was cut was of Milo's brain being [...] "shorted out" [...] by the Doctor's rapid-fire <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the episode, which was later alluded to in the episode.|$|E

[...] Hunter and Hendry made high breaks of 49 and 55 in defeating Brian Morgan and Jimmy Michie 5–1, respectively. After the match Hendry—the world number two and a seven-time world champion said [...] "I feel like going to apologise to each fan one by one because {{it was such a}} bad match". John Higgins whitewashed Barry Pinches 5–0, compiling a 132 break in the last frame in a match where Pinches made a high break of 33. Jimmy White overcame James Wattana 5–4 having trailed 2–3. Graeme Dott defeated Drew Henry 5-3 and Quinten Hann beat Simon Bedford 5–0. In the last game of the day, Drago beat Alan McManus 5–4.|$|E
500|$|Under Idaho law, conspirators were {{considered}} to be legally present {{at the scene of the}} crime. Using this provision, the local county prosecutor in Idaho drew up extradition papers for Haywood, Moyer, and George Pettibone which described them as having been physically present in Idaho at the time of the murder, which they were not. [...] McParland arrived in Denver on Thursday, February 15, and presented the extradition papers to Colorado Governor McDonald, who, by prior arrangement with the governor of Idaho, accepted them immediately. But Denver sheriff's deputies waited until Saturday evening to arrest Haywood, Pettigrew, and Moyer, then held the three in the Denver Jail, and refused requests by the three to contact lawyers and family. When reporters began asking <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Denver Jail, the three prisoners were secretly taken to the Oxford Hotel, where they were held overnight. Early Sunday morning the prisoners were put on a special train, and guarded by Colorado militia, were sped to Idaho. Unionists regarded the incident to be a kidnapping, to extradite them to Idaho before the courts in Denver could intervene. The events were so extraordinary that even American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers, who had little good to say about the WFM, directed his union to raise funds for the defense. However, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a habeas corpus appeal (George Pettibone v. Jasper C Nichols), ruling that the arrest and extradition were legal, with only Justice Joseph McKenna dissenting.|$|E

2500|$|While {{serving as}} {{boss of the}} Luciano family in the 1950s, Costello {{suffered}} from depression and panic attacks. During this period Costello sought help from a psychiatrist, who advised him {{to distance himself from}} old associates such as Genovese and spend more time with politicians. In the early 1950s, U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee began investigating organized crime in New York in the Kefauver hearings. The Committee summoned numerous mobsters to testify, but they refused to answer <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hearings. The mobsters uniformly cited the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a legal protection against self-incrimination. However, when Costello was summoned, he agreed to answer <b>questions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hearings and not take the Fifth Amendment. As part of the agreement to testify, the Special Committee and the U.S. television networks agreed not to broadcast Costello's face. During the questioning, Costello nervously refused to answer certain questions and skirted around others. When the Committee asked Costello, [...] "What have you done for your country Mr. Costello?", he famously replied, [...] "Paid my tax!". The TV cameras, unable to show Costello's face, instead focused on his hands, which Costello wrung nervously while answering questions. Costello eventually walked out of the hearings.|$|E
