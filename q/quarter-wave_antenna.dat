40|$|Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) is a {{numerical}} method {{often used to}} analyze interaction of electromagnetic radiation with complex geometries.

5000|$|On 31 May 1960 {{the hold}} of the [...] was {{converted}} into studios, transmitter room and crew quarters at the Norder Werft shipyard in Hamburg, West Germany. Due to laws restricting work on the unlicensed installation of broadcasting equipment at the port, the ship, now renamed Bon Jour, {{was taken to the}} free port at Langelinie, Copenhagen. A 125-foot mast to support the broadcasting antenna coupled to two 10,000 watts LTV-Continental Electronics (CEMCO) transmitters was then assembled and installed. The transmitters had been flown in from the factory at Dallas, Texas in six thousand parts. The original antenna design called for fore and aft masts with a horizontal antenna slung between (as on Radio Veronica's ship Borkum Riff). However, final design was an inverted V supported by the single foremast, forming a folded unipole antenna. This design was chosen because the mast was too short to support a conventional <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} theory of {{resonances}} of time harmonic fields in resonating cavities, based on the Helmholtz equation, we have presented the principle of operation of the Reverberation Chamber (RC) : a n electrically large cavity where the resonant frequencies are changed with a tunerin order to obtain a uniform maximum electric field, within a time cycle. This type of test facility {{can be used as}} an alternative to the conventional Semi-Anechoic Room (SAR) for testing the immunity of electronic equipment to high intensity radiofrequency fields. But, at the opposite of the deterministic environment present in a SAR, the RC generates electromagnetic waves with a direction of incidence, a polarization and a time of arrival on the Equipment Under Test (EUT) that are varying randomly in time. The presented research had two objectives: the firstis to conceive, design and evaluate the efficiency of innovative and less cumbersome tuning systems and the second is to compare the severity level of RC and SAR for immunity testing by using both facilities available at Royal Military Academy (RMA). The first innovative tuning method (RAIL) we have conceived, designed and assessed in the RC at RMA is a dynamic source-mode tuning based on a translation movement of two broadband antennas on two orthogonal rails. The efficiency analysis shows that it complies with the field uniformity requirement ofthe IEC 61000 - 4 - 21. The second innovative tuning method (STATIC) we have conceived and investigated in the same RC is based on a fixed network of sixteen static antennas where a limited subset of eight antennas is randomly activated by means of fast electronic switches. Tuning is obtained without any movement in the RC. The technological breakthrough is that important testing time reduction can be achievedwhen using the STATIC tuner instead of using conventional mechanical tuners. Using the RAIL tuner, we develop a new method for measuring the radiation efficiency of an antenna in a RC without the need of a reference antenna. In order to perform a severity comparison of the immunity testing to Electric fields between a SAR and a RC, a Canonical Equipment Under Test (CEUT) has been designed, developed and manufactured at the RMA. It is an original realization with no equivalent in the EMC community. An unexpected development of this initiative lies in the fact that it has been accepted as reference material for interlaboratory testing in the field of radiated immunitytesting to RF, according to IEC 61000 - 4 - 3. Moreover, EMC testing laboratories in Germany and Japan have shown interest and have participated inthis campaign. The comparison of radiatedimmunity testing performed both in a SAR and a RC has produced several interesting results. Applied to test RS 103 of the MIL-STD- 461 F, it meansthat with one aspect angle in a SAR, it is recommended to use from 20 to 30 tuner steps, in a RC, in order to achieve equivalence of testing results. For the IEC 61000 - 4 - 3, testing with 4 aspect angles in a SAR willneed from 40 to 60 tuner steps for equivalence. Finally, we have shown experimentally that, in a RC, spatial averages and time averages are equal; this is a characteristic of ergodic processes. This experimental demonstration of ergodicity establishes a scientific breakthrough since, as far as we know, there is no literature about this subject yet. From now on, we can say that the stochastic generation of an electric field in a RC is a stationary process and that various statistical parameters in its volume can be estimatedby measuring the time average in a fixed spatial point.

40|$|The RF {{system of}} the CERN PS is being {{upgraded}} to bunch a beam that can be captured by the SPS 200 MHz RF system for injection into LHC. Two identical 80 MHz cavities {{are part of this}} PS upgrade program. At CERN, the cavity has been designed using SUPERFISH and MAFIA concerning its shape, tuning devices and amplifier coupling loop. TRIUMF has built a simplified full-scale, copper-lined, wooden model, designed such that the field patterns of the fundamental accelerating mode and the longitudinal modes agree closely to CERN cavity ones. The aim of constructing the wooden model was primarily to check the design of the capacitive tuners, the power coupling loop and the HOM dampers for the longitudinal modes up to 1 GHz. The results of the measurements were used to define the parameters of the tuners and a reliable model to describe the interaction of the coupling loop with the fundamental mode of the final CERN cavity. Four <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>antennae</b> are adequate to damp the first fifteen longitudinal modes. In order not to decrease the shunt impedance of the fundamental mode by more than 5 %, three-element filters have been used with the antenna which damps the longitudinal mode at 256 MHz, 336 MHz and 912 MHz. ...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>quarter-wave</b> {{monopole}} <b>antenna</b> is a single-element antenna fed at one end, that behaves as a dipole antenna. It {{is formed}} by a conductor [...] in length, fed {{in the lower}} end, which is near a conductive surface which works as a reflector (see effect of ground) and {{is an example of}} a Marconi antenna. The current in the reflected image has the same direction and phase as the current in the real <b>antenna.</b> The <b>quarter-wave</b> conductor and its image together form a half-wave dipole that radiates only in the upper half of space.|$|R
5000|$|Another type of {{patch antenna}} is the planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA).The PIFA {{is common in}} {{cellular}} phones (mobile phones) with built-in antennas.The antenna is resonant at a quarter-wavelength (thus reducing the required space needed on the phone), and also typically has good SAR properties.This antenna resembles an inverted F, which explains the PIFA name. The PIFA is popular {{because it has a}} low profile and an omnidirectional pattern.These antennas are derived from a <b>quarter-wave</b> half-patch <b>antenna.</b> The shorting plane of the half-patch is reduced in length which decreases the resonance frequency.Often PIFA antennas have multiple branches to resonate at the various cellular bands. On some phones, grounded parasitic elements are used to enhance the radiation bandwidth characteristics.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the rubber}} ducky, antennas on {{portable}} radios usually consisted of <b>quarter-wave</b> whip <b>antennas,</b> rods whose length was {{one-quarter of the}} wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] In the VHF range where they were used, these antennas were 2 or 3 feet long, making them cumbersome. They were often made of telescoping tubes that could be retracted when not in use. To make the antenna more compact, electrically short antennas, shorter than one-quarter wavelength, began to be used. Electrically short antennas have considerable capacitive reactance, so to make them resonant at the operating frequency an inductor (loading coil) is added in series with the antenna. Antennas which have these inductors built into their bases are called base-loaded whips.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{practical}} {{drawback to}} this band {{is that because}} of the length of the waves, full size resonant antennas (half wave dipole or quarter wave monopole antennas) cannot be built because of their physical height. Vertical antennas must be used because VLF waves propagate in vertical polarization, but a <b>quarter-wave</b> vertical <b>antenna</b> at 30 kHz would be 2.5 kilometers high. So practical transmitting antennas are electrically short, a small fraction of a wavelength long. [...] Due to their low radiation resistance they are inefficient, radiating only 10% to 50% of the transmitter power at most, [...] {{with the rest of the}} power dissipated in the antenna/ground system resistances. Very high power transmitters (~1 megawatt) are required to radiate enough power for long distance communication.|$|R
5000|$|Whip antennas are {{normally}} designed as resonant antennas; the rod {{acts as a}} resonator for radio waves, with standing waves of voltage and current reflected {{back and forth from}} its ends. Therefore, the length of the antenna rod is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. The most common length is approximately one-quarter of the wavelength, called a [...] "quarter-wave whip" [...] (although often shortened by the use of a loading coil; see Electrically short whips below). For example, the common <b>quarter-wave</b> whip <b>antennas</b> used on FM radios in the USA are approximately 75 cm long, which is roughly one-quarter the length of radio waves in the FM radio band, which are 2.78 to 3.41 meters long. Half-wave antennas are also common.|$|R

The combination of 4 circular patches of Design 1 and the additional of quarter wave impedance matching technique for Design 2 {{have been used}} to design the X-circular polarized with slanted rectangular slot microstrip patch antenna. The designs are simulated using Computer Simulation Technology (CST) with dielectric constant, εr= 4. 3 and tan δ= 0. 019 and thickness of substrate, t= 1. 6 mm. The simulation results such as return loss, bandwidth, gain, directivity and polarization have been compared.

40|$|Abstract—Three-dimensional Finite-Difference in Time-Domain {{method is}} applied to {{simulate}} Low Frequency antennas {{in the presence of}} natural environments. All antennas are made up of wires set down on a square shaped ground plane and their dimensions depend on the wavelength of the source. Both monopole and inverted L antennas are considered in this paper. The antenna systems are computed in the presence of two examples of natural elements: a large forest and then {{on the top of a}} hill. The main aim of this paper is to show the effects of these environments on the properties of the antennas and on the efficiency of the ground wave excitation. The outcome of these investigations shows a power ratio enhancement of several decibels when the two kinds of antenna described in this paper are located on the top of a hill. On the other hand, the effects of a large forest depend on the geometry of the antenna. It doesn’t affect the radiation of a <b>quarter-wave</b> monopole <b>antenna,</b> on the contrary losses disrupt radiation when an inverted L antenna is built in the middle of a large forest. 1...|$|R
50|$|They {{are used}} as {{transmitting}} antennas below 1 MHz, in the LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical to build a full size <b>quarter-wave</b> monopole <b>antenna.</b> Either the central mast itself, insulated from the ground, {{is connected to the}} transmitter and serves as the radiating element, or vertical wires parallel to the mast. At the low frequencies used the height of the mast is typically 1/10 to 1/40 of a wavelength, so it makes a very electrically short antenna, and by itself would have very low radiation resistance and be a very inefficient radiator. The function of the umbrella-wires is to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna, improving the current distribution on the vertical mast radiator to increase the radiation resistance and radiated power. The umbrella wires serve as the plate of a capacitor, with the ground serving as the other plate, which is charged and discharged by the radio frequency current from the tramsmitter. Umbrella antennas with heights of 15 to 460 metres are in service. The tallest umbrella antennas are actually used by Lualualei VLF transmitter, INS Kattabomman and the CHAYKA-transmitters at Inta and Dudinka.|$|R
5000|$|In {{electrical}} systems involving {{transmission lines}} (such as radio and fiber optics)—where {{the length of}} the line is long compared to the wavelength of the signal (the signal changes rapidly compared to {{the time it takes to}} travel from source to load)— the impedances at each end of the line must be matched to the transmission line's characteristic impedance (...) to prevent reflections of the signal at the ends of the line. (When {{the length of the}} line is short compared to the wavelength, impedance mismatch is the basis of transmission-line impedance transformers; see previous section.) In radio-frequency (RF) systems, a common value for source and load impedances is 50 ohms. A typical RF load is a <b>quarter-wave</b> ground plane <b>antenna</b> (37 ohms with an ideal ground plane; it can be matched to 50 ohms by using a modified ground plane or a coaxial matching section, i.e., part or all the feeder of higher impedance).|$|R
40|$|Great {{structural}} {{variety is}} seen in the eyespot of dinoflagellates, a structure involved in phototaxis. Although there are several works on the phototactic responses in some species of dinoflagellates, none of the dinoflagellates used in these studies possessed an eyespot and, therefore, we have no knowledge of the relationship between eyespot type and phototactic response. In this study, we determined wavelength dependency curves for phototaxis in four marine dinoflagellates that possess a different type of either eyespot or chloroplast. These include: (i) a dinoflagellate possessing a peridinin-containing chloroplast with an eyespot (Scrippsiella hexapraecingula Horiguchi et Chihara); (ii) a dinoflagellate containing a diatom endosymbiont and with the type B eyespot sensu Dodge (1984; (Peridinium foliaceum (Stein) Biecheler); (iii) a dinoflagellate with peridinin-containing chloroplasts, but lacking an eyespot (Alexandrium hiranoi Kita et Fukuyo); and (iv) a dinoflagellate with fucoxanthin, 192 ̆ 7 -hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin and 192 ̆ 7 -butanoyloxyfucoxanthin, but lacking an eyespot (Gymnodinium mikimotoi Miyabe et Kominami ex Oda). Regardless of the eyespot or the chloroplast type, all four dinoflagellates showed similar wavelength dependency curves for phototaxis, with sensitivity between 380 and 520 nm, the highest peak at approximately 440 or 460 nm and smaller peaks or shoulders at 400 - 420 nm and 480 - 500 nm. Substantial peaks have also been noted in the ultraviolet range (260 - 280 nm). The ultrastructural study of the eyespot of Scrippsiella hexapraecingula revealed that the eyespot consists of two layers of lipid globules and probably acts as a <b>quarter-wave</b> stack <b>antenna...</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{the length}} of the wire {{segments}} are shorter than a quarter wavelength (λ/4) of the radio waves, as is typical for use below 1 MHz, the antenna functions as a vertical electrically short monopole antenna with capacitive top-loading. [...] Because the two horizontal arms of the [...] "T" [...] have equal but oppositely-directed currents in them, which causes the radio waves from them to cancel far from the antenna, and because of similar cancelling ground currents, the horizontal wire radiates little radio power. [...] Instead it serves to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna. [...] This increases the currents in the upper portion of the vertical wire (see drawing at right), increasing the radiation resistance and thus its efficiency, allowing it to radiate more power, or in a receiving antenna be more sensitive to incoming radio signals. The top load wire can increase radiated power by 2 to 4 times (3 to 6 dB) for a given base current. However, the antenna is still typically not as efficient as a full-height λ/4 vertical monopole, [...] and has a higher Q and thus a narrower bandwidth. T antennas are typically used at low frequencies where it is not practical to build a <b>quarter-wave</b> vertical <b>antenna</b> because of its height, and the vertical radiating wire is often very electrically short, only a small fraction of a wavelength long, 0.1λ or less. Since the radiation resistance and efficiency increases with height, the antenna should be suspended as high as possible. The antenna has a base impedance with a capacitive component that must be tuned out with an added inductor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ground plane}} {{used with a}} {{monopole}} may be the actual earth; {{in this case the}} antenna is mounted on the ground and one side of the feedline is connected to an earth ground {{at the base of the}} antenna. This design is used for the mast radiator antennas employed in radio broadcasting at low frequencies, as well as other low frequency antennas such as the T-antenna and umbrella antenna. At VHF and UHF frequencies the size of the ground plane needed is smaller, so artificial ground planes are used to allow the antenna to be mounted above the ground. A common type of monopole antenna at these frequencies consists of a <b>quarter-wave</b> whip <b>antenna</b> with a ground plane consisting of several wires or rods radiating horizontally or diagonally from its base; this is called a ground-plane antenna. At gigahertz frequencies the metal surface of a car roof or airplane body makes a good ground plane, so car cell phone antennas consist of short whips mounted on the roof, and aircraft communication antennas frequently consist of a short conductor in an aerodynamic fairing projecting from the fuselage; this is called a blade antenna. [...] The most common antenna used in mobile phones is the inverted-F antenna, which is a variant of the inverted-L monopole. Bending over the antenna saves space and keeps the it within the bounds of the mobile's case but the antenna then has a very low impedance. To improve the match the antenna is not fed from the end, rather some intermediate point, and the end is grounded instead. The quarter-wave whip and rubber ducky antennas used with handheld radios such as walkie-talkies and cell phones are also monopole antennas. These don't use a ground plane, and the ground side of the transmitter is just connected to the ground connection on its circuit board. The hand and body of the person holding them may function as a rudimentary ground plane.|$|R
