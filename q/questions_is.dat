5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios used to ask him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E
5|$|What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical <b>Questions</b> <b>is</b> a non-fiction book by Randall Munroe {{in which}} the author answers {{hypothetical}} science questions sent to him by readers of his webcomic, xkcd. The book contains a selection of questions and answers originally published on his blog What If?, along with several new ones. The book is divided into several dozen chapters, {{most of which are}} devoted to answering a unique question. What If? was released in September 2, 2014 and was received positively by critics.|$|E

25|$|Connected {{with many}} of these <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> {{the role of women}} in the {{sciences}} (including researchers’ wives and female friends). Djerassi’s plays recognize the special contributions women make as scientists and to science, both directly and indirectly. His female characters are usually depicted as strong and independent, proving a strong impact of feminist thinking on his work.|$|E
25|$|Tone is not lexically {{significant}} in Portuguese, but phrase- and sentence-level tones are important. As in most Romance languages, interrogation on yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> expressed mainly by sharply raising the tone {{at the end}} of the sentence. Exception is the word 'oi' that is subject to meaning changes: in exclamation tone 'oi' means 'hi/hello', in interrogative tone 'oi' means 'I didn't understand'.|$|E
30|$|To do the comparison, {{we first}} {{implemented}} {{a method for}} machine-generating questions from a biology knowledge base. A second set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> formed by selecting questions retrieved from the web. The authors of most web <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> probably students and not biology experts. Our third set of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> comprised of professional human-generated questions from textbooks and a biology study website ([URL] University biology students were recruited to act as judges. They rated the three sets of questions on four measures. Our primary <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether the machine-generated <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> worse than the human-generated ones. We were also interested in whether {{the two types of}} human-authored <b>questions</b> <b>were</b> of different quality.|$|R

25|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to train a child for a WISC test or other gifted test. Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information. It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program. Reviewing actual test questions can confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> a possibility.|$|E
25|$|The clearest {{illustration}} of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> {{to be found in}} Pusey's attitude towards ritualism. Pusey, the only pre-eminent first-generation leader of Anglo-Catholicism to survive into the second generation, had no sympathy with the preoccupation with ritual. However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned {{as a result of the}} Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.|$|E

30|$|Will the new NQS really measure FDC {{quality or}} does it measure how the scheme ‘monitors’ quality in each {{residence}} by assuming all residences are the same? These two <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> quite different — the first <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a validity issue related to measuring quality and the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> an evaluation of how the NQS is operating in FDC schemes. Indeed, the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not really about a measuring quality.|$|R
25|$|Quaestiones quaedam philosophicae (Certain {{philosophical}} <b>questions)</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} {{given to a}} set of notes that Isaac Newton kept for himself during his early years in Cambridge. They concern questions in the natural philosophy of the day that interested him. Apart from the light it throws on the formation of his own agenda for research, the major interest in these notes is the documentation of the unaided development of the scientific method in the mind of Newton, whereby every question is put to experimental test.|$|E
25|$|Some natural {{questions}} are: {{under what}} circumstances does this formalism work, and for what operators L are expansions in series of other operators like this possible? Can any function f be {{expressed in terms of}} the eigenfunctions (are they a Schauder basis) and {{under what circumstances}} does a point spectrum or a continuous spectrum arise? How do the formalisms for infinite-dimensional spaces and finite-dimensional spaces differ, or do they differ? Can these ideas be extended to a broader class of spaces? Answering such <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> the realm of spectral theory and requires considerable background in functional analysis and matrix algebra.|$|E
25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four <b>questions,</b> <b>is</b> a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential alcohol problems. The questionnaire takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E

25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), {{it would be interesting}} to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.|$|E
25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} non-response bias is that answering <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people must answer these questions and won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
50|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>are</b> {{of three}} types—Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one {{to which a}} member desires an oral answer in the House and which is {{distinguished}} by an asterisk mark. An unstarred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one which is not called for oral answer {{in the house and}} on which no supplementary <b>questions</b> can consequently <b>be</b> asked. An answer to such a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> given in writing. Minimum period of notice for starred/ unstarred <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 10 clear days.

500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the next {{question is whether the}} patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. [...] A patient who can answer all of these <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> said to be [...] "alert and oriented times four" [...] (sometimes denoted [...] "A" [...] on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, the Terrain Gallery {{opened with}} Dorothy Koppelman as {{founding}} director.

500|$|The {{original}} values statement was, and remains, controversial. [...] U.S. Green Party co-founder John Rensenbrink credits it {{with helping}} {{to unify the}} often contentious Greens.

[...] Greta Gaard says it fails to call {{for the elimination of}} capitalism or racism. [...] Looking back after 20 years, Green activist Brian Tokar said that [...] "the voice of the original [...] <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> distinctly personal … and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms." [...] A [...] "modified" [...] list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens' political platform. [...] However, all the open-ended questions were replaced by declaratory sentences, and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left, rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right.|$|E
