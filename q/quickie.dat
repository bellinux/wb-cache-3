5|$|The D'Angelo-indebted grind session 'Rocket' and frisky 'Drunk In Love' are {{similarly}} sexy, but they're not sexy like a glamour shot or a steamy video. They're sexy like an overeager, pre-shower <b>quickie,</b> or a hushed morning make-out session before the baby wakes up. These {{are the most}} unapologetically raunchy songs she's ever sung, {{and in many ways}} also the most romantic.|$|E

Following a preliminary canard project (model 49), a tandem wing configuration was eventually designed, to be powered by an 18hp Onan industrial engine. The prototype (Rutan model 54) was built in 1977 and registered as N77Q. After 5 months of testing, <b>Quickie</b> Aircraft marketed the aircraft as the Rutan model 54 <b>Quickie</b> in 1978.|$|E

500|$|... "'Till the World Ends' {{was already}} the best Britney single since 'Toxic', an ecstatic Euroclub floor-filler {{about wanting to}} dance until the world ends and other {{important}} matters. Then they added the Nicki Minaj verse. In her 45-second evisceration, Nicki manages to squeeze in chicken noises and the words 'poultry', 'Epsom salt', and 'Ricki Lake'-- {{not to mention the}} immortal diss 'Sniff, sniff, criiiies/ I done slayed your entire fucking liiiiife.' (Fact: In 2011, pretty much any song in the world could be made infinitely better by the addition of a Nicki Minaj verse.) Sprinkle a little bit of Ke$ha, the song's co-writer, on the chorus, and you've got a three-headed diva Hydra that sums up the recent changing of the femme pop guard from airbrushed and perfect to (relatively) weird and chaotic. It's the year's greatest <b>quickie</b> cash-in remix created to boost the chart position of a floundering single. Considering the ubiquity of the practice, that's saying something." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Jason Newman from MTV Buzzworthy, All I Want Is You is [...] "a diverse album {{rooted in}} R and hip-hop, thoughtfully laced with {{elements}} of classic rock, funk and electro". Marc Hogan from Spin said it featured neo soul music, while AllMusic critic David Jeffries {{described it as}} a [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "sexy" [...] synthesis of influences from Prince, Kanye West, and electro. [...] "Girl Like You" [...] and [...] "Hard Way" [...] feature aggressive hip hop beats, while [...] "Pay Me" [...] and [...] "To the Moon" [...] explore European electronic music and EDM, respectively. The album's first half features two romantic songs, an interlude, a song about a prostitute, and another about a <b>quickie.</b> The closing track [...] "My Piece" [...] uses a [...] "piece"-"peace" [...] homonym. Jeffries said the album featured Miguel's [...] "sly sense of humor". On [...] "Sure Thing", Miguel sang about loyalty in a passionate committed relationship.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{noticed the}} {{combination}} of musical genres. Christina Kelly from Rolling Stone magazine criticised the group's image, and added that their songs, including [...] "Wannabe," [...] were [...] "a watered-down mix of hip-hop and cheesy pop balladry, brought together by a manager with a marketing concept." [...] Matt Diehl of Entertainment Weekly {{said that it was}} [...] "more a compendium of music styles (from ABBA-style choruses to unconvincing hip hop) than an actual song," [...] and Sara Scribner of the Los Angeles Times described it as [...] "a bubblegum hip-hop confection of rapping lifted off Neneh Cherry and Monie Love albums." [...] Charles Aaron of Spin magazine called it [...] "a <b>quickie,</b> mid-'80s teen paperback come to life [...] so gooey it melts in your hands, not in your mouth." [...] The song ranked at fifteenth on Village Voice's 1997 [...] "Pazz & Jop" [...] critics' poll, conducted by music journalist Robert Christgau.|$|E
500|$|Ned reluctantly {{agrees with}} this and asks Homer to teach him the secret to his lust for life. This leads Homer to head towards Mr. Burns' Casino, but when Ned reminds Homer it is now defunct, Homer instead takes Ned on a {{gambling}} trip to Las Vegas. Homer is confident about going there, but Flanders is nervous. When they arrive, they see Captain Lance Murdock (from [...] "Bart the Daredevil") doing one of his stunts, and Homer chooses to volunteer, and survives (although Murdock is again badly injured). They wander into a casino called [...] "Nero's Palace" [...] and begin to play roulette. Ned protests against games of chance because of Deuteronomy 7, but Homer ignores him and takes the reference as a lucky number. They win, but immediately lose all they won. They {{then go to the}} casino's bar, and Ned gives into temptation and gets drunk on wine spritzers. Homer and Ned wake up the next morning in their hotel room married to two cocktail waitresses: Homer's new wife is named Amber, and Ned's new wife is Ginger. Homer finally realizes he got in over his head. While Homer fantasizes about bigamy, Ned snaps Homer back to reality by saying they were drunk and thus not of sound judgement to have such <b>quickie,</b> plastic weddings; also they are already married.|$|E
500|$|Rick Thames, {{editor of}} The Charlotte Observer, criticized the book's {{packaging}} calling the cover as [...] "tacky, hot pink-and-acid green sleeves, featuring an unflattering {{photo of the}} dished artist." [...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these <b>quickie</b> knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or any way of predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{relationship}} between Francesa and Russo, Francesa said, [...] "It was an arranged marriage and almost a <b>quickie</b> divorce."

[...] However, Russo said in an interview, [...] "I think that, in the long term, the station sees us as a tandem and {{would not want to}} break the brand up... And to tell you the truth, after almost 20 years together, Mike and I are like a married couple: It would be too hard to leave him. I never thought I would hear myself say this, but it would feel very strange to be on the air without him." ...|$|E
