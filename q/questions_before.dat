In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|The Assembly {{had already}} done {{significant}} work on a catechism between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five <b>questions,</b> <b>before</b> it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The Larger Catechism was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter Catechism {{was based on the}} Larger Catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E

Rachael answers over 100 <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> Deckard determines she is a replicant. The theatrical cut's voice-over ending said that as an experimental replicant, Rachael didn't have the four-year life but the Director's Cut did not address this.

25|$|In a {{study by}} Føllesdal, the MSCEIT test results of 111 {{business}} leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was {{found that there were}} no correlations between a leader's test results and how he or she was rated by the employees, with regard to empathy, ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the MSCEIT test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> scoring but without stating this officially.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2006, Beazley {{focussed}} much of the Labor Party's parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) scandal, which allegedly involved bribes and kickbacks with the then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, that universally breached UN sanctions, to which Australia was a signatory. The situation reached a climax in the aftermath of Treasurer Peter Costello's 2006 Budget, whereby {{for the first time in}} recent Australian political history, the opposition leader and his colleagues ceased inquiry on the budget papers after just six <b>questions,</b> <b>before</b> resuming further questioning on the AWB scandal. The media criticised the ALP, although many ministers acknowledged the need for the Government to be held accountable for the AWB scandal.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his removal, Parkin {{had given}} {{talks on the}} role of U.S. {{military}} contractor Halliburton in the Iraq war and led a small protest outside the Sydney headquarters of Halliburton subsidiary KBR. The Attorney-General at that time, Philip Ruddock, refused to explain the reasons for Parkin's removal, leading to speculation that ASIO had acted under pressure from the United States. This was denied by O'Sullivan before a Senate committee, where he gave evidence that ASIO based its assessment only on Parkin's activities in Australia. O'Sullivan refused to answer <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> a later Senate committee hearing after his legal counsel told the Federal Court that ASIO did not necessarily base its assessment solely on Parkin's activities in Australia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, a concept {{known as the}} Planetary Grand Tour was {{developed}} in the United States by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It would allow a single spacecraft to travel past the asteroid belt and onto each of the outer planets, including Jupiter, if the mission was launched in 1976 or 1977. However, there was uncertainty over whether a spacecraft could survive passage through the asteroid belt, where micrometeoroids could cause it physical damage, or the intense Jovian magnetosphere, where charged particles could harm sensitive electronics. To resolve these <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> sending the more ambitious Voyager missions, NASA and the Ames Research Center launched a pair of twin probes, Pioneer10 and Pioneer11 on March 3, 1972 and April 6, 1973, respectively, on the first unmanned mission to the outer Solar System.|$|E

Kingsley gives the money to Marlowe to deliver. Marlowe is to wear a distinctive scarf so Crystal will recognise him, though she expects Kingsley. He gets to the rendezvous, a bar, where a Mexican boy enters to tell Marlowe that Crystal is waiting outside. Marlowe goes out, meets Crystal and insists that she answer his <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> receiving the money. Crystal agrees but only at a nearby apartment where she is staying. At the apartment, Marlowe who has recognised her as Mrs. Fallbrook, the woman he met in Lavery's house, accuses her of being the murderer of Lavery. She pulls a gun on him.

25|$|Flavio Briatore's {{future as}} QPR {{chairman}} came into question in September 2009 {{after he left}} the Renault F1 team in the midst of race fixing allegations. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> commenting further. Meanwhile, the club continued to make losses (£18.8m in 2008–09 and £13.7m 2009–10). Briatore sold his 62% share to Ecclestone in December 2010, with the Italian possibly retaining a right of first refusal should Ecclestone sell, and initially stepped back from the day-to-day running of the business in favour of Amit Bhatia and Ishan Saksena, the company chairman and managing director respectively. However, his involvement gradually returned, and conflicts between Briatore {{on the one hand and}} Bhatia and Saksena on the other resulted in both Bhatia and Saksena leaving QPR in May 2011.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutors}} at Collins' trial, William Delhey and Booker Williams, {{opted to}} charge Collins {{only with the}} murder of Karen Sue Beineman, with the state contending that she had been murdered by Collins {{in the basement of the}} Leik household. In his opening statement to the jury on July 20, Delhey outlined the prosecution's contention that the evidence to be presented would form a clear pattern indicating that Collins had been in the company of Karen Sue Beineman at the time she was last seen alive by Mrs. Joan Goshe and her assistant; that he had taken her to the home of his own uncle, where he had tortured and beaten the girl before strangling her to death at this location; and that he had then discarded her body, before attempting to persuade his roommate to provide him with a false alibi. The two primary <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> the jury, Delhey stated, would be the accuracy of eyewitnesses who would be called to testify and, ultimately, whether the more than 500 hair samples found upon Beineman's panties matched the hair clippings later recovered from the basement of Collins' uncle. Delhey also stated the prosecution's intent to prove that Collins had had sole access to his uncle's home and basement on the afternoon of Beineman's disappearance, and although he had made concerted efforts to remove physical evidence from the crime scene, blood samples recovered from this location were a match for the blood type of the victim. Delhey formally closed his opening statement to the jury by requesting they return a verdict of life imprisonment with no possibility of parole.|$|E

Ginsburg herself {{was not the first}} nominee to avoid answering certain specific <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> Congress, and as a young lawyer in 1981 Roberts had advised against Supreme Court nominees giving specific responses. Nevertheless, some conservative commentators and Senators invoked the phrase [...] "Ginsburg precedent" [...] to defend his demurrers. In a September 28, 2005 speech at Wake Forest University, Ginsburg said that Roberts' refusal to answer questions during his Senate confirmation hearings on some cases was [...] "unquestionably right".|$|E

500|$|Townsend's first {{run-in with}} the law {{occurred}} on 25 November 1941 when federal prosecutors investigating German-funded propaganda in the United States sought him to answer <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> a grand jury about Scribner's Commentator. When {{he could not be}} found at his home in Lake Geneva a nationwide manhunt was launched, but three weeks later Townsend came forward willingly, claiming he had simply been on vacation in the southern United States and hadn't known he was wanted by the government. On 15 December he stated that he had no knowledge about how Scribner's Commentator was financed, but had strong confidence in the magazine's owners who he knew to be [...] "good Americans." [...] He added that although he had worked to prevent the outbreak of a conflict, he was now fully supportive of the US war effort. It emerged later that Nazi German agents had been surreptitiously bankrolling the magazine.|$|E
500|$|The bill {{authorizing the}} Oregon Trail Memorial [...] half dollar was first {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives on January 25, 1926 by Washington Congressman John Franklin Miller, who had previously been mayor of Seattle.

According to local historian Bert Webber in his 1986 monograph on the coin, [...] "there {{is little doubt that}} Mr. Miller was influenced to propose this coin by Ezra Meeker." [...] A hearing was held before the House Coinage Committee on March 3; Meeker testified. [...] The bill was reported favorably, and then passed by the full House on April 5, 1926. The bill was not opposed in the House of Representatives, though one member, Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, asked several <b>questions</b> <b>before</b> it passed by unanimous consent.
