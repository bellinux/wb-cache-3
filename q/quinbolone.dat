25|$|<b>Quinbolone,</b> the 17-cyclopentenyl enol ether of boldenone.|$|E
25|$|Aside from prohormones and {{testosterone}} undecanoate, {{almost all}} orally active AAS are 17α-alkylated. A few AAS {{that are not}} 17α-alkylated are orally active. Some examples include the testosterone 17-ethers cloxotestosterone, <b>quinbolone,</b> and silandrone, which are prodrugs (to testosterone, boldenone (Δ1-testosterone), and testosterone, respectively), the DHT 17-ethers mepitiostane, mesabolone, and prostanozol (which are also prodrugs), the 1-methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone (although these are relatively weak AAS), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and 11β-MNT, which have improved resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism due to their 11β-methyl groups (in contrast to them, the related AAS trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is not orally active). As these AAS are not 17α-alkylated, they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinbolone</b> can be {{prepared}} from testosterone. Dehydrogenation using DDQ forms boldenone. Reaction with 1,1-dimethoxycyclopentane followed by heating to eliminate methanol gives <b>quinbolone.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most orally {{administered}} {{anabolic steroids}} function by having an alkylated 17α-carbon atom, which prevents first-pass metabolism by the liver. This approach does, however, give the drug a high hepatotoxicity. <b>Quinbolone</b> is not 17α-alkylated; instead it has increased oral bioavailability {{due to its}} cyclopentenyl ether group. After ingestion, the inactive <b>quinbolone</b> becomes boldenone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinbolone</b> is a {{derivative}} of boldenone with an easily removed cyclopentenyl ether group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinbolone</b> {{itself has}} very few {{androgenic}} effects, {{and most of}} what it does have {{are a result of}} its conversion to boldenone and its metabolites. Because of high doses necessary for androgenic effects, cost and inconvenience meant that <b>quinbolone</b> never proved to be commercially successful, and its clinical applications were fulfilled by alternative, more effective, steroids. Its illicit usage in bodybuilding and athletics likewise proved limited, though drug tests are still used to detect its metabolites as it remains a banned substance for most competitive sports.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quinbolone</b> (brand name Anabolicum Vister, Anabolvis) is an anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS). It was {{developed}} by Parke-Davis {{in an attempt to}} create a viable orally-administered anabolic steroid with little or no liver toxicity.|$|E
