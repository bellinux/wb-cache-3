This model supports the decision making by providing <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> covering dredging cost, and social and environmental impacts. This model requires various input data which are dredging points, dredging machines, dewatering machines, disposal sites. Furthermore, for the model development, the researcher applied imaginary dredging project area for model assessment and analysis. We used a total of 5 cases of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination. It can classify <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination in 2 categories. The first category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for single-objective optimization and another category is <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination for multi-objective optimization. The single-objective optimization is same that one <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 1. 0 and other <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> is 0. 0. The multi-objective optimization is used equality <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> combination or <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> from previous study. According to model simulation, it shows that cost of dredging is different approximately 18 % due to <b>weight</b> <b>factors.</b> Besides, the maximum cost is obtained when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of social impact is 1. 0. In contrast, minimum cost of dredging projects is discovered when <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> of cost is 1. 0. From the <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> in previous study, it illustrates that there are about 2 % beyond the minimum cost of dredging projects, and approximately 18 % less than maximum cost. Next study will be used real river dredging areas or simulation results of bed changes. The results of this study can be efficiently applied to 4 major rivers in Korea where periodical river dredging is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: The {{compound}} identification in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) {{is achieved}} by matching the experimental mass spectrum to the mass spectra in a spectral library. It is known that the intensities with higher m/z value in the GC-MS mass spectrum are the most diagnostic. Therefore, to increase the relative significance of peak intensities of higher m/z value, the intensities and m/z values are usually transformed {{with a set of}} <b>weight</b> <b>factors.</b> A poor quality of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> can significantly decrease the accuracy of compound identification. With the significant enrichment of the mass spectral database and the broad application of GC-MS, it is important to re-visit the methods of discovering the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> for high confident compound identification. Results: We developed a novel approach to finding the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> only through a reference library for high accuracy compound identification. The developed approach first calculates the ratio of skewness to kurtosis of the mass spectral similarity scores among spectra (compounds) in a reference library and then considers a <b>weight</b> <b>factor</b> with the maximum ratio as the optimal <b>weight</b> <b>factor.</b> We examined our approach by comparing the accuracy of compound identification using the mass spectral library maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

The combination of PPIC receiver and new bit estimator is called VRPPIC detector. This realization is derived for the main PPIC operation and soft decision (SD) from PPIC, which are linear combination of the bit estimator using appropriate <b>Weighting</b> <b>Factors</b> (WF). These <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> are derived from Partial Parallel Interference Cancellation (PPIC) <b>weighting</b> <b>factors.</b> It is used to reduce the conditional variance of the final stage signal estimation. An Optimal <b>Weighting</b> <b>Factor</b> (OWF) selection algorithm has been derived for VRPPIC detector scheme, to minimize a monotonically increasing condition variance function.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm for least squares (LS) estimation of both stationary and nonstationary signals which arise from Volterra models. The algorithm concerns the recursive implementations {{of the method}} of LS which usually have a <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> in the cost function. This <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> enables nonstationary signal models to be tracked. In particular, {{the behavior of the}} <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> is known to influence the performance of the LS estimation. However, there are certain constraints on the <b>weighting</b> <b>factor.</b> In this paper, we have refor-mulated the LS estimation with the commonly used exponential <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> as a constrained optimization problem. Specif-ically, we have addressed this constrained optimization using the Lagrange programming neural networks (LPNN’s) thereby enabling the <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> to be adapted. The utility of our adaptive weighted least squares (AWLS) algorithm is demon-strated in the context of Volterra signal modeling in stationary and nonstationary environments. By using the Kuhn–Tucker conditions, all the LS estimated parameters may be shown to be optimal. Index Terms—Least square estimation, neural networks, non-linear signal modeling, Volterra system.

This study assesses gender effects on radiation dose <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> used in internal dosimetry. A <b>weighting</b> <b>factor</b> represents the relative contribution of a particular organ or tissue to the total detriment due to the effects from uniform whole body irradiation. <b>Weighting</b> <b>factors</b> are used in the calculation of effective dose formerly called the effective dose equivalent. The 1990 recommendations of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 60 introduce a set of <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> based on total detriment which includes the probability of attributable fatal cancer, the weighted probability of attributable non-fatal cancer, the weighted probability of severe hereditary effects, and the relative length of life lost.

This research developed a separate set of <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> for males and females using United States population data and methods based on ICRP Publication 60. A definite difference between the male and female <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> was discovered, but it is was hard to state a justifiable difference due to the many uncertainties involved in the process.

This paper reviews different <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> {{that have been used}} in the climate economics literature. Based on a simple model, it is shown that although the different <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> imply substantially different cost-damage estimates, they actually yield the same optimal emission reductions. This paradox is {{explained by the fact that}} some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted – and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis. At present, when most of the global emissions of (fossil) CO 2 originate from the industrialised countries, the global optimal emissions are considerably lower if costs are weighted. However, the more the emissions in developing countries grow, the less important becomes the introduction of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> in cost-benefit analysis of climate change for the global emission reductions, in the model developed here. On a regional level, the introduction of <b>weight</b> <b>factors</b> continues to play an important role, implying substantially lower emissions in the rich region and slightly higher (!) in the poor.

Most of these <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> are isotropic. However, anisotropic <b>weighting</b> <b>factors</b> have recently been used to give greater weight to the upstream and downstream observations as compared to those of the crosswind direction.
