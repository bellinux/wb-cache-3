5|$|Humphrey {{moved to}} his new home with an elderly couple in {{suburban}} London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced {{until the next day}} {{to reduce the risk of}} kidnap attempts. The Conservatives were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power.|$|E
5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was {{under the control of the}} Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E
25|$|Reinhart is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the {{difference}} in available interpretations is not because the Logical Form of these sentences is impossible to describe.

25|$|This {{novel is}} based on the idea of {{traveling}} to another time period. However, it is not about basic time travel. The author is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the traditional idea of time travel is not possible. Instead, the author uses quantum mechanics to suggest that other universes exist {{at the same time as}} ours, each existing in another time and place.|$|E
25|$|It {{also seems}} {{that people who}} are more {{creative}} {{are also more likely to}} show a similar pattern of brain activation. Some researchers have been <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness, as it is still not clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.|$|E
25|$|Google {{introduced}} in-app subscriptions to Google Play in May 2012. In June 2016, Google {{announced that}} subscriptions charged through Google Play would now split the revenue 85/15, where developers receive 85% of revenue and Google only takes 15%, {{a change from}} the traditional 70/30 split in years prior. The move followed Apple's then-recently announced change of the same model, although commentators were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> while Apple only grants the 85/15 revenue share after one year of active subscriptions, Google's subscription change takes effect immediately.|$|E

25|$|Engineers such as John Smeaton, Peter Ewart, , Gustave-Adolphe Hirn and Marc Seguin {{recognized}} that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and {{made use of}} Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some chemists such as William Hyde Wollaston. Academics such as John Playfair were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the second law of thermodynamics, but in the 18th and 19th centuries {{the fate of the}} lost energy was still unknown.|$|E
25|$|Davis won the World Billiards Championships in June 1980, beating Rex Williams 5978-4452, and in {{so doing}} became the only player except for Joe Davis to have lifted both the World Snooker and World Billiards titles. However, he was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{standards}} differed markedly from those of the 1930s when the top players made such large breaks that they killed the game as popular entertainment. He would receive £1500 plus a cheque for £500 for the highest break (583); this was presented to him by 94-year-old Willie Smith, World Billiards champion in 1920 and 1923. Davis also retained the title later in November the same year, when the championship was restored to a knock-out basis {{for the first time since}} 1934. Davis beat Paddy Morgan 1907-978, John Barrie 1253-1153 and Mark Wildman 3037-2064 in the final to pocket £4000, then a record for a billiards event.|$|E
25|$|Sakura Wars 4 {{was first}} {{announced}} in June 2001; when announced, Hiroi was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{while it was}} the last series entry for the Dreamcast, it was not the final entry in the Sakura Wars series. A preview disc was released with Sakura Wars Online, featuring promotional images and trailers released up to that point. Running up to the game's release, Sakura Wars 3 and the Dreamcast ports of the first two Sakura Wars games were reissued at reduced prices by Sega. The game was released on March 21, 2002. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC). It was released for Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 and Windows XP on March 3, 2005. This version required multiple CD-ROMs due to the game's size. A DVD-ROM version for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista on January 25, 2007. Wider localization efforts for the series were prevented due to Sega's uncertainly as to whether the game's blend of genres would find a profitable audience outside Japan.|$|E

500|$|In October, 2017, another apocalyptic writer, Terral Croft, {{predicted}} {{the arrival of}} Nibiru for November 19; a prediction again reported in the British tabloid press. Croft describes Nibiru as a [...] "black star" [...] {{at the edge of}} our Solar System, which, rather than colliding with Earth, would form an apocalyptic conjunction with Earth, leading to massive earthquakes. Croft claimed that earthquakes have been increasing worldwide in the leadup to the conjunction, though The Washington Post, quoting the United States Geological Survey, was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> earthquakes had decreased in both power and frequency over the year.|$|E
500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience. As Carole Hillenbrand wrote, it would be [...] "dangerously misleading to take the evidence of his book at its face value." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Legacy said the album was, [...] " [...] pretty much like the lifestyle {{and the culture of}} the typical California teenager put in music. It’s going to surprise a lot of people, {{because a lot of people}} think we just make the jerk songs [...] dance music." [...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'. Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown, local producers. Legacy said, [...] "We have no big producers on our album. All of our producers are like kids ...|$|E
50|$|Grudge Match contestants can be from television, movies, cartoons, sports, video games, or larger-than-life real people. The {{focus is}} on characters, not celebrities. This is the key that keeps Grudge Match from being a retread of Celebrity Deathmatch (which the creators are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> debuted after Grudge Match did).|$|R
5000|$|On his tours, Sarasin is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the building's purpose.

50|$|Although {{based on}} fairly {{reliable}} {{information provided by}} Polish intelligence and intercepted Soviet radio communications, the plan was called 'amateurish' by many high-ranking army officers and military experts, from Polish officers to the advisors from the French Military Mission to Poland who were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> Piłsudski's lack of formal military education.|$|R
500|$|Hartley is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> before [...] "Justice", {{the series}} did {{not focus on}} [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise {{you look like a}} standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated {{that he was one of}} the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing. Other interpretations are that the coloration is merely skin pigmentation or {{that it is the}} hue associated with a [...] "healthy glow," [...] since Mickey has historically been viewed as a creature with skin rather than fur. Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his disbelief and laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage. He did not develop the use of a stencil (i.e. the technique of pressing the liquid paint onto the surface through a screen of dots) to present uniformly distributed dots until 1963.|$|E
500|$|When the Ming founder Hongwu {{came upon}} the {{mechanical}} devices housed in the Yuan dynasty's palace at Khanbaliq – such as fountains with balls dancing on their jets, self-operating tiger automata, dragon-headed devices that spouted mists of perfume, and mechanical clocks {{in the tradition of}} Yi Xing (683–727) and Su Song (1020–101) – he associated all of them with the decadence of Mongol rule and had them destroyed. This was described in full length by the Divisional Director of the Ministry of Works, Xiao Xun, who also carefully preserved details on the architecture and layout of the Yuan dynasty palace. Later, European Jesuits such as Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault would briefly mention indigenous Chinese clockworks that featured drive wheels. However, both Ricci and Trigault were <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> 16th-century European clockworks were far more advanced than the common time keeping devices in China, which they listed as water clocks, incense clocks, and [...] "other instruments... with wheels rotated by sand as if by water" [...] (Chinese: [...] ). Chinese records – namely the Yuan Shi – describe the 'five-wheeled sand clock', a mechanism pioneered by Zhan Xiyuan (fl. 1360–80) which featured the scoop wheel of Su Song's earlier astronomical clock and a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated, similar to European models of the time. This sand-driven wheel clock was improved upon by Zhou Shuxue (fl. 1530–58) who added a fourth large gear wheel, changed gear ratios, and widened the orifice for collecting sand grains since he criticized the earlier model for clogging up too often.|$|E
50|$|However, many {{patients}} claim to feel {{full of energy}} and stamina after undergoing therapy. Medical scientists are <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> this side effect is likely the result of rapid lipolysis, as free fatty acids are freed from glycerol, and forcibly diffused into blood and muscle fiber due to artificially elevated blood pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Several hard-core country {{fans were}} <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the discrepancy, but Billboard {{magazine}} writer Paul Grein responded, [...] "Only a Scrooge would count that against them."

2500|$|Though Livgren {{is known}} for his music, he is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it is only one of his many pursuits. On his Web site, he quotes his biography: [...] "I'm a family man, I have a role in my church, I'm running a record label, a studio, a {{production}} company, a farm, and I have more hobbies and interests than there are hours in the day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their mother appears. She is distraught about Edmund's coughing, {{which he}} tries to {{suppress}} {{so as not to}} alarm her, fearing anything that might trigger her addiction again. When Edmund accepts his mother's excuse that she had been upstairs so long because she had been [...] "lying down", Jamie looks at them both contemptuously. Mary notices and starts becoming defensive and belligerent, berating Jamie for his cynicism and disrespect for his parents. Jamie is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the only reason he has survived as an actor is through his father's influence in the business.|$|E
50|$|The {{second act}} of the show {{revolves}} around a play written by Howard Moon {{about the end of}} the world, entitled No Future? Moon has enlisted the help of Naboo, Fossil, Bollo and Vince to perform the play, however, Noir is <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> its ridiculous content, and hijacks the play by blackmailing Howard about a jazz-porn photo shoot he mistakenly got roped into.|$|R
