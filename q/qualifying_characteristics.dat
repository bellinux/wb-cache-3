5000|$|... ===Applying voice {{classification}} to non-classical singing=== In non-classical singing, it {{is difficult}} to place voices within either system for two major reasons. First, these voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique. These specific techniques, through study and training, result in a particular kind of vocal production and vocal timbre for each voice type which is unique to classical music. This is particularly problematic when trying to apply the operatic terms, as the vocal types are more descriptive of vocal timbre and vocal facility than simple vocal range. For example, one category of voice in opera is a contralto, which is the lowest female voice in the operatic system. One of the <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> of this voice is a deep and dark quality to the vocal sound. This quality is not entirely innate to the voice, but is developed through classical vocal training. So although a singer in another genre might have a range equivalent to a contralto, they would not have a similar sound.|$|E

The Polycity project represents a significant demonstration of this energy policy, which was applied to 3 cities: Barcelona, Stuttgart and Torino. The case of Torino appears of particular relevance because it is dedicated to the improvement of energy performance of existing buildings and installations which is, in our opinion, the most frequent situation. In particular the most <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristic</b> of Torino project is the installation of a new combined heat and power generator (CHP), coupled with an absorption chiller, in order to supply energy more efficiently in a district which include the Housing Authority of the Province of Torino (ATC) building and 30 council buildings.

Pirmoje darbo dalyje atskleistas susitaikymo instituto baudžiamojoje teisėje turinys bei samprata, remiantis moksline literatūra bei įvairiais teisės aktais atskleista šio instituto istorinė raida. Remiantis teismų praktika bei baudžiamosios teisės principais aptarti susitaikymo instituto taikymo pagrindai bei sąlygos. Išanalizuotas susitaikymo instituto bei aukos ir kaltininko mediacijos santykis. Taip pat lyginamuoju aspektu aptariama Vokietijos, Lenkijos bei Suomijos valstybių susitaikymo baudžiamajame procese galimybės pagal tose šalyse įtvirtinus įstatymus lyginant su Lietuva. Šioje dalyje paaiškėjo, kad aukos ir kaltininko mediacijos institutas ne tik labai artimas BK 38 str. įtvirtintam susitaikymo institutui, tačiau galėtų būti kaip alternatyva jam, bei užtikrinti efektyvesnį ginčų sprendimo procesą smurto artimoje aplinkoje bylose, nes šiuo atveju taikantis tarpininkauja trečioji nepriklausoma šalis (mediatorius) padedanti šalims pasiekti susitaikymą. Taip pat atskleista, kad artimiausias susitaikymo institutas įtvirtintam Lietuvos BK 38 str. yra Lenkijos BK 66 straipsnyje įtvirtintas, Vokietijos baudžiamasis kodeksas sudaro platesnes galimybes kaltininko ir nukentėjusiojo susitaikymui nei Lietuvos baudžiamieji įstatymai, Suomijoje egzistuojantis susitaikymo institutas yra siauriausiai reglamentuotas visų analizuotų šalių atžvilgiu. Antroji darbo dalis skirta atsakomybės už smurtą artimoje aplinkoje reglamentavimo Lietuvos Respublikos baudžiamajame kodekse analizei, atliktų tyrimų smurto artimoje aplinkoje atvejais Lietuvos Respublikos prokuratūrose statistikos įvertinimui, bei remiantis Kauno miesto apylinkės teisme, bei Kauno apygardos teisme išnagrinėtomis bylomis susitaikymo instituto taikymo smurtinių nusikaltimų bylose analizės (tyrimo) atlikimui prieš ir po „artimos aplinkos“ kaip kvalifikuojančio požymio įtvirtinimo LR BK 140 str. Atlikus tyrimą paaiškėjo, kad daugelis pradėtų ikiteisminių tyrimų dėl smurto artimoje aplinkoje nutraukiami ikiteisminio tyrimo stadijoje įvairiais BPK pagrindais, į kuriuos įeina ir BPK 214 str. 2 d. pagrindas – ikiteisminio tyrimo nutraukimas įtariamajam ir nukentėjusiajam susitaikius, todėl teisminio nagrinėjimo stadiją pasiekia ganėtinai maža dalis smurto artimoje aplinkoje bylų. Šiame darbe iškelta hipotezė pasitvirtino iš dalies, nes įvertinus Lietuvos Respublikos prokuratūrų atliktų tyrimų smurto artimoje aplinkoje atvejais statistiką, bei atlikus išsamią teismų praktikos analizę (tyrimą) skirtingais laikotarpiais, prieš ir po „artimos aplinkos“ kaip kvalifikuojančio požymio atsiradimo LR BK 140 str. atsiskleidė, kad smurto artimoje aplinkoje bylose gali būti taikomas susitaikymo institutas. Tačiau atsižvelgiant į tai, kad šis institutas taikomas ganėtinai formaliai, vien tik paviršutiniškai įvertinant kaltininko atitiktį susitaikymo pagrindams ir sąlygoms, mediacijos proceso metu minėtieji trūkumai galėtų būti pašalinami, taip įgyvendinant atkuriamojo teisingumo idėjas, užtikrinant tiek aukos tiek kaltininko interesus ir išsaugant jų tarpusavio santykius. The main {{target of}} this paper was to define whether the {{institute}} for reconciliation is applied in cases related to domestic violence. In order to answer the question arisen in the paper, various legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania, court practice, scientific and legal literature, the Lithuanian Republic Law on Protection from Domestic Violence, statistical data of prosecutors' offices of the Republic of Lithuania were analysed. The paper consists of two sections. The first section discloses the content and the concept of the institute for reconciliation in criminal law, as well as the historical development and the appearance of the institute in legislation of the Republic of Lithuania pursuant to scientific literature and various legal acts. The relation between the institute for reconciliation and victim-offender mediation was analysed. Bases and conditions for applying the institute for reconciliation were discussed in accordance with court practice and the principles in criminal law. As well, possibilities for reconciliation were laid down in criminal procedure in Germany, Poland and Finland in accordance with laws adopted in these countries in comparison with Lithuania. While disclosing the historical development of the institute for reconciliation, it appeared that the origin of the institute for reconciliation comes from the first written legal sources, the institute has been improved for long years, the current criminal law ensures larger possibilities for achievement of reconciliation between an offender and a victim than former laws. As well, this section of the paper revealed that the institute for victim-offender mediation is not only so close to the institute for reconciliation established in Article 38 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania but it could also be the option for ensuring more effective settlement of disputes in cases related to domestic violence. While assessing experience of foreign countries in application of the institute for reconciliation, we can see that it was disclosed that the most European countries have no institute in their own criminal law similar to discharge from criminal liability upon recondition of an offender with a victim stipulated in Lithuania. Other countries widely apply the well known institute for mediation which means that an offender reconciles with a victim through the intermediation of the special third person – mediator who assists in reconciliation. The institute for discharge from criminal liability upon recondition of an offender with a victim has been established only in legislation of Spain, Poland, Finland and Germany in comparison to other European countries. Upon analysing criminal laws of the aforementioned countries, it was disclosed that the closest institute to the Lithuanian one laid down in Article 38 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania has been stipulated in Article 66 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Poland. The Criminal Code of Germany insures more possibilities for reconciliation of an offender with a victim than criminal laws of Lithuania, whereas the institute for reconciliation existing in Finland is the least regulated in comparison with all above analysed countries. The second section of the paper is designed for discussing the regulation of liability for domestic violence in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania, assessment of statistics in investigations of domestic violence gathered by prosecutors' offices of the Republic of Lithuania, and analysing (examining) the application of the institute for reconciliation in cases related to domestic violence heard by the District Court of Kaunas City and the Kaunas County Court before and upon establishment of <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ‘domestic” in Article 140 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania. While assessing regulation of liability for domestic violence in the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania, it appeared that the Criminal Code valid till 13 July 2013 did not provide separate <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> for domestic violence allowing for acknowledgement of this offence as being more dangerous but upon entering the amended Article 140 of the Criminal Code into force and establishment of the <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> in Paragraph 2 of this Article, offences related to domestic violence were allowed to separate from any negligible health impairment or causing physical pain and to attribute them to acts being more dangerous. While reviewing statistics of conducted investigations concerned with domestic violence gathered by prosecutors' offices of the Republic of Lithuania, it appeared that more than one third of investigations instituted with regard to domestic violence is discontinued during pre-trail investigation and does not reach the stage of courts and judicial proceedings in the Republic of Lithuania. While analysing the practice of the District Court of Kaunas City and the Kaunas County Court related to cases concerned with domestic violence from different periods, it was disclosed that frequency in applying the institute for reconciliation is different in each period, in 2011 - 2014 this institute was very often applied in court practice, whereas in 2014 - 2017 application of this institute in cases concerned with domestic violence was relatively uncommon phenomenon. As well, this research appeared that the institute for reconciliation is not often applied during juridical proceedings because {{a large part of the}} reconciliation takes still place during pre-trail investigation and only a small part of cases concerned with domestic violence reaches the stage of judicial proceedings. The hypothesis arisen in this paper was partially confirmed because upon assessment of statistics of conducted investigations concerned with domestic violence gathered by prosecutors' offices of the Republic of Lithuania and detailed analysing (examining) court practice in different periods before and upon establishment of <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ‘domestic” in Article 140 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Lithuania, it was disclosed that the institute for reconciliation should be applied in cases related to domestic violence. However, considering the fact that this institute is being applied formally, during mediation dispute, abovementioned limitations could be eliminated, implementing restorative justice idea, ensuring interests and preserving relationship between victim-offender...|$|E

In the eight-component basic system of the parts of speech with secondary intermediate status of Parti-ciple (Verb ↔Adjective), Verbal Adverb (Verb ↔Adverb) and the specific dimension of Infinitive (Verb ←Infinitive →Noun) the Verb is qualified through comparison with Adjective and deter-mining of specialized internal sentence load (predicative). General spatial verbality in interpreta-tive-qualifying and classification-normative grammar model of Yuriy Shevelyov covers two defining verb-forming hierarchically top categories – Tense and Mood with adjoining to them regular category of Aspect. Categoriality of Person and Number are functionally blurred in the verb. There is the relevant study of categorial verbality by Yu. Shevelyov, as the researcher substantiated its qualification on the original postulates of grammatical theory of O. Potebnya {{taking into account the}} active developments of formal grammatical approach to the analysis of verbality. The purpose of the analysis is to establish the characteristics of the verbality interpretation by Yuriy Shevelyov with consistent clarification of internal and external parts of speech status load of categorial-verbal formations, determination of hierarchy of verbal categories, tracing their disparity. According to the stated purpose the solution of the following tasks is relevant: 1) to ana-lyze the grammatical conception of verbality of Yuriy Shevelyov; 2) to establish the expressions of grammatical tradition continuity in verbality conception of the prominent linguist; 3) to determine the scope of the verbality concept by Yuriy Shevelyov; 4) to trace the loading of the parts of speech categories in verbality classification by the scientist; 5) to characterize the “power space” of the linguistic-paradigm space in the development of grammatical conception of Yuriy Shevelyov. The scientific novelty of the study is motivated by the comprehension of conceptual and theoretical heritage of Yuriy Shevelyov in general, and qualification of verbality made by him with the de-termination of the <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics</b> of verbality and also the entire range of its categorial forms. The theoretical value of the proposed study is motivated by the substantiation of conceptual and grammatical verbality by Yuriy Shevelyov with outlining of its load in the history of linguistic thought. The grammatical conception of Yuriy Shevelyov by its main dimensions is interpretation-qualifying and classification-normative one, based on three postulates – scientific, normative and stylistic. One prospective is the holistic study of grammatical conception of Yuriy Shevelyov with the establishment of the basic (landmark) points of the evolution of his scientific views through the consistent application of the comparative-historical research methodology in the investigations...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{techniques}} in ‘proximal sensing’ coupled to image analysis insights are assuming {{an increasingly important}} role {{in a variety of}} discipline including ecology, forestry, geology, geography, urban planning, archeology, and civil engineering. In this context, the technique based on the acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral images appears the most suited for landscape classification and evolution over time. At the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, an effective methodology for classifying landscapes according to the reflectance characteristics of the materials on the surface has been developed. It is based on the use of two complementary innovative experimental devices and appropriate software for acquiring and analyzing hyperspectral images. The first device is based on the use of three interference filters covering the ranges 400 - 720 nm (VIS), 650 - 1100 nm (NIR) and 850 - 1800 nm (MIR) and comprises one frame grabber with three Camera Link inputs and a trigger signal generator to tune the filter frequency, one solid state disk array of 1 Tbyte, two CMOS Dalsa- 4 M 60 cameras (coupled to the VIS and NIR filters) and one Xenics InGaAs camera (coupled to the MIR filter), one thermal camera, a power supply for all devices and a processing computer for controlling the entire system and acquiring images of the thermal camera via a USB port. The second device employs the same equipments describe above but for the use of two spectrometers instead of three filters, the first spectrometer centered in the visible range (400 nm to 1000 nm, VIS), the second one centered in the near infrared range (from 900 nm to 1800 nm, MIR). The VIS spectrometer is mounted in front of the CMOS camera while the MIR one is mounted in front of the InGaAs camera. The other CMOS camera, equipped with standard lens, is used for georeferencing lines acquired with the spectrometers. In fact, the latter system simultaneously acquires the spectra of a line. Multiple images must be acquired to reconstruct a two-dimensional scene from the combination of several lines. The systems developed have very unique and <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics,</b> mainly related to the low cost if compared to other systems available on the market, high spectral resolution, high spatial and temporal resolution, easy portability, both systems have been engineered {{so that they can be}} transported by ultralight airplanes. It is suitable for monitoring areas of extension ranging from small to large. In the latter case a large number of images have to be acquired and joined into one large image without using ground control points. This can be automatically done through a specific software that calculates the correspondences by maximizing the photometric consistency among images through correlation operations. The software accounts for rotations, translations and object size changes in consecutive images. The platforms have been employed for field surveys aimed at acquiring hyperspectral images of objects placed at a distance of some hundreds of meters with the equipment mounted on the fixed stand (usually located uphill) or on aircrafts allowing low altitude flights. The most significant results have been obtained in the fields of vegetation recognition, detection of diseases and abnormalities in the spectral signatures of plant species (organic citrus on the Lentini Plains), identification and characterization of landfills, highlighting the spectral inhomogeneity they are associated with and the variations induced on land and on adjacent vegetation...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA; P. L. 113 - 128), which succeeded the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (P. L. 105 - 220) as {{the primary}} federal {{workforce}} development legislation, was enacted in July 2014 to bring about increased coordination among federal workforce development and related programs. Most of WIOA’s provisions went into effect July 1, 2015. WIOA authorizes appropriations for each of FY 2015 through FY 2020 {{to carry out the}} programs and activities authorized in the legislation. Workforce development programs provide a combination of education and training services to prepare individuals for work and to help them improve their prospects in the labor market. They may include activities such as job search assistance, career counseling, occupational skill training, classroom training, or on-the-job training. The federal government provides workforce development activities through WIOA’s programs and other programs designed to increase the employment and earnings of workers. WIOA includes five titles: Workforce Development Activities (Title I), Adult Education and Literacy (Title II), Amendments to the Wagner-Peyser Act (Title III), Amendments to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Title IV), and General Provisions (Title V). Title I, whose programs are primarily administered through the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL), includes three state formula grant programs, multiple national programs, and Job Corps. Title II, whose programs are administered by the U. S. Department of Education (ED), includes a state formula grant program and National Leadership activities. Title III amends the Wagner-Peyser Act of 1933, which authorizes the Employment Service (ES). Title IV amends the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which authorizes vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities. Title V includes provisions for the administration of WIOA. The WIOA system provides central points of service via its system of around 3, 000 One-Stop centers nationwide, through which state and local WIOA employment and training activities are provided and certain partner programs must be coordinated. This system is supposed to provide employment and training services that are responsive to the demands of local area employers. Administration of the One-Stop system occurs through Workforce Development Boards (WDBs), a majority of whose members must be representatives of business and which are authorized to determine the mix of service provision, eligible providers, and types of training programs, among other decisions. WIOA provides universal access (i. e., an adult age 18 or older does not need to meet any <b>qualifying</b> <b>characteristics)</b> to its career services, including a priority of service for low- income adults. WIOA also requires Unified State Plans (USPs) that outline the workforce strategies for the six core WIOA programs—adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs (Title I of WIOA), the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA; Title II of WIOA), the Employment Service program (amended by Title III of WIOA), and the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grant Program (amended by Title IV of WIOA). Finally, WIOA adopts the same six “primary indicators of performance” across most of the programs authorized in the law. This report provides details of WIOA Title I state formula program structure, services, allotment formulas, and performance accountability. In addition, it provides a program overview for national grant programs. It also offers a brief overview of the Employment Service (ES), which is authorized by separate legislation but {{is an integral part of}} the One-Stop system created by WIOA...|$|E

40|$|Application of aroma extract {{dilution}} analysis (AEDA) on organic {{extracts from}} Port wines barrelaged over 40 years revealed 5 odor-active compounds corresponding to descriptors used to <b>qualify</b> the <b>characteristic</b> old wine aroma. One of the compounds, described as “nutty” and “spicy-like”, and present {{in at least}} 9 dilutions above the others, was perceived as particularly important. The compound responsible for this flavor was identified as 3 -hydroxy- 4, 5 -dimethyl- 2 (5 H) -furanone (sotolon). The levels ranged from 5 to 958 íg/L for wines between 1 and 60 years old. It was also observed that during oxidative aging the concentration of this compound increased with time according to a linear trend (r > 0. 95). Although the presence of 2 -ketobutyric acid was verified, the constant rate of formation of sotolon with aging and its high correlation with sugar derivates (HMF, furfural) suggests other mechanisms, different from those reported for other wines. The flavor threshold of sotolon was evaluated in Port wine at 19 íg/L. Sensorial tests provided valuable information concerning sotolon impact on Port wine aroma. Samples supplemented with this substance were consistently ranked as older. In view of these results it can be expected that sotolon plays a pre-eminent role in the characteristic old Port wine aroma...|$|R
