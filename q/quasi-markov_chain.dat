40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} canonical shift space {{representation of}} discrete-timeMarkov chain given by transition kernels. Markov shifts and eigenfunc-tions of skew products above them {{are characterized by}} terms of Frobeniusâ€“ Perron operator. The results are applied to the exactness property of Markov chains. We introduce also the notion of <b>quasi-Markov</b> <b>chain</b> {{and apply it to}} Gauss endomorphisms...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how subtle signals {{taken from the}} early stages within a construction process {{can be used to}} diagnose potential problems within that process. For this study, the construction process is modeled as a <b>quasi-Markov</b> <b>chain.</b> A set of six different scenarios representing various common problems (e. g., small budget, complex project) is created and simulated by suitably defining the transition probabilities between nodes in the Markov chain. A Monte Carlo approach is used to parameterize a Bayesian estimator. By observing the time taken to pass the review gateway (as measured by number of hops between activity nodes), the system is able to determine with good accuracy the problem scenario that the construction process is suffering from...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a computational stochastic model of virtual cells irradiation, based on <b>Quasi-Markov</b> <b>Chain</b> Monte Carlo method and using biophysical input. The model {{is based on}} a stochastic tree of probabilities for each cell of the entire colony. Biophysics of the cells is described by probabilities and probability distributions provided as the input. The adaptation of nucleation and catastrophe theories, well known in physics, yields sigmoidal relationships for carcinogenic risk {{as a function of the}} irradiation. Adaptive response and bystander effect, incorporated into the model, improves its application. The results show that behavior of virtual cells can be successfully modeled, e. g. cancer transformation, creation of mutations, radioadaptation or radiotherapy. The used methodology makes the model universal and practical for simulations of general processes. Potential biophysical curves and relationships are also widely discussed in the paper. However, the presented theoretical model does not describe the real cells and tissues. Also the exposure geometry (e. g., uniform or non-uniform exposure), type of radiation (e. g., X-rays, gamma rays, neutrons, heavy ions, etc.) as well as microdosimetry are not presently addressed. The model is focused mainly on creation of general and maximal wide mathematical description of irradiated hypothetical cells treated as complex physical systems...|$|E
