5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a local street map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a full page to a <b>quarter</b> <b>page</b> in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E

As time progressed, Selfridge took the more traditional form of marketing by writing daily columns under the pen name Callisthenes. Overall, however, {{one of the most effective}} marketing tools proved to be the opening week cartoons focusing on the grand event. Selfridge enlisted the help of thirty-eight of London’s top illustrators to draw hundreds of full page, half page, and <b>quarter</b> <b>page</b> advertisements for eighteen newspapers. This innovative combination of direct advertisements and newspaper publicities proved to be quite effective at drawing the crowds to the store.|$|E

One size fits all, <b>quarter</b> <b>page</b> ads, the half page ads are really expensive. The content is selected by a bunch of editors and journalists that cover beats. Their model hasn't changed, and my position is that the print newspaper doesn't need to go away simply because it's on paper.

5000|$|For the {{simplest}} of merchandise sales offers, the rectangular area on a page occupied by an item's illustration, its descriptive copy, its order number and price can be measured by hand with a ruler and the square area calculated by the formula width (inches) x height (inches) = area (square inches). A simpler, less accurate measure can be obtained using fractional page sizes (e.g. <b>quarter</b> <b>page,</b> half page). Measurements are tabulated for each item offered on each page. In certain design presentations which display offer-specific content in two or more areas (such as an illustration and descriptive copy on facing pages), each separate area is measured and the areas are summed for that item in the tabulation. When an offer occupying a discrete area on a page comprises more than one item in a grouping, the collective area is subdivided {{by the number of}} items in the grouping and the apportionments are entered into the tabulation for each item.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, {{a unique}} federal law {{enforcement}} undercover operation was created to identify and arrest individuals selling bogus Moon rocks. This sting operation was known as Operation Lunar Eclipse. Originally two undercover agents were involved in this sting, Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz of NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA OIG), posing as Tony Coriasso, and Inspector Bob Cregger of the United States Postal Inspection Service, posing as John Marta. This sting operation was later expanded to include Agents from the United States Customs Service, namely, Special Agent Dwight Weikel and Special Agent Dave Atwood. Agents posted a <b>quarter</b> <b>page</b> advertisement in USA Today asking for Moon rocks. The Agents were targeting individuals selling bogus Moon rocks, which con artists sell to the elderly and to space enthusiasts. The sting operation was led by NASA OIG Senior Special Agent Joseph Gutheinz. For {{the first time in}} history the sting operation recovered an Apollo era Moon rock, the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock. This Moon rock had been given to Honduras by President Nixon, fallen into private hands, and then offered to the Agents for $5 million.

5000|$|Letters {{written by}} [...] "C. Jerome Hopkins", as he now {{referred}} to himself, from those first years in New York indicate ongoing feuds with musical directors at the churches {{where he played}} organ, unceasing conflicts with other musicians and endless complaints from Jerome about a {{lack of support and}} funding for the musical education of choirs. It would seem that there was no professional relationship in his life that did not sour due to Hopkins' general tendency to insist on his righteous and stubborn belief that he was correct in all matters musical and that his opinions must be recognized as valid or someone would suffer the consequences. His emphatic and dramatic mannerisms early made Jerome enemies in the New York arts circles and it became common practice for the writers at The New York Times to comment upon his fiery temper and overly proud demeanor. Taking up a regular habit of writing frequent letters to the editor at the Times, Hopkins attempted to champion musical education and the cultivation of a uniquely American musical flavor. He spared no one, however, in his public letters and leading figures of the day were called out for their lack of support of the Arts. Some took serious offense, and one member of the Rockefeller family eventually threatened to sue Hopkins for defamation of character. One of the more volatile and public events precipitated by Hopkins' tendency to offend came after he had gifted a young lady living in Vermont, some acquaintance of his youth, with a book of poetry. The lady's fiance apparently took great offense at the gift of the book, as some passages had been noted and he felt that the passages were [...] "...obscene and filthy". The young man confronted Jerome at his home and attacked him with a leather strap, leaving marks across his face and injuring one of his hands. Hopkins tried to press charges but only succeeded in bringing a civil suit against the man. During the case, Jerome stated that the book had been marked by someone else long before he came upon it and that [...] "...in any case, only a filthy mind would consider such poetry filthy..." [...] The work in question was a collection of poems written by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Having already become a figure of some public notice due to his outspoken nature and rather unusual methods of persuasion, much was written by Hopkins supporters and detractors alike about the case and about the farce he had made of the events. He won his case, receiving payment from the man for injuries and slander. That was not enough to satisfy Hopkins, though. Taking out a <b>quarter</b> <b>page</b> ad in The New York Times, he humiliated his attacker and called him an [...] "... immature, undeveloped ape of a clerk, barely able to appreciate the spoken word... much less fine poetry..." [...] Typical C. Jerome Hopkins, reportedly a perfectly witty man and a perfectly horrible foe.|$|E
