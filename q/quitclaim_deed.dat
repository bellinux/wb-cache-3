25|$|John Burley's origins are obscure, {{not least}} because his name was not uncommon. Burley is a toponymic surname signifing a meadow or {{clearing}} by a fortified place and is found fairly widely across the Midlands and the North of England. He has been portrayed as a nephew of Simon de Burley, an influential courtier executed by the Merciless Parliament {{at the behest of}} the Lords Appellant. However, this makes little sense in view of John Burley's political position and apparent social origins. He seems to have been a son of a John Burley of Wistanstow in southern Shropshire and a nephew of John Burnell of Westbury, Shropshire. The lawyer John Burley is known from a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> of 1397 to have had at that time three brothers: Nicholas, portioner of the church of Westbury, James and Edmund. There seems to have been pattern of having a lawyer and a cleric in each generation.|$|E
25|$|Although Military Road did not close, Congress passed {{legislation}} allowing {{traffic on the}} highway to be stopped. On January 31, 1936, Representative John D. Dingell, Sr. warned Washington-Hoover Airport that Military Road posed a serious flying hazard. On February 14, airport officials (faced with legal action from Arlington County for obstructing traffic), stopped attempting to close the road using traffic guards, chains, or lights, leading the Department of Commerce to announce it would close the airport if traffic were not stopped. Two days later, the United States Post Office Department declared it would suspend airmail operations at Washington-Hoover unless the road were closed, leading both houses of Congress to introduce legislation demanding closure and realignment of the road. A fight {{broke out in the}} United States Senate over payment for the road: Some Senators wanted Washington-Hoover's owners to pay $50,000 in exchange for a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> from the War Department. The airport refused, calling this blackmail. Eventually, after several failed compromises, Congress passed and Roosevelt signed federal legislation permitting traffic to be temporarily stopped whenever planes took off or landed, and paying for guards to do the traffic stops.|$|E
500|$|Five {{generations of}} Camaks {{lived in the}} house until 1947. In her book Historic Houses of Athens, Charlotte Thomas Marshall notes that [...] "It was not until 1904, eleven years after Dr. Camak's [...] death, that the first deed {{relating}} to the Camak house lot was recorded. At that time his sons, Louis and James Wellborn Camak, executed a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> to their mother, Mary Wellborn Camak, acknowledging that the lot has been given to her by their father without a deed being made." [...] In 1949, the house was purchased to serve as the Mount Vernon Lodge No. 22, F. & A. M (Masonic lodge); then in 1979 by the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company.|$|E
50|$|In many jurisdictions, <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> {{are rarely}} used to {{transfer}} property from seller to buyer in a traditional property sale: the grantor and grantee have an existing relationship, or the grantor and grantee are the same person. But in others, such as Massachusetts, <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> are the norm.|$|R
5000|$|While {{rooted in}} {{warranty}} deeds, {{estoppel by deed}} has been extended to affect <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> if the deed represents that the grantor actually had title.|$|R
50|$|In November 2011, {{the diocese}} {{generated}} more controversy when it issued <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> to all parishes in the diocese, thereby surrendering any {{claim that it}} might have over parish property. Under the canons of the Episcopal Church, parish property is held in trust for the diocese and the national church; however, South Carolina's diocesan chancellor defended the <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> by citing a recent state Supreme Court ruling that the Episcopal Church's property canon was not binding on All Saints Parish in Pawleys Island. He also cited the fact that before 1979, the Episcopal Church never claimed ownership of parish property.|$|R
2500|$|In 1871, Holden met James Alexander Patterson (brother of U.S. Senator David T. Patterson), {{a colonel}} who owned land {{adjacent}} to Squahalish, a Nooksack Indian {{camp in the}} Nooksack Valley of Whatcom County. Like many Washingtonian bachelors at the time, he had married an American Indian (a young Lummi princess known as Lizzie), building a small cabin in 1860. Patterson treated Lizzie as a slave and left her to run the farm with Ned, a young Indian hand, {{while he was on}} business in Olympia. Lizzie and Ned eloped to Sumas (then the site of another Indian encampment), leaving behind Patterson's two young daughters, Dollie and Nellie. Patterson refused to allow Lizzie see her children again, but was unable to keep up the farm or take care of the children on his own. He convinced the Judsons to foster his daughters and executed a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> in favor of Judson for his [...] and 20 cattle.|$|E
5000|$|Susan Harper died, and her heirs gave Maude Harper a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> to {{the same}} property. The deed {{mentioned}} the earlier lost deed. This <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> was not for life, it was to Maude Harper in fee simple absolute; she owned it. This deed was first recorded in 1928.|$|E

50|$|While {{living in}} Lewistown and Havana, Ossian Ross engaged in land speculation, {{purchasing}} warranty <b>deeds,</b> <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds,</b> and tax deeds, typically for good quality land. Much {{of the land}} was then sold at roughly a 25 percent profit. In addition to providing a source of income, some of the land speculation by local businessmen such as Ross {{also served as a}} valuable resource for local farmers. For example, Ross' frequent practice of buying land with <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> and then selling the land back to the original owner at the auction price in essence provided a source of loans to farmers in the absence of banks, which did not exist in the region until the 1850s.|$|R
5000|$|Del Valle {{sponsored}} {{legislation to}} protect homeowners by stopping the forgery of <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> {{which is the}} process of transferring the title or deed of property to another individual or company. He has also sponsored legislation to provide harsher punishment for ATM crimes; provide Illinois with more Early Childhood Teachers; provide comprehensive health coverage for every child in Illinois; and increase funding for Advanced Placement courses in Illinois high schools.|$|R
50|$|In late 1945, {{the field}} was {{reported}} to the War Assets Administration (WAA) as being in surplus and between April 1946 and June 1947, the WAA sold or moved the on-site equipment to military locations where it could be better utilized. The land and left-over facilities were sold {{to the city of}} Brooksville by a General Services Administration (GSA) <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> which contained clauses that limited the property to be used for a public airport only. Some of these clauses have since been modified by the Federal Aviation Administration.|$|R
50|$|A <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> {{is a legal}} {{instrument}} {{which is used to}} transfer interest in real property. The entity transferring its interest is called the grantor, and when the <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> is properly completed and executed, it transfers any interest the grantor has in the property to a recipient, called the grantee. The owner/grantor terminates (“quits”) any right and claim to the property, thereby allowing the right or claim to transfer to the recipient/grantee.|$|E
50|$|As {{with tax}} deed sales, title to {{property}} is obtained via a form of <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed,</b> thus requiring further action to quiet title.|$|E
50|$|A {{so-called}} <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> is (in most jurisdictions) {{actually not}} a deed at all—it {{is actually an}} estoppel disclaiming rights of the person signing it to property.|$|E
6000|$|In 1727 Provincetown was [...] "invested with {{peculiar}} privileges." [...] for its encouragement. Once {{or twice}} {{it was nearly}} abandoned; but now lots on the street fetch a high price, though titles to them were first obtained by possession and improvement, {{and they are still}} transferred by <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> merely, the township being the property of the State. But though lots were so valuable on the street, you might in many places throw a stone over them to where a man could still obtain land, or sand, by squatting on or improving it.|$|R
50|$|The Rhode Island Senate {{asked the}} Rhode Island Supreme Court {{to issue an}} {{advisory}} opinion on the law's constitutionality; the opinion summarizes much of the tribe's land and other dealings with the state up until that point. Additionally, the Senate certified the questions of: whether certain <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> executed by the tribe were valid; whether the state could acquire valid title under the 1880 law; whether the tribe was abolished by the law; and whether those to whom the state conveyed title under the 1880 law had valid title. The court upheld the statute and answered all the questions in the affirmative.|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> {{are used}} in tax deed sales (in those cases, the term [...] "tax deed" [...] or [...] "sheriff's deed" [...] {{may be used to}} {{describe}} the actual document), where a property is sold in a public auction to recover the original homeowner’s outstanding tax debt. The auctioning body is usually the local government, which claims no interest to the property whatsoever, but is selling only to recover the unpaid taxes without extending any warranty for the property title. The purchaser then may need to initiate a quiet title action to remove any clouds to the title.|$|R
5000|$|Title is {{generally}} transferred in a tax deed sale through {{a form of}} limited warranty or <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> (sometimes styled as Tax Deed or Sheriff's Deed). In most jurisdictions, this type of deed {{is generally}} insufficient to acquire title insurance. [...] Therefore, a purchaser would most likely then need to initiate a quiet title action in order to resell the property later. However, the property can be sold from one purchaser to another using a limited warranty or another <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed,</b> though usually at far less than its market value.|$|E
50|$|In both cases, as {{with tax}} deed sales, {{title to the}} {{property}} will normally be {{in the form of}} a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed,</b> thus requiring further action to quiet title.|$|E

5000|$|The Bishops Disciplinary Board cited three {{specific}} actions by Lawrence which, it stated, showed his abandonment of his ordination vows. First, his support at the 2010 diocesan convention for efforts to [...] "qualify the diocese’s accession to the Constitution of the Church and {{to remove any}} provision acceding to the canons of the Church, as well as proposals to amend the diocesan Canons to remove all references to the canons of the Church." [...] Second, a set of 2011 amendments to the South Carolina nonprofit corporate charter of the diocese, filed by Lawrence, [...] "deleting all references to the Episcopal Church and obedience to its Constitution and canons." [...] Third, in November 2011, the issuance of <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> for the real estate of every diocesan parish, {{in violation of the}} Church's Dennis Canon.|$|R
40|$|After {{decades of}} {{advocacy}} by the modern domestic violence movement, {{institutions such as}} police departments, hospitals, and family law courts-although far from perfect in their responses-are now engaged in a conversation about domestic violence as a social problem, rather than denying its existence or significance. Despite this growth in awareness, {{a new form of}} domestic violence has developed, one which has not yet been recognized and which needs to be addressed: financial abuse through consumer credit. As consumer lending has permeated American life, violent partners have begun using debt as a means of exercising abusive control, making the consumer credit system an unknowing party to domestic violence. This abuse is known as coerced debt. Coerced debt can take a variety of forms. It ranges from abusers taking out credit cards in their partners 2 ̆ 7 names without their knowledge, to forcing victims to obtain loans for the abuser, to tricking victims into signing <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> for the family home. This Essay presents original, empirical data on the nature and scope of coerced debt, and explains how abusive partners use the complex consumer credit system to leave many victims of domestic violence with hundreds or thousands of dollars of coerced debt...|$|R
5000|$|Jaffe, {{a native}} of New York, moved to Canada in the early 1970s. In Canada, he worked as an {{international}} economist. After his move, he also continued {{to do business in}} the United States. He was involved in land deals in Putnam County, Florida as an employee of the Atlantic Commercial Development Corporation. Jaffe sought purchasers for subdivided lots of land, but due to a dispute with the original holder of the mortgage on the lots, Jaffe issued <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deeds</b> rather than warranty deeds to purchasers. In August 1980, Jaffe was arrested on twenty-eight counts of violating the Florida Land Sales Practices Act. Accredited Surety & Casualty posted a US$137,500 bail bond for him. Jaffe then returned to Canada and applied to naturalise as a Canadian citizen. He failed to appear at his May 1981 trial, and was tried in absentia. AS&C faced forfeiture of its bail bond if Jaffe were not returned in 90 days. As a result, AS&C employee Daniel Kear, along with independent bounty hunter Timm Johnsen, then traveled to Canada in pursuit of Jaffe. In September 1981, they intercepted Jaffe at his apartment building as he returned from jogging, and took him in their car back to the United States. Jaffe later testified that Johnsen and Kear threatened him to obtain his cooperation, telling him that his daughter would be harmed he did not cooperate and that they could return him to Florida [...] "dead or alive", while attorneys for Johnsen and Kear claimed that Jaffe cooperated willingly because of the bail bond agreement.|$|R

50|$|The County of Ventura officially regained {{control of}} the airport from the federal {{government}} in 1948 by receiving a final <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed.</b> The State of California issued the airport an operating permit in 1949.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{this lack}} of warranty, {{quitclaim}} deeds are most often used to transfer property between family members, as gifts, placing personal property into a business entity (and vice versa) or in other special or unique circumstances. An example use for a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> is in divorce, whereby one spouse terminates any interest in the jointly owned marital home, thereby granting the receiving spouse full rights to the property. For example, when one spouse acquires the marital home in a divorce settlement, the other spouse could execute a <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> eliminating their interest in the property and transferring full claim to the other spouse, quickly and inexpensively.|$|E

5000|$|The ease {{at which}} the <b>quitclaim</b> <b>deed</b> can be {{executed}} (it requires little more than both parties signing the document and having it notarized where required, and filed with the appropriate governmental agency with the proper fees paid) is partly {{to blame for the}} [...] "quick claim" [...] misnomer associated with the deed.|$|E
