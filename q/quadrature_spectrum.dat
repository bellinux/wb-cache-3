The combined fractional perturbation in propagation velocity is δc/c + u/c. The second term, generally neglected, introduces a nonreciprocity when source and receiver are interchanged. Nonreciprocity is expected to be relatively small except for transmission along a deep downward loop. The principal internal wave contribution to nonreciprocity is from inertial frequencies. The sum and difference of reciprocal travel times are a measure of ζ and u, respectively, along the ray path; the <b>quadrature</b> <b>spectrum</b> of reciprocal travel times is related by an integral equation to the spectrum of the momentum flux 〉ζu〈.

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of helicity in homogeneous skew-isotropic freely decaying turbulence is investigated, {{at very high}} Reynolds numbers, thanks to a classical eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) closure. In agreement with previous direct numerical simulations, a k^{- 5 / 3 } inertial range is obtained for both the kinetic energy and helical spectra. In the early stage of the decay, when kinetic energy, initially only present at large scales, cascades towards small scales, {{it is found that}} helicity slightly slows down the non-linear transfers. Then, when the turbulence is fully developed, theoretical decay exponents are derived and assessed numerically for helicity. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of helicity does not modify the decay rate of the kinetic energy with respect to purely isotropic turbulence, except in Batchelor turbulence where the kinetic energy decays slightly more rapidly. In this case, non-local expansions are used to show analytically that the permanence of large eddies hypothesis is verified for the helical spectrum, unlike the kinetic energy one. Moreover, the 4 / 3 rd law for the two-point helical structure function is assessed numerically at very large Reynolds numbers. Afterwards, the evolution equation of the helicity dissipation rate is investigated analytically, which provides significant simplifications and leads notably to the definition of a helical derivative skew-ness and of a helical Taylor scale, which is numerically very close to the classical Taylor longitudinal scale at large Reynolds numbers. Finally, when both a mean scalar gradient and helicity are combined, the <b>quadrature</b> <b>spectrum,</b> linked to the antisymmetric part of the scalar flux, appears and scales in k^{- 7 / 3 } and then in k^{- 5 / 3 } in the inertial range...|$|E

This case is mainly relevant to highly nondegenerate signal and idler modes. We show that both intensity and quadrature squeezing are present and that the maximum noise reduction below the standard quantum limit is the same at the signal and idler frequencies as in the doubly resonant case. As the threshold of oscillation is approached, however, the intensity-difference and <b>quadrature</b> <b>spectra</b> display a progressive line narrowing which is absent in the balanced doubly resonant case. By use of the separability criterion for continuous variables, the signal-idler state {{is found to be}} entangled over wide ranges of the parameters.

40|$|The {{squeezing}} {{spectrum of}} the fluorescent light is investigated for a laser-driven three-level atom of the Lambda configuration when quantum interference of the decay channels is accounted for. We show that when the two atomic transitions contribute to the detected fluorescence field, squeezing at certain frequency intervals is obtained in both the weak- and the high-Rabi-frequency regimes even for equally decay rates of the transitions. Unlike in two-level atoms in free space, squeezing can be obtained in both the in-phase and out-of-phase <b>quadrature</b> <b>spectra</b> although in different spectral regions. We also show that the squeezing spectrum can be controlled by an adequate selection of the Rabi frequencies and atomic detunings. Another remarkable effect is that squeezing can be achieved with proper relative phases of the driving fields.

40|$|The stretched-spiral vortex {{model is}} used to {{calculate}} the velocity-scalar cross spectrum for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence {{in the presence of a}} mean scalar gradient. The only nonzero component of the cospectrum is that contributed by the velocity component in the direction of the imposed scalar gradient while the <b>quadrature</b> <b>spectrum</b> is identically zero, in agreement with experiment. For the velocity field provided by the stretched-spiral vortex, the velocity-scalar spectrum can be divided into two additive components contributed by the velocity components along the vortex axis, and in the plane normal to this axis, respectively. For the axial velocity field, a new exact solution of the scalar convection-diffusion equation is found exhibiting scalar variation in the direction of the vortex tube axis. An asymptotic expression was found for the cospectrum contributed by this solution and the axial velocity, with the leading order term showing a k– 5 / 3 range. This term is produced by the winding of the initial axial velocity field by the axisymmetric vortex core. The next order term gives a k– 7 / 3 range, and arises from the lowest order effect of the nonaxisymmetric vorticity on the evolution of the axial velocity. Its coefficient can be of either sign or zero depending on the initial conditions. The contribution to the cospectrum from the velocity in the plane of the vortex is also calculated, but no universal high wave number asymptotic form is found. The integrals are evaluated numerically and it is found that the resulting cospectrum does not remain of one sign. Its form depends on the choice of the vortex core velocity profile and time cutoff in the spectral integrals. The one-dimensional cospectrum contributed by the axial velocity is compared with the experimental data of Mydlarski and Warhaft [J. Fluid Mech. 358, 135 – 175 (1998) ]...|$|E

40|$|Polyurethane {{copolymers}} generally {{consist of}} linear segments of polyurethane and polyester (or polyether). At room temperature, these polymers undergo a micro-phase separation, {{in which the}} polyurethane segments form hard domains while the polyester segments form relatively soft domains that act as the crosslinks between the hard cores. A wide variety of techniques has been utilized to characterize the microscopic (molecular) structure of polymeric materials. Recently, the dynamic infrared opto-rheological method has been developed, which involves the combination of dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy to study the real time IR spectral changes in polymer films under sinusoidal (or impulse) tensile stress of small amplitude. Phase-locked electronics are used to record the dynamic infrared spectral change in-phase and in-quadrature with the applied mechanical field. The result provides insight on {{the response to the}} external stress on the molecular and submolecular scale. While for relatively narrow spectral ranges this experiment is efficiently carried out by use of a dispersive spectrometer, for measurements over broader spectral windows, the use of step-scan Fourier transform infrared (S{sup 2 }FT-IR) has proved to be more effective.

Also, as the field propagates, there is an oscillatory creation and annihilation of correlations between the probe and pump quadratures. We further study the field {{propagation of}} squeezed states when there is two-photon resonance, but the field has a detuning δ from atomic resonance. We show that the field propagation is very sensitive to δ.

40|$|Low-frequency <b>quadrature</b> {{conductivity}} <b>spectra</b> of siliclastic materials exhibit {{typically a}} characteristic relaxation time, which either {{corresponds to the}} peak frequency of the phase or the quadrature conductivity or a typical corner frequency, at which the quadrature conductivity starts to decrease rapidly toward lower frequencies. This characteristic relaxation time can be combined with the (intrinsic) formation factor and a diffusion coefficient to predict the permeability to flow of porous materials at saturation. The intrinsic formation factor can either be determined at several salinities using an electrical conductivity model or at a single salinity using {{a relationship between the}} surface and quadrature conductivities. The diffusion coefficient entering into the relationship between the permeability, the characteristic relaxation time, and the formation factor takes only two distinct values for isothermal conditions. For pure silica, the diffusion coefficient of cations, like sodium or potassium, in the Stern layer is equal to the diffusion coefficient of these ions in the bulk pore water, indicating weak sorption of these couterions. For clayey materials and clean sands and sandstones whose surface have been exposed to alumina (possibly iron), the diffusion coefficient of the cations in the Stern layer appears to be 350 times smaller than the diffusion coefficient of the same cations in the pore water. These values are consistent with the values of the ionic mobilities used to determine the amplitude of the low and high-frequency quadrature conductivities and surface conductivity. The database used to test the model comprises a total of 202 samples. Our analysis reveals that permeability prediction with the proposed model is usually within an order of magnitude from the measured value above 0. 1 mD.

40|$|International audienceSpectral induced {{polarization}} (SIP) {{has become an}} increasingly popular geophysical method for hydrogeological and environmental applications. These applications include for instance the non-intrusive characterization of the textural and interfacial physicochemical properties of bentonites used as permeability barriers in landfills or to store various types of contaminants including radioactive wastes. Bentonites are mainly constituted of smectites, which have very high specific surface areas (SSA) and cation exchange capacities (CEC). Therefore, these minerals have very high electromigration and polarization current densities responsible for very high in phase and quadrature conductivities, respectively. In addition, in diluted water, the diffuse layer of smectites occupies a large fraction of the pore space and may be therefore considered {{as part of the}} pore space. In our approach [1], complex electrical conductivities of saturated unconsolidated bentonite and bentonite-sand mixtures are modeled at different salinities (NaCl) of the bulk pore water using a Donnan equilibrium model coupled to the revisited SIP model of Leroy and Revil [2]. Our complex surface conductivity model considers the DC contribution of the diffuse and Stern layers as well as the electrochemical polarization of the Stern layer coating the grains with different sizes. The macroscopic SIP model is based on the differential effective medium theory and considers the complex surface conductivity of the sand and smectite grains and the complex conductivity of the pore space. In our model, the diffuse layer of quartz sands occupies {{a small fraction of the}} pore space and is considered therefore as part of the surface of the grains. Our SIP model predicts very well the low frequency (0. 1 Hz - kHz) complex electrical conductivities of bentonite and bentonite-sand mixtures, except for very low frequencies (< 0. 1 Hz) where membrane polarization may occur (Figure 1). The in phase conductivity of the sample with a high clay content (20 % in volume) increases slowly with salinity because of the very high DC surface conductivity of smectite. The observed large increase of the in phase and quadrature conductivity of the samples with the clay content (1, 20 and 100 % in volume) is also predicted by our model. The quadrature conductivity of the samples with a high clay content is fairly independent on the pore fluid salinity because it is strongly connected with the SSA, CEC and Stern layer of smectite (Figure 1). The in phase conductivity of the sample with a low clay content (1 % in volume) increases quickly with the salinity because of its low DC surface conductivity. Its quadrature conductivity also increases quickly with salinity because of the formation of the Stern layer at the surface of quartz sand. Nevertheless, our SIP model can't predict the <b>quadrature</b> conductivity <b>spectra</b> observed at very low frequencies (< 10 - 1 Hz). The missing polarization mechanism may correspond to membrane polarization and there is an effort to be done to incorporate this contribution in a unified model...|$|R
