5|$|The precise {{origin of}} the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18thcentury, duck breeds were rarely {{recorded}} in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for <b>quilts.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Aylesbury duck is a {{breed of}} domesticated duck, bred mainly for its meat and appearance. It {{is a large}} duck with pure white plumage, a pink bill, orange legs and feet, an unusually large keel, and a {{horizontal}} stance with its body parallel to the ground. The precise origins of the breed are unclear, but raising white ducks became popular in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in the 18th century owing to the demand for white feathers as a filler for <b>quilts.</b> Over the 19th century selective breeding for size, shape and colour led to the Aylesbury duck.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, Harriet Powers made <b>quilts</b> {{in rural}} Georgia, United States {{that are now}} {{considered}} among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern quilting. Later in the 20th century, the women of Gee's Bend developed a distinctive, bold, and sophisticated quilting style based on traditional African-American <b>quilts</b> with a geometric simplicity that developed separately but was like that of Amish <b>quilts</b> and modern art.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of African-American quilting beginning with <b>quilts</b> made by slaves, both for themselves and for their owners. The style of these <b>quilts</b> was determined largely by time period and region, rather than race, and the documented slave-made <b>quilts</b> generally resemble those made by white women in their region. After 1865 and the end of slavery in the United States, African-Americans began to develop their own distinctive style of quilting.|$|E

50|$|The Fred <b>Quilt</b> {{inquiries}} {{were two}} coroner's inquests into the November 1971 death of Fred <b>Quilt,</b> an elder of the Tsilhqot'in First Nation in the Chilcotin Country {{region of the}} west-central British Columbia Interior. Members of <b>Quilt's</b> family alleged that he died days after being beaten by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) constables. The inquest juries found no wrongdoing {{on the part of}} the RCMP. A group of activists formed the Fred <b>Quilt</b> Committee, which raised money for <b>Quilt's</b> family, later attempted to press criminal charges against the RCMP. The two constables were exonerated in 1977 by <b>Quilt's</b> widow's deathbed confession that she had caused <b>Quilt's</b> fatal injury and had orchestrated false testimony by herself and other witnesses.|$|R

25|$|Another American {{group to}} develop a {{distinct}} style of quilting were the Amish. Typically, these <b>quilts</b> use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish {{are known for their}} Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster <b>quilts</b> feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern <b>quilts</b> feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.|$|E
25|$|Some Native Americans {{are thought}} to have learned {{quilting}} through observation of white settlers; others learned it from missionaries who taught quilting to Native American women along with other homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These <b>quilts</b> often featured floral appliqué framing the star design. Pictorial <b>quilts,</b> created with appliqué, were also common.|$|E
25|$|Throughout China, {{a simple}} method of {{producing}} <b>quilts</b> is employed. It involves {{setting up a}} temporary roadside site. A frame is assembled within which a lattice work of cotton thread is made. Cotton batting, either new or retrieved from discarded <b>quilts,</b> is prepared in a mobile carding machine. The mechanism of the carding machine {{is powered by a}} small, petrol motor. The batting is then added, layer by layer, to the area within the frame. Between each layer, a new lattice of thread is created with a wooden disk used to tamp down the layer.|$|E

25|$|<b>Quilts</b> {{can have}} many {{different}} templates or patterns {{and they can}} have a large impact on the final result. There are a number of mediums that can be used and depending on the usage, size, and style they will give your quilt a varied look.

25|$|The <b>quilt</b> design {{theory is}} disputed.
