40|$|The {{design of}} a {{suitable}} quench protection system is fundamental for the safe operation of superconducting magnets and in turn requires the accurate simulation of the quench transient. The quench propagation in a toroidal field (TF) coil for the future European fusion reactor (EU DEMO) is analyzed here considering the latest, layer-wound winding pack (WP) design proposed by ENEA. The thermal-hydraulic model of a TF coil implemented in the 4 C code is updated by including the external cryogenic circuits of the WP and of the casing cooling channels and proposing a preliminary layout of the <b>quench</b> <b>lines.</b> Three different locations are considered for the quench initiation: maximum temperature margin in the WP, and minimum and maximum temperature margin on the same turn of the innermost layer. The evolution of the main electrical and thermal-hydraulic parameters is simulated, such as voltage along each layer, quench front propagation both along and across the layers, hot spot temperature, pressurization of the coil and coolant mass flow rate at the coil boundaries, so that the 4 C code provides a reliable (in view of its validation) and detailed virtual monitor of what happens inside the coil during the quench transient.

40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) are an emerging technology based on electrically conducting polymer films, with great promise for large area lighting and flexible ultra-thin displays. However, despite the rapid technological development, {{there is still a}} poor understanding of the degradation and spindependent recombination processes that take place inside an OLED. In this thesis, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) was used to investigate these processes in blue-emitting OLEDs. A successful procedure was developed and refined for fabricating OLEDs with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/emissive layer/Al/Ag, with and without the PEDOT:PSS hole-transporting layer. The organic emissive layer was either F 8 BT, PFO, or PVK:OXD- 7 :FIrpic (PB). These OLEDs were fabricated in air and with a geometry optimised for EPR experiments. Critical features for satisfactory devices were found to be a sufficiently thick organic layer and minimal exposure to the air. A compact apparatus was developed for simultaneous light output, current, and voltage measurements on the OLEDs while in an inert glove box environment. Electroluminescence and current-voltage parameters measured for these devices showed predominantly trap-controlled space-charge-limited conduction. OLEDs with PFO as the emissive layer and with a PEDOT:PSS layer were investigated with conventional, electrically-detected (ED) and optically-detected (OD) EPR techniques. EDEPR and ODEPR signals were observed at ~ 9. 2 GHz and in the low (< 50 mT) and high (~ 330 mT) magnetic field regimes and were found to change markedly with time during operation as the device degraded. The low field signals initially showed a composite broad quenching and superimposed narrow enhancing response centred around zero field strength. These signals were attributed to magneto-resistance (MR) and magneto-electroluminescence (MEL). Following operational ageing, a third, narrow <b>quenching</b> <b>line</b> was observed in the MR and the ratio of the initial two MR responses changed substantially. These effects are tentatively attributed to a hyperfine interaction. For both EDEPR and ODEPR, quenching high field resonances with a g-value (gyromagnetic ratio) of 2. 003 ± 0. 001 were observed. The current-quenching resonance gradually diminished during operation and after 4 – 5 hours was replaced by a current-enhancing resonance. The appearance of this latter resonance could be explained by chemical changes in the OLED due to the diffusion of oxygen through the device from the oxygen-plasma-treated ITO. A working model is proposed which can explain this observed change as spindependent trapping and recombination at free radicals, although the model requires further experimentation to test its validity...|$|R

40|$|Pion {{production}} in heavy-ion collisions is relatively well studied both theoretically and experimentally. There is still, however, a longstanding open question: Why pion multiplicities produced by transport models like BUU and QMD overestimate the experimental data? The largest discrepancy is observed for central Au+Au collisions at 1 AGeV [1]. In this system pions are mostly produced through the ∆-resonance excitations in a two-step process: NN → N∆, ∆ → Nπ. Since this process happens in nuclear matter, in-medium effects (besides evident Pauli blocking of the nucleons in final states) cannot be excluded. We {{have studied the}} effect of possible in-medium modification of the cross sections for the processes NN ↔ NR on the pion observables. The calculations have been done within the BUU model [2] employing the SM mean field (K= 220 MeV). The in-medium spin-averaged matrix element squared for the resonance R production/absorption was parametrized as |MNN↔NR | 2 = κ(ρ) |Mvac NN↔NR | 2, where |Mvac NN↔NR | 2 is the vacuum matrix element squared and κ(ρ) is a density-dependent function to be determined from a fit of the experimental data.

The fluorescence experiments of using DNA analog-double helix poly(oligo) nucleotide adducts yielded consistent results. Based upon model compounds, two anti-BPDE-DNA adducts have been identified by FLNS, trans N[superscript] 2 -dG and N[superscript] 6 -dA, which are believed to be of greatly biological-significance in the initiation processes of carcinogenesis.;This study shows that FLNS has sufficient resolution to distinguish the DNA adducts formed from the different BPDE stereoisomers, (+) -, (-) -anti-, and syn-BPDE-DNA adducts. FLNS was successfully applied to characterize the DNA adducts in the liver of English sole exposed to different doses of BaP in vivo. FLNS directly detected for the first time detected a potent carcinogen, (+) -anti-BPDE-DNA adduct, in women 2 ̆ 7 s placental samples. Laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy also revealed several other adducts in the placental DNA samples. The chemical origins of these adducts can be determined arising from three widespread environmental carcinogens: benzo (a) pyrene, benzo (b) fluoranthene, and dibenz (a,h) anthracene. The metabolic activation of BaP in the woman placenta is mainly through the monooxygenation pathway. In addition, this study reveals that the formation of the major adduct resulting from exposure to BaP in humans and fish is closely associated with the interactions of the co-existing carcinogens.

40|$|A new {{diagnostic}} {{for local}} measurements of ion temperature and drift velocity in fusion plasmas is {{proposed in the}} paper. The diagnostic is based on laser induced ionization of excited hydrogen and deuterium atoms from the levels which ionization energy less than the laser photon energy. A high intensive laser beam ionizes nearly all the excited atoms in the beam region resulting in a <b>quench</b> of spontaneous <b>line</b> emission of the appropriate optical transitions. The measurements of the quenching emission {{have been used in}} the past for local measurements of hydrogen atom density in tokamak plasma. The idea of the new diagnostic is spectral resolution of the quenching emission. The measured spectrum relates directly to the velocity distribution of the excited atoms. This distribution is strongly coupled to the distribution of the hydrogen atoms at the ground state. So, the spectral resolution of quenching emission is a way of local measurements of the temperature and drift velocity of hydrogen atoms in plasma. The temperature of hydrogen atoms is well coupled to the local ion temperature as long as the mean free path of the atoms is shorter than the ion gradient length in plasma. In this case the new diagnostic can provide local measurements of ion temperature in plasma.

These are found to vary from sample to sample, with values of 12. 5 and 18. 4 meV for the A and B excitons, respectively, in the one showing the highest quality spectra. Analysis of the temperature and power dependent PL spectra from the bound excitonic lines, labelled M 1, M 2, and M 3 appearing in multiplets points to a likely assignment of the hole involved in each case. The M 1 excitons appear to involve a conduction band electron and a hole from the B valence band hole. In contrast, an A valence band hole appears to be involved for the M 2 and M 3 excitons. In addition, the M 1 exciton multiplet seems to be due to the radiative recombination of excitons bound to shallow hydrogenic defects, whereas the excitons involved in M 2 and M 3 are bound to more complex defects. In contrast to the M 1 exciton multiplet, the excitonic lines of M 2 and M 3 saturate at high excitation powers suggesting that the concentration of the defects involved is low.

Single crystals of B- and P-Nb 2 O 5. were prepared by the Chemical Vapour Transport Technique Tinder predominantly convection controlled conditions. Phase equilibria experiments were carried out in a Cahn microbalance system and a newly designed Horizontal <b>Quench</b> Furnace <b>line.</b> Controlled oxygen potentials were generated from CO 2 /CO or CO 2 /H 2 gas mixtures. Structural studies of the oxides involved X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Results of phase equilibria studies in the NbO 2 - (B-Nb 2 O 5) system at 750 Â°C <T< 900 Â°C indicated that the transformation of B- to the block structure phase takes place readily on the area of contact with the Pt. container, probably catalyzed by the platinum surface. The transformed oxides contained both disordered and ordered fragments. In diffraction studies, the disordered structures simulated the tetragonal symmetry of M-Nb 2 O 5, the existence of which was contradicted by HRTEM results. A new phase Nb 43 O 107 having monoclinic lattice parameters of a = 20. 3 Ã, b = 3. 8 Ã, c = 61. 5 Ã and Î² = 117 Â° was detected in the ordered crystals. Its structural relationships with the neighbouring phases in the Nb-O system is discussed. At 700 Â°C and controlled oxygen potentials, B-Nb 2 O 5 transformed directly into NbO 2 on reduction. In the system NbO 2 - (P-Nb 2 O 5) at isotherm 750 Â°C and controlled oxygen potentials, Nb 12 O 29 existed as the only stable intermediate phase. Phase equilibria in the system (Ti-Nb-O) were determined by equilibrating TiNb 2 O 7, Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 and TiNb 24 O 62 at 1400 Â°C. The oxide-gas equilibrium was attained rapidly (< 1 hr). The (p, x) isotherms showed complete bivariance in the systems (Ti,Nb) O 2 - TiNb 2 O 7, (Ti,Nb) O 2 - Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 and (Ti,Nb) O 2 - TiNb 24 O 62.

Studies of quantum phase transitions {{in the presence of}} quenched randomness and with frustrating interactions are presented in detail. We discuss novel phenomena like Griffiths-McCoy singularities. We then turn to more recent topics like information theoretic measures of the quantum phase transitions in these models such as concurrence, entanglement entropy, quantum discord and quantum fidelity. We then focus on non-equilibrium dynamics of a variety of transverse field systems across quantum critical points and lines. After mentioning rapid quenching studies, we dwell on slow dynamics and discuss the Kibble-Zurek scaling for the defect density following a quench across critical points and its modifications for <b>quenching</b> across critical <b>lines,</b> gapless regions and multicritical points. Topics like the role of different quenching schemes, local quenching, quenching of models with random interactions and quenching of a spin chain coupled to a heat bath are touched upon. The connection between non-equilibrium dynamics and quantum information theoretic measures is presented at some length. We indicate the connection between Kibble-Zurek scaling and adiabatic evolution of a state as well as the application of adiabatic dynamics as a tool of a quantum optimization technique known as quantum annealing.

40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} apparatus in oxygenic photosynthesis {{consists of}} four major complexes (photosystem I, photosystem II, cytochrome b 6 f and ATPase). The vectorial integration of these complexes in the thylakoid membrane makes possible the transport of electrons across the membrane {{and the release of}} protons in lumen. The thylakoid membrane is energized through proton accumulation and ATP is formed though the pmf-driven ATPase rotation. Hence, steady state photosynthetic electron transport is coupled to ATP synthesis. When light saturates photosynthesis the reaction centers are under excitation pressure (especially PSII) and major photoprotective mechanisms are activated (non photochemical quenching and state transition quenching). Sustainable autoregulation of the photosynthetic apparatus maximizes quantum yield and increases photophotection. This work has focused on the role of polyamines (putrescine, Put; spermidine, Spd; and spermine, Spm) during biogenesis and functional assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus. They are ubiquitous low molecular weight aleiphatic amines with 2, 3 and 4 amino moieties, respectively. Polyamines are considered as hormone-like molecules although the underlying mechanism is not known. Due to their elevated levels during stress, they are corelated with tolerance of cells/organisms. Knowledge concerning the relationship between polyamines and the photosynthetic apparatus is rather fragmentary. During chloroplast biogenesis the plastidal levels of polyamines are reduced within hours to a new set point but the reason is not well understood. The missing underlying molecular mechanism of polyamine action in the photosynthetic apparatus was both the major obstacle and the main subject of this study. In this work a top-down approach through an in vivo functional monitoring of the biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus, allowed {{a better understanding of the}} role of polyamines. Further investigation of photosynthesis regulatory mechanisms, the use of the mutants C- 2 A΄ and Wt-LHC of Scenedesmus obliquus and in vitro experiments allowed the proposal of two novel molecular mechanisms concerning polyamine actions. Results are presented in four chapters. In the 1 rst chapter comparative analysis of light dependent and light independent biogenesis of the photosynthetic apparatus revealed why down-regulation of polyamines is a prerequisite of this developmental stage. Namely, a key process like chlorophyll biosynthesis and the subsequent assemply of chlorophyll binding proteins (photosystems and light harvesting complexes) are hindered by high levels of polyamines (> 2 mM Spm), because both light dependent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (LPOR) and light independent protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (DPOR) are inhibited. In addition, use of the mutant C- 2 A΄ made possible to reveal a novel phase of photosynthetic activation. Namely, the already known light independent chloroplast biogenesis reach a functional threshold of photosynthetic efficiency (unknown stable intermediate phase of suboptimum efficiency, Fv/Fm= 0. 31). Hence, the crucial distinction between intact-active and intact-inactive is suggested. Activation is possible through distinct events that among others include a 50 % increase of Spm bound to LHC of PSII, a dramatic increase of oligomerization degree of LHC monomers (from 10 % to 90 %) and an optimization of photosynthetic efficiency (from 0. 31 to more than 0. 70). This phase lasts only 300 s when light intensity is high enough (1000 μmolquanta. m- 2 s- 1). Studies with the mutant Wt-LHC demonstrated that polyamines are involved in the regulation of light energy utilization. A detailed study (2 nd chapter) of the regulation of photosynthesis indicated that Put has different effects than Spd and Spm. The common action of Spd and Spm in functional terms, distinct from the role of Put was verified by in vitro studies (3 rd chapter). Put treatment inhibits early NPQ rise, indicating inactivation of PsbS and alters membrane relaxation kinetics (delays membrane de-energization). Interestingly, Spd- and Spm-treatment caused an up-regulation of the energy dissipated nonradiatively as heat by the photosynthetic apparatus (350 % and 420 % respectively) and also induced a sustainable form of non photochemical quenching. The details of the underlying molecular mechanism were revealed by isolation of the thylakoid membranes and subsequent isolation of the native monomers of light harvesting complex of PSII. Namely, it was found that the iminogroup(s) of Spd and Spm were responsible for the quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. Furthermore, activation of the quenching mechanism is possible through a pHdependent step (protonation of a secondary amine group of polyamines). Put was unequivocally excluded as a quencher and Spd and Spm were the first in vivo and in vitro quenchers of chlorophyll fluorescence. The evaluation of these results allowed the proposal of a novel mechanism of non-photochemical quenching. The traits of the proposed mechanism (activation through protonation, inactivation through deprotonation, direct interaction between polyamines and light harvesting complex) improve our understanding concerning qE without conflicting with the xanthophyll cycle model, that is already correlated with NPQ. The latter is more slow process due to the enzymatic step that requires, than the proposed protonation of the iminogroup of polyamines and thus it might have a role in stabilizing and enhancing <b>quenching.</b> In <b>line</b> with these results, it was demonstrated that in LHC-lacking mutants (Wt-LHC) polyamines can not participate in energy dissipation. Additionally, a beneficial role of Spm in activation of reaction centers of PSII was shown. In the 4 th chapter this was confirmed in isolated chloroplasts (Spm increase 55 % Fv, mainly due to activation of PSIIα reaction centers) further studied with low temperature (77 K) spectroscopy. Activation of reaction centers is probably possible through a functional assembly of CP 43 with PSII core. Moreover, experiments under low salt media revealed the cationic effects of polyamines in the photosynthetic apparatus. Polyamines proved more efficient than inorganic cations which are normally found in chloroplast and a detailed study (concerning linear electron flow, PSII activity, overall efficiency to name a few) is illustrated. This study allowed the in-depth analysis of polyamine bionergetic role in photophosphorylation, attributed to non-cationic action. Put was proved as an efficient stimulator of photophosphorylation (provoked up to 80 % increase). Furthermore, small increase or decrease of Put levels (in the range of 0 - 1. 5 mM) leads to subsequent up or down regulation of chemiosmotic ATP synthesis, suggesting that for the same light energy input plants have a mechanism to increase profit by fine tuning levels of Put. The effect of Put treatment on relaxation kinetics of thylakoid membrane energization, the simulation of in vivo conditions in in vitro experiments and Put biochemical properties indicate, that ion trapping could be responsible for the stimulation mechanism. The two proposed mechanisms are in line with the increase of polyamines during stress and they may exlain why inability for rise leads to sensitivity. Ο φωτοσυνθετικός μηχανισμός στα ανώτερα φυτά και τα χλωροφύκη αποτελείται από τέσσερα μεγαλομοριακά σύμπλοκα, που εδράζονται ανυσματικά στις θυλακοειδείς μεμβράνες του χλωροπλάστη και κατηγοριοποιούνται σε δύο είδη φωτοσυστημάτων (I και II), ένα κυτόχρωμα (Cytb 6 f) και μία συνθάση ΑΤΡ. Τα τρία πρώτα είναι υπεύθυνα για τη ροή των ηλεκτρονίων και την φόρτιση της μεμβράνης των θυλακοειδών από πρωτόνια, που απελευθερώνονται προς την πλευρά του μικροχώρου. Η τελευταία (ΑΤΡάση) είναι υπεύθυνη για την αποφόρτιση της μεμβράνης και την παραγωγή ενέργειας υπο μορφή ΑΤΡ. Τα σύμπλοκα λειτουργούν συγχρόνως και η ροή των ηλεκτρονίων είναι συζευγμένη με την σύνθεση ΑΤΡ. Η λειτουργικότητα του μηχανισμού κάτω από τις διαρκώς μεταβαλλόμενες συνθήκες (π. χ. θερμοκρασίας, έντασης φωτός, διαθεσιμότητας θρεπτικών), εξασφαλίζεται με πολύπλοκους μηχανισμούς αυτορρύθμισης. Η ταχύτατη ενεργοποίηση (ακόμη και εντός δευτερολέπτων) αυτών των εξειδικευμένων δικλείδων ασφαλείας και η ελεγχόμενη ενεργοποίηση, μόνο όταν το απαιτούν οι συνθήκες, εξασφαλίζει υψηλότατες αποδόσεις σε χαμηλό φωτισμό και από την άλλη υψηλή φωτοπροστασία σε έντονο φωτισμό. Η παρούσα εργασία αφιερώθηκε στη μελέτη του ρόλου των πολυαμινών (πουτρεσίνη: Put, σπερμιδίνη: Spd και σπερμίνη: Spm) κατά την ανάπτυξη και τη λειτουργική οργάνωση του φωτοσυνθετικού μηχανισμού. Οι πολυαμίνες είναι χαμηλού μοριακού βάρους αμίνες με 2, 3, και 4 αμινομάδες, αντίστοιχα, που απαντώνται σε όλα τα κύτταρα (προκαρυωτικά και ευκαρυωτικά). Θεωρούνται αυξητικοί παράγοντες χωρίς όμως να έχει βρεθεί ο μοριακός μηχανισμός δράσης τους. Επίσης, συνδέονται με την αντοχή των κυττάρων σε καταπονήσεις και συνήθως ανικανότητα αύξησης των πολυαμινών σε συνθήκες καταπόνησης αυξάνει την ευαισθησία των κυττάρων/οργανισμών. Στο χλωροπλάστη είναι παρούσες σε φυσιολογικές συνθήκες και σταθεροποιούνται σε νέα επίπεδα μετά από μία σημαντική μείωση κατά τη διαφοροποίηση του πλαστιδίου, αλλά η γνώση για τον τρόπο με το οποίο δρουν είναι αποσπασματική. Στην παρούσα εργασία επιχειρήθηκε να αποσαφηνισθεί ο ρόλος τους στο φωτοσυνθετικό μηχανισμό. Τα πειραματικά αποτελέσματα είναι χωρισμένα σε 4 θεματικές ενότητες (4 Κεφάλαια). Στο 1 ο κεφάλαιο, η συγκριτική μελέτη της φωτοανεξάρτητης και της φωτοεξαρτώμενης βιογένεσης του φωτοσυνθετικού μηχανισμού αποκάλυψε ότι ο λόγος που οι πολυαμίνες μειώνονται φυσιολογικά κατά τη βιογένεση είναι διότι πρέπει να επιτρέψουν τη βιοσύνθεση της χλωροφύλλης και την συνεπακόλουθη δημιουργία των φωτοσυστημάτων. Αν διατηρηθούν σε υψηλά επίπεδα (> 2 mM Spm) αναστέλλουν την αναγωγή του πρωτοχλωροφυλλιδίου, εμποδίζουν τη σύνθεση της χλωροφύλλης και ως εκ τούτου εμποδίζουν τη δημιουργία του|$|R
