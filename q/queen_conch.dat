5|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> {{fishery is}} usually managed under the {{regulations}} of individual nations. In the United States all taking of <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is prohibited in Florida and in adjacent Federal waters. No international regional fishery management organization exists {{for the whole}} Caribbean area, but {{in places such as}} Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is regulated {{under the auspices of the}} Caribbean Fishery Management Council (CFMC). In 2014, the Parties to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) included <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> in Annex III of its Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol). Species included in the Annex III require special measures to be taken to ensure their protection and recovery, and their use is authorised and regulated accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Brought by explorers, <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells {{quickly became}} a popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations by families of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is more abundant in the deepest range. The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, inshore seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E
500|$|The {{shells of}} {{juvenile}} <b>queen</b> <b>conches</b> are strikingly different in appearance {{from those of}} the adults. Noticeable is the complete absence of a flared outer lip; juvenile shells have a simple sharp lip, which gives the shell a conical or biconic outline. In Florida, juvenile <b>queen</b> <b>conches</b> are known as [...] "rollers", because wave action very easily rolls their shells, whereas it is nearly impossible to roll an adult specimen, due to its shell's weight and asymmetric profile. Subadult shells have a thin flared lip that continues to increase in thickness until death.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{generalized}} ecosystems in Quintana Roo—tropical forests, or jungle; savanna, mangrove forests, and coral reefs. One of the byproducts of traditional and large-scale agriculture {{is the creation}} of additional habitats, such as second growth forests and fields/pastures. [...] Tourism has caused Quintana Roo to become famous around the world in the last thirty or so years for its beaches, coastline and cenote sinkholes. [...] Biological experts consider the coastline of Quintana Roo one of the best manatee habitats worldwide. [...] <b>Queen</b> <b>conchs</b> are also noted for their inhabitation of coastal territory. [...] The wide variety of biotic organisms such as these has decreased drastically in the last fifteen years.|$|R

Each grade level elects two Class Attendants, two escorts, and two Kahili Bearers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells {{were used}} by Native Americans and Caribbean Indians {{in a wide variety}} of ways. South Florida bands (such as the Tequesta), the Carib, the Arawak and Taíno used conch shells to {{fabricate}} tools (such as knives, axe heads and chisels), jewelry, cookware and used them as blowing horns. In Mesoamerican history, Aztecs used the shell as part of jewelry mosaics such as the double-headed serpent. The Aztecs also believed that the sound of trumpets made from <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells represented divine manifestations, and used them in religious ceremonies. In central Mexico, during rain ceremonies dedicated to Tlaloc, the Maya used conch shells as hand protectors (in a manner similar to boxing gloves) during combat. Ancient middens of L. gigas shells bearing round holes are considered an evidence that pre-Columbian Lucayan Indians in the Bahamas used the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> as a food source.|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the <b>queen</b> <b>conch).</b>|$|E
5|$|International {{trade in}} the Caribbean <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is {{regulated}} under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, {{in which it is}} listed as Strombus gigas. This species is not endangered in the Caribbean as a whole, but is commercially threatened in numerous areas, largely due to extreme overfishing.|$|E
5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the <b>queen</b> <b>conch).</b> Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small cardinalfish, known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is herbivorous {{and lives}} in {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong foot and a corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell and}} soft parts of living L.gigas {{serve as a}} home to several {{different}} kinds of commensal animals, including slipper snails, porcelain crabs and cardinalfish. Its parasites include coccidians. The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails, and also by starfish, crustaceans and vertebrates (fish, sea turtles and humans). Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as a decorative object. Historically, Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas is a prey {{species for}} several {{carnivorous}} gastropod mollusks, including the apple murex Phyllonotus pomum, the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea, the lamp shell Turbinella angulata, the moon snails Natica spp. and Polinices spp., the muricid snail Murex margaritensis, the trumpet triton Charonia variegata and the tulip snail Fasciolaria tulipa. Crustaceans are also conch predators, {{such as the}} blue crab Callinectes sapidus, the box crab Calappa gallus, the giant hermit crab Petrochirus diogenes, the spiny lobster Panulirus argus and others. Sea stars, vertebrates, including fish (such as the permit Trachinotus falcatus and the porcupine fish Diodon hystrix), loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) and humans also dine on the <b>queen</b> <b>conch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and weighing up to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, {{but it could be}} substantially higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E
25|$|In some Caribbean {{countries}} such as Jamaica and the Bahamas, cleaned <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells, or polished fragments, are sold, mainly to tourists, as souvenirs or in jewelry. Responding to a 2003 recommendation from CITES, some countries in the Caribbean have banned the export of <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> shells. CITES has also asked all countries to ban import of these shells from countries that are not complying with CITES recommendations for managing the fishery. <b>Queen</b> <b>conch</b> fisheries have been closed in several countries. Conch shells or fragments taken home by tourists from noncomplying countries may be confiscated on return to the tourist's home country while clearing customs. In the UK, conch shells are the ninth most-seized import.|$|E
25|$|In North America, a conch {{is often}} {{identified}} as a <b>queen</b> <b>conch,</b> found {{off the coast of}} Florida. Queen conchs are valued for fish bait, and are also known as seafood.|$|E
25|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely or partially into the substrate, is also frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing process itself, which involves distinct sequential movements and sometimes complex behaviours, is very characteristic of each species. Usually, large strombid gastropods such as the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> Eustrombus gigas and the spider conch Lambis lambis, do not bury themselves, except during their juvenile stage. On the other hand, smaller species such as the dog conch Strombus canarium and Strombus epidromis may bury themselves even after adulthood, though {{this is not an}} absolute rule.|$|E
500|$|This {{species has}} been {{mentioned}} in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1985. [...] In 1992 the United States proposed <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> for listing in CITES Appendix II, making <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> the first large-scale fisheries product to be regulated by CITES (as Strombus gigas). In 1995 CITES began reviewing the biological and trade status of the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> under its [...] "Significant Trade Review" [...] process. These reviews are undertaken to address concerns about trade levels in an Appendix II species. Based on the 2003 review, CITES recommended that all countries prohibit importation from Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, according to Standing Committee Recommendations. <b>Queen</b> <b>conch</b> meat continues to be available from other Caribbean countries, including Jamaica and Turks and Caicos, which operate well-managed <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> fisheries. For conservation reasons, the Government of Colombia currently bans the commercialisation and consumption of the conch between the months of June and October.|$|E
500|$|Lobatus gigas {{abundance}} {{is declining}} throughout its range {{as a result}} of overfishing and poaching. Trade from many [...] Caribbean countries such as Antigua and Barbuda, Honduras, Haiti and the Dominican Republic is known or thought to be unsustainable. As of 2001, <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> populations in at least 15 Caribbean countries and states were overfished and/or overexploited. Illegal harvest, including fishing in foreign waters and subsequent illegal international trade, is a common problem in the region. The Caribbean [...] "International <b>Queen</b> <b>Conch</b> Initiative" [...] is an international attempt at managing this species.|$|E
500|$|Lobatus gigas, {{originally}} {{known as}} Strombus gigas, {{commonly known as}} the <b>queen</b> <b>conch,</b> is a species of large edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family of true conches, the Strombidae. This species {{is one of the largest}} molluscs native to the tropical northwestern Atlantic, from Bermuda to Brazil, reaching up to [...] in shell length. L.gigas is closely related to the goliath conch, Lobatus goliath, a species endemic to Brazil, as well as the rooster conch, Lobatus gallus.|$|E
500|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> was {{originally}} described from a shell in 1758 by Swedish naturalist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus, who originated {{the system of}} binomial nomenclature. Linnaeus named the species Strombus gigas, which remained the accepted name for over 200 years. Linnaeus did not mention a specific locality for this species, giving only [...] "America" [...] as the type locality. The specific name is the ancient Greek word [...] (...) , which means [...] "giant", referring to the large size of this snail compared with almost all other gastropod molluscs. Strombus lucifer, which {{was considered to be}} a synonym much later, was also described by Linnaeus in Systema Naturae.|$|E
500|$|<b>Queen</b> <b>conch</b> embryos hatch 3–5 {{days after}} spawning. At {{the moment of}} hatching, the [...] protoconch (embryonic shell) is {{translucent}} and has a creamy, off-white background color with small, pustulate [...] markings. This coloration is different from other Caribbean Lobatus, such as Lobatus raninus and Lobatus costatus, which have unpigmented embryonic shells. Afterwards, the emerging two-lobed veliger (a larval form common to various marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) spend several days developing in the plankton, feeding primarily on phytoplankton. Metamorphosis occurs some 16–40 days from the hatching, when the fully grown protoconch is about 1.2mm high. After the metamorphosis, L.gigas individuals {{spend the rest of}} their lives in the benthic zone (on or in the sediment surface), usually remaining buried during their first year of life.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{species of}} large marine {{gastropod}} shells {{can be turned}} into [...] "blowing shells", but some of the best-known species used are the sacred chank or shankha Turbinella pyrum, the Triton's trumpet Charonia tritonis, and the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> Strombus gigas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group of}} conchs that are {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "true conchs" [...] are marine gastropod molluscs in the family Strombidae, specifically in the genus Strombus and other closely related genera. For example, see Lobatus gigas, the <b>queen</b> <b>conch,</b> and Laevistrombus canarium, the dog conch.|$|E
2500|$|Strombid {{gastropods}} live {{mainly in}} tropical and subtropical waters. These animals are {{widespread in the}} Indo-West Pacific, where most species and genera occur. [...] Nearly forty of the living species that used {{to belong to the}} genus Strombus {{can be found in the}} Indo-Pacific region. They also occur in the eastern Pacific and Western Atlantic, and a single species can be found on the African Atlantic coast. Six species of strombids are found in the wider Caribbean region, including the <b>queen</b> <b>conch</b> Lobatus gigas, the goliath conch Lobatus goliath, the hawk-wing conch Lobatus raninus, the rooster tail conch Lobatus gallus, the milk conch Lobatus costatus, the West Indian fighting conch Strombus pugilis and the Florida fighting conch Strombus alatus. Until recently, all of these species were placed in the genus Strombus, but now many species are being moved into new genera.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{different}} kinds of mollusks can produce pearls. Pearls from the <b>queen</b> <b>conch,</b> L. gigas, are rare and have been collectors' items since Victorian times. Conch pearls occur {{in a range of}} hues, including white, brown and orange, with many intermediate shades, but pink is the colour most associated with the conch pearl, such that these pearls are sometimes referred to simply as [...] "pink pearls". In some gemological texts, non-nacreous gastropod pearls used to be referred to as [...] "calcareous concretions" [...] because they were [...] "porcellaneous" [...] (shiny and ceramic-like in appearance), rather than [...] "nacreous" [...] (with a pearly lustre), sometimes known as [...] "orient". The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term [...] "pearl"—or, where appropriate, the more descriptive term [...] "non-nacreous pearl"—when referring to such items, and under Federal Trade Commission rules, various mollusc pearls may be referred to as [...] "pearls" [...] without qualification.|$|E
