The inverse square-root and square-root Helmholtz operator symbols are the initial quantities of interest in both formulations, in addition to providing the theoretical framework for {{the development and implementation of}} the ‘parabolic equation ’ (PE) method in wave propagation modeling. Exact, standard (left) and Weyl symbol constructions are presented for both the inverse square-root and square-root Helmholtz operators in the case of the focusing <b>quadratic</b> <b>profile</b> in one transverse spatial dimension, extending (and, ultimately, unifying) the previously published corresponding results for the defocusing quadratic case [J.

Both (i) spectral (modal) summation representations and (ii) contour-integral representations, exploiting the underlying periodicity of the associated, quantum mechanical, harmonic oscillator problem, are derived, and, ultimately, related through the propagating and nonpropagating contributions to the operator symbol. High- and low-frequency, asymptotic operator symbol expansions are given along with the exact symbol representations for the corresponding operator rational approximations which provide the basis for the practical computational realization of the PE method. Moreover, while the focusing <b>quadratic</b> <b>profile</b> is, in some respects, nonphysical, the corresponding Helmholtz operator symbols, nevertheless, establish canonical symbol features for more general profiles containing locally-quadratic wells.

Characterization of the scattering properties of this particular scatterer constitutes the main objective of this work. The presence of viscoelastic film induces an inhomogeneous damping that is added to that of the material constituting the plate. The study of the dissipation mechanisms is conducted in two steps. The first step consists in developing an analytical model of reference, characterizing the ABH behavior in the absence of viscoelastic coating.

It {{will be shown}} that such a profile, which may be induced by the laser beam itself, changes the curvature of the phase front, so that additional radiation transport in the radial direction takes place. It turns out that for many practical systems the radial radiation transport can be comparable to the radiation gained directly from the medium and therefore may not be neglected. Furthermore, it will be shown how the additional radial radiation transport affects the oscillating frequency.

It was a special EAA event ([URL] reduction of flexural vibration in thin plates is examined using the acoustic black hole effect associated with nearly zero reflection of quasi-plane waves from a lightly damped wedge or tapered hole where the profile varies according to a power-law. The flexural wave propagation can be determined through the application of geometrical acoustics approximation or exact analytical solutions. For a plate of thickness of power-law profile, the wave slows down and grows in amplitude. In the ideal case of no truncation of the quadratic (or higher) profile, the phase speed asymptotically decreases to zero and the wave never reaches the end. Manufactured plates always have a truncation, leading to relatively high reflection coefficients, however, the application of small damping layers leads to substantial decreases in the reflection coefficients and thus large reductions in mobility amplitudes.

This match was obtained by keeping constant the texture surface, and by varying the illumination direction for the shading surface, and the angular rotation for the motion surface. If the 3 D shapes perceived from shading, motion or texture are related to the simulated surface by an affine stretching, then our procedure should produce identical values of perceived curvature, depth and slant also for all other local patches of the three surfaces. Our empirical results, however, show {{that this is not the}} case. This implies that the recovered 3 D shapes from shading, texture and motion are not related to the simulated 3 D surface by an affine transformation. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the local analysis of image signals specifies different 3 D properties. Shading specifies only local curvature; texture local slant and curvature; motion local curvature, slant and depth. Slant and depth from shading, and depth from texture can only be computed through spatial integration, which necessarily introduces noise in the recovery process.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{two-dimensional}} thin-film flow inside a stationary circular cylinder {{driven by an}} imposed surface shear stress. Modelling is motivated by a {{need to understand the}} cooling and film dynamics provided by oil films in an aero-engine bearing chamber characterised by conditions of very high surface shear and additional film mass flux from oil droplets entering the film through the surface. In typical high-speed operation, film inertial effects can provide a significant leading-order mechanism neglected in existing lubrication theory models. Inertia at leading-order is included within a depth-averaged formulation where wall friction is evaluated similar to hydraulic models. This allows key nonlinear inertial effects to be included while retaining the ability to analyse the problem in a mathematically tractable formulation and compare with other approaches. In constructing this model, a set of simplified mass and momentum equations are integrated through the depth of the film yielding a spatially one-dimensional depth-averaged formulation of the problem. An a priori assumed form of velocity profile is needed to complete the system. In a local Stokes flow analysis, a <b>quadratic</b> <b>profile</b> is the exact solution for the velocity field though it must be modified when inertial effects become important. Extension of the velocity profile to a cubic profile is selected enabling specification of a wall friction model to include the roughness of the cylinder wall. A modelling advantage of including the inertia term, relevant to the applications considered, is that a smooth progression in solution can be obtained between cases of low Reynolds number corresponding to lubrication theory, and high Reynolds number corresponding to uniform rimming-flow. Importantly, we also investigate the effect of inertia on some typical solutions from other studies and present a greater insight to existing and new film solutions which arise from including inertia effects...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{simulation}} (forward problem) and reconstruction (inverse problem) in Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT) are studied using a pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method with 4 th-order time integration. The {{objective of the}} TAT simulation is to solve for the thermoacoustic pressure field in an inhomogeneous medium. Using the PSTD method, the spatial derivatives of pressure field and particle velocity can be obtained using fast fourier transform (FFT). Since the Fourier transforms used to represent the spatial derivatives of smooth functions are exact, only 2 points per wavelength are needed in the spatial discretization. The time integration is achieved by a 4 th-order method to effectively reduce the computational time. The results of the algorithm are validated by analytical solutions. Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) are applied to absorb the outgoing waves and avoid ``wraparound'' effect. The maximum attenuation coefficient of the PMLs has an optimum value to minimize the reflections due to discretization and wraparound effect for 2 D and 3 D problems. Different PML profiles are also compared, <b>quadratic</b> <b>profile</b> is chosen because it can minimize the overall reflection. Spatial smoothing is needed for PSTD to avoid Gibbs' phenomenon in the modeling of a point source, {{and the effect of}} the smoothing function is studied. In the TAT reconstruction problem, the PSTD method is used to reconstruct the thermoacoustic sources by solving the thermoacoustic wave equations in a reversed temporal order within the framework of time reversal imaging. The back-propagated pressure waves then refocus at the spatial locations of the original sources. Most other TAT reconstruction algorithms are {{based on the assumption that}} the tissue medium is acoustically homogeneous. In practice, however, even the mild tissue inhomogeneity will cause large phase errors and cause spatial misplacement and distortion of the sources. The proposed PSTD method utilizes a two-step process to solve this problem. In the first step, a homogeneous time reversal reconstruction is performed. Since an inhomogeneity itself is usually a source because of spatially dependent electrical conductivity (thus microwave absorption), the spatial location and the shape of the inhomogeneity can be estimated. In the second step, the updated acoustic property map is loaded followed by an inhomogeneous reconstruction. Numerical results show that this method greatly improves the reconstruction results. Images with improved quality are reconstructed from experimental data. A 3 D PSTD algorithm is developed and validated. Numerical results show that the PSTD algorithm with the 4 th-order time integration is capable of simulating large 3 D acoustic problems accurately and efficiently. A 3 D breast phantom model is used to study the inhomogeneous reconstruction in 3 D. Improved results over the homogeneous method are observed.

The application of the technique for single coil acquisitions is thoroughly studied by means of numerical simulations as well as phantom and in vivo experiments on a 7 T scanner. The corresponding results suggest a favorable comparison with state-of-the-art variable density k-space under-sampling approaches.
