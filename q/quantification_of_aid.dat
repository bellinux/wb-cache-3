40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of public support for the European car industry during the past decade. First, we identify the most relevant instruments of public support, and review their economic assessment. The European Commission increasingly recognizes the role of economic analysis in controlling public aid to the car industry, although the degree of economic assessment varies across di¤erent instruments of public support and individual state aid cases. Moreover, the state aid legislative framework is open to derogations and interpretations. In particular, the Temporary Framework, approved by the Commission to tackle the last financial and economic crisis de facto implied a relaxation <b>of</b> the state <b>aid</b> rules and foresaw no formal control <b>of</b> individual state <b>aids.</b> Second, we aim to estimate the amount of public support for European car manu- facturers. Three factors complicate the overall <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> public support for each instrument: (i) the Commission does not scrutinize, and hence does not quantify all public support measures; (ii) the available information depends on whether the state aid is granted to individual companies or in the form of general schemes; and (iii) the available information depends on whether the aid is granted {{in the form of a}} grant, soft loan or guarantee. Our lower bound estimate <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> suggests that the aid declined over the pre-crisis period, but peaked at EUR 1. 2 billion as a response to the last financial and economic crisis in 2009. Perhaps even more strikingly, this state aid was combined with an unprecedented amount of public support granted through scrapping schemes of at least EUR 4. 0 billion, and loans from the European Investment Bank of EUR 2. 8 billion, or an equivalent of EUR 400 million of "aid element". In conclusion, the existence of multiple public support instruments at different levels may create coordination problems and a lack of transparency, in spite of the Commis- sion's efforts. The lack of transparency in turn poses a challenge for the <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> and non-state aid support to any industry or sector. This paper provides a first step towards informing the policy debate on the e¤ects of public support to the car sector, and also stimulates the academic interest in the subject <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> and - more generally - public transfers to companies...|$|R

40|$|Modification of {{cellular}} macromolecules by reactive drug metabolites {{is considered to}} play an important role in the initiation of tissue injury by many drugs. Detection and identification of reactive intermediates is often performed by analyzing the conjugates formed after trapping by glutathione (GSH). Although sensitivity of modern mass spectrometrical methods is extremely high, absolute <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> GSH-conjugates is critically dependent on the availability of authentic references. Although 1 H NMR is currently the method <b>of</b> choice for <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> metabolites formed biosynthetically, its intrinsically low sensitivity can be a limiting factor in <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> GSH-conjugates which generally are formed at low levels. In the present study, a simple but sensitive and generic method for absolute <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> GSH-conjugates is presented. The method is based on quantitative alkaline hydrolysis of GSH-conjugates and subsequent <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> glutamic acid and glycine by HPLC after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde/N-acetylcysteine (OPA/NAC). Because of the lower stability of the glycine OPA/NAC-derivate, <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> the glutamic acid OPA/NAC-derivate appeared most suitable for <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> GSH-conjugates. The novel method was used to quantify the concentrations of GSH-conjugates of diclofenac, clozapine and acetaminophen and quantification was consistent with 1 H NMR, but with a more than 100 -fold lower detection limit for absolute quantification...|$|R
