25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the mound was either raised for a woman or {{for a young man}} and a woman as the remains of a woman and boy were found.

25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but his bright blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
25|$|In Locabail, Mrs. Emmanuel and {{her lawyers}} did nothing after the judge's {{disclosure}} {{of a conflict}} of interest and only sprung into action to complain about bias after learning she had failed in her claims. It was held that the law did not allow Mrs. Emmanuel to have {{the best of both worlds}} by waiting to see how her claims in litigation turned out before pursuing her complaint of bias. Similarly, in Pillai, although the applicant had knowledge of all matters grounding his complaint of bias before judgment was delivered, he only decided to complain after he had lost the appeal. The court found that if he had not lost, it was <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> that he would not have filed the motion. The doctrine of waiver therefore militated firmly against him.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Lee and John Stuart {{searched the}} {{surrounding}} country for fugitives who {{had participated in}} the attack. Few of Brown's associates escaped, and among those who did, some were sheltered by abolitionists in the north, including William Still. Brown was taken to the court house in nearby Charles Town for trial. He was found guilty of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia and was hanged on December 2. (This execution was witnessed by the actor John Wilkes Booth, who would later assassinate President Abraham Lincoln.) On the day of his execution, Brown wrote his last testament, which said,'I John Brown am now <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> that the crimes of this guilty, land: will never be purged away; but with Blood. I had as I now think: vainly flattered myself that without very much bloodshed; it might be done.'Four other raiders were executed on December 16 and two more on March 16, 1860.|$|E

25|$|The new {{millennium}} saw {{a shift in}} Wong's musical career with the album Fable (寓言). The prominent feature of this album is its segregated and distinguishable halves – songs {{in the first half}} of the album running in an almost continuous manner and in a format that is akin to a song-cycle, and the second half of discrete, chart-friendly numbers. The album itself derives its artistic merits from the first half, notable for its unique thematic and continuous sequencing of songs unprecedented in the Chinese music industry. The theme itself is ambiguous and the lyrics subject to multiple interpretations, though it is <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> that the theme of Fable forms the main thematic reference, derived from the motivic elements of the prince and princess in fables and fairytales of European origins. Elements of spirituality, metaphysics and Buddhism hold an important place in the lyrics as well, penned by Lin Xi who has by then, been unanimously identified as Faye's lyricist par excellence. Musically the arrangements display influences of drum and bass, electronica, east-west collage and lush string orchestral infusions.|$|E
25|$|The chapel, in particular, was {{a mix of}} {{architectural}} styles– Gothic revival and baroque. The chapel is mixture of late Gothic tracery, Renaissance swags of fruit and foliage, cherubs and cusps, fan-vaulting and Corinthian capitals. In the first place there was the old Chapel of St. Mary's College, the roof and window jambs of which were used up again in the new building. The date of this Chapel is not <b>quite</b> <b>certain.</b> It may have been as early as 1440, or even before that date; it was certainly completed by 1536. It would in any case have been in late Perpendicular Gothic, with tracery windows, and had the hammer-beam roof, now over the new Chapel. Gothic traditions lingered on in Oxford longer than anywhere else: Trinity College Hall, with its Perpendicular windows was built in 1610; Wadham College also in 1610; Thomas Bodley's additions to the Bodleian Library, and the old Schools, were finished in 1613. At {{the same time the}} new school of the Renaissance was emerging, in its later and more classical phase, with its carvers trained in the school of Inigo Jones, Nicholas Stone, and others, who had already done work in Oxford, at St. Mary's porch, the Oxford Botanic Gardens, and elsewhere. At the time of the Chapel's construction there were thus competing styles. It is the mixture of styles that has attracted most of the criticism.|$|E
25|$|There is {{not much}} known of Confucius's disciples, and a little over half of them had their {{surnames}} recorded in the Zuo Zhuan. The Analects records 22 names that are most likely Confucius's disciples, while the Mencius records 24 names, although it is <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> {{that there have been}} many more disciples whose name were not recorded. Most of Confucius's disciples were from the Lu state, while others were from neighboring states. For example, Zigong was from the Wey state, and Sima Niu was from the Song state. Confucius's favorite disciple was Yan Hui, most {{probably one of the most}} impoverished of them all. Sima Niu, in contrast to Yan Hui, was from a hereditary noble family hailing from the Song state. Under Confucius's teachings, the disciples became well-learned in the principles and methods of government. He often engaged in discussion and debate with his students and gave high importance to their studies in history, poetry, and ritual. Confucius advocated loyalty to principle rather than to individual acumen, in which reform was to be achieved by persuasion rather than violence. Even though Confucius denounced them for their practices, the aristocracy was likely attracted to the idea of having trustworthy officials who were studied in morals as the circumstances of the time made it desirable. In fact, the disciple Zilu even died defending his ruler in Wei.|$|E

[...] From 1862 to 1865 he studied harmony, counterpoint and fugue with Zaremba, while Rubinstein taught him instrumentation and composition.

500|$|Critics {{writing at}} the end of the nineteenth century praised Planché with sentiments such as [...] " [...] raised {{theatrical}} extravaganza and burlesque to the dignity of a fine art, and wrote verses to be sung on the stage which could be read with pleasure in the study." [...] and [...] "I am <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> that such masters of lyrical writing as W. S. Gilbert ... would confirm me in my opinion that the songs and lyrics in the extravaganzas of Planché were as faultless in tone, tact and taste as they were rhythmically perfect". (The converse was also true; Planché approved of, and strongly influenced Gilbert's works) Planché's dramatic reputation was already fading before his death, and continued to do so in the twentieth century. He is still remembered for his influence on and contributions to British theatre over a long career.|$|E

500|$|Although the rhino {{had been}} {{thought to be}} extinct in Kalimantan since the 1990s, in March 2013 World Wildlife Fund (WWF) {{announced}} that the team when monitoring orangutan activity found in West Kutai Regency, East Kalimantan, several fresh rhino foot trails, mud holes, traces of rhino-rubbed trees, traces of rhino horns {{on the walls of}} mud holes, and rhino bites on small branches. The team also identified that rhinos ate more than 30 species of plants.

500|$|In 2004, Chastain took on {{the role}} of Anya, a virtuous young woman, in a Williamstown Theatre Festival {{production}} of Anton Chekhov's play The Cherry Orchard in Massachusetts, starring with Michelle Williams. Also that year, she worked with Playwrights Horizons on a production of Richard Nelson's Rodney's Wife as the daughter of a troubled middle-aged film actor. Her performance was not well received by the critic Ben Brantley of The New York Times, who thought that she [...] "somehow seems to keep losing color as the evening progresses". While working on the play, she was recommended by Nelson to Al Pacino, who was looking for an actress to star in his production of Oscar Wilde's tragedy Salome. The play tells the tragic story of its titular character's sexual exploration. In the play, Salome is a 16-year-old, but Chastain, who was 29 then, was cast for the part. The play was staged in 2006 at the Wadsworth Theatre in Los Angeles, and Chastain later remarked that it helped bring her to the attention of several casting directors. Writing for Variety, the critic Steven Oxman criticized her portrayal in the play: [...] "Chastain is so ill-at-ease with Salome, not <b>quite</b> <b>certain</b> whether she's a capable seductress or a whiny, wealthy brat; she doesn't flesh out either choice".|$|E
