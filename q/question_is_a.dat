The book in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany {{at the time of}} my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the name Yatton is uncertain.

25|$|This {{publication}} set out {{the modern}} model-theoretic definition of (semantic) logical consequence, {{or at least the}} basis for it.

John Etchemendy stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.|$|E

25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The {{reason is that the}} theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to get an answer is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E

The German question is not a constitutional question but a question of power; and the Prussian monarchy is now wholly German, while that of Austria cannot be.|$|E

500|$|By October, Republicans {{shifted to}} a new issue: the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock {{presidency}} would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said [...] "the tariff <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> local question". [...] The answer seemed only to reinforce the Republicans' characterization of him as ignorant of the issues. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College, Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E
500|$|After their {{defeat in}} Maine, the Republicans began to emphasise policy {{differences}} more. One {{significant difference between}} them and the Democrats was a purposely vague statement in the Democratic platform endorsing [...] "a tariff for revenue only". Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that benefited from a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said [...] "the tariff <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> local question". While not completely inaccurate—tariff preferences often reflected local concerns—the statement was at odds with the Democrats' platform and suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue.|$|E

UGO named the episode's main antagonist {{as one of the greatest}} [...] "Top 11 X-Files Monsters," [...] noting that the creature is a [...] "perfect [...] if only because the monster in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> living, breathing metaphor, a never-seen specter that shifts to fit the fears of the person witnessing it." [...] Narin Bahar from SFX named the episode one of the [...] "Best Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries" [...] and wrote, [...] "Whether you see this as a brilliantly post-modern merging of fact and fiction or shameless cross-promotion of two of the Fox Network's biggest TV shows, there's lots of nods to the real Cops show in this episode".

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|Practical {{differences}} between the candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if Democrats held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed {{since the end of}} the war, and Union generals at the head of both tickets, the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters. With a few months to go before the election, the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff. Seizing on the Democratic platform's call for a [...] "tariff for revenue only", Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said, [...] "The tariff <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> local question." [...] The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield. In the end, fewer than two thousand votes, of the more than 9.2 million popular votes cast, separated the two candidates, but in the Electoral College Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock, 214 to 155.|$|E

500|$|With the war {{fifteen years}} {{in the past and}} Union generals at the head of both tickets, the tactic was less {{effective}} than the Republicans hoped. [...] Realizing this, they adjusted their approach to claim that Democrats would lower the country's protective tariff, which would allow cheaper manufactured goods to be imported from Europe, and thereby put thousands out of work. This argument struck home in the swing states of New York and Indiana, where many were employed in manufacturing. Hancock did not help his own cause when, in an attempt to remain neutral on the tariff, he said that [...] "he tariff <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> local question," [...] which only made him appear uninformed about an important issue. [...] Candidates for high office did not personally campaign in those days, but as state Republican chairman, Arthur played a part in the campaign in his usual fashion: overseeing the effort in New York and raising money. The funds were crucial in the close election, and winning his home state of New York was critical. The Republicans carried New York by 20,000 votes and, in an election with the largest turnout of qualified voters ever recorded—78.4%—they won the nationwide popular vote by just 7,018 votes. [...] The electoral college result was more decisive—214 to 155—and Garfield and Arthur were elected.|$|E
500|$|The episode makes {{references}} to several films and television shows. The Tracey Ullman Show {{is referred to}} as [...] "the nation's showcase for psychiatrist jokes and musical comedy numbers", while the outtakes right before the commercial breaks parodies television series such as Roseanne and Home Improvement (which regularly aired similar outtakes). The deleted scene from [...] "$pringfield" [...] in which Homer plays blackjack with James Bond parodies the 1967 film Casino Royale. The deleted scene from [...] "Burns' Heir" [...] in which the robotic Richard Simmons is shot through the head and repairs itself parodies the liquid metal T-1000 in the 1991 film [...] The episode satirizes the Fox network in particular, as the two specials mentioned in the beginning, Alien Nose Job and Five Fabulous Weeks Of 'The Chevy Chase Show, are {{references to}} two actual programs that have aired on the network: The Chevy Chase Show (1993) and [...] (1995). Several famous musical themes are used or parodied in the clips, such as when Homer sings the theme song from The Flintstones, and Johann Strauss II's Blue Danube is heard in the background of one scene. The show's producers are depicted as animated characters in the introduction: Groening is a bald Southern patriot who wields a gun wearing an eye patch, a reference to the promotional poster of the 1970 film Patton, and his own comic strip Life in Hell; Brooks is seen as Rich Uncle Pennybags, the tycoon from Monopoly; and Simon's appearance resembles Howard Hughes. One of Smithers' fantasies is a parody of Marilyn Monroe's famous happy birthday song to President John F. Kennedy, while another one is an allusion to Peter Pan flying through the window.
