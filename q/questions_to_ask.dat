5|$|The {{impending}} {{dinner with}} Mr. Burns divides the Simpson household. Homer pragmatically supports Mr. Burns, while Marge and Lisa oppose him. Before the dinner arrives, Mr. Burns's advisers prepare {{the family for}} the event, even giving them pre-written <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> in lieu of conversation. Lisa becomes disillusioned by it all, but Marge tells her not to worry. To everyone's surprise, Marge serves Blinky for dinner. Mr. Burns tries {{to act as if}} it does not bother him, but is not able to keep from spitting it out. The cameras flash as the bite flies through the air, {{and by the time the}} chunk hits the floor the press is gone and his governatorial campaign dissolves. Bailey wins the election and, despite Mr. Burns saying that Homer's dreams will be unfulfilled for as long as he is alive, the Simpson family happily get together again.|$|E
25|$|Review {{of systems}} (ROS) or systems inquiry: {{a set of}} {{additional}} <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> which may be missed on HPI: a general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.), followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The DM also {{includes}} the ability to save partially complete DSN's, with code and logic to ask the user for any missing information at runtime. For instance, a DSN can be created without a required password. When an ODBC application attempts to connect to the DBMS using this DSN, the system will pause and ask the user to provide the password before continuing. This frees the application developer from having to create this sort of code, as well as having to know which <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> All of this {{is included in the}} driver and the DSNs.|$|E

25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} were delighted with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their failure}} to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other {{radicals}} sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Washington, attempted to read them over {{the din of the}} melee. He was among the arrested, and the [...] "Boston riot" [...] received national press coverage. [...] Trotter later claimed that there was no plan to break up the meeting. Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimké, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity. After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.|$|E
500|$|M. Keith Booker {{cites the}} episode in Drawn to Television, while {{discussing}} The Simpsons treatment of religion. Booker cites {{a scene from}} the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul– and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money; Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that [...] "life suddenly feels empty and incomplete" [...] without a soul, which suggests [...] "either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction". Mark I. Pinsky and Samuel F. Parvin discuss the episode in their book The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study, and use examples from it to stimulate discussion among youth {{about the nature of the}} soul. Pinsky and Parvin note Bart's statement to Milhouse from the beginning of the episode: [...] "Soul— come on, Milhouse, there's no such thing as a soul. It's just something they made up to scare kids, like the Boogie Man or Michael Jackson", and then suggest <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> students, including whether they know individuals that agree with Bart, and their views on the existence of a soul.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the expert}} witness is being {{walked through the}} evidence, he/she has {{to keep in mind}} that most people have no {{thorough}} knowledge of entomology, so the responses to the questions being asked and the explanations about the evidence have to be kept clear and concise and in a simplistic manner that informs and educates, not only the jurors, but the judge as well. [...] It is vital that the attorney has a thorough grasp on all the concepts that are being explored so that he/she knows which <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> to carry across his point. In the same manner, the responses to the questions being asked by the opposing side should be kept as precise as possible, so as not to given the opposing attorney any ammunition to discredit the findings in the cross-examination.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1951, Wolff {{presented}} Cage {{with a copy}} of the I Ching—a Chinese classic text {{which describes}} a symbol system used to identify order in chance events. This version of the I Ching was the first complete English translation and had been published by Wolff's father, Kurt Wolff of Pantheon Books in 1950. The I Ching is commonly used for divination, but for Cage it became a tool to compose using chance. To compose a piece of music, Cage would come up with <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the I Ching; the book would then be used {{in much the same way}} as it is used for divination. For Cage, this meant [...] "imitating nature in its manner of operation": His lifelong interest in sound itself culminated in an approach that yielded works in which sounds were free from the composer's will: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{lecture at}} the Zoological Institute of the University of Zurich also was {{interrupted}} by two groups of protesters. The first group {{was a group of}} disabled people who staged a brief protest {{at the beginning of the}} lecture. They objected to inviting an advocate of euthanasia to speak. At the end of this protest, when Singer tried to address their concerns, a second group of protesters rose and began chanting [...] "Singer raus! Singer raus!" [...] ("Singer out!") When Singer attempted to respond, a protester jumped on stage and grabbed his glasses, and the host ended the lecture. The first group of protesters was distressed by this second, more aggressive group. It had not intended to halt the lecture and even had <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Singer. Singer explains [...] "my views are not threatening to anyone, even minimally" [...] and says that some groups play on the anxieties of those who hear only keywords that are understandably worrying (given the constant fears of ever repeating the Holocaust) if taken with any less than the full context of his belief system.|$|E
