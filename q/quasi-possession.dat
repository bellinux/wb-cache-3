50|$|The {{fiduciary}} security cession is {{an ordinary}} cession {{of a personal}} right as security coupled with a fiduciary agreement, which is an ordinary contract. In a pledge of a personal right, the ownership of the personal right is retained by the cedent, while only <b>quasi-possession</b> is transferred to the cessionary (pledgee).|$|E
40|$|It is {{suggested}} that this judgment is noteworthy, mainly for four reasons: first and foremost, {{the way in which}} Binns-Ward J, writing for the full court (Yekiso J and Savage AJ concurring), formulated the ratio decidendi: employing proper source materials - mainly case law and old authority - and not falling into the trap of merely relying on standard textbooks (for a critical appraisal of this trend, see Scott "A growing trend in source application by our courts illustrated by a recent judgment on right of way" 2013 THRHR 239). Secondly, it illustrates the fact that if more fundamental spadework had been done in the preparation of the case of the applicant (respondent in the appeal), the matter would probably not have ended up in court, although this suggestion is in some measure belied {{by the fact that the}} court of first instance actually decided in the applicant's favour (albeit erroneously, to my mind). In the third place, one is again reminded of the fact that the mandament van spolie is a remedy that has over time proved itself to possess the uncanny ability of causing confusion, in particular where it is applied to obtain redress in situations where there is an averment of spoliation of <b>quasi-possession.</b> Finally, it is living proof of how rich our Roman-Dutch common law is in well-established rules to resolve the most minute problems that can arise in an everyday situation flowing from normal commercial activity such as property development involving the subdivision of land in modern times.

40|$|The South African {{legal system}} is uncodified {{and from a}} {{comparative}} law perspective it is usually classified as a “mixed legal system”, meaning a mixture between Romano-Germanic law (in the form of Roman-Dutch law) and English common law. Property law is deeply rooted in Roman and Roman-Dutch law and a sharp distinction is drawn between ownership and possession {{and the protection of}} these two institutions. This contribution focuses on the protection of <b>quasi-possession</b> namely the possession of rights. Only certain rights can be possessed in South African law. These are rights of use such as servitutal rights and so-called incidents of possession (for example the access to water and electricity in terms of a contract such as a contract of letting and hiring). There is only one possessory remedy in South African law, the mandament van spolie (spoliation order or actio spolii). This remedy originated in 9 th century Canon Law and it protects possession against spoliation (the unlawful deprivation of possession of a thing or an alleged right). In accordance with the Roman, Canon law and Roman-Dutch tradition, when applying the mandament the court is not supposed to investigate the merits of the case (the actual rights of the parties). The Court only establishes whether there was possession of the alleged right (the exercise of actions usually associated with the right) and whether there was spoliation. Recently, however, the South African Supreme Court of Appeal started to focus on the actual rights (real or personal) of the parties involved. It is submitted that this approach is incorrect and that the same results could have been achieved if the Court had followed the traditional Roman and Roman-Dutch approach. [URL]...|$|E
