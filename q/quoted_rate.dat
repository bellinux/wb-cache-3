However, heat (possibly leading to weapon failure) and exhaustion of ammunition mean most automatic weapons {{are unlikely to}} sustain their cyclic rate of fire for a full minute. That is why lower rates apply in practice and it is incorrect to describe the cyclic rate of fire as [...] "the number of rounds a weapon can fire in one minute." ...|$|E
50|$|The officially <b>quoted</b> <b>rate</b> is a spot price. In {{a trading}} market however, {{currencies}} are {{offered for sale}} at an offering price (the ask price), and traders looking to buy a position seek to do so at their bid price, which is always lower or equal to the asking price. This price differential {{is known as the}} spread. For example, if the quotation of EUR/USD is 1.3607/1.3609, then the spread is USD 0.0002, or 2 pips. In general, markets with high liquidity exhibit smaller spreads than less frequently traded markets.|$|E

40|$|Companies tend to {{outsource}} transport to fleet management companies to increase efficiencies if transport is a non-core activity. The provision of fleet management services on contract introduces {{a certain amount}} of financial risk to the fleet management company, specifically fixed rate maintenance contracts. The <b>quoted</b> <b>rate</b> needs to be sufficient and also competitive in the market. Currently the quoted maintenance rates are based on the maintenance specifications of the manufacturer and the risk management approach of the fleet management company. This is usually reflected in a contingency that is included in the quoted maintenance rate. An alternative methodology for calculating the average maintenance cost for a vehicle fleet is proposed based on the actual maintenance expenditures of the vehicles and accepted statistical techniques. The proposed methodology results in accurate estimates (and associated confidence limits) of the true average maintenance cost and can beused as a basis for the maintenance quote...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is: 1. to discuss the methods of calculating {{interest}} rates that are commonly used in New Zealand; 2. to present case examples showing the difference between quoted and effective interest rates for a number of major lending institutions; and 3. to generate discussion as to the need for effective interest rate disclosure legislation in New Zealand. In only one of the case examples presented is the interest rate quoted on an effective basis. In all other cases, except where no interest rate is quoted at all, the quoted rates are lower than the effective rates. In one case the <b>quoted</b> <b>rate</b> is less than half the effective rate. If the effective rates were reduced to the quoted rates then for some of the larger loans borrowers would pay several thousand dollars less in interest over the term of the loan. The advent of programmable calculators and desktop computers has greatly simplified the calculating of effective interest rates. This should facilitate both the implementation and enforcement of interest rate disclosure legislation. The major factor at present preventing the enactment of interest rate disclosure legislation appears to be the opposition of the financial institutions. It would seem that many of these institutions {{have a vested interest in}} maintaining the status quo...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss whether or not {{postnatal}} depression is a global public health concern. Public health is the study of the morbidity, mortality and the cause and course of disease, at a population rather than an individual level. Public health is also concerned with examining factors that cause health inequalities. Postnatal depression is a mental and emotional condition that can affect women during the first postnatal year. Since the effects of postnatal depression are known to go beyond the mother in that it also affects the partner and the child, it can be deemed a public health problem. Additionally, severe postnatal depression can lead to infanticide as well as maternal death, often by suicide. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates that all countries are faced with the challenge of postnatal depression, but low- to middle-income countries face the greatest burden. The literature revealed various treatment options for this complex condition. However, it also uncovered that not all women are assessed for postnatal depression, nor do all women receive treatment. The emerging picture is that postnatal depression is indeed a public health problem, particularly as the incidence is much higher than the <b>quoted</b> <b>rate</b> of 10 %— 15 %. This paper recommends direction for public health-orientated perinatal mental health research and suggests that service providers should consider the routine assessment of all postnatal women...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is to find out}} the {{borrowing}} cost premia for those individuals who are liquidity-constrained, or who are first-time buyers of real estate. The analysis uses the similarity of a leveraged purchase with the exercise of a call option to defer the purchase of the asset. Sensible parameters are selected for the option, and simulations are run to identify the cost premia. The main conclusion is that these borrowing costs are prohibitive in central tendency and in dispersion. This means that liquidity-constrained individuals may be given borrowing quotations, but these <b>quoted</b> <b>rates</b> are so high and variable that these individuals are unwilling to borrow.
