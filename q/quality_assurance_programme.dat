With the permanent office also came an increase in structural funding for the secretariat. In addition to the operating costs for the AUN secretariat, also the financial support for AUN activities increased substantially since 1999. In addition to a growth in financial terms, projects also became more comprehensive. In particular, the AUN <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> <b>programme</b> has very ambitious goals with consequences that transcend the disciplinary boundaries. This can also form {{a turning point in the}} sense that through such projects all members of the participating universities will be affected. Many of the current activities are focused on particular individuals of the universities, and many other students and staff that are not involved in activities are not familiar with AUN and its activities. Most exchanges and gatherings for instance, although successful, have been modest in its impact on the universities as a whole. An explanation for this lies in the top-down character of the activities, with a high involvement of the university’s central level (and in some countries the ministry level) and only modest involvement of the faculties.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The initial <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>programme</b> of the EORTC Radiotherapy Cooperative Group {{in trial}} 22881 / 10882 is described. The {{implications}} of its results for quality assurance in future trials are discussed. METHODS: In the EORTC trial 22881 / 10882 patients with stage I or II breast cancer {{are treated with}} tumor excision, axillary dissection, 50 Gy whole breast irradiation and then randomized to receive a boost dose of 15 Gy or no boost following complete tumor excision or between 10 Gy or 25 Gy in case of incomplete excision. To avoid or diminish protocol deviations and to quantify inevitable variations an extensive initial <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>programme</b> was conducted. The programme consisted of a dummy run procedure an individual case review procedure, in vivo dosimetry studies and phantom dosimetry studies. RESULTS: This combination of quality assurance procedures allows a good estimation of patient to patient and inter-institutional variations, and early detection of (potential) systematic protocol deviations of 3 types: 1. Deviations due to ambiguities in the protocol prescriptions. 2. Deviations not known to the institution, such as mistakes in implementation of treatment planning algorithms resulting in a systematic overdosage or underdosage. 3. Inability of an institution to cope with (precise) protocol prescriptions for technical or logistic reasons. DISCUSSION: The first 2 types of deviations may be corrected or avoided by direct discussions and recommendations. With respect to the third type {{it is up to}} the trial coordinator to accept participation or not, depending upon the relative importance of the particular deviation(s) for the trial end points.

To analyze the validity of this <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>programme,</b> the ZI-data were compared with those of our prospective study.

The Data was compared with those of a prospective study that had been supplied by the same physicians during the same time period. The complications were recorded in three steps: After colonoscopy, physicians filled out a case report form (CRF) on immediate complications during and immediately after colonoscopy until patient discharge (physician CRF colonoscopy; CRF- 1). A second CRF included complication data that were {{brought to the attention of}} the gastroenterologists after the patient had left the practice, within 30 days (CRF- 2).
