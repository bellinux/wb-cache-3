The First Day covers, especially commemoratives with full sets affixed, are popular though the older issues are harder to find because less than a million of the high value stamps were printed {{in the early years}} (1929–1940s) for several issues, a far lower number than the 20-plus millions printed for most of the low values during the same period.|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon switch over to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual <b>quantity</b> <b>issued</b> remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
6000|$|The {{value of}} paper money is, of course, {{primarily}} and mainly [...] {{dependent on the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>issued.</b> The general level of value [...] depends on the quantity; but we also find that deviations from [...] this general level, {{in the direction of}} further depreciation than [...] could be due to quantity alone, is caused by any event which [...] shakes the confidence of any one that he may get the existing [...] value for his paper. The “convention” by which real value (the [...] essential idea of money) was associated with this paper in the [...] minds of all is thereby broken. Fiat money—that is, a piece of [...] paper, not containing a promise to pay a dollar, but a simple [...] declaration that this is a dollar—therefore, separates the paper [...] from any connection with value. And yet we see that fiat money [...] has some, although a fluctuating, value at certain times: if the [...] State receives it for taxes, if it is a legal acquittal of [...] obligations, then, to that extent, a certain quantity of it is [...] given a value equal to the wealth represented by the taxes, or the [...] debts. Jevons remarks on this point(247) that, if “the quantity of [...] notes issued was kept within such moderate limits that any one [...] wishing to realize the metallic value of the notes could find some [...] one wanting to pay taxes, and therefore willing to give coin for [...] notes,” stability of value might be secured. If there is more in [...] circulation than performs these functions, it will depreciate in [...] the proportion of the quantity to the extent of the uses [...] assigned to it; so that the relation of quantity to uses is the [...] only thing which can give value to fiat money, but beyond a [...] certain point in the issues other forces than mere quantity begin [...] to affect the value. Although the paper is not even a promise to [...] pay value, the form of expression on its face, or the term used as [...] its designation, generally tends, under the force of convention [...] and habit, to give a popular value to paper.|$|E

40|$|The {{prospect}} of water wars and conflict over water are {{ideas that are}} frequently dramatized in media and also studied by scholars. It is well-established that bona fide wars are not started over water resources, but conflict over water does exist and is not well understood. One would suppose, as scholars often do, that dyads composed of two democratic nations {{would be the best}} at mitigating conflict and promoting cooperation over freshwater resources. General conflict research supports that supposition, as does the argument that democracies must be best at avoiding conflicts over resources because they excel at distributing public goods. This study provides empirical evidence showing how interstate dyads composed of various governance types conflict and cooperate over general water and water <b>quantity</b> <b>issues</b> relative to each other. After evaluating the water conflict mitigating ability of democratic-democratic, democratic-autocratic, and autocratic-autocratic dyads, this study found that democracy-autocracy dyads are less likely to cooperate over general water <b>issues</b> and water <b>quantity</b> <b>issues</b> than the other two dyad types. Nothing certain can be said about how the three dyad types compare to each other in terms of likelihood to conflict over water <b>quantity</b> <b>issues.</b> However, two-autocracy dyads seem to be most likely to cooperate over water <b>quantity</b> <b>issues.</b> These findings support the established belief that democratic-autocratic pairs struggle to cooperate while also encouraging greater scrutiny of the belief that democracies must be best at cooperating over water resources.

6000|$|Although the State may not {{promise to}} pay a dollar, yet, {{wherever}} [...] such paper money carries any purchasing power with it (which has [...] very seldom happened, and then only for short periods), it will be [...] found {{that there is a}} vague popular understanding that the State [...] intends, at some time or other, to redeem the notes with value in [...] coin to some amount. In the early cases of irredeemable money in [...] our colonies, the income of taxes, or similar resources, were [...] promised as a means of redemption. To some—although a [...] slight—extent, the idea of value was associated with such paper. [...] The actual <b>quantity</b> <b>issued</b> did not measure the depreciation. The [...] paper did depreciate with increased issues. But only in so far as [...] the increased issues proved to the community that there was less [...] and less possibility of ever receiving value for them did they [...] depreciate. In other words, we come to the familiar experience, [...] known to many, of a paper money depending for its value on the [...] opinions of men in the country. This was partially true, even of [...] our own greenbacks, which were not fiat money, but promises to [...] pay (although not then redeemable), as may be seen by the movement [...] of the line in Chart XII (p. 359), which represents the [...] fluctuations of our paper money during the civil war. The upward [...] movement of the line, which indicates the premium on gold during [...] our late war, of course represents correspondingly the [...] depreciation of the paper. Every victory or defeat of the Union [...] arms raised or lowered the premium on gold; it was the register of [...] the opinion of the people as to the value to be associated with [...] the paper. The second and third resorts to issues of greenbacks [...] were regarded as confessions of financial distress; it was this [...] which produced the effect on their value. It was not only the [...] quantity but also that which caused the issue of the quantity. It [...] is, of course, clear that the value of a paper money like the [...] greenbacks, which were the promises to pay of a rich country, [...] would bear a definite relation to the actual quantity issued; and [...] this is to be seen by the generally higher level of the line on [...] the chart, showing a steadily diminishing purchasing power as the [...] issues increased. But the thing which weighed largely in people’s [...] minds was the possibility of ultimate redemption; and the premium [...] on gold was practically a register of the “betting” on this [...] possibility. In 1878, when Secretary Sherman’s reserve was seen to [...] be increasing to an effective amount, and when it became evident [...] that he would have the means (i.e., the value represented by all [...] the paper that was likely to be presented) to resume on the day [...] set, January 1, 1879, the premium gradually faded away. The [...] general shifting of the level to a lower stage in this later [...] period was not due to any decrease in the quantity outstanding, [...] because the contraction had been stopped in 1868, and that [...] consequent on the resumption act in May, 1878.|$|E

5000|$|Clement’s most {{influential}} work was Faults on Both Sides (1710). This was a wide-ranging pamphlet that briefly discussed paper {{money and the}} influence of credit on trade. The pamphlet (widely attributed to Harley) produced several replies, which Clement answered in A Vindication of the Faults on Both Sides (1710). In it he dismissed what modern economists call the money multiplier, on the grounds that all bank-issued money is backed, either by the [...] "valuable and sufficient security" [...] offered as collateral by the borrower, or by the [...] "proper stock" [...] of the banker himself. Thus a banker need only take care to issue money to borrowers who offer sufficiently valuable collateral, and the value of the bank’s money will be preserved regardless of the <b>quantity</b> <b>issued.</b> This idea is the basis for what later became known as the real bills doctrine, and Clement was one of the earliest defenders of that doctrine. As recently as 1945 Clement’s exposition of real bills principles was attacked by Lloyd Mints, who incorrectly attributed Clement’s writings to [...] "Richard" [...] Harley.|$|E

40|$|On 23 October 2001 the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{proposal}} for a directive for trade in greenhouse gas emissions. Following the US experience of emissions trading systems, this marks the first large-scale attempt to deploy this instrument of environmental policy in Europe. The proposal places European climate protection policy on a completely new footing. The prospects of its implementation have increased since the climate change conference in Marrakech. This paper introduces the draft directive and gives an initial economic appraisal. It concludes that the directive deliberately and wisely - limits the scope of the first trading phase starting 2005. Consequently, there is still considerable scope for increasing its efficiency (resulting from gains from trading) in later phases, namely by extending both the number of participants and the gases included. The number of participants in the first phase and the institutional arrangements, however, appear sufficient to enable a liquid, functioning market. In this respect, also the politically difficult decision to start with a compulsory system is to be welcomed. Important issues not yet sufficiently clarified include the concrete rules for defining the total permit <b>quantity</b> <b>issued</b> to participants by each Member State, and whether other economic sectors, which are to be treated by other policies and measures, will bear a comparable burden. Furthermore, the essential questions of primary allocation and treatment of newcomers which are in principle left up to Member States as well as the linkage of emissions trading with existing policies affecting the participating sectors must be solved before legal implementation is recommended.

Making use of prior information (available from the coefficients estimated on other data sets, or expert knowledge about the coefficients) a Bayesian approach is proposed to improve the credit scoring models. To achieve this, a data set is split into two sets, “old” data and “new” data. Priors are obtained from a model fitted on the “old” data. This model {{is assumed to be}} a scoring model used by a financial institution in the current location. The financial institution is then assumed to expand into a new economic location where there is limited data. The priors from the model on the “old” data are then combined in a Bayesian model with the “new” data to obtain a model which represents all the available information. The predictive performance of this Bayesian model is compared to a model which does not make use of any prior information. It is found that the use of relevant prior information improves the predictive performance when the size of the “new” data is small. As the size of the “new” data increases, the importance of including prior information decrease...|$|R
