30|$|The {{storage and}} {{processing}} servers that are used by the CPS system can {{be a part of}} the cloud computing environment. The results are then sent in appropriate format to the network control center (NCC), where they can be presented to the NCC personnel using applications that allow visualization of the pipeline structure. The graphic representation that is displayed can show the pipeline’s current status as well as any anomalies that need more attention and further inspection. The NCC officers can then issue certain commands back to the SNs in a particular hot spot. Alternatively, such commands might be automatically issued by the CPS system in accordance with algorithms and configurations that are programmed by the system administrators. The command messages intended to reach the target SNs are communicated via the network, the sink, and other SNs (if the multihop routing strategy is used) or the UAV (if UAV-based communication is used). An example of such commands could be: (1) increase the quantity and/or quality of the collected data, (2) turn ON more SNs in the hot spot, and (3) turn ON additional sensing or monitoring devices (that might be in sleep-mode to save energy) such as higher resolution cameras, as well as audio or video monitoring equipment. Also, the NCC might dispatch specialized UAVs and/or <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> for further inspection, or to take remedial emergency actions (put out fire, etc.) In other cases, the collected data can be used to generate appropriate maintenance schedules, which could result in the service of various parts of the pipeline according to a pre-set priority strategy.|$|R
40|$|Scientists {{working in}} aquatic {{ecosystems}} {{have long been}} concerned about invasive species. They may have {{felt that they were}} swimming against the tide of global forces, but the issue of invasive alien species has become much more prominent in recent years and has surfaced as a leading global concern in the past few years. For example, the 2001 World Biodiversity Day (22 May) focused on the issue of Invasive Alien Species, with workshops on the topic being held in many countries around the world. Globally, at least 45 international conventions and programmes are dealing with invasives, many of which are focussed specifically on marine invasions. While much of the attention has focused on terrestrial species, the aquatic side has also gained much greater attention, including plants such as Caulerpa, fish, invertebrates, and even disease organisms such as those causing cholera. This increasing public attention offers new opportunities for addressing the problem of aquatic invasive species including as part of the work of international agencies such as the International Maritime Organization and the World Trade Organization. The link with WTO is especially important, because global trade has increased from $ 192 billion in 1965 to $ 6 trillion in 2000. Most of this is carried by sea, with 5 billion tons of cargo being shipped annually in 165 million large containers. This flood of material has overwhelmed customs and quarantine officers, who seem powerless to stop the flood of invasive species that accompanies this trade. Solutions will come from increased awareness of the problem, improved early-warning systems, and <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>teams</b> set up to deal with invasives before they can become established...|$|R

It {{was part of a}} large collaborative project, a randomised clinical controlled trial that tested efficacy, safety, and cost sayings of a crisis intervention programme for older people in Central Auckland. The QRT, an intensive short-term multidisciplinary scheme developed in Canada, was evaluated as being very effective in preventing hospital admissions and enabling early discharges. This study explored the effectiveness of QRT care within the context of health care in New Zealand. The study population included people over 55 years of age who lived at home and, mainly due to increased social needs, would normally be cared for in hospital. QRT nurses and geriatricians at Auckland Hospital identified and screened patients, in the Emergency Department for the Admission Prevention arm of the study, and on in-patient wards for the Early Discharge arm of the study. Data on age, gender, demographics, problems, and reasons for seeking hospital care were obtained from patient records and through personal and telephone interviews with patients, family, hospital staff, GPs, and community health providers. QRT nurses completed comprehensive assessments at study entry including details about: living accommodation and the use of formal supports, such as District Nursing, rehabilitation therapy, meal services, home help, day programmes, and respite care. Consenting patients (Ṉ = 285) were randomly assigned either to control groups receiving the usual in-patient hospital care or to experimental groups receiving QRT care. Visiting nurses, rehabilitation therapists, and social workers provided care and coordinated home supports for the QRT intervention groups, which included live-in home help if required. Medical supervision was provided by hospital geriatricians in a shared role with GPs. Interviews were completed again three months after study entry. Subjects in all groups after three months showed an increase in dependency as evidenced by changes in living accommodation and care support packages, however {{there were no significant differences}} in the changes between the experimental and control groups (p < 0. 05). Therefore, regarding levels of independence, care at home by the QRT was judged to be as effective as hospital care for older people experiencing a health crisis.

40|$|Introduction: The blood mobile {{is one of}} {{the modern}} methods of mobile blood {{collection}} facility funded through the third phase of National AIDS Control Programme by the National Blood Transfusion Council of India. Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of data in relation to the blood mobile was carried out with respect to the number of blood donation camps, number of blood units collected, adverse donor reactions, and the expenditure that occurred during the blood collection in the blood mobile from 1 st January 2012 to 30 th June 2014. Results: There were 64, 84 and 62 blood donation camps conducted in the blood mobile with collection of 3301, 5166 and 2842 blood units during 2012, 2013 and the first half of 2014. The percentage of voluntary blood collection in blood mobile was 8. 5 % in 2012, increased to 12. 4 % in 2013 and stands at 14. 39 % {{in the first half of}} 2014. The difference in the means of the adverse donor reactions in the blood mobile and the outdoor camps was not statistically significant.

40|$|Mass {{customisation}} {{systems have}} been well-established in the fashion industry.
