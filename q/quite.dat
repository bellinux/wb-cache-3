5|$|I find it <b>quite</b> nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you}} write songs, you don't really think about performing in a video. I think it's <b>quite</b> fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to find P. fimbriata in the wild, as its shape and movements are well disguised. The Queensland variety is <b>quite</b> easy to raise, while the Northern Territory variety is <b>quite</b> troublesome to maintain.|$|E
5|$|It will be <b>quite</b> an {{undertaking}} {{to carry}} on all the work in America. Essentially, I am a great man, a rarity, as it were. I can't <b>quite</b> believe it myself, however, {{and that is why}} I struggle against playing the role of a great man.|$|E
5|$|Technologically and socially, {{most of the}} civilizations in Eora are in what roughly {{corresponds}} to {{the early stages of}} the Renaissance. Firearms are still a relatively new invention and are <b>quite</b> cumbersome to use; as a result, their use is not widespread. They have, however, proven <b>quite</b> effective against magic users.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{law in the}} Czech Republic is <b>quite</b> liberal. It {{is mostly}} caused {{by the fact that}} after the fall of {{communist}} regime people wanted to regain their rights {{to keep and bear arms}} and these needs resulted in passing <b>quite</b> liberal legislation in 1995, which surpassed the previous restrictive communist enactment. The law became widely accepted and led to <b>quite</b> massive civilian arming. Especially many businessmen felt the actual need to obtain a firearm because the times shortly after the Velvet Revolution are known for the rise in organized crime often related to the economic transformation in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. They {{are known for}} being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. <b>Quite</b> often the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied <b>quite</b> often, and {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Both γ and β {{forms are}} <b>quite</b> stable at room temperature, {{although}} the equilibrium transformation temperature {{is estimated at}} around 75°C.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Aberdaron can have <b>quite</b> extreme weather, the number of frosts per year is very low, at around 7.2 days per year. This is {{comparable}} with coastal areas of Devon and Cornwall. The region, England NW and Wales N, averages 52.3 days, with December alone exceeding the average yearly amount of frost for Aberdaron. The village is generally <b>quite</b> windy throughout the year, particularly in Autumn and Winter. Sunshine amounts are lower than the UK average. Rainfall is well below the Wales average.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his visit}} to Valley Forge, Allen {{traveled}} to Salisbury, arriving on May 25, 1778. There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week, and that his brother Zimri, who had been caring for Allen's family and farm, {{had died in the}} spring following his capture. The death of Heman, with whom Allen had been <b>quite</b> close, hit him <b>quite</b> hard.|$|E
5|$|Geysers are <b>quite</b> rare, {{requiring}} {{a combination of}} water, heat, and fortuitous plumbing. The combination exists in few places on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Northern {{specimens}} can be <b>quite</b> small {{shrubs and}} {{may be hard to}} distinguish from B.micrantha, which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>Quite</b> Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation! grossed $186,986 at the {{box office}} in Australia,.|$|E
5|$|Nut oils are {{generally}} used in cooking, for their flavor. Most are <b>quite</b> costly, {{because of the}} difficulty of extracting the oil.|$|E

5|$|The {{events were}} <b>quite</b> {{close to the}} sun {{and would not have}} been visible to the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|Swainson was {{at times}} <b>quite</b> {{critical}} {{of the works of}} others and, later in life, others in turn became <b>quite</b> critical of him.|$|E
25|$|I think Neal {{did a lot}} of {{marvelous}} {{things for}} us, because even though what he did was a different thing and not <b>quite</b> the style but sort of a different sound, I think it was <b>quite</b> musical.|$|E
25|$|Variability between lotic {{systems is}} <b>quite</b> high.|$|E
25|$|Is, as thou seest, not <b>quite</b> closed.|$|E
25|$|Emma and Molly: Luke and Jim's tank locomotives. Emma is <b>quite</b> sensitive, expressing her {{feelings}} about Luke's mood by whistling and huffing, {{despite the fact}} she often does not <b>quite</b> understand the reason for her owner's mood. Molly is smaller and younger.|$|E
25|$|Despite the name, Kt/V is <b>quite</b> {{different}} from standardized Kt/V.|$|E

25|$|The ribosomal {{subunits}} of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are <b>quite</b> similar.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium sulfate is {{referred}} to as papermaker's alum. Although reference to this compound as alum is <b>quite</b> common in industrial communication, it is not regarded as technically correct. Its properties are <b>quite</b> {{different from those of the}} set of alums described above. Most industrial flocculation done with alum is actually aluminium sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Amputation was commonplace, {{even when}} unnecessary, and care <b>quite</b> rudimentary.|$|E

25|$|The {{consonant}} {{inventory of}} Luxembourgish is <b>quite</b> {{similar to that}} of Standard German.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the Crank–Nicolson method {{is that the}} matrix in the above equation is banded with a band width that is generally <b>quite</b> large. This makes direct solution {{of the system of}} linear equations <b>quite</b> costly (although efficient approximate solutions exist, for example use of the conjugate gradient method preconditioned with incomplete Cholesky factorization).|$|E
