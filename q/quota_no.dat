The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, there should not be any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved <b>quota</b> have <b>no</b> relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree.

40|$|We {{consider}} an industry with firms that produce a final good emitting pollution to different degree {{as a side}} effect. Pollution is regulated by a tradable quota system where some quotas may have been allocated at the outset, i. e. before the quota market is opened. We study how volatility in quota price affects firm behaviour, {{taking into account the}} impact of quota price on final-good price. The impact on the individual firm differs depending on how polluting it is - whether it is `clean' or `dirty'- and whether it has been allocated quotas at the outset. In the absence of long-term or forward contracting, the optimal initial quota allocation turns out to resemble a grandfathering regime: clean firms are allocated <b>no</b> <b>quotas</b> - dirty firms are allocated quotas for a part of their emissions. With forward contracts {{and in the absence of}} wealth effects initial <b>quota</b> allocation has <b>no</b> effect on firm behaviour. ...|$|R
