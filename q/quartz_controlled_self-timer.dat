30|$|Hot, thick {{continental}} {{crust is}} susceptible to ductile flow within the middle and lower crust where <b>quartz</b> <b>controls</b> mechanical behavior. Reconstruction of subsidence in several sedimentary basins around the South China Sea, most notably the Baiyun Sag, suggests that accelerated phases of basement subsidence are associated with phases of fast erosion onshore and deposition of thick sediments offshore. Working together these two processes induce pressure gradients that drive flow of the ductile crust from offshore towards the continental interior {{after the end of}} active extension, partly reversing the flow that occurs during continental breakup. This has the effect of thinning the continental crust under super-deep basins along these continental margins after active extension has finished. This is a newly recognized form of climate-tectonic coupling, similar to that recognized in orogenic belts, especially the Himalaya. Climatically modulated surface processes, especially involving the monsoon in Southeast Asia, affects the crustal structure offshore passive margins, resulting in these “load-flow basins”. This further suggests that reorganization of continental drainage systems may also have a role in governing margin structure. If some crustal thinning occurs after the end of active extension this has implications for the thermal history of hydrocarbon-bearing basins throughout the area where application of classical models results in over predictions of heatflow based on observed accommodation space.|$|R

Hammerstein's mission was to kill the president, so the vote would swing in the UN's favour. Infiltrating the White House, Hammerstein overcame the secret service and the Hammerstein mk IVs and encountered President Dick Quartz in the oval office. In order to kill him, Hammerstein had to get his ethical conductor, the software which gauges hostile targets to identify Quartz as an enemy. Hammerstein succeeded in getting Quartz to admit to various war crimes committed by the US in the Volgan war, his ethical conductor allowing Hammerstein to kill him. Hammerstein is then greeted by Howard Quartz, who displays little emotion {{for the death of}} his nephew. Hammerstein attempts to kill Quartz, but Quartz gleefully reveals that all his machines have a prime directive that prevents them from killing him. Hammerstein escapes and is given a new head by his UN contact, and then placed in a robot emporium, where he would meet Ro-Jaws. While in the emporium, Hammerstein learns that the UN vote was carried, with his UN contact revealed to be an African ambassador, successfully beats Great Britain in trade negotiations via the new method.

5000|$|The {{cases of}} some diving watches {{designed}} for extreme depths {{are filled with}} silicone oil or fluorinated oil (oil {{in which all the}} hydrogen is replaced by fluorine) exploiting the relative incompressibility of liquids. This technology only works with quartz movements as a mechanical movement does not work properly in the oil filled case. An example of these watches is the Sinn UX (EZM 2B), whose case is certified by Germanischer Lloyd for 12000 m, which is deeper than the Challenger Deep. However, the <b>quartz</b> <b>controlled</b> movement is only certified for 5000 m. At extreme liquid pressures, the metal tube or the glass vial that shields the movement's quartz crystal oscillator in a quartz movement will eventually implode and the movement will stop functioning. The watch battery is another critical part that might fail under extreme liquid pressure.A problem with this technology is to accommodate for thermal expansion of the liquid contained inside the watch. The employed oil changes volume by 10% over a temperature range from [...] to [...] This property endangers a traditional watch case since the crystal would blow out from any significant internal overpressure. On the UX (EZM 2B), the case back contains a large movable piston with an o-ring seal, allowing the liquid inside the watch case to expand and contract to adjust internal fluid volume and equalize with outside pressure. The liquid filling improves the watch face legibility under water significantly, due to reduced refractive index differences between the watch crystal and its adjacent media and eliminates crystal fogging due to condensation.To obtain its water resistance the Sinn UX (EZM 2B) stainless steel watch case has a diameter of 44 mm, thickness of 13.3 mm and the case and bracelet weigh 105 g.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the stable silica polymorph quartz, several metastable silica phases are present in Yucca Mountain. The conversion of these phases to quartz is accompanied by volume reduction {{and a decrease in}} the aqueous silica activity, which may destabilize clinoptilolite and mordenite. The primary reaction sequence for the silica phases is from opal or glass to disordered opal-CT, followed by ordering of the opal-CT and finally by the crystallization of quartz. The ordering of opal-CT takes place in the solid state, whereas the conversion of opal-CT takes place through dissolution-reprecipitation involving the aqueous phase. It is proposed that the rate of conversion of opal-CT to <b>quartz</b> is <b>controlled</b> by diffusion of defects out of a disordered surface layer formed on the crystallizing quartz.

Volcanic ashes from Arizona and Hawaii with mineral {{properties}} {{similar to those of}} lunar and Martian soils, respectively, are used to simulate lunar and Martian environments for instrument testing. Martian soil is highly oxidative; this property is not found in Earth's volcanic ashes. NASA is concerned about the health risk from potential exposure of workers in the test facilities. Fine lunar soil simulant (LSS), Martian soil simulant (MSS), titanium dioxide, or quartz in saline was intratracheally instilled into groups of 4 mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J) at 0. 1 mg/mouse (low dose, LD) or 1 mg/mouse (high dose, HD). Separate groups of mice were exposed to ozone (0. 5 ppm for 3 h) prior to MSS instillation. Lungs were harvested for histopathological examination 7 or 90 days after the single dust treatment. The lungs of the LSS-LD groups showed no evidence of inflammation, edema, or fibrosis; clumps of particles and an increased number of macrophages were visible after 7 days but not 90 days. In the LSS-HD- 7 d group, the lungs showed mild to moderate alveolitis, and perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation. The LSS-HD- 90 d group showed signs of mild chronic pulmonary inflammation, septal thickening, and some fibrosis. Foci of particle-laden macrophages (PLMs) were still visible. Lung lesions in the MSS-LD- 7 d group were similar to those observed in the LSS-HD- 7 d group. The MSS-LD- 90 d group had PLMs and scattered foci of mild fibrosis in the lungs. The MSS-HD- 7 d group showed large foci of PLMs, intra-alveolar debris, mild-to-moderate focal alveolitis, and perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation. The MSS-HD- 90 d group showed focal chronic mild-to-moderate alveolitis and fibrosis. The findings in the O(3) -MSS-HD- 90 d group included widespread intra-alveolar debris, focal moderate alveolitis, and fibrosis. Lung lesions in the MSS groups were more severe with the ozone pretreatment. The effects of O(3) and MSS coexposure appeared to be more than additive. Results for the TiO(2) and <b>quartz</b> <b>controls</b> were consistent with the known pulmonary toxicity of these compounds. The overall severity of lung injury was TiO(2) < LSS < MSS < O(3) + MSS < quartz.

40|$|Results of a European {{round-robin}} {{aiming to}} identify and quantify scattering sources impacting the polished stone value (PSV) of aggregates, and to assess the reference PSV of Herrnholzer granite, are presented and discussed. This reference value corrected against <b>quartz</b> dolerite <b>control</b> stone is calculated as PSVHE ref = 56. 1 ± 0. 5. According to variance analysis calculations, PSV scattering sources breakdown into three main components which have been assessed, a random friction tester term and two biases caused by test specimen preparation and polishing machine. Further investigation carried out on machine parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that narrowing the tolerance on flour emery flow rate should mitigate the machine bias. The results also evidence a higher scattering for low PSV aggregates, and PCA shows that this relates to their higher sensitivity to wheel speed variability not {{accounted for by the}} PSV control stone correcting factor. Besides, the results suggest enlarging the validity range of residual friction measured on PSV control stone prescribed by European standard EN 1097 - 8 : 2009, and they raise issues relating to test specimen preparation.

The biotite to phengite reaction occurs at pressures between 2 · 4 and 2 · 6 GPa for temperatures of 750 - 850 °C, and the amphibole to clinopyroxene reaction from 2 · 0 GPa, 875 °C to 2 · 5 GPa, 740 °C. Dolomite is the carbonate phase stable at subsolidus conditions. The biotite to phengite reaction preserves K 2 O, but is not H 2 O conservative, as a fluid is produced from the decomposition of zoisite. Phengite + <b>quartz</b> <b>control</b> fluid-saturated melting at a pressure (P) > 2 · 6 GPa, whereas biotite + quartz dominate at P < 2 · 4 GPa. Incongruent melting occurs through the reactions phengite or biotite + zoisite + quartz/coesite + fluid = silicate melt + clinopyroxene + kyanite. Overstepping of the solidus, located at 850 - 950 °C, results in 7 - 24 wt % metaluminous K-rich granitic melts. The experiments define the melting surface of the model system, projected from kyanite + quartz/coesite + fluid onto the K 2 O-CaO-MgO plane. The solidus melts in the studied system occur at a peritectic point consuming mica + zoisite and forming clinopyroxene. With increasing temperature (T), carbonated pelites then evolve along a peritectic curve along which further clinopyroxene is produced until zoisite is exhausted. This is then followed by a peritectic curve consuming clinopyroxene and producing garnet. A comparison of CO 2 -bearing with CO 2 -free experiments from the literature suggests that {{the main effect of}} adding calcite to a continental sediment is not the minor shift of typically 20 - 30 °C of reactions involving fluid, but the change in bulk Ca/(Mg + Fe) ratio stabilizing calcic phases at the expense of ferromagnesian phases. The experiments suggest that in most subduction zones, CO 2, H 2 O and K 2 O will be carried to depths in excess of 120 - 150 km through carbonates and K-micas, as partial melting occurs only at temperatures at the uppermost end of thermal models of subduction zones. Nevertheless, the release of fluid through P-induced decomposition of amphibole and zoisite provides some H 2 O for arc magma formation. Melting at higher temperatures (e. g. resulting from slower burial rates or from incorporation of subducted crust into the mantle) will produce potassic granitic melts and provide a substantial volatile and K source for the formation of arc magma...|$|R

40|$|Quartz {{cementation}} {{is a major}} parameter {{controlling the}} reservoir properties of the Middle Cambrian quartz arenites of the central and western parts of the Baltic Basin. Marked local variations in the porosity and permeability severely complicate oil exploration and ex-ploitation in West Lithuania. Commonly, the porosity of the oil reservoirs is 6 – 8 %. Therefore even minor changes in the porosity have a considerable impact on the potential of oil fields. A predictive model of the quartz cementation is proposed, based on kinetic modelling results. The precipitation rate-limiting model effectively explains sharp variations in <b>quartz</b> cementation <b>controlled</b> by grain-size changes. The model was further improved by incorporating the sorting factor. Even so, the amount of quartz cementation is overpredicted by 4 – 7 % in some intervals, implying that the precipitation rate-limiting model is too simplified.

The modelling results argue against any discernable impact of the oil on the reservoir quality of the sandstones. The successful pre-diction of reservoir quality mainly depends on correct reconstruction of the sedimentary environment of the Middle Cambrian deposits.

Single low-dose Printex 90 application induced no marked alterations in lung functions or BALF phospholipid levels but significant decrease in superoxide dismutase 2 and numerically elevated glutathione peroxidase 3 mRNA expression levels in type II pneumocytes. Multiple CBNP applications produced reduced lung function, collagen accumulation, elevated phospholipid levels in BALF, and a massive infiltration of macrophages. Type II pneumocyte mRNA expression of antioxidative enzymes remained unchanged throughout the subchronic experiment, but showed a significant decrease in interleukin (IL) - 6 R mRNA expression. This study demonstrates that an environmentally relevant CBNP concentration induced an acute inflammatory response, an effect that is exacerbated throughout the subchronic duration...|$|R
