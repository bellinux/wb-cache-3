60|$|Beneath him to {{the left}} and across a deep ravine he saw a wide level clearing. The few {{scattered}} and blackened tree stumps showed the ravages made by a forest fire in the years gone by. The field was now overgrown with hazel and laurel bushes, and intermingling with them were the trailing arbutus, the honeysuckle, and the wild rose. A fragrant perfume was wafted upward to him. A rushing creek bordered one edge of the clearing. After a long <b>quiet</b> <b>reach</b> of water, which could be seen winding back in the hills, the stream tumbled madly over a rocky ledge, and white with foam, it hurried onward as if impatient of long restraint, and lost its individuality in the broad Ohio.|$|E

60|$|Avoiding the town, {{and passing}} through the villages at night, they kept along down the river bank for four days. The river was {{as wide as the}} Thames at Greenwich, with a very rapid current. They saw in some of the <b>quiet</b> <b>reaches</b> fishing-boats at work, some with nets, others with lines, and at night saw them spearing salmon and {{sturgeon}} by torch-light. Across the river they made out several of the yourts or summer tents of the Ostjaks, {{but it was not until}} the fourth day that they came upon a group of seven or eight of these tents on the river bank. The men were all away fishing, but the women came out to look at the strangers. As Luka spoke their dialect he had no difficulty in opening the conversation with them.

And he thought of how he had stood by the ship's rail on that honeymoon trip of his twenty years ago, giving his young wife her first lesson in counting the stars. And something very deep down, very mossed and crusted over in John's heart, beat and stirred, and hurt him. Nedda--he had caught her looking at that young fellow just as Anne had once looked at him, John Freeland, now an official fogey, an umbrella in a stand. There was a policeman! How ridiculous the fellow looked, putting one foot before the other, flirting his lantern and trying the area gates! This confounded scent of hawthorn--could it be hawthorn?--got here into the heart of London! The look in that girl's eyes! What was he about, to let them make him feel as though he could give his soul for a face looking up into his own, for a breast touching his, and the scent of a woman's hair. Hang it! He would smoke a cigarette and go to bed! He turned out the light and began to mount the stairs; they creaked abominably--the felt must be wearing out.

Her sister, approaching with the soft and stealing step appropriate to the chamber of sickness and death, attempted to replace the covering around her, and to compose her again upon the pillow.

40|$|Background The Microsoft Kinect sensor (Kinect) is {{potentially}} a low-cost solution for clinical and home-based assessment of movement symptoms {{in people with}} Parkinson's disease (PD).

Methods Nine people with PD and 10 controls performed a series of movements which were measured concurrently with a Vicon three-dimensional motion analysis system (gold-standard) and the Kinect. The movements included <b>quiet</b> standing, multidirectional <b>reaching</b> and stepping and walking on the spot, and the following items from the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale: hand clasping, finger tapping, foot, leg agility, chair rising and hand pronation.

40|$|Inertial sensors {{relying on}} atom {{interferometry}} offer a breakthrough advance {{in a variety}} of applications, such as inertial navigation, gravimetry or ground- and space-based tests of fundamental physics. These instruments require a <b>quiet</b> environment to <b>reach</b> their performance and using them outside the laboratory remains a challenge. Here we report the first operation of an airborne matter-wave accelerometer set up aboard a 0 g plane and operating during the standard gravity (1 g) and microgravity (0 g) phases of the flight. At 1 g, the sensor can detect inertial effects more than 300 times weaker than the typical acceleration fluctuations of the aircraft. We describe the improvement of the interferometer sensitivity in 0 g, which reaches 2 x 10 - 4 ms- 2 / √Hz with our current setup. We finally discuss the extension of our method to airborne and spaceborne tests of the Universality of free fall with matter waves...|$|R
40|$|We {{simulate}} the dynamics {{and the evolution}} of quiet Sun magnetic elements to produce a probability density function of the field strengths associated with such elements. The dynamics of the magnetic field are simulated through a numerical model in which magnetic elements are passively driven by an advection field presenting spatio-temporal correlations which mimicks the granulation and the mesogranulation scales observed on the solar surface. The field strength can increase due to an amplification process which takes place where the magnetic elements converge. Starting from a delta-like probability density function centered on B= 30 G, we obtain magnetic field strengths up to 2 kG (in absolute value). To derive the statistical properties of the magnetic elements several simulation runs are performed. The model is able to produce kG magnetic fields in a time interval of the order of the granulation time scale. The mean unsigned flux density and the mean magnetic energy density of the synthetic <b>quiet</b> Sun <b>reach</b> respectively 100 G and 350 G in the stationary regime. The derived probability density function of the magnetic field strength decreases rapidly from B= 30 G to B= 100 G and presents a secondary maximum for B= 2 kG. From this result it follows that magnetic fields > 700 G dominate the unsigned flux density and magnetic energy density although the probability density function of the field strength presents a maximum for B= 30 G.

25|$|The {{third quarter}} was <b>quiet</b> offensively.

On BYU's last {{possession of the}} quarter, Hall threw his second interception of the game to Oklahoma linebacker Keenan Clayton, leaving Oklahoma within 25 yards from the end zone. Despite the short yardage, Oklahoma and redshirt freshman quarterback Landry Jones were unable to capitalize and settled for a field goal to extend their lead to 13-7. The next BYU possession proved tantamount for the Cougars. After beginning on their own 22-yard line, they drove down the field for 16 plays and scored a touchdown to go up 14-13. This included a fourth down conversion {{that resulted in a}} 23-yard gain. The Oklahoma defense held the BYU offense back for a while, forcing the Cougars to execute seven plays within the seven-yard line before finally succumbing. The BYU defense held Oklahoma on their next possession, securing the win.|$|R
