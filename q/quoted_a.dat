5|$|Darwin <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> {{passage from}} Aristotle's Physics II 8 in The Origin of Species, which entertains the {{possibility}} of a selection process following the random combination of body parts. However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in any case discussing ontogeny, the Empedoclean coming into being of an individual from component parts, not phylogeny and natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Garrow's {{work was}} cited in court as {{recently}} as 1982, when the Supreme Court of Canada <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> passage from The Trial of William Davidson and Richard Tidd for High Treason, where Garrow instructed the jury {{as to how to}} interpret testimony, in Vetrovec v The Queen in 1982. In 2006 he was again quoted, when the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal used the same work in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of Veronica Guerin.|$|E
5|$|Dugdale both {{transcribed}} the Boulogne {{agreement and}} made a reference to it, in a footnote in his 1675 Baronage of England. After this the document was absent from history writing for almost three centuries. Dugdale's footnote was mentioned by certain historians, {{but it was not}} until 1965 that the document itself was again used as a source, when Noël Denholm-Young <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> few lines from it in his History and Heraldry: 12541310. In 1972, J. R. S. Phillips printed a complete transcription of the Boulogne agreement in his book Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke 13071324.|$|E

However, Shriya Saran was signed as the other female lead as her fourth collaboration with Nagarjuna. Nagarjuna announced in mid September 2013 that Kaushal Sharma, Srikar Chittarbu and Krishna Yadav, who graduated from the Annapurna International School of Film and Media, would make their debut with this film.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 1995, Ike and Clara Altgens {{were found}} dead in {{separate}} rooms in their home in Dallas. A Houston Chronicle article <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> nephew, Dallas attorney Ron Grant, as saying his aunt Clara had been very ill with heart trouble and other health problems, {{and both of them}} had long suffered from the flu. Carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty furnace may also {{have played a role in}} their deaths. Altgens was survived by three nephews, and his wife by two sisters.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of Wednesday, 8 October 2008, the Central Bank of Iceland {{abandoned}} its attempt to peg the Icelandic króna at 131 krónur to the euro after trying to set this peg on 6 October. By 9 October, the Icelandic króna was trading at 340 to the euro when trading in the currency collapsed due to the FME's takeover of the last major Icelandic bank, and thus the loss of all króna trade 'clearing houses'. The next day, the central bank introduced restrictions on the purchase of foreign currency within Iceland. From 9 October to 5 November, the European Central Bank <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> reference rate of 305 krónur to the euro.|$|E

5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E
5|$|Since Du Tertre {{wrote that}} the macaws were prone to sickness, an {{outbreak}} of a disease, along with hunting, {{may have contributed to}} its demise. In 1760, the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> letter by French writer M. de la Borde, which stated that macaws had become very rare in the Antillean islands because they were hunted for food. By then they could only be found in areas not frequented by humans, and were probably extinct soon afterwards. Parrots are often among the first species to be exterminated from a given locality, especially islands.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The statue {{depicts a}} doughboy walking through {{shattered}} tree stumps strung with barbed wire, his rifle {{in his left}} hand and his right hand held high above his head, clutching a hand grenade. The aggressive design and affordability of the statue made it extremely popular, and more than 150 copies of it were created for municipal memorials across the nation. The Smithsonian American Art Museum currently lists 159 locations. Of that number, 134 currently existing originals have been independently authenticated, and several have been identified as copies by other artists (notably Over the Top by John Paulding). Viquesney's actual brochures <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> figure of over 300 by the late 1930s, claiming at least one in every state of the Union, but this is believed to be an inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Jardine {{was born}} on 23 October 1900 in Bombay, British India, to Scottish parents, Malcolm Jardine—a former {{first-class}} cricketer who became a barrister—and Alison Moir. At the age of nine, {{he was sent to}} St Andrews in Scotland to stay with his mother's sister. He attended Horris Hill School, near Newbury, Berkshire, from May 1910. There, Jardine was moderately successful academically, and from 1912, he played cricket for the school first eleven, enjoying success as a bowler and as a batsman. He led the team in his final year, and the team were unbeaten under his captaincy. As a schoolboy, Jardine was influenced by the writing of former England captain C. B. Fry on batting technique, which contradicted the advice of his coach at Horris Hill. The coach disapproved of Jardine's batting methods, but Jardine did not back down and <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> book by Fry to support his viewpoint.|$|E
5|$|Id had {{no clear}} {{expectations}} for Wolfensteins commercial reception, but hoped {{that it would}} make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. PC Zone <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> shareware distributor as saying Wolfenstein 3D was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of Wolfenstein 3D as well as Spear of Destiny had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly {{by the end of the}} year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete with it for shelf space. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols. The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier Commander Keen series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart.|$|E

Alexander Doyle proposed to furnish eight statues in either plaster, for which he <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> price of $5,000, or in marble, for which he <b>quoted</b> <b>a</b> price of $9,000.
