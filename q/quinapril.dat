RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Forty patients with the metabolic syndrome were randomized in a double-blind manner to either the ACE inhibitor <b>quinapril</b> (20 mg/day) or matching placebo for 4 weeks. Serum markers of vascular oxidative stress were measured. RESULTS — After 4 weeks of therapy, serum 8 -isoprostane was reduced by 12 % in the <b>quinapril</b> group when compared with placebo (<b>quinapril,</b> 46. 7 1. 0; placebo, 52. 7 0. 9 pg/ml; P 0. 001).

This {{study was designed}} to compare ACE-IS with widely differing tissue affinity (captopril and <b>quinapril)</b> and an ARB (losartan) on vascular protection against the adverse effects of high cholesterol. Methods and Results: Forty-two New Zealand rabbits on a 0. 5 % cholesterol diet were ran-domized into control, captopril (10 mg/kg/d), <b>quinapril</b> (0. 3 mg/kg/d), and losartan (8 mg/kg/d) groups for 14 weeks.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of quinapril's {{interaction with the}} organic anion transporter was characterized by studying {{its effect on the}} transport of p -aminohippurate (PAH) in rabbit renal basolateral membrane vesicles (BLMV).

The K i of <b>quinapril</b> was about 20 μM, a value similar to that of probenecid and eight-times lower than the K m value of 165 μM for PAH. Even though <b>quinapril</b> resulted in trans-inhibition of PAH uptake during counterflow studies, kinetic studies revealed that <b>quinapril</b> was a competitive inhibitor of PAH transport. This latter finding suggests that <b>quinapril</b> and PAH share a common binding site on the transporter.

We studied the effect of <b>quinapril</b> on disease activity in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Mice received oral <b>quinapril</b> (10 mg/kg/day) at the time of arthritis induction (prophylaxis protocol) or at the onset of mild arthritis (therapy protocol).

40|$|Oligopeptidic {{drugs such}} as β-lactams and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors share the same {{carriers}} in humans and animals, which results in possible pharmacokinetic interactions. To model such interactions, the effects of <b>quinapril</b> on cephalexin pharmacokinetics were investigated in rats. Blood cephalexin concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography, and the data were analyzed by a noncompartmental method and by fitting a bicompartmental model by a nonlinear mixed-effect modeling approach. Five groups of eight rats were examined. In the first three groups, cephalexin elimination kinetics after intra-arterial administration alone or in combination with <b>quinapril</b> given by the parenteral or the oral route were studied, and the occurrence of a pharmacokinetic interaction was not revealed. The absence of an effect of <b>quinapril</b> on cephalexin elimination after parenteral administration might be explained either by the higher affinity of cephalexin for the renal anionic transport system than that of <b>quinapril</b> or by the much higher concentrations of cephalexin than those of <b>quinapril.</b> In the last two groups, cephalexin was administered by the oral route alone or in combination with <b>quinapril.</b> The mean area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for cephalexin was increased by ca. 30 % by coadministration of <b>quinapril</b> (40. 1 versus 31. 4 mg · h/liter; P = 0. 04). The mean elimination clearance of cephalexin was significantly decreased by <b>quinapril,</b> from 0. 81 to 0. 64 liter/h/kg of body weight (P < 0. 05), probably by competitive inhibition of cephalexin secretion at the tubular level.

Background. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy has assumed {{a pivotal role in}} the treatment of chronic heart failure. Quinnpril hydrochloride, a nonsulfydryl angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor, has shown beneficial clinical effects in previous studies. Methods. After ≥ 10 weeks of single-blind <b>quinapril</b> therapy, 224 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III heart failure were randomized in double-blind fashion to continue <b>quinapril</b> (n = 114) or to receive placebo (n = 110) for 16 weeks. Changes in treadmill exercise time, New York Heart Association functional class, quality of life and symptoms of heart failure were assessed. Results. Patients withdrawn to placebo had a significant deterioration in exercise tolerance (median change - 16 s with placebo vs. + 3 s with <b>quinapril,</b> p = 0. 015). New York Heart Association fractional class (p = 0. 004) and quality of life were improved and and symptoms of congestive heart failure were lessened in those remaining on <b>quinapril</b> therapy compared with those receiving placebo. During double-blind treatment, 18 patients were withdrawn from the placebo group because of worsening heart failure compared with 5 patients withdrawn from <b>quinapril</b> treatment (p < 0. 001). Rather than a precipitous deterioration of clinical status or early incidence of adverse events, withdrawal from <b>quinapril</b> was associated with steady worsening of heart failure, beginning 4 to 6 weeks after randomization to placebo.

40|$|It {{remains unknown}} whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) {{inhibition}} can prevent heart failure in rats with a fixed high pressure load {{of the left}} ventricle and if this effect {{could be attributed to}} normalization of contractile protein phenotype and cardiac collagen content. Rats with constriction of the ascending aorta were treated with the ACE inhibitor <b>quinapril</b> (6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1) (n= 95) or placebo (n= 96) (starting 6 weeks post surgery. <b>Quinapril</b> treatment improved survival markedly (P< 0. 0000001) during the 24 weeks observation period. There were 69 deaths with placebo and only 25 deaths with <b>quinapril.</b> At the end of the observation period signs of left ventricular backward failure were, however, detected in 75 rats with placebo and in 67 rats treated with <b>quinapril</b> (P= 0. 229). Cox proportional hazard model with time-dependent covariates was used to document that the effect of <b>quinapril</b> treatment had been dependent on time. <b>Quinapril</b> had no significant effect on the development of morphological signs of left ventricular dysfunction after the first 54 days of treatment. The increased isomysin V 3 proportion of hypertrophied non-failing hearts was also not affected by <b>quinapril</b> treatment. Irrespective of treatment, failing hypertrophied hearts were characterized by an increase in left ventricular volume (P< 0. 05), percentage of the ‘foetal' isomyosin V 3 (P< 0. 05), and hydroxyproline concentration (P< 0. 05).

In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days. This decline in left ventricular performance {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume. Administration of <b>quinapril</b> from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume. The cardioprotective effects of <b>quinapril</b> were observed at doses of 112. 4 and 222. 4 mg/kg/day but not at 10. 2 mg/kg/day. Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by <b>quinapril</b> in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels.

A final 20 mg dose of <b>quinapril</b> had no additional effect on blood pressure. This is interesting inasmuch as the plasma half-life of the active metabolite quinaprilat is approximately 2 hours and the effective accumulation half-life is approximately 3 hours. The blood pressure reduction in patients with mild hypertension receiving long-term <b>quinapril</b> therapy may be more closely related to prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or to an effect on tissue angiotensin II concentration than to the plasma half-life. This may be the case particularly for cardiac output and renal circulation, because <b>quinapril</b> lowers total vascular resistance without increasing cardiac output or disturbing autoregulation of renal blood flow.

Perfusate protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration method at 37 °C. The total renal learance of <b>quinapril</b> (CLr) was calculated as Dose/AUC (0 -∞), and is represented by the sum of its urinary and metabolic clearances.

Of the total renal clearance for <b>quinapril</b> (CLr = 4. 49 ml/min), less than 0. 1 % was cleared as unchanged drug (CLe = 0. 004 ml/min); over 99 % of the drug was cleared as quinaprilat formed in the kidney. The clearance ratio of <b>quinapril</b> [CR=CLr/(fu·GFR) ] was 41. 0, a value representing extensive tubular secretion into the renal cells.

We now studied renal effects of adding hydrochlorothiazide to ACE inhibitor after myocardial infarction in rats. Rats were randomized to ACE inhibitor <b>quinapril</b> monotherapy or <b>quinapril</b> with add-on hydrochlorothiazide. Survival was monitored for 14 months. Plasma creatinine, measured at 4 months, was increased by 40 % in <b>quinapril</b> with add-on hydrochlorothiazide compared to <b>quinapril.</b> Although overall 14 -months mortality was similar in <b>quinapril</b> with add-on hydrochlorothiazide and <b>quinapril,</b> stratification based on plasma creatinine showed increased mortality in the tertile with highest plasma creatinine (P= 0. 03, Log rank). With add-on hydrochlorotiazide, renal morphology displayed severe renal interstitial lesions; tubular dilatation and fibrosis. Interstitial myofibroblast transformation (alpha-smooth muscle actine staining) was increased at 8 and 14 months, and coincided with collagen deposition and interstitial inflammation (macrophage influx). In rats with <b>quinapril</b> monotherapy or untreated rats, renal structure was normal. Thus, adding hydrochlorotiazide to ACE inhibitor detrimentally affected not only renal function, but also renal structure in rats with myocardial infarction.

Few studies have reported whether the time at which drug administration is initiated plays a role in the reduction of proteinuria and GS. MethodsFifty-six male Obese Zucker rats (OZR) were used as a model of spontaneous type 2 diabetes-related nephropathy. Biochemical and histological analysis were performed to compare the efficacy of a non-dihydropyridine-CCB diltiazem [DZM; 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) /day], an ACEI <b>quinapril</b> (10 mg/kg BW/day), or both in diminishing proteinuria and GS, and to determine their role in effective prevention and treatment. ResultsOnly <b>quinapril</b> was able to diminish proteinuria. As far as histological lesions, both treatments were effective, although only <b>quinapril</b> prevented GS. The combination of <b>quinapril</b> plus DZM did not demonstrate any beneficial effects. Surprisingly, <b>quinapril</b> ameliorated the damage of podocytes whereas DZM did not, thus leading to doubt concerning the efficiency of DZM in long-term studies.

Therefore, the use of ACE inhibitors might reduce hypoxic pulmonary hypertension by decreasing pulmonary vasomotor tone or vascular remodeling. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pulmonary hemodynamics and vascular remodeling were compared in chronically hypoxic (FIO 2 = 0. 10) rats treated with 0, 1, and 10 mg. kg- 1. d- 1 <b>quinapril,</b> a potent tissue ACE inhibitor, both {{during and after the}} development of pulmonary hypertension. <b>Quinapril</b> reduced the development of pulmonary hypertension after 12 days of hypoxia from 26 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1 mm Hg (P <. 05).

Three days after STZ injection, rats were treated with <b>quinapril</b> (2 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks, after that aortic reactivity to vasoactive agents were {{compared with those of}} untreated diabetic rats or non-diabetic control rats. For this purpose, contractile response to phenylephrine (PE) was obtained from aortic rings. Concentration-response curves from quinapril-treated diabetic rats to PE in the presence and absence of endothelium were attenuated as compared to vehicle-treated diabetics. Therefore, the 4 -week treatment of diabetic rats with <b>quinapril</b> could prevent the functional changes in vascular reactivity in diabetic rats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether endothelial dysfunction as a consequence of direct postprandial lipid response might be favorably influenced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin AT 1 receptor antagonists. BACKGROUNDPostprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins cause endothelial dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to improve vascular reactivity. For angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists this effect is as yet uncertain. METHODSA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 30 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 33 years, evaluated the effect of <b>quinapril</b> (40 mg daily for two weeks) and losartan (50 mg daily for two weeks) on basal as well as postprandial endothelial function measured noninvasively as percentage diameter change in the brachial artery after reactive hyperemia. Endothelium-independent dilation was measured after nitroglycerine spray sublingual. RESULTSAn acute oral fat load impaired endothelial function. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) decreased from a median of 6. 2 % to 4. 2 % (p < 0. 05). There was no significant difference in preprandial endothelial function after two weeks of treatment with either <b>quinapril</b> or losartan compared with placebo in these healthy volunteers. Both <b>quinapril</b> (FMD 6. 4 % to 6. 3 %) and losartan (7. 1 % to 5. 4 %) prevented endothelial dysfunction induced by an oral fat load, although the protective effect of <b>quinapril</b> appeared to be more profound. The response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroglycerine was unaltered throughout the study. CONCLUSIONSBoth losartan and <b>quinapril</b> prevent endothelial dysfunction induced by triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in healthy volunteers. However, the protective effect of <b>quinapril</b> is more pronounced...|$|E
40|$|The QUO VADIS {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore whether 1 year of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with <b>quinapril</b> (40 mg/day) would decrease ischemia in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients (n = 149) scheduled for CABG were randomized 4 weeks before surgery. Study medication was used from randomization up to 1 year after CABG. Exercise testing was performed at randomization; the exercise test was repeated 1 year after CABG and patients underwent 48 -hour Holter monitoring. Clinical ischemic events were recorded and defined as death, revascularization, myocardial infarction, recurrence of angina pectoris, ischemic stroke, or transient ischemic attack. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Total exercise time increased overall by 75 +/- 76 seconds 1 year after CABG (placebo + 79 +/- 75 seconds, <b>quinapril</b> + 72 +/- 79 seconds, p = 0. 6). All patients had ischemic ST-segment changes at randomization; 33 % of patients had ischemic ST-segment changes 1 year after CABG (placebo 29 %, <b>quinapril</b> 37 %, p = 0. 4). On Holter monitoring, the number of patients experiencing > or = 1 episodes of ischemia was equal in both groups. Treatment with <b>quinapril</b> significantly reduced clinical ischemic events after CABG: 15 % in patients on placebo versus 4 % of patients on <b>quinapril</b> (hazard ratio 0. 23, 95 % confidence interval 0. 06 to 0. 87, p = 0. 02). Long-term <b>quinapril</b> treatment significantly reduced clinical ischemic events within 1 year after CABG, although ischemia at exercise testing and Holter monitoring was unchange...|$|E

40|$|A large {{multicentre}} study involving 6003 [3044 males, 2959 females; mean (+/- SD) age 59 +/- 11 years] mild-to-severe hypertensive patients {{was carried out}} to evaluate {{the effects of the}} angiotension converting enzyme inhibitor <b>quinapril</b> on blood pressure and on metabolic cardiovascular risk factors during 3 - 6 months' treatment (mean follow-up 90. 4 days). The study population included 551 elderly [mean (+/- SD) age 71. 9 +/- 9. 3 years] patients, 1314 subjects with diabetes mellitus and 154 non-diabetic patients with hyperlipaemia; 4 % of patients were lost to follow-up. Diastolic blood pressure decreased from 102 to 87 mmHg (intent-to-treat analysis) and 62 % of patients were normalized (diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg) at the last evaluable visit. Overall, serum lipids were favourably affected during <b>quinapril</b> treatment; when corrected for changes in body weight, a significant improvement in total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides was detected. <b>Quinapril</b> treatment in elderly patients was efficacious and well tolerated, and <b>quinapril</b> appears to be an effective antihypertensive drug devoid of untoward effects on metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular diseas...|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>quinapril</b> and its active metabolite quinaprilat {{were studied}} in 12 patients with {{congestive heart failure}} (CHF) after multiple oral doses of 10 mg <b>quinapril</b> twice daily. Six patients had an ejection fraction of < 35 % and six had an ejection fraction between 35 %- 50 %. Increases in the apparent elimination half-life and in AUC(0, 12 h) values of quinaprilat were associated with smaller ejection fractions, decreased creatinine clearance, and increased patient age. Comparison with data from age-matched controls having comparable renal function suggests that creatinine clearance is the major determinant of quinaprilat clearance.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of two 20 -mg <b>quinapril</b> hydrochloride tablet preparations; Quinaril ® (The Biolab Ltd, Bangkok, Thailand) as {{the test and}} Accupril ® as the reference. Material and Method: The present study was a single dose, randomized, two-period crossover design conducted in 24 healthy volunteers under fasting conditions with a 7 -day washout period. Serial plasma concentrations of <b>quinapril</b> and its active metabolite quinaprilat up to 24 h after dosing were determined by HPLC with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis and the ANOVA was carried out using logarithmically transformed data of the AUC and Cmax as well as untransformed Tmax. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the two preparations regarding the Tmax of <b>quinapril</b> and quinaprilat and their median Tmax were 0. 5 h and 1. 4 - 1. 5 h, respectively. The half-life of <b>quinapril</b> (1. 2 h) was faster than quinaprilat (1. 8 - 1. 9 h) although the volume of distribution (Vd/F) of <b>quinapril</b> (1. 1 L/kg) was larger than quinaprilat (0. 3 L/kg), however, its clearance rate (CL/F) was faster when compared to quinaprilat (20 - 26 ml/min/kg vs. 1. 7 ml/min/kg). The mean (90 % CI) for the ratios Reference of <b>quinapril</b> were 0. 99 (0. 89 - 1. 10), 0. 99 (0. 90 - 1. 09) and 1. 01 (0. 90 - 1. 14), respectively for AUC 0 - 24, AUC 0 - ∞ and Cmax. Similarly, the corre-sponding values for quinaprilat were 0. 95 (0. 90 - 1. 01), 0. 95 (0. 90 - 1. 01) and 1. 03 (1. 00 - 1. 07), respectively.
