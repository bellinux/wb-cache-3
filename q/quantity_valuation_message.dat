40|$|Theory {{on green}} {{national}} accounting {{has been an}} important research topic in recent years. Nevertheless, little effort has been put into the practical measurement of exchange values for environmental goods and services to be integrated with commercial ones in applied green national accounting. While market values are measured in national accounts using market exchange prices times <b>quantity,</b> environmental <b>valuation</b> techniques yield consumer surplus or Hicksian variations, so that direct aggregation is not possible. For free-access public recreation in forests we propose to simulate the whole market (demand, costs and competitive environment). We obtain an interval, depending on the competitive environment assumed, but the values obtained are (simulated) exchange values that can be aggregated to commercial values. We also discuss the different options available to obtain an interval for the exchange value for private environmental recreation and other amenity values consumed by the land owner. The methodology is illustrated with two forest applications in Spain. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is an immensely important measure {{in order to}} reduce the stress that humans pose on their surrounding environment. As population grows and the detrimental effects of insufficient treatment becomes better understood, the demands on these processes increase. For Sweden, the Baltic Sea Action Plan manifest these increasing expectations, such as increasing demands on emission reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus. The present paper has sought to investigate the potential of hydroponic wastewater treatment plants as a technological step to meet set targets. A cost benefit analysis was performed using data from Fors wastewater treatment plant in Haninge in Sweden. Based on valuation studies, and reports from hydroponic wastewater treatment plants in Sweden and abroad, some conclusions were derived. The results show a positive net present value in favour of a hydroponic treatment plant in the base- and best case scenarios, but a negative in the worst case scenario. The sensitivity analysis shows that the results are sensitive to the <b>quantity</b> and <b>valuation</b> of emission of phosphorus and nitrogen. These results could with some adjustments be generalized to other municipalities and wastewater treatment plants in Sweden...|$|R
40|$|Insensitivity to <b>quantity</b> in <b>valuation</b> {{appears in}} 3 ways: {{embedding}} (when {{willingness to pay}} for a good is smaller if assessed after a superordinate good), insensitivity to numerical quantity, and adding up (when willingness to pay for 2 goods is less than inferred from willingness to pay for each good alone). Results of 11 experiments on these effects are generally inconsistent with 3 accounts: People think of the task as a contribution, they get a warm glow from participation, and they have budget constraints on expenditures for certain goods. The results support an explanation in terms of prominence of the type of good as opposed to its quantity. In addition, 1 study supports availability of only the good evaluated rather than other goods of the same type. These findings support the critics of contingent valuation, but they suggest that some of the methods of decision analysis can improve the elicitation of economic values. Researchers often measure the economic value of public goods by asking people how much money is equivalent to a good. In the contingent-valuation (CV) method, subjects indicate their willingness to pay (WTP) for the good in question. CV is used in several countries for assessing environmental damage from oil and chemical spills and for evaluating environmental and safety effects of government policies. CV is a matter of contentious debate and litigation (NOAA, 1993; Portney, 1994). A large {{part of the problem is}} that CV judgments are sometimes remarkably insensitive to the quantit...|$|R
3000|$|In this paper, {{a special}} form of {{discontinuous}} double auction, the McAfee double auction protocol [22], is exemplarily exploited for trading of spectral resources. With McAfee protocol operators' strategy that maximizes own benefit {{is to send}} real, that is, [...] "honest," [...] <b>valuations</b> in auction <b>messages.</b> In other words, with [...] "honest" [...] reporting of valuations equilibrium is reached in McAfee protocol. This property is achieved by sometimes charging buyers a higher price than sellers receive and by prohibiting that the least profitable trade happens in the event when buyers are charged more than sellers. The broker receives the gains that occur in such cases. Proposed hierarchical spectrum trading concept {{is not limited to}} application of McAfee protocol and could be combined with other price formation rules for discontinuous sealed-bid auctions, some of which are described for example, in [23]. In the following, we describe the application of McAfee protocol to the considered spectrum trading concept.|$|R

40|$|For over 30 {{years the}} <b>quantity</b> and <b>valuation</b> {{surveying}} professions have been facilitating infrastructure development in Zambia {{regardless of the}} economic environment at any particular point in time. Recently, however, {{there has been a}} trend where the information about infrastructure development policy has been punctuating daily tabloids without a notable participation of the surveying professionals. A case in point is the reemergence and re-invigoration of the Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for nearly every major project in Zambia over the last 5 years. Anecdotal evidence indicates that while the costs of such projects {{have been the subject of}} the built environment and engineering professional discussions, there has been no clear policy evaluation and guidance from the Surveyors Institute of Zambia (SIZ); more so with a clear indication of the true value and cost of such projects to the public coffers over the proposed concession periods. There could be a myriad of reasons for a lack of professional surveyors’ engagement with policy development; but the outright outcome of such a stance by the surveyors could arguably lead to poor utility value though the life cycle of the infrastructure. This paper strives to ignite critical discussions of the role the surveying profession ought to play in the overall infrastructure development within Zambia, and Africa at large; and how professionals could engage policy makers with a view of creating a mutual appreciation of the importance of either profession to the public life without jeopardising the institutional trust between policy makers and surveyors. The paper concludes that unless surveyors can prove their importance to policy makers, development would continue costing the tax payer beyond what they ought to pay for...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} plane {{parallel}} channel flows of incompressible Newtonian fluids in an infinite layer of R" 3 with a thickness of h. We presume non-slip {{conditions of the}} fluid at the walls. We write the task as initial-boundary value problem of the Navier-Stokes equations. Now we transform these equations to a non-dimensionalized version. The limitation of the domain on an open bounded rectangular parallelepiped in R" 3 furnished with periodical conditions for the sought velocity field in the antecedent unbounded directions and the decomposition of the velocity field in two parts affords equations for {{the determination of the}} remaining velocity. The laminar velocity is fulfilling homogeneous Dirichlet conditions. The mainspring of flow is a constant pressure gradient. The application of Galerkin method precipitates a corresponding system of ordinary differential equations. The features of this system depend on one parameter Re (Reynolds number based on the laminar velocity of the midline of the channel). For the Galerkin method we utilize Stokes eigenfunctions and a fix period 2 l= 2 x 2. 69. For our first considerations we use 356 eigenfunctions (to attain all eigenvalues less then or equal to 4 #pi#" 2). For solving our problem in time we exert a Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method. We define a kinetic energy as an essential <b>quantity</b> for the <b>valuation</b> of our solution. The results of computations lead to the conclusions that some features of the laminar turbulent transition are describable by our Galerkin system. (orig.)
