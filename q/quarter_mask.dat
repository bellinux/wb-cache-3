50|$|The leather masks {{designed}} by Stein were often used inventively to comic effect, with actors sometimes removing them for an inner monologue, as in Hanks' portrayal of Callimaco, {{in which he}} conversed to himself while holding his <b>quarter</b> <b>mask</b> to one side.|$|E
50|$|Each mask {{has a very}} {{distinct}} {{look about}} it, some have large noses or foreheads, and others have bumps or are only a three <b>quarter</b> <b>mask</b> like Dottore. The distinct sections of the mask are the eyes, nose, forehead, upper lip and cheekbones, these create the overall shape of each mask. Each of these features may be exaggerated, or maybe the mask does not {{have one of these}} quality. Dottore typically does not have cheekbones or an upper lip under his nose. One factor that is most dis-configured and proportioned is the nose. Someone making a mask has the freedom to show their talents and skills in these areas, the nose, cheekbones, brows, and lip, but they do need to follow the fundamentals of each character that they are creating so that they are still recognizable. One does not want to make il Dottore unrecognizable for who he is, or cause confusion between to characters because they are too similar. Much like the people you see on a daily bases, not all masks must be perfect, they can have bumps just like any person can. The characters have the same skin problems as teenagers and the elder we see daily.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Past {{studies on}} {{respirator}} fit or performance have mostly been done for Whites or male subjects, and {{little attention has}} been paid to minorities and Asians. To fill this gap, this study was designed to provide facial anthropometric data for Koreans and to analyze the association between facial dimensions and respirator fit factors for three brands of quarter-mask respirators, two domestic and one imported brand, using a Portacount ™ 8020. A total of 110 university student subjects, 70 males and 40 females volunteered for participation in the study. The results of this study showed that Korean males and females have different facial dimensions as compared with those of White males and females. Unexpectedly, the imported respirator performed better than the domestic respirators. Males were found to achieve better respirator fit than females regardless of respirator brands tested. The regression analysis found no common prognostic variables with the three respirator brands studied. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to find predictive facial dimensions with respirator fits. Some facial dimensions were found to be statistically significant, but these dimensions are different from the traditionally recommended facial dimensions of face length and lip width for <b>quarter</b> <b>mask.</b> To improve respirator fit for Koreans, these different facial characteristics need to be considered in the design of <b>quarter</b> <b>mask</b> respirators...|$|E
2500|$|... (1995) Research {{has shown}} that {{different}} types of respirators (<b>quarter</b> <b>masks,</b> half masks and PAPR with loose-fitting hood) provide a similar (low) degree of protection when its were used intermittently. The researchers interviewed the workers to determine deficiencies of RPE different designs, and gave advice on the selection of respirators for different types of work.|$|R
2500|$|If the {{facepiece}} of the respirator is tight-fitting one (elastomeric <b>quarter</b> or half <b>masks,</b> filtering facepieces, or full-face masks), efficiency decreases due to leakage of unfiltered {{air through}} {{the gaps between}} the mask and face. These gaps are formed {{due to the fact}} that while the employees do a variety of movements that do not do the testers in the lab, and {{due to the fact that}} even properly dressed mask [...] "slipping" [...] sometimes.|$|R
50|$|The {{study found}} that there were {{significant}} relationships between the respondent’s individual values, their normative concerns of their friends and family, their sense of control over the threats, and their trust in the government’s aid. All of these risk perceptions now predict a change in preventative measures that will be taken in the future. Avoidance behaviors are including many different safety measures (keeping first aid kits, modifying living <b>quarters,</b> wearing <b>masks,</b> and even contemplating leaving the country). There were, however, significant differences between regions in how they responded to the threat. There was great repeat earthquake anticipation in Tokyo, and behavioral changes were more prominent in areas affected by the March 2011 events. Trust in the government as far as their risk perception is concerned, was also lowered after the events.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{questionnaire}} survey was undertaken {{to identify the}} current status of respirator usage in manufacturing work environments subject to gas/vapor chemicals exposure in Korea and to suggest improvements to enhance the effectiveness of respirator usage. The number of target companies included 17 big companies, 110 small & mid-size companies, and 5 foreign companies, and the number of respondents included 601 workers and 69 persons in charge of respirators (PCR). The results explained clearly that respirator programs in practice were extremely poor in small & mid-sized companies. The findings indicated that the selection of respirators was not appropriate. <b>Quarter</b> <b>mask</b> including filtering facepiece was the most common facepiece form for respirator and was worn by sixty-four percent. Not a little proportion of respondents (33 %) complained about the fit: faceseal leakage between the face and facepiece. A filtering facepiece with carbon fiber filter was used as a substitution for a gas/vapor respirator. Another result was that the PCR respondents ’ perception of the administration of respirators was very low. The results of this survey suggest that regal enforcement of respiratory protection programs should be established in Korea. On the basis of these findings, respiratory protection programs should include respirator selection, maintenance, training, and fit testing...|$|E
