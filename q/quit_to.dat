40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking - {{a pattern}} of attitudes, intentions, and {{behaviors}} that reflect a likelihood of engaging in cessation activitiesâ€”is a useful heuristic for understanding smoking disparities based on sexual orientation. This study examined demographic, tobacco-use patterns, psychosocial and cognitive factors associated with readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> among gay and bisexual male smokers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted {{as part of a}} larger Tobacco Elimination and Control Collaboration (Q-TECC) initiative in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> was measured by a composite score created from four variables (motivation <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> importance of <b>quitting,</b> plan <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> and confidence in quitting) (alpha=. 87, M= 3. 42, SD=. 96, range 1 - 5). Results: The sexual minority smokers in the sample (N= 208; M= 33 years) were racially/ethnically diverse. Latino men had significantly lower levels of readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> compared <b>to</b> African American and White men. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were performed to explore the relative contributions of sociodemographic, tobacco-use patterns, psychosocial and cognitive factors on Readiness <b>to</b> <b>Quit.</b> In the final model, the following variables were associated with readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> scores: Latino ethnicity, fewer quit attempts, positive expectancies for the beneficial effects of smoking, and lower perceived importance of smoking as an important LGBT health issue. None of the psychosocial factors were associated with readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Discussion: Readiness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> scores were largely predicted by modifiable attitudes, behaviors, and expectancies. Study findings have implications for improving outreach and awareness and for the development of effective treatment approaches...|$|R
5|$|Knopf {{decided to}} produce The Big Pond in New York and {{appointed}} Hepburn the understudy to the leading lady. A week before opening, the lead was fired {{and replaced with}} Hepburn, which gave her a starring role only four weeks into her theatre career. On opening night, she turned up late, mixed her lines, tripped over her feet, and spoke too quickly to be comprehensible. She was immediately fired, and the original leading lady rehired. Undeterred, Hepburn joined forces with the producer Arthur Hopkins and accepted {{the role of a}} schoolgirl in These Days. Her Broadway debut came on November 12, 1928, at the Cort Theatre, but reviews for the show were poor and it closed after eight nights. Hopkins promptly hired Hepburn as the lead understudy in Philip Barry's play Holiday. In early December, after only two weeks, she <b>quit</b> <b>to</b> marry Ludlow Ogden Smith, a college acquaintance. She planned to leave the theatre behind, but began to miss the work and quickly resumed the understudy role in Holiday, which she held for six months.|$|E
5|$|One day {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Victor Kennedy (Peter Kay) {{interrupts}} a meeting and points out that LINDA has lost focus. He reinvigorates the group's efforts to locate the Doctor by teaching them spying techniques. Elton is given the task of getting close to Rose Tyler's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri). He manages to meet Jackie at a laundrette and is invited to her apartment. She tries and fails to seduce him, but when she finds a picture of Rose in Elton's jacket she demands that he leave her alone. Meanwhile, Bridget and Bliss disappear from the group unexpectedly. Victor explains their absence by saying that they <b>quit</b> <b>to</b> move on with their lives. After a meeting Elton, Ursula and Mr Skinner stage a walkout. Victor persuades Mr Skinner to remain behind, but Elton and Ursula leave. Ursula realises she forgot her phone, and she returns with Elton only to discover that Victor is an alien, whom Elton dubs an Abzorbaloff. As Ursula and Elton see the faces of the former LINDA members on the Abzorbaloff's body, the alien reveals that he has absorbed them and wishes to also absorb the Doctor to gain his accumulated experience and knowledge. The Abzorbaloff manages to trick Ursula and absorb her as well, before pursuing Elton who attempts to escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of The Rescuers signaled {{the beginning of}} a changing of the guard process in the personnel at the Disney animation studio: as veterans such as Milt Kahl and Les Clark retired, they were gradually replaced by new talents such as Don Bluth, Ron Clements, John Musker, and Glen Keane. The new animators, culled from the animation program at CalArts and trained by Eric Larson, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, and Woolie Reitherman got their first chances to prove themselves as a group with the animated sequences in Disney's live-action/animated hybrid feature Pete's Dragon (1977), the animation for which was directed by Don Bluth.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of two types of self-identity on {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking: self-identity in terms of smoking and self-identity in terms of quitting. Design: A prospective survey among an initial sample of 3, 411 smokers. Smoking history variables and psychosocial variables from the theory of planned behavior are also measured. Main Outcome Measures: Intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and smoking cessation attempts 4 months later. Results: Both smoking identity and quitting identity matter, but they appear to play different roles in explaining intention <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> and in predicting actual attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Quitting identity is particularly important for intention <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> whereas both quitting identity and smoking identity are important for actually trying <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Recent attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> slightly attenuate the negative effect of smoking identity on attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Conclusion: A broader interpretation of self-identity in terms of both current and aspired behavior offers a better understanding of when people might change health-relevant behavior...|$|R

5|$|As the WSPU gained {{recognition}} and notoriety for its actions, Pankhurst resisted efforts to democratise the organisation itself. In 1907 {{a small group}} of members led by Teresa Billington-Greig called for more involvement from the rank-and-file suffragettes at the union's annual meetings. In response, Pankhurst announced at a WSPU meeting that elements of the organisation's constitution relating to decision-making were void and cancelled the annual meetings. She also insisted that a small committee chosen by the members in attendance be allowed to co-ordinate WSPU activities. Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel were chosen (along with Mabel Tuke and Emmeline Pethick Lawrence) as members of the new committee. Frustrated, several members including Billington-Greig and Charlotte Despard <b>quit</b> <b>to</b> form their own organisation, the Women's Freedom League. In her 1914 autobiography Pankhurst dismissed criticism of the WSPU's leadership structure:if at any time a member, or a group of members, loses faith in our policy; if any one begins to suggest that some other policy ought to be substituted, or if she tries to confuse the issue by adding other policies, she ceases at once to be a member. Autocratic? Quite so. But, you may object, a suffrage organisation ought to be democratic. Well the members of the W. S. P. U. do not agree with you. We do not believe in the effectiveness of the ordinary suffrage organisation. The W. S. P. U. is not hampered by a complexity of rules. We have no constitution and by-laws; nothing to be amended or tinkered with or quarrelled over at an annual meeting... The W. S. P. U. is simply a suffrage army in the field.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play himâ€”English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youthâ€”but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to <b>quit</b> <b>to</b> move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series by suggesting that Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{factors that}} predict wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking {{in a national}} sample of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Design, setting and participants: The Talking About The Smokes (TATS) project used a quota sampling design to recruit participants from communities served by 34 Aboriginal community-controlled health services and one community in the Torres Strait. Baseline survey {{data were collected from}} 1643 current smokers between April 2012 and October 2013. Main outcome measure: Wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. Results: More than two-thirds of smokers (70 %) said they want <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Many factors were associated with wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> including past quitting activity. Interest in quitting was lower among men and smokers from economically disadvantaged areas, but there was no difference by age, remoteness or other measures of economic disadvantage. Attitudes and beliefs negatively associated with wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> included enjoying smoking and believing <b>quitting</b> <b>to</b> be very difficult, and those positively associated included regretting ever starting to smoke, perceiving that local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community leaders disapprove of smoking, believing non-smokers set a good example to children, worrying about future smoking-related health effects and believing <b>quitting</b> <b>to</b> be beneficial. Reporting support from family and friends was predictive of wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> but factors related to smoking in the social network were not. Associations with health and wellbeing were mixed. While most tobacco control policy exposure variables were positively associated with wanting <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> two â€” receiving advice <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> from a health professional, and recall of targeted anti-tobacco advertising â€” appeared to have an effect that extended beyond influencing relevant attitudes and beliefs. Conclusion: Interest in quitting among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers appears to be influenced by a broad range of factors, highlighting the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to tobacco control. Advice from health professionals and targeted advertising appear to be important intervention strategies...|$|R

MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was administered to a cohort of male students that were recruited from three institutes of higher education. Using the retrieved data, bivariate analysis and logistic regression tests were performed to assess the factors associated with the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. ResultsOf 467 participants, 24 % of respondents were current smokers, while 65 % of these smokers were willing <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. In the bivariate analysis, past attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and the anti-smoking messages on TV and in newspapers were significantly associated with the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. Only one variable â€“ past attempts <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking â€“ was a significant predictor of the willingness <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking, as shown by the multivariate logistic regression analysis.
