5|$|Proper nouns are not {{included}} in the list. There are, in addition, many place names and personal names, mostly originating from Arabic-speaking countries, Albania, or China, that have a Q without a U. The most familiar of these are the countries of Iraq and Qatar, along with the derived words Iraqi and <b>Qatari.</b> Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, also has a Q which is not directly followed by a U. Qaqortoq, in Greenland, is notable for having three such Qs. Other proper names and acronyms that have attained the status of English words include: Compaq (a computer company), Nasdaq (a US electronic stock market), Qantas (an Australian airline), and QinetiQ (a British technology company). Zaqqum (a tree mentioned in the Qur'an) and Saqqara (an ancient burial ground in Egypt) are proper nouns notable for their use of a double Q.|$|E
5|$|Then 25-year-old Marc Burns, an Auburn University {{graduate}} from Port-of-Spain on Trinidad, represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 100meters at Beijing.

5|$|Operation Desert Storm {{began on}} 17 January 1991, {{but for the}} first two weeks 3rd Battalion only {{conducted}} sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border. That all changed on 29 January, when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji, less than 15kilometers north of 3rd Battalion's position. During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured. Although they were unable to find them, the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping. While Saudi and <b>Qatari</b> units ultimately retook the town, 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward. In addition, several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault. From 19–21 February, 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait. It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive. Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport, the battalion (along with 2/3) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security {{for the rest of the}} 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait. On the night of 22 February, 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait, infiltrating past Iraqi minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles. Like many American units, 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire. Throughout the ground war, the battalion advanced steadily northwards, encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners. 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion's command post. Several months later, 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii, having suffered no combat casualties.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, the {{gathering}} {{uncertainty in the}} global financial markets sparked concerns about {{the viability of the}} Shard. However, in January 2008, Sellar announced that it had secured funding from a consortium of <b>Qatari</b> investors, who had paid £150 million to secure an 80% stake in the project. The consortium included Qatar National Bank, QInvest, <b>Qatari</b> Islamic Bank and the <b>Qatari</b> property developer Barwa Real Estate, as well as Sellar Property. The deal involved a buyout of the Halabi and CLS Holdings stakes, and part of the Sellar Property stake. The new owners promised to provide the first tranche of finance, allowing construction of the tower to begin. In 2009, the State of Qatar consolidated its ownership of London Bridge Quarter, including the Shard, through the purchase of the private <b>Qatari</b> investors' stakes. London Bridge Quarter is today jointly owned by the State of Qatar and Sellar Property.|$|E

The officials touched on various bilateral matters, including the security and educational sectors {{as well as the}} Houthi insurgency in Yemen. Additionally, Al Attiyah reaffirmed his administration's support for the Somali government's reconstruction efforts. He also indicated that the <b>Qatari</b> government would invest in Somalia given the nation's abundant natural resources and other investment opportunities.

25|$|Some {{individuals}} and media sources expressed {{concern over the}} <b>Qatari</b> involvement. Because <b>Qatari</b> Diar was involved, the project was required {{to adhere to the}} restrictions of Sharia, or Islamic law. This included a ban on collecting interest. Not only did <b>Qatari</b> Diar provide cash (not interest-bearing loans) for the project, banks were not initially permitted as tenants. There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a wine bar (or similar business) as a tenant the Qataris said their interpretation of Sharia permitted such an establishment. The Qataris also said restaurants would be able to serve liquor and pork, because the sale of such items was not a restaurant's primary business. Automated teller machines would also be permitted, and the agreement between Hines-Archstone and <b>Qatari</b> Diar did not bar a bank as a tenant in the future. Concern over the <b>Qatari</b> role in CityCenterDC was expressed by the conservative think tank Center for Security Policy and by Pamela Geller, author of the popular conservative blog Atlas Shrugs, both of whom believed that Islamic law was being imposed on Americans without their consent. Conservative concern over the project was also reported in the Washington City Paper.|$|E

In September 2012, the UK HPA named it the London1 novel CoV/2012 and produced the virus' preliminary phylogenetic tree, the genetic sequence of the virus based on the virus's RNA obtained from the <b>Qatari</b> case.|$|E
25|$|Ground on {{the project}} was {{formally}} broken on April 4 (although workers had actually broken ground 10 days earlier). D.C. officials told the press that the unidentified investor in the project was the <b>Qatari</b> Diar Real Estate Investment Company, a company controlled by the Qatar Investment Authority, the government of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund. Barwa Bank, a <b>Qatari</b> bank, assisted in the financing. The total invested was $620 million, and made <b>Qatari</b> Diar the development's principal owner. It was <b>Qatari</b> Diar's first investment in the United States, and officials of the organization said they considered the deal the most important in their $60 billion portfolio. Since the CityCenterDC investment, the Qatar Investment Authority recently stated its intentions to invest $10 billion in U.S. infrastructure projects, in addition to previous announcements that it would invest $35 billion between 2016-2021. Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri, the <b>Qatari</b> ambassador to the United States, and Joseph LeBaron, the United States Ambassador to Qatar, were present for the groundbreaking. Hines-Archstone officials said American firms were too reluctant {{to invest in the}} project during the recession, which forced the company to look globally for a financier. Newly elected D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray said the project would create an estimated 1,700 temporary construction jobs and 3,700 permanent jobs, while bringing in $29.8 million annually in taxes and generating $9.4 million in annual sales taxes. Construction on the main phase of the development would conclude in 2014, local press reported, while construction of the retail and hotel building on the northern parcel would not be complete until 2015. More than 100 subcontractors had been hired.|$|E

25|$|Casual {{discussion}} or “sharing one’s faith” {{with any}} Muslim resident in Qatar has been deemed {{a violation of}} <b>Qatari</b> law, leading to deportation or prison time. There is no law against proselytizing non-Muslims to join Islam.|$|E
25|$|Some {{individuals}} and media sources expressed {{concern over the}} <b>Qatari</b> involvement. Because <b>Qatari</b> Diar was a major stake owner, it practiced heavy say in the various tenants and uses permitted at the entire development, and the project was required {{to adhere to the}} restrictions of Sharia in finance which requires no interest be charged and as such Qatar invested equity only and did not provide a loan. There were concerns that the sale of alcohol, pork, or tobacco as well as businesses such as gambling, hotels, movie theaters, and nude entertainment would also be prohibited. The Hines-Archstone group said it had never intended to allow banks, gambling, or liquor stores, and although it was seeking a wine bar (or similar business) as a tenant. The Hines-Archstone group also stated that restaurants would be able to serve liquor, but {{that it would not be}} seeking tenants such as liquor stores whose primary business was the sale of alcohol.

25|$|Qatar {{has long}} been accused of acting as a conduit for the flow of funds to ISIL. While {{there is no proof}} that the <b>Qatari</b> {{government}} is behind the movement of funds from the gas-rich nation to ISIL, it has been criticised for not doing enough to stem the flow of financing. Private donors within Qatar, sympathetic to the aims of radical groups such as al-Nusra Front and ISIL, are believed to be channeling their resources to support these organisations. According to the US Treasury Department, a number of terrorist financiers have been operating in Qatar. <b>Qatari</b> citizen Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi has served as an interlocutor between <b>Qatari</b> donors and leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). Nuaimi reportedly oversaw the transfer of US$2 million per month to AQI over a period of time. He is also one of several of Qatar-based al-Qaeda financiers sanctioned by the US Treasury in recent years. According to some reports, US officials believe that the largest portion of private donations supporting ISIS and al Qaeda-linked groups now comes from Qatar rather than Saudi Arabia.|$|E

25|$|Originally, {{the fort}} was {{built as a}} base for the <b>Qatari</b> {{military}} and police to protect Qatar’s north-west coast as part of a series of forts along Qatar’s coastline. It was restored in 1987 with the removal of a number of much later auxiliary buildings erected to house the <b>Qatari</b> forces. After opening, the fort quickly became a major heritage attraction and, for a while, a local museum. Due to the unsuitable conditions in the fort for displaying and storing finds, the objects were relocated to Doha in 2010. Starting in 2011, the Qatar Museums Authority conducted a project of monitoring and restoration to ensure the upkeep of the fort. Between 2010 and 2013, parts of the fort were inaccessible to visitors.|$|E
