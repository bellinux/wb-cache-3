5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it would still have been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E

25|$|The {{confusion}} over Rizal's real {{stance on the}} Philippine Revolution leads to the sometimes bitter <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ranking as the nation's premier hero. But then again, according to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, there is no Filipino historical figure, including Rizal, that was officially declared as national hero through law or executive order. Although, there were laws and proclamations honoring Filipino heroes.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} now became extremely critical for Henry. As {{a result of}} the agitation, which was zealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the princes met in October at Trebur to elect a new German ruler.

25|$|Due to {{increasing}} repulsion by the Russian court, King Alexander again tried to approach Austria {{in the autumn}} of 1902. He had taken some earlier steps in January 1902 when he sent his personal secretary to Vienna with the promise that it would solve the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> successor in agreement with the neighboring monarchy by adopting one of the descendants of female line of Obrenovićs, living in Austria-Hungary. On the other hand, Draga believed that Alexander should adopt her brother Nikodije Lunjevica for the succession.|$|E
25|$|When Straffen's {{murder trial}} opened on 21 July, he pleaded not guilty, and the defence opted {{to leave the}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sanity as an issue to be {{determined}} by the jury.

This application was resisted by Straffen's defence as prejudicial, but the judge ruled the evidence admissible.|$|E

The Assistant Commissioner withdrew quietly, unnoticed, as if already forgotten.|$|R
25|$|As {{many of the}} {{contemporary}} theological journals published in Germany, Belgium and France make evident, Catholic theologians, rejecting Marxism, socialism, and the excesses of capitalism, debated and formulated social solutions that would come from the combined actions of the Church, the State, the employer and the employee, and elaborated in greater detail the principles {{to be used in}} seeking justice in industrial, social, and economic life. While Sheehan was aware of the social <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> time, and was actively engaged in the great contemporary social evolution directly affecting him in his parish, he can never be regarded as having in any manner espoused the Zeitgeist, as quickly emerges from his portrayal of such a priest in his novel Luke Delmege published in 1901 and, not surprisingly, translated into all of the major European languages.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{residual}} fears many in England {{may have}} felt {{at the prospect of}} being ruled by a Scot, James's arrival aroused a mood of high expectation. The twilight years of Elizabeth had been a disappointment; and for a nation troubled for so many years by the question of succession, the new king was a family man who already had male heirs in the wing. But James's honeymoon was of very short duration; and his initial political actions were to do much to create the rather negative tone which was to turn a successful Scottish king into a disappointing English one. The greatest and most obvious of these was the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exact status and title. James intended to be King of Great Britain and Ireland. His first obstacle along this imperial road was the attitude of the English Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Another testing point {{concerned}} the pro-French Archbishop-Elector, Maximilian Henry, and the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> succession {{in the state}} of Cologne. The territory of the archbishopric lay along the left bank of the Rhine and included three fortresses of the river-line: Bonn, Rheinberg, and Kaiserswerth, besides Cologne itself. Moreover, the archbishop was also prince-bishop of Liège, the small state astride the strategic highway of the river Meuse. When the Elector died on 3 June 1688 Louis XIV pressed for the pro-French Bishop of Strasbourg, William Egon of Fürstenberg, to succeed him. The Emperor, however, favoured Joseph Clement, the brother of Max Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. With neither candidate able to secure the necessary two-thirds of the vote of the canons of the cathedral chapter, the matter was referred to Rome. There was no prospect of the Pope, already in deep conflict with Louis, favouring the French candidate, and on 26 August 1688 he awarded the election to Clement.|$|E
5000|$|The Arians, {{who taught}} {{that the nature}} of Christ was {{inferior}} to that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Father, claimed that Jesus was ignorant of many things, according to their interpretation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own statements about the day of judgment (...) and {{by the fact that he}} frequently asked <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> companions (...) and <b>of</b> the Jews.|$|R

25|$|Parnell visited America {{that year}} {{accompanied}} by O'Connor Power. The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> closeness to the IRB, and whether indeed he ever joined the organisation, {{has been a}} matter of academic debate for a century. The evidence suggests that later, following the signing of the Kilmainham Treaty, Parnell did take the IRB oath, possibly for tactical reasons. What is known is that IRB involvement in the League's sister organisation, the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, led to the moderate Butt's ousting from its presidency (even though he had founded the organisation) and the election of Parnell in his place on 28 August 1877. Parnell was a restrained speaker in the House but his organisational, analytical and tactical skills earned wide praise, enabling him to take on the British organisation's presidency. Butt died in 1879 and was replaced as chairman of the Home Rule League by the Whig-oriented William Shaw. Shaw's victory was temporary, however.|$|E
25|$|Although {{letting the}} Countess escape was morally questionable, {{it was not}} uncommon. In The Nemean Lion, Poirot sided with the criminal, Miss Amy Carnaby, {{allowing}} her to evade prosecution by blackmailing his client Sir Joseph Hoggins, who, Poirot discovered, had plans to commit murder. Poirot even sent Miss Carnaby two hundred pounds as a final payoff prior to the conclusion of her dog kidnapping campaign. In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Poirot allowed the murderer to escape justice through suicide and then withheld the truth to spare {{the feelings of the}} murderer's relatives. In The Augean Stables, he helped the government to cover up vast corruption. In Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot allowed the murderers to go free after discovering that twelve different people participated in the murder. The victim had been responsible for a disgusting crime which had led to the deaths of no fewer than five people. There was no <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> guilt, but he had been acquitted in America in a miscarriage of justice. Considering it poetic justice that twelve jurors had acquitted him and twelve people had stabbed him, Poirot produced an alternate sequence of events to explain the death.|$|E

500|$|During John's early years, Henry {{attempted}} {{to resolve the}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> succession.

500|$|Immediately after Brown's resignation, the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{replacement}} and {{who would}} coach the team during the Gator Bowl arose. Brown offered to stay on to coach the team through the bowl game, but the proposal was met with hostility from some North Carolina players who felt betrayed by the coach's resignation.

500|$|However, some {{newspapers}} disagreed.
