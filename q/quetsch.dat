50|$|Solomon <b>Quetsch</b> was an Austrian rabbi and Talmudist. He {{was born}} at Nikolsburg, Moravia on 13 October 1798 and died there on 30 January 1856. He was educated at the yeshiva of his native city under Mordechai Benet, and was his premier disciple. He officiated as rabbi {{successively}} at Piesling, Leipnik, and Nikolsburg. In the later city, where he succeeded Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, he officiated {{for only a few}} months. He was a traditionalist, but was distinguished by a tolerant and kindly disposition. Of his literary works only some Talmudic novellæ are known, edited under the title Chokmat Shelomoh in the collection Harha-Mor by Moses Löb Kohn (Vienna, 1862).|$|E
50|$|Zwetschgen {{hold their}} form well at oven {{temperatures}} and are much used in baking, {{for example in}} tarts such as quetschentaart and zwetschgenkuchen. Zwetschgen are the sole ingredient in the traditional powidl jam of Austria and the Czech Republic, and the main ingredient in schmootsch, a similar but spiced jam from Silesia. Fermented zwetschgen are distilled to make eaux de vie: zwetschgenwasser or zwetsch (in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland), zwetschgeler (in South Tyrol, Italy), and <b>quetsch</b> (in Alsace, France). Carlsbad plums are a candied zwetschgen confection named after Carlsbad (now Karlovy Vary) in the Czech Republic. Szilvás gombóc and zwetschkenknödel are potato dumplings with a zwetschgen filling in Hungary and Austria respectively, served as a sweet main course or as a dessert. At Christmas markets in Germany, for example the Christkindlesmarkt in Nuremberg, a zwetschgenmännla ("little zwetschge man") or zwetschgenweibla ("little zwetschge woman"), with a walnut head, a body of dried figs, and limbs of dried zwetschgen, is a popular treat.|$|E
