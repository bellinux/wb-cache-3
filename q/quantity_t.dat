These two different behaviors are analyzed in terms of the distribution of the participation ratios of individual eigenstates. We also investigate the effect of next-nearest-neighbor interactions, which break the integrability of the model.

40|$|Neurons in {{the spinal}} cord do not spontaneously regenerate, which often leads to {{debilitating}} injuries. One method proposed to promote axonal regeneration is the injection of viruses carrying genes for growth factors into the injured spinal cord. One such virus, the adeno-associated virus (AAV), has shown promise in gene therapy medical research. However, injecting AAV into rhesus macaques with C 7 spinal cord hemisection lesions actually leads to motor neuron loss in the gray matter of {{the spinal cord}}, rather than contributing to the preservation or regeneration of axons. This unexpected result highlights the necessity of further testing with therapeutic approaches for axon regeneration in nonhuman primate models before moving into clinical trials. It is possible that an immune-related T cell response to the AAV-transfected cells causes this motor neuron loss. T cells are white blood cells that {{play a role in}} attacking cells infected with viruses. It is unknown whether such a response of the immune system to respond with an up-regulation of T cells may be taking place over a relatively short period (weeks) or over many months. This question was tested here: T cells were stained in spinal cord sections caudal (below) the lesion in the spinal cord and near AAV injection sites to determine whether there was a greater <b>quantity</b> of <b>T</b> cells in these areas compared to the subject’s baseline levels. Subjects that had AAV therapeutic injections and that were examined 6 months after the injection were found to have greater <b>quantities</b> of <b>T</b> cells {{than those who did not}} have injections containing AAV.
