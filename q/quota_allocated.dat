40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} the main market outlet for imported bananas, with an estimated annual turnover of ECU 2 billion ($ 1. 8 billion) in 1996 (excluding trade between EU members). By 1999, European demand for bananas (excluding EU production) is projected to reach about 3. 3 million tonnes annually. Who are the leading suppliers of bananas to the European Union? In addition to EU producers, suppliers include ACP signatories to the Lomé Convention and some Central and Latin American banana-producing countries. The Common Market Organisation for Bananas, set up in 1993 and extended by the Framework Agreement endorsed in Marrakech (1994), led to allocation of import quotas based on three different banana origins, with a provision for compensation {{to make up for}} any loss of income subsequent to market consolidation. A tariff quota of 2. 2 million tonnes was established for dollar bananas from third country origins, at a tariff of ECU 75 a tonne. In September 1996, USA, supported by Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, contested the terms of the Marrakech trading agreement and lodged a complaint for violation of trade laws. What is actually at issue? Is the percentages of the third-country tariff <b>quota</b> <b>allocated</b> to four Latin American signatories to the Framework Agreement. It is the quotas designated for non-traditional ACP bananas (80, 000 t) that are being contested. The percentages of the tariff <b>quota</b> <b>allocated</b> to Venezuela and Nicaragua are being disputed, i. e. WTO contends that these two countries do not have a sufficient vested interest in the banana industry. Rejection of the terms of the Marrakech agreements, along with the modified status and increased demands of American multinational corporations (Chiquita, Dole, Del Monte), could create a new order with respect to the import subsector. Many small-scale banana importers or ripeners will be affected by the economic and political implications of the future Common Market Organisation for Bananas. Banana origins Community bananas. These are produced by EU countries: Martinique and Guadeloupe (France); Madeira (Portugal); Canary Islands (Spain); Crete and Lakonia (Greece). 854, 000 tonnes is the maximum quantity of Community bananas that can be marketed to qualify for loss-of-income compensation. ACP bananas. These are produced by African, Pacific and Caribbean countries signatory to the Lomé IV Convention along with the EU. This category includes: traditional ACP bananas. These are exported to the EU by traditional ACP supply countries (Belize, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Madagascar, St Lucia, St Vincent/Grenadines, Somalia and Suriname).

40|$|We study {{techniques}} to enforce and provision differentiated service levels in Computational Grid systems. The Grid offers simplified provisioning of peak-capacity for applications with computational requirements beyond local machines and clusters, by sharing resources across organizational boundaries. Current systems have focussed on access control, i. e., managing who {{is allowed to}} run applications on remote sites. Very little {{work has been done}} on providing differentiated service levels for those applications that are admitted. This leads to a number of problems when scheduling jobs in a fair and efficient way.

We investigate the requirements of High Performance Computing (HPC) applications that run in academic Grid systems, and propose two models of service-level management.

40|$|The {{research}} for this paper was triggered by a stunning judgement of the Icelandic Supreme Court in December 1998, which declared as unconstitutional existing fisheries laws on individual transferable quotas (ITQs), because they privileged those who derived their fishing rights from ownership of vessels during a specific period over which their "fishing history" was established (Pálsson 1999, Copes 1999 a, Gudmundsdóttir 1999). In Iceland, as elsewhere, {{it has been the}} practice to start up ITQ systems by giving away quotas for free to individuals or companies owning licensed fishing vessels at the time an ITQ regime is introduced. The amount of <b>quota</b> <b>allocated</b> to recipients is usually calculated in relation to their recent catch history. The Court decided that this privileged allocation violates both the constitutional provision against discrimination and the provision concerning the "right to work". This set the stage for intensified legal and political discussions in Iceland about ITQs. There are potential implications for the constitutionality or legality of similar systems elsewhere. The ruling is interesting, in its own right, to legal scholars, anthropologists, political scientists, and investigators concerned with common property regimes and public-trust doctrines. In our paper we explore emerging constitutional and political challenges to ITQ systems in Iceland, Canada and South America...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the {{obstacles}} to the democratisation process in Lebanon since the Syrian military withdrawal in 2005. It argues that the main impediment to the democratisation process in Lebanon is in the current consociational form of governance. It argues that this form of governance helps spark inter- and intra-sectarian conflicts between the political parties that intersect with external factors, such as foreign alliances, and regional and international developments. The endeavour of the sectarian political parties to mobilise popular support is aimed to secure their victory in the elections which can enable them to obtain the <b>quota</b> <b>allocated</b> for their sects in the consociational system, such as cabinet posts. This usually involves employing extensively sectarian rhetoric, inculcating a sense of fear among their followers, building inter-sectarian alliances, and seeking foreign support which help fuel inter- and intrasectarian conflicts. These conflicts influence negatively the behaviour of the Lebanese political parties, which leave adverse implications on political stability and the democratisation process. To demonstrate how the three aforementioned factors intersect and influence the behaviour of the political parties and the democratisation process, the thesis will explore and analyse {{the case of the}} electoral law {{that was supposed to be}} adopted for the 2013 parliamentary elections.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{commercial}} trade in three reptile species harvested for different purposes in western Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) for international markets: (1) Tokay geckos, Gekko gecko, traded for medicinal uses, (2) Javan filesnakes, Acrochordus javanicus, harvested for skins, and (3) Asiatic softshell turtles, Amyda cartilaginea, harvested for meat; each species is also exploited for the pet trade, but to a lesser extent. All three species are harvested from wild populations. None of these species are protected by Indonesian law, {{but there is a}} national harvest and export quota system in place to prevent overexploitation. For each species, we collected data from catchers, middlemen and exporters on harvest volumes, catching locales, turn-over and prices, and compared these figures with the <b>quota</b> <b>allocated</b> by the Indonesian authorities. The trade in G. gecko from Central and East Java (3 traders, 2006) amounts to around 1. 2 million individuals annually, greatly exceeding the national quota of 50, 000 G. gecko for the entire year and representing a monetary value for exporters of around one million USD / year. The annual trade in A. javanicus (in five cities in East and South Kalimantan, and North Sumatra, Riau (central Sumatra) and South Sumatra, 2005 – 6) was estimated at around 300, 000 individuals from Kalimantan and 30, 000 from Sumatra, exceeding the national quota of 200, 000 individuals / year and representing a monetary value for exporters of at least three million USD / year. The trade in A. cartilaginea was monitored in three cities in North Sumatra and Riau in 1999 : 200 – 450, 000 individuals were traded in 1998 and 1999, greatly exceeding the national quota of 10, 000, with a monetary value for exporters in excess of ten million USD / year.
