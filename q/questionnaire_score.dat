5000|$|A {{number of}} {{unwanted}} symptoms {{have been caused}} by prolonged use of virtual reality, and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. Virtual reality sickness (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to motion sickness symptoms. [...] The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy. [...] Other symptoms include postural instability and retching. [...] Virtual reality sickness is different from motion sickness in that it can be caused by the visually induced perception of self-motion; real self-motion is not needed. [...] It is also different from simulator sickness; non-virtual reality simulator sickness tends to be characterized by oculomotor disturbances, whereas virtual reality sickness tends to be characterized by disorientation. A 2016 publication assessed the effects of exposure to 2D vs 3D dissection videos on nine pathology resident physicians, using self-reported physiologic symptoms. Watching the content in 3D vs 2D did not increase simulator sickness. Although the average simulator sickness <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> did increase with time, statistical analysis does not suggest significance.|$|E

The questionnaires were completed by 160 of these professionals. The Fonseca’s questionnaire was used to {{evaluate the}} presence and severity of TMD, the IDATE was used to evaluate anxiety, the SAQ was used to evaluate quality of sleep, and the SF- 36 was used to evaluate quality of life. Forty-one nurses (25. 6 %) reported having no TMD (Fonseca’s <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 15), 66 (41. 3 %) had mild TMD (Fonseca’s <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> 20 – 40), 39 (24. 4 %) had moderate TMD (Fonseca’s <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> 45 – 65), and 14 (8. 8 %) had severe TMD (Fonseca’s <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> ≥ 70). According to Fonseca’s questionnaire, the presence of TMD was associated with trait anxiety, but the TMD severity was associated with state anxiety classification (mild, moderate, severe). The SAQ score differed significantly from Fonseca classification. The Fonseca’s <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> correlated negatively with the score of each dimension of the SF- 36 (r = – 0. 419 to – 0. 183).

40|$|Background: Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal {{joint of}} thumb occurs {{frequently}} {{and can be}} very disabling. Numerous surgical techniques including trapeziectomy with or without tendon interposition arthrodesis and partial or total joint arthroplasty with cemented and noncemented prosthesis have been described {{for the treatment of}} trapeziometacarpal joint osteoarthritis. Initial problems of osteolysis and implant loosening have been substantially reduced with improvement in implant design. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate that trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis of the thumb can be effectively treated with uncemented total joint replacement prosthesis. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected data for 16 trapeziometacarpal joint replacements in 14 patients. One patient was excluded as they required revision with trapeziectomy and ligament reconstruction following fracture of Trapezium. The trapeziometacarpal joint prosthesis was used in all cases and all operations were carried out by one surgeon. Clinical outcome was determined by a pre and postoperative patient rated wrist evaluation (PRWE) and Michigan Hand <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>Score.</b> Range of motion, grip, tip pinch and key pinch strength were measured and compared with the unoperated hand. Radiological assessment was carried out by plain radiographs for preoperative staging of arthritis and postoperative radiographs at latest followup for evaluation of osteolysis and implant loosening.

Aims Reanalyze the effect of intra-arterial treatment for large vessel occlusion in acute ischemic stroke patients on health-related {{quality of life}} in more detail. We now include patients who died during follow-up. Methods The EuroQol Group 5 -Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire questionnaires were obtained 90 days after treatment. We used the Dutch tariff to derive a utility index from the EuroQol Group 5 -Dimension Self-Report <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>score.</b> Treatment effect was estimated with the Mann-Whitney U test and linear regression. The effect of treatment on the distribution of EuroQol Group 5 -Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire dimension scores was assessed with ordinal logistic regression. Results We obtained EuroQol Group 5 -Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire scores from 457 (91. 7 %) of the 500 patients, including 108 who died before follow-up. Median EuroQol Group 5 -Dimension Self-Report <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> in the intervention group was 0. 57, and 0. 39 in the control group (p= 0. 03).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies of}} the effects of passive {{exposure}} to smoke on spirometric indices in children have largely relied on questionnaire measures of exposure. This may have resulted in underestimation of the true effect of passive smoking. Biochemical measures offer the opportunity to estimate recent exposure directly. METHODS: The relation between spirometric indices and passive exposure to tobacco smoke was examined in a large population sample of 5 - 7 year old children from 10 towns in England and Wales. The effects of passive exposure to smoke on lung function were assessed by means of both salivary cotinine concentration and questionnaire measurements of exposure. Analyses of the relation between spirometric values and cotinine concentrations were based on 2511 children and of the relation between spirometric values and questionnaire measures on 2000 children. RESULTS: Cotinine concentration was negatively associated with all spirometric indices after adjustment for confounding variables, which included age, sex, body size, and social class. The strongest association was with mid expiratory flow rate (FEF 50), the fall between the bottom and top fifths of the cotinine distribution being 6 %, equivalent to a reduction of 14. 3 (95 % confidence limits (CL) 8. 6, 20. 0) ml/s per ng/ml cotinine. Salivary cotinine concentrations were strongly related to exposure to cigarette smoke at home but 88 % of children who were from non-smoking households and not looked after by a smoker had detectable cotinine concentrations, 5 % being in the top two fifths of the cotinine distribution. A composite <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> {{based on the number of}} regular sources of exposure was as strongly related to mid and end expiratory flow rates as the single cotinine measure. The fall in FEF 50 per smoker to whom the child was exposed was 51. 0 (26. 5, 75. 5) ml/s. The relationships between the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score</b> and forced vital capacity (FVC) or forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These effects of passive smoking on respiratory function are consistent with the results of previous studies and, although small in absolute magnitude, may be important if the effects of exposure are cumulative. In children aged 5 - 7 years the use of a single salivary cotinine concentration as a marker of passive exposure to smoke resulted in clear relationships between exposure and FVC and FEV 1, whereas the associations were much weaker and not significant when based on the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score.</b> The associations between exposure and mid or end expiratory flow rates were of similar magnitude for cotinine concentration and the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>score.</b> The use of salivary cotinine concentration in longitudinal studies may help to determine the extent to which these effects are cumulative or reversible...|$|E
