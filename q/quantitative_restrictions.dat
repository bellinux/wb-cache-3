25|$|The {{government}} was {{more successful in}} the part of its program aimed at trade liberalization. As has been noted, the average tariff rate was cut greatly in two steps, in September 1990 and March 1991. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> were eliminated, and the tariff structure was greatly simplified. Effective protection was brought down to a lower level than at any point since the mid1960s, with a more coherent structure that left much less room for distorted incentives.|$|E
25|$|To back up {{the impact}} of the price shocks, the {{government}} declared that it would keep its own expenditure within the limit of current revenue and stop the other two large streams of Central Bank credit creation: Central Bank financing for agricultural credit and for the system of subsidies supporting differential exchange rates. The multiple exchange rates in effect under García were to be unified, and the unified rate was to be determined by market forces. Further, competition from imports to restrain inflation and access to imported supplies for production would both be improved by taking away <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> and reducing tariff rates.|$|E
25|$|RBI also {{exercises}} {{a system}} of capital controls in addition to intervention (through active trading) in currency markets. On the current account, there are no currency-conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange (although trade barriers exist). On the capital account, foreign institutional investors have convertibility to bring money {{into and out of}} the country and buy securities (subject to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions).</b> Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. However, local households are restricted in their ability to diversify globally. Because of the expansion of the current and capital accounts, India is increasingly moving towards full de facto convertibility.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple way}} for countries {{to reap the benefits}} of trade liberalization without exacerbating problems of overexploitation of natural resources. In the context of a Ricardo–Viner dynamic trade model, it is shown that when a binding <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> regulates extraction of a natural resource, free trade is optimal. This is true even if the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> is not optimal. In contrast, {{in the presence of a}} suboptimal tax (including a zero tax in the special case of open access) on the use of natural resources, trade liberalization is not necessarily welfare improving.

25|$|The {{preceding}} Belaúnde {{administration had}} started Peru {{on the path}} of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial Community Law of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed to get in the way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerrutti (1975–80) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average tariff rate reached 66 percent, accompanied by <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on 2,890 specific tariff positions.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{liberalisation}} of 1991, India {{was largely}} and intentionally isolated from world markets, {{to protect its}} economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions,</b> while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-limit equity participation, restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200million annually between 1985 and 1991; {{a large percentage of}} the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians. India's exports were stagnant for the first 15years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{generally}} accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have [...] "direct effect". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that {{the provisions of the}} Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not [...] "expressly" [...] confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed [...] "the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are 'directly applicable in all Member States'. Member states come under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. [...] "Regulations", held the Court of Justice, [...] "come into force solely by virtue of their publication" [...] and implementation could have the effect of [...] "jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union". On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.|$|E

Detailed data on traded goods’ prices, quantities and shipping costs for many importers and exporters are used to test these predictions. These data provide a strong rejection of the iceberg assumption on transportation costs and a strong confirmation of the classical Alchian Allen hypothesis. Within a narrowly defined commodity classification, exporters charge destination-varying prices that co-vary positively with shipping costs and negatively with tariffs. Shipping costs operate as a <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> similar to quotas...|$|R
