40|$|We {{describe}} a current-mode circuit for Gabor-type image filtering {{which uses a}} differential representation where positive (on) and negative (off) signals are encoded using separate channels. Previous current-mode implementations represented positive and negative signals as variations around a constant bias at every pixel. However, this bias current has several disadvantages. First, variations in it introduce significant additive fixed pattern noise to the output. Second, it dissipates power even with zero input. Third, if the output is encoded using the Address Event Representation, the bias current sets up a quiescent firing rate which loads the bus. The architecture proposed here alleviates these problems since a zero signal is encoded as nearly zero current in both channels. On the other hand, the transistor count and the address space are doubled. Measurements from a 1 by 25 pixel array with a cell size of 64 μm by 540 μm was fabricated in the AMI 1. 5 μm process available through MOSIS. <b>Quiescent</b> power <b>dissipation</b> was 5 μW total...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} fully {{differential}} 128 -channel integrated neural interface. It {{consists of an}} array of 8 16 low-power low-noise signal–recording and generation circuits for electrical neural activity monitoring and stimulation, respectively. The recording channel has two stages of signal amplification and conditioning with and a fully differential 8 -b column-parallel successive approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The total measured power consumption of each recording channel, including the SAR ADC, is 15. 5 W. The measured input-referred noise is 6. 08 V over a 5 -kHz bandwidth, re-sulting in a noise efficiency factor of 5. 6. The stimulation channel performs monophasic or biphasic voltage-mode stimulation, with a maximum stimulation current of 5 mA and a <b>quiescent</b> power <b>dissipation</b> of 51. 5 W. The design is implemented in 0. 35 - m complementary metal–oxide semiconductor technology with the channel pitch of 200 m for a total die size of 3. 4 mm 2. 5 mm and a total power consumption of 9. 33 mW.

40|$|Resolving {{stability}} {{issue is}} one of the major challenges in designing a perfect op-amp, the most widely used analog circuit block. Many compensation techniques have been proposed to improve the stability performance of op amps, but virtually all these techniques were developed for continuous-time applications and subsequently applied to discrete-time applications (e. g., switched-capacitor circuits). Since the early 1980 s, an increasing number of op-amps have been used in switched-capacitor circuits with no special compensation method applied. Consequently, there remains a need to explore the possibility of designing a unique compensation method specifically for switched-capacitor use. A new switched-compensation technique (SCT) is proposed for switched-capacitor circuit applications in which high speed is a critical index of performance. In general, designers must deal with trade-offs among accuracy, speed, and power dissipation. SCT avoids traditional approaches of designing high-speed, high-gain operational amplifiers that are in many cases technology-limited. Instead, it modifies the switched-capacitor circuit structure to use the under-damped response of the system, usually regarded as a drawback. SCT is introduced as a novel solution for achieving fast settling performance and lower <b>quiescent</b> power <b>dissipation</b> while guaranteeing almost equivalent accuracy. SCT can be easily implemented in flip-around switched-capacitor amplifier circuits. This paper explains SCT principle and implementation applied to multiplying-digital-to-analog converters (MDACs) as a proof of concept. Simulation results based on an IBM 0. 13 um CMOS process are presented. Compared with a conventional switched-capacitor amplifier, a SCT-based implementation reduces the quiescent power consumption by half and settling time within 1 % error by 60 %...|$|R
40|$|Fourth {{generation}} cellular networks offer performance {{similar to}} cable modems while allowing wide mobility. Although {{the use of}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing in fourth generation increases its spectral efficiency but it also increases the peak-to-average power ratio of the transmitted signal. If a conventional power amplifier is used to transmit a high peak-to-average power ratio signal, then to meet the stringent linearity requirements, it will be operating 6 to 10 dB back-off from the maximum output power. This is the region where power amplifier has lower efficiency. To overcome the low efficiency problem, the envelope tracking power amplifier architecture has been proposed in the literature due to its feature of high efficiency over a wide power range. The overall efficiency of the envelope tracking system {{is the product of}} the power amplifier efficiency and the envelope amplifier efficiency, which provides the dynamically varying power supply voltage. This dissertation focuses on developing high efficiency envelope amplifiers for wideband applications. First, a CMOS envelope amplifier is developed which cuts the <b>quiescent</b> power <b>dissipation</b> by half over the conventional designs and also employs more accurate current sensing. In order to further improve its efficiency, a dynamic supply is provided on the linear amplifier, which improves the overall efficiency by 6 % in measurements. Secondly, modeling of power amplifier operating under envelope shaping is described, in order to accurately predict the efficiency of the envelope amplifier. Also, the stability of the envelope amplifier is analyzed under nonlinear resistive load operation. The overall envelope tracking system achieves a record high efficiency of 43 % for 20 MHz LTE signal using a GaAs power amplifier. Finally, another new architecture for CMOS envelope amplifier is developed for efficiency enhancement, using deadband controller. A linearized describing function analysis is done on the proposed architecture, to predict the frequency responses of each block, which matches pretty well with the simulations. The stacked implementation of linear and switching amplifiers allows 6 V supply while using all 3. 3 V devices for them. This leads to integration of envelop amplifiers into submicron CMOS processe...|$|R
40|$|Energy-efficient radio {{frequency}} (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) are critical and paramount to achieve longer battery life in state-of-the-art portable systems because they typically determine and dominate the power consumption of such devices. In this dissertation, a high-efficiency, linear RF PA with a dynamically adaptive supply and bias current control for code {{division multiple access}} (CDMA) and wideband CDMA (WCDMA) is conceived, simulated, and experimentally demonstrated with a discrete PCB-level design and in integrated circuit (IC) form. The PA efficiency is improved by dynamically adjusting both its supply voltage and bias current, there by minimizing its <b>quiescent</b> power <b>dissipation.</b> The PA supply voltage is derived from the battery by a noninverting, synchronous buck-boost switching regulator because of its flexible functionality and high efficiency. Adjusting the PA supply voltage and bias current by tracking the output power, instead of following the complete envelope in large baseband bandwidth wireless applications, is achieved by a converter with a lower switching frequency and consequently higher light-load efficiency, which translates to prolonged battery life. A discrete PCB-level prototype of the proposed system with 915 MHz center frequency, CDMA IS- 95 signal having 27 -dBm peak-output power resulted in more than four times improvement in the average efficiency compared to a fixed-supply class-AB PA while meeting the required performance specifications. In the IC solution fabricated in AMIs 0. 5 -micron CMOS process through MOSIS, a dual-mode, buck-boost converter with pulse-width modulation (PWM) control for high power and pulse-frequency modulation (PFM) for low power is designed and implemented to improve the PA efficiency during active and standby operation, respectively. The performance of the dynamically adaptive supply and bias control IC was validated by realizing a 25 -dBm, 1. 96 GHz center frequency, WCDMA PA over an input supply range of 1. 4 4. 2 V. The PA with dual-mode power supply and bias control IC showed an average-efficiency improvement of seven times compared to a fixed-supply class-AB PA, which translates to five times improvement in battery life assuming the PA is active for 2 % of the total time and in standby mode otherwise.
