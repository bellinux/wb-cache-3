40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on microcrystalline wax (E 905) when used as a food additive. Microcrystalline wax (E 905) is authorised <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> as a surface treatment agent on non-chocolate confectionery, chewing gum and decorations, coatings and fillings, except fruit based fillings. It is also permitted as a surface treatment of melons, papaya, mango and avocado. The substance was evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1990 and 1995 and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), the latest in 1995. The JECFA established a group ADI of 20 mg/kg bw/day for mineral oils, paraffins and microcrystalline waxes. The Panel noted that all mineral oil products accumulated in tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner {{with the exception of}} microcrystalline waxes. The Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity from microcrystalline wax (E 905). The Panel also considered that the available toxicity studies with mineral hydrocarbons, closely related from a chemical point of view with microcrystalline waxes, consistently reported no effects of concern associated with the intake of microcrystalline wax. The Panel further concluded that since no long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies with microcrystalline wax E 905 were available, no ADI could be established. The Panel also concluded that the conservative exposure estimates to microcrystalline wax (E 905) from its use at maximum permitted level (following <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> rules), resulted in a sufficient margin of safety compared to the NOAEL established by the Panel for the closely related high viscosity mineral oils, and therefore the use microcrystalline wax (E 905) as a food additive with the currently authorised uses would not be of safety concern...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 982 {{individuals}} distributed in 11 lots belonging to 10 fish species from three Atlantic FAO fishing areas were sampled and examined {{to detect the}} presence of anisakid larvae in fish muscle. After hazard identification by genetic sequencing and exposure assessment by anatomic extent and demographic characterization of in-fection, all data were fitted for each fish species to a new proposed scoring schema of parasite prediction. In {{the absence of a}} criterion standard method for inspection and precise definition of the <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> for parasites in contaminated fish lots, the inspection rating scheme called SADE (Site of infection, Assurance of quality, De-mography, Epidemiology) may help fish industries to precisely handle and to evaluate the likely outcome of infected fish lots after being diagnosed. For this purpose, a supporting flow diagram for decision was defined and suggested. This new performance assessment tool has the aim of staging fish lots, thus helping in planning manufacture, commercial, and research decisions during self-management programs. This novel scoring system provides an improved inspection format by implementing the occurrence stratification for parasites to guide Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs for the uniform exchange of information among fish industries, administration and researchers, thus facilitating standardization and communication. In the future, this scoring version could be validated (in terms of classification and wording) for similar overall predictive purposes in other muscular parasites infecting seafood products...|$|E
40|$|Polyols are {{approved}} {{for use as}} sweeteners in specific foods {{but they may be}} used for other technological purposes in a wider range of foods, all on a <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> basis. The European Polyols Association (EPA) has identified 24 categories of food where polyols are used and it has been able to establish the levels at which the polyols are used in each type of food and whether for sweetening or non-sweetening purposes. The UK National Dietary and Nutrition survey database was used to estimate potential exposures to total polyols based on reported use levels. It was possible to express potential polyol intake on the basis of exposure relating to a single eating occasion, a meal period, 1 day and the average over 4 days of the survey. Potential intakes of polyols were approximately twice that found on a per-item or a meal-period basis when estimated on a daily basis. Apparent intakes were lower when averaged over the 4 days of the survey. It was felt that intake expressed on a per-meal occasion basis was most relevant to the development of digestive discomfort. On the basis of maximum use levels of polyols in all food categories, adults had the highest intake of total polyols up to 5. 6 g per meal period at the 95 th percentile. However, when expressed on a bodyweight basis, children had higher intakes, up to 0. 15 g kg– 1 bw per meal period. Distributions of potential polyol exposures were highly skewed towards lower values with higher levels of exposure relating to sweetener uses occurring relatively infrequently...|$|E
40|$|Ascorbic acid (C 6 H 8 O 6) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{belonging to the}} family of monosaccharide. It is highly soluble in water, and is often called one of the secrets of the Mediterranean diet. Its use is widespread in the food industry is also important, having always been exploited for its antioxidant and stabilising ability. Many indeed are the additive formulations that take advantage of these properties. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explain the characteristics that make ascorbic acid an important food additive and to emphasise the technical and legal issues related to its use in food productions. In particular, in the course of this employment, laws and scientific studies have been applied to the resolution of a lawsuit, having as its object the use of ascorbic acid in preparations of ground beef sold at a butcher shop. The views expressed in court by the technical consultant have led to the acquittal of the accused, in the light of the demonstrated and proven non-toxicity of the molecule and the use of a mixture of additives for the production of sausage. The European and national legislations, supported by numerous scientific studies, define the possible use of ascorbic acid according to the principle of <b>quantum</b> <b>satis,</b> and it can be used in foods for children. Our work aims to represent further evidence of the safety of use of ascorbic acid as a food additive, and – as confirmed by the legal decision reported – it wants to bring out the prospects for use of ascorbic acid for technological purposes even by registered establishments...|$|E
40|$|Monoglycerides are lipid based {{emulsifiers}} extensively {{used for}} their broad technical {{function in the}} food industry. Commercial monoglycerides are generally manufactured through chemical synthesis; however, lipolysis of triglycerides by lipase enzyme provides a biochemical pathway by which monoglycerides may be produced. This is particularly appealing for consumers for whom all natural and clean labelled food products are a particular driver. Accordingly, rather than replacing monoglycerides from formulations {{with other types of}} emulsifiers (and that may lack the requisite functionality), an alternative approach may be to develop a non-chemical and more natural pathway to produce the emulsifier, thereby allowing the particular monoglyceride functionality to be retained within products. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the feasibility of using lipase enzyme as a processing tool to synthesise polar lipids, namely monoglycerides, in situ of the manufacture of whippable food emulsions, such as cream and ice cream. This concept idea was initially proven viable through interfacial tension (IFT) measurements obtained using a straight-forward surface characterisation technique. R. miehei lipase was found to competitively bind at the interface of vegetable oils-water and that the adsorbed protein (sodium caseinate and whey protein isolate) or surfactant layer (lecithin and Tween 80) did not act as a barrier to lipase adsorption at the oil-water interface. IFT measurements were also able to demonstrate the progressive accumulation of polar lipids at the oil-water interface arising from lipolysis, and were additionally used to indicate how thermal treatment of the enzyme could be used to terminate activity. In considering how the requisite functionality could be achieved for whippable emulsion formulations, emulsion droplet size, type of emulsifiers used as well as lipase concentration were shown to be key variables by which the extent and rate of lipolysis could be manipulated and controlled. The results showed that formulation (emulsifier types and oil content) and processing conditions (Microfluidizer® pressure and number of passes) had significant effects on the emulsion droplet size. As part of controlling the extent of lipolysis, the conditions by which the reaction could be terminated were investigated by measuring the viability of R. miehei lipase against thermal treatment. Results showed that the R. miehei lipase was thermostable up to temperatures of 70 °C. Above this temperature, substantial reduction of the residual activity occurred. However, even elevated temperature of between 90 and 100 oC did not immediately inactivate the lipase, with heating for ~ 2 min required before activity was no longer detected. In terms of emulsion stability, the palm oil emulsion tested in this study was found to be thermostable up to 100 oC, thus allowing development of a thermalisation step that was able to inactivate the enzyme without compromising the stability of the emulsion. The shear stability analyses on lipolysed O/W emulsion showed the lipolysed emulsions were susceptible to shear-induced aggregation, and that the degree of aggregation could be manipulated as a consequence of controlling the extent of lipolysis through either enzyme concentration or holding time. The drastic increase in the viscosity curve between the nonlipolysed and lipolysed emulsion suggested that the shear–induced partial coalescence was primarily due to the lipolysis reaction and was not {{as a result of the}} high fat content (30 %). The findings elucidate the ability of the generated polar lipids in the emulsion to displace the existing sodium caseinate adsorbed layer, thus compromising emulsion stability upon shearing. The quantification of synthesised polar lipids from the triglyceride component of fat droplets by the lipolysis reaction showed a mixture of fatty acids, di- and mono-glycerides being produced. Palmitic acid was observed to be the main liberated fatty acids. While, monoolein and monopalmitin were the most prominent monoglycerides, with measured concentrations of 3. 755 ± 0. 895 and 1. 660 ± 0. 657 mg / g fat respectively after 15 min with lipase concentration of 50 mg /g fat. The relative concentration of polar lipids produced was found to be dependent on the lipase concentration as well as time of lipolysis. Furthermore, up to 30 min of lipolysis (concentration 50 mg /g fat) were seen to have no observable effect on the droplet size distribution of the emulsion suggesting that quiescently stable emulsions could be produced. The results show the importance of controlling reaction conditions (both enzyme concentration and reaction time) in order to provide requisite functionality without excessively destabilising emulsions such that droplet structuring can occur under quiescent conditions. The generation of monoglycerides at <b>quantum</b> <b>satis</b> levels able to impart critical functionality was demonstrated in whipped cream and ice cream. The addition of R. miehei lipase at very low concentration of 5 mg /g fat was able to produce a rigid and stable whipped cream with overrun exceeding 100 %. However, good stability of the whipped cream over time was achievable with concentration above 10 mg /g fat. Similarly, ice cream made with the addition of 5 mg /g fat exhibited good melt stability and firmness. The findings proved the feasibility of in situ production of polar lipids, namely monoglycerides and fatty acids, in replicating the functionality imparted by commercial monoglycerides in whippable emulsions. Thus, the findings in this thesis offer an alternative biochemical pathway for the generation of polar lipids to that of commercially available monoglycerides, which are currently produced synthetically. The potential for using this approach as part of the processing step for food emulsion manufacture has also been demonstrated. The concept can be tailored for various emulsion based food products...|$|E
