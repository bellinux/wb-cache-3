5|$|Portia {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Portia {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (<b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Portia′s closest relatives are the genera Spartaeus, Phaeacius, and Holcolaetis.|$|E

5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius is {{a spider}} genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Phaeacius {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, which {{is thought to be}} primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Phaeacius {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (<b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Phaeacius′s closest relative is the genus Holcolaetis, and that the next closest are Portia and Spartaeus.|$|E

5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns {{tend to be the}} most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana {{is discussed in}} all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of the Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, {{is associated with the}} legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E

5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is carved {{in the shape of}} a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of the gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E

5|$|The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge of the tooth {{inclined}} backwards. The root of the lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E
5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
5|$|After Joe Colquhoun departed, he was succeeded {{first by}} Paul Trevillion, then by Yvonne Hutton, who {{illustrated}} from 1967 to 1974, before David Sque {{took over in}} 1975. Despite reportedly not being a football fan, {{he was responsible for}} one of the strip's more definitive looks in its early '80s period. He was replaced in 1986 by former 2000AD artist Mike White, who gave Roy a more muscular look and the strip a more modern feel. Barrie Mitchell took over in 1992, with a style <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> White's. A number of artists worked on the monthly comic, such as David Jukes, Sean Longcroft and Garry Marshall, in contrast to the lengthy tenures of the weekly strip's creative team. Tony Harding often illustrated Roy for the Roy of the Rovers annuals and also drew the Roy's Action Replay strip that appeared in All Action Monthly in the late eighties (Fleetway). Mitchell returned in 1997 as the sole artist of the Match of the Day strips for all four years.|$|E
50|$|However, {{a clearly}} {{separate}} evolution {{can be seen}} in Turoyo and Mlahsô. Mlahsô is grammatically <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> the classical language, and continued <b>to</b> use a <b>similar</b> tense-aspect system <b>to</b> it. However, Mlahsô developed a distinctively clipped phonological palette and systematically turns /θ/→/s/. On the other hand, Turoyo has a <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> phonology <b>to</b> Classical Syriac, yet it has developed a radically different grammar, sharing similar features with NENA varieties.|$|R

5|$|Alongside {{traditional}} piercing techniques, modern body adornment includes variant {{techniques such}} as pocketing and flesh stapling, although as of 2007 these were still not widely made available by piercers. In the first of these, a scalpel opens the skin or mucous membranes, into which the larger end {{of a piece of}} jewellery or—if using a bar—two ends are inserted. These kinds of piercings may be difficult to remove, as fibrous tissue can form around the end or ends of the jewellery or the implanted tube into which the jewellery is placed. When a bar is used, pocketing looks <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> flesh stapling. The latter technique is frequently done {{in the form of a}} ladder. Modern body piercing practices also include dermal anchoring or dermal piercing, which combines piercing and implantation to create a single point of opening in the body (whereas pocketing creates two) to permit one end of the jewellery to show above the surface of the skin. While this technique can be performed almost anywhere on the body, as of 2007 it was popularly done between the eyes, on the chest, or on the finger, to simulate a ring.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty rings of Jupiter or the broad and complex rings of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
5|$|Rocksteady {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a sequel before development of Arkham Asylum had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in Arkham Asylum containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> its final layout in Arkham City. The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.|$|E
50|$|The Vindec High Riser was a children's wheelie bicycle of the 1970s, first {{manufactured}} in 1972 by the British company Brown Brothers. It was <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> in design <b>to</b> the Raleigh Chopper.|$|R
