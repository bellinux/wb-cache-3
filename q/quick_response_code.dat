QR <b>codes</b> (<b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>codes)</b> are two-dimensional, camera-readable bar codes that have become popular for allowing smartphones and other camera-equipped, web-connected devices access to web sites, text messages, and application downloads. QR codes are read by a mobile device through the device’s camera using an application specifically designed to read the information embedded in the code. QR codes are easily recognizable by their square shape and series of black square/white space patterns. The size of the QR code is largely irrelevant: as long as the device’s camera can bring the code into the field of view, the code can be read by the code reader application. Gaming as a way of learning and reviewing content has become an increasingly popular way to engage students despite objections by adults who see them as not instructional in natur...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to explain}} how <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>codes</b> can obtain customer information and which {{are the implications of}} using it on customer relationship management. Moreover, this work analyzes the influence of acquiring information in real time. The methodology is based on an empirical research of the concepts in analysis, <b>Quick</b> <b>Response</b> <b>Codes,</b> Customer Relationship Management and Contextual Marketing, separately. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that there is a possible connection between these concepts. On Collaborative CRM, QR-codes influence positively, eCRM, virtual shop and improve customer interaction center performance, while helping direct call guides, automate pre-selection and product selection. Operational CRM function is positively influenced by QR-code on marketing automation (including campaign planning, campaign execution and campaign controlling) and service automation constituted by sales force support and product configuration. On campaign planning, it is concluded that QR-code is a contextual marketing tool to CRM to use because it is next to the consumer, when he/she wants and needs, presenting the right information. It is also relevant to mention the positive impact on Analytical CRM, where QR-code information is an input to marketing analysis, sales analysis and service evaluation.
