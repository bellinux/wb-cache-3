40|$|There is a {{tendency}} among policy-makers and industry lobbyists toward "specific", "relative" or "output-based" <b>quotas,</b> i. e., freely distributed to firms proportionally to their output. With a stochastic analytical model, we demonstrate that relative <b>quotas</b> are dominated either by absolute <b>quotas</b> or by price instruments as regards expected social cost. Furthermore, price instruments entail a lower expected compliance cost than relative <b>quotas.</b> Why, then, do industry lobbyists favour quantity instruments over price instruments? A {{possible explanation is that}} if the industry anticipates that the State will underestimate output and overestimate the MAC curve slope, it has an interest in defending relative <b>quotas.</b> The problem is that in such a case, both the environmental damage and the social cost are higher with relative <b>quotas</b> than with absolute ones.

5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing <b>quotas</b> to an open access fishery. When <b>quotas</b> are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. <b>Quotas</b> were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian fisheries for cod, after <b>quotas</b> were introduced? Because the <b>quotas</b> limit {{the activity of the}} fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether <b>quotas</b> increased profits, it is necessary to do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without the <b>quotas.</b> Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without <b>quotas,</b> however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that the <b>quotas</b> increased profits in two rounds.
