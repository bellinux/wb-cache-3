40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to empirically explore the {{organisational}} characteristics of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of hospital departments, to develop and empirically test models for the organisation and implementation of <b>quality</b> <b>systems,</b> and to discuss the clinical implications of the findings. Data were collected from hospital departments through interviews (n= 19) and a nation-wide survey (n= 386). The interviews were analysed thematically and organisational models were developed. Relationships among aspects of organisation and implementation were hypothesised and analysed with structural equation modelling. The result was a new framework with three organisational aspects of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> each with two sub-aspects: structure (resources and administration), process (culture and cooperation), and outcome (evaluation of goal achievement and development of competence). Strong positive relationships were confirmed among structure, process, and outcome. <b>Quality</b> <b>systems</b> could therefore be classified into three organisational degrees. For instance, <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of high organisational degree often had adequate resources and administration as well as positive organisational cultures and high cooperation among different professions. Advanced designs required <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> of high organisational degrees. Examples of such designs were coordination between departments, random check ups, and accreditation. The organisationally demanding <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> had been implemented through cooperative implementation, that is, directed by managers {{while at the same}} time giving opportunities for staff to participate in planning and designing. The results can be useful to managers, quality coordinators, and clinicians when they describe, develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> in hospital departments...|$|R

2500|$|In the European context, safety {{effectiveness}} and quality is ensured through the [...] "Conformity Assessment" [...] that {{is defined as}} [...] "the method by which a manufacturer demonstrates that its device complies {{with the requirements of}} the European Medical Device Directive". The directive specifies different procedures according to the class of the device ranging from the simple Declaration of Conformity (Annex VII) for Class I devices to EC verification (Annex IV), Production quality assurance (Annex V), Product quality assurance (Annex VI) and Full quality assurance (Annex II). The Medical Device Directive specifies detailed procedures for Certification. In general terms, these procedures include tests and verifications that are to be contained in specific deliveries such as the risk management file, [...] the technical file and the <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> deliveries. [...] The risk management file is the first deliverable that conditions the following design and manufacturing steps. Risk management stage shall drive the product so that product risks are reduced at an acceptable level with respect to the benefits expected for the patients {{for the use of the}} device. The technical file contains all the documentation data and records supporting medical device certification. FDA technical file has similar content although organized in different structure.

Toyota evolved a unique {{manufacturing}} system centered on two complementary notions: {{just in time}} (produce only what is needed) and autonomation (automation with a human touch). Regarding JIT, Ohno was inspired by American supermarkets: workstations functioned like a supermarket shelf where the customer can get products they need, {{at the time they}} need and in the amount needed, the workstation (shelf) is then restocked. Autonomation was developed by Toyoda Sakichi in Toyoda Spinning and Weaving: an automatically activated loom that was also foolproof, that is automatically detected problems.

2500|$|Complaints {{have also}} arisen that foreign [...] "health tourists" [...] paying with dollars and senior Communist party {{officials}} receive a higher {{quality of care}} than Cuban citizens. Former leading Cuban neurosurgeon and dissident Dr Hilda Molina asserts that the central revolutionary objective of free, quality medical care for all has been eroded by Cuba's need for foreign currency. Molina says that following the economic collapse known in Cuba as the Special Period, the Cuban Government established mechanisms designed to turn the medical system into a profit-making enterprise. This creates an enormous disparity {{in the quality of}} healthcare services between foreigners and Cubans leading to a form of tourist apartheid. In 1998 she said that foreign patients were routinely inadequately or falsely informed about their medical conditions to increase their medical bills or {{to hide the fact that}} Cuba often advertises medical services it is unable to provide. Others makes similar claims, also stating that senior Communist party and military officials can access this higher <b>quality</b> <b>system</b> free of charge.

40|$|Abstract Background Clinicians, nurses, and {{managers}} in hospitals are continuously confronted by {{new technologies and}} methods that require changes to working practice. <b>Quality</b> <b>systems</b> can help to manage change while maintaining a high quality of care. A new model of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> inspired by the works of Donabedian has three factors: structure (resources and administration), process (culture and professional co-operation), and outcome (competence development and goal achievement). The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyse whether structure, process, and outcome can be used to describe <b>quality</b> <b>systems,</b> to analyse whether these components are related, and to discuss implications. Methods A questionnaire was developed and sent to a random sample of 600 hospital departments in Sweden. The adjusted response rate was 75 %. The data were analysed with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling in LISREL. This is to our knowledge the first large quantitative study that applies Donabedian's model to <b>quality</b> <b>systems.</b> Results The model with relationships between structure, process, and outcome was found to be a reasonable representation of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> at hospital departments (p = 0. 095, indicating {{no significant differences between the}} model and the data set). Structure correlated strongly with process (0. 72) and outcome (0. 60). Given structure, process also correlated with outcome (0. 20). Conclusion The model could be used to describe and evaluate single <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> or to compare different <b>quality</b> <b>systems.</b> It could also be an aid to implement a systematic and evidence-based system for working with quality improvements in hospital departments. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to ascertain whether Swedish construction companies measure the impact of their <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> (such as ISO 9000) and, if so, whether the ‘balanced scorecard’ approach is a useful technique as a measure of performance. The balanced scorecard approach requires each organization to look at itself from four different perspectives to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance: the ?nancial perspective, the customer perspective, the process perspective, the innovation and learning perspective. Twelve Swedish construction sector companies (clients, architectural-engineering consultants, contractors) with well-established <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> were studied. The results indicate two important points. First, the balanced scorecard can be successfully used to measure the performance of <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> in the construction process. Second, the organization and learning perspective is neglected in the Swedish construction process. The use of the balanced scorecard highlighted the fact that a lack of balance often exists between the four perspectives. While it is tempting to conclude that investments in <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> increase organizational performance, there is little (if any) evidence that this is the case. Many investments in <b>quality</b> <b>systems</b> appear to be based more on blind faith than on facts.
