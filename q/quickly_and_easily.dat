5|$|The {{design of}} Perl can be {{understood}} as a response to three broad trends in the computer industry: falling hardware costs, rising labor costs, and improvements in compiler technology. Many earlier computer languages, such as Fortran and C, aimed to make efficient use of expensive computer hardware. In contrast, Perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} Oblivions {{landscape and}} architecture, developers worked from personal travel photographs, nature books, texture images, and reference photographs. Procedural content generation tools used in production {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind. Erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} craggy terrain <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily,</b> replacing Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily,</b> and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{current flows}} toward the Winkie Country," [...] said he; [...] "and so, {{if we had}} a boat, or a raft, the river would float us there more <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> more <b>easily</b> than we could walk." ...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{difficulty}} {{is not the}} production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can often be manufactured relatively <b>quickly,</b> cheaply <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> Rather, it is the weaponization, storage and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems.|$|R
5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, would allow a road to be formed <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> It is a modular firearm, {{consisting of}} four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

Although she is very ambitious, she often loses confidence <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> becomes <b>easily</b> discouraged. But something always comes up to motivate her, and she works tirelessly for her dream. Her motto is Dream.|$|R
50|$|As terriers, Glens {{can have}} a {{stubborn}} streak, but they respond well to a firm hand and can withstand correction when necessary. They are intelligent, learn <b>quickly,</b> <b>and</b> socialize <b>easily.</b> They are typically fearless and loyal, and are superb with people, including children. However, some can be dog-aggressive, especially when provoked.|$|R

50|$|The ulpan is {{designed}} to teach adult immigrants to Israel the basic language skills of conversation, writing and comprehension. Most ulpanim also provide instruction in the fundamentals of Israeli culture, history, and geography. The {{primary purpose of the}} ulpan is to help new citizens to be integrated as <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> as <b>easily</b> as possible into the social, cultural and economic life of their new country.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, without warning, Swenson and Miller fell, {{pierced with}} savage spears, {{and at the}} same instant sinewy fingers gripped Barbara Harding, and a {{silencing}} hand was clapped over her mouth. There had been no sound above the muffled tread of the seamen. It had all been accomplished so <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> so <b>easily</b> that the girl did not comprehend what had befallen her for several minutes.|$|R
60|$|What miracles habit can do! <b>and</b> how <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> how <b>easily</b> {{habits are}} acquired--both trifling habits and habits which profoundly change us. If by {{accident}} we wake {{at two in}} the morning a couple of nights in succession, we have need to be uneasy, for another repetition can turn the accident into a habit; and a month's dallying with whiskey--but we all know these commonplace facts.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} to compost lint retrieved from the lint screen on a dryer by adding it to other materials being composted. The texture of the material allows the organic matter within it to compost <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily,</b> but depending on the source, it may include inorganic fibers and materials which never break down.|$|E
25|$|Pontoon boats {{have also}} become popular in recent years. These boats allow {{one or two}} {{fishermen}} to get into small rivers or lakes that would have difficulty accommodating larger boats. Typically 8–12ft in length, these inflatable craft can be assembled <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> Some feature rigid frames derived from the white water rafting industry.|$|E
25|$|Between 1995 and 2009, the Internet {{has contributed}} to 8% of the GDP's growth in the United States. Most recently, the Internet {{has contributed to}} 15% of the GDP's growth from 2004-2009. The American {{government}} can also communicate more <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> with citizens who are Internet consumers: e-government supports interactions with American individuals and businesses.|$|E

40|$|A {{revolution}} {{is occurring in}} terms of how pervasive computing hardware is designed, prototyped, and manufactured. A broad set of researchers and users now have access to a host of digital fabrication tools and techniques that empower them to create new devices and realize new concepts more <b>quickly,</b> cheaply, <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> This special issue brings together four articles that describe recent research in this space of printing and fabrication for pervasive computing...|$|R
50|$|On watercraft, a sponson is a {{projection}} that extends outward (usually from the hull, but sometimes {{other parts of}} the vessel) to improve stability while floating, or to act as a securing point for other equipment. Vessels with unstable body shapes or unevenly distributed weight are likely to feature sponsons to help prevent capsizing or other instabilities. On many vessels, these projections from {{the main body of the}} vessel can be attached <b>and</b> removed <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> fairly <b>easily.</b>|$|R
25|$|Ochrotomys nuttalli {{are mainly}} nocturnal, crepuscular and arboreal, {{although}} many {{live on the}} ground as well. Their peak activity occurs around 3–4 hours before dawn. Golden mice move <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> and are able to use their prehensile tails to balance while climbing trees, to hang from branches, and to anchor themselves to a tree limb while they sleep.|$|E
25|$|To {{turn the}} pipe ranks on and off, the {{traditional}} organ console used drawknobs placed on panels {{on both sides}} of the manuals. Using electricity, Robert Hope-Jones substituted tongue-shaped tabs arranged on a curved panel around and above the manuals. These stop tabs could be <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> flipped up or down to select or deactivate any ranks of pipes.|$|E
25|$|Breathhold and scuba divers {{generally}} carry {{some or all}} {{of their}} weights in a way that can be <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> removed while under water. Research performed in 1976 analyzing diving accidents noted that in majority of diving accidents, divers failed to release their weight belts. Later evaluations in 2003 and 2004 both showed that failure to ditch the weight remained a problem.|$|E
50|$|The Ghost {{appearance}} is like miniature model of Chinook helicopter. It {{was developed to}} support Missions in urban warfare. The <b>quickly</b> deploy-able <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> operate-able system can carry in two backpacks that can be quickly assembled. It has low acoustic, silent propulsion and mission versatility that can perform in day and night. Due to automatic vertical takeoff and landing, it is suitable for use in densely built-up areas. Its functions can be operated by simple man-machine interface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Building a scalable, {{fault-tolerant}} stream mining {{system that}} deals with realistic data volumes presents unique challenges. Consider-able work {{is being done to}} make the development of such systems simpler, creating high level abstractions on top of existing systems. Many of the technical barriers can be eliminated by adopting a state-of-the-art inter-face, such as the Trident API for Storm. We describe a stream mining tool, based on Trident, for monitoring breaking news events on Twitter, which can be extended <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> scaled <b>easily...</b>|$|R
40|$|A method {{involving}} eigenfunction {{expansion and}} collocation is employed {{to solve the}} axisymmetric problem of a slowly and steadily rotating circular disc in a fluid of finite extent whose surface {{is covered with a}} surfactant film. The present method (originally described by Wang (Acta Mech. 94, 97, 1992)) is observed to produce results of practical importance associated with the problem more <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> more <b>easily</b> than the one used earlier by Shail and Gooden (Int. J. Multiphase Flow 7, 245, 1992). (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
25|$|Mobile docking {{stations}} {{usually come}} mated to an armature, laptop desk or standard rack {{in order to}} provide the ability to position the computer in a vehicle in a safe and ergonomic position. As with all docking stations, a mobile docking station will provide the user with a means to <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> dock and un dock the computer. In addition, some mobile docking-stations provide a security-lock to discourage theft.|$|E
25|$|World War II {{followed}} {{this period of}} exploration; Indiana Standard participated in the war effort, discovering new means of refinement and even a way of producing TNT more <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily.</b> In addition, Indiana Standard significantly contributed to the aviation and land gasoline needed for the Allied armies. Also, during the war Indiana Standard created its chemical division, formed from the merger of the Pan American Chemicals Company and the Indoil Chemical Company.|$|E
25|$|To enhance livability, Tesla has {{developed}} a network of fast-charging 'Supercharger' stations that allow the driver to <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> top-up the charge on their Model S. This Supercharger network has rapidly expanded in Europe, across the United States, and other countries where there is significant demand, and , the network {{has been established in}} most American states, thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety.|$|E
50|$|Experiments on {{hereditary}} material {{during the}} time of the Hershey-Chase Experiment often used bacteriophages as a model organism. Bacteriophages lend themselves to experiments on hereditary material because they incorporate their genetic material into their host cell's genetic material (making them useful tools), they multiply <b>quickly,</b> <b>and</b> they are <b>easily</b> collected by researchers.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} and monitor {{the progression of}} scoliosis and other spinal deformities in patients following idiopathic scoliosis (IS), non-invasive and radiation-free techniques are recommended {{because of the need}} for repeated radiographs. In a clinical setting, spine parameters can be <b>quickly,</b> cheaply <b>and</b> <b>easily</b> assessed using rasterstereography (RS). To assess the validity of the radiation-free technique RS based on surface topography compared with radiographs. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were systemat-ically searched for studies which investigate the validity of rasterstereography compared with x-ray measurements. Studies publishe...|$|R
50|$|Threats to {{this species}} have {{included}} grazing and trampling by livestock, development and ranching, cranberry farming, genetic drift, vehicles and road maintenance, and horticultural collecting of the bulbs and flowers. New sprouts and shoots dry out <b>quickly</b> <b>and</b> are <b>easily</b> crushed. The invasion of trees into the plant's habitat, either by natural succession or deliberate planting and fire suppression, {{can alter the}} hydrology and soil structure enough to eliminate it. When the plant was listed as an endangered species in 1994, there were 2000 to 3000 individuals remaining.|$|R
