5|$|Although Yarralumla {{is one of}} {{the largest}} suburbs in Canberra by area, its {{population}} remains <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> because more than half of its area consists of open space or non-residential development, including Weston and Stirling Parks, the Royal Canberra Golf Club, and the grounds of Government House. A relatively high proportion of houses are occupied by diplomatic missions.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{typically}} have <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> brains relative to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some fish have relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E

5|$|The new fort was <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> by {{eighteenth century}} standards, {{and it was}} more similar to a large redoubt than a fort. Despite this, its design was {{considered}} to be revolutionary, since {{it was one of the}} earliest polygonal forts to be built around the world. Fort Tign√© was also the last major fortification built by the Order of Saint John.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} achieved some {{surprise and}} tactical success, but was ultimately a failure. A great many Allied aircraft were destroyed {{on the ground}} but replaced within a week. Allied aircrew casualties were <b>quite</b> <b>small,</b> since the majority of Allied losses were grounded aircraft. The Germans, however, lost many pilots {{that they could not}} readily replace.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} Fox's Standards and Practices {{department}} was flown {{out to the}} episode's Vancouver, British Columbia filming location. She was asked to watch the episode being produced {{to ensure that it}} did not breach any of the network's censorship rules. Several of the scenes that were being produced required <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> spaces during filming, requiring Nutter to record additional coverage on a handheld camera, which he later played back to the Standards and Practices liaison for approval.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} rather {{similar to the}} dark-green {{fritillary}} (Argynnis aglaja) and high brown fritillary (Argynnis adippe), but it is <b>quite</b> <b>smaller,</b> the silver centred brown spots are smaller and the postdiscal silver markings are not continuous.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the class}} is criticized for the small {{displacement}} related to their equipment, the previous Audace class were even more cramped: they were 900t lighter, <b>quite</b> <b>smaller,</b> with a bulky powerplant; however, in their latest update {{they had the same}} armament, plus an extra Super-Rapido gun (4 instead of 3).|$|R

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only a couple of days of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E
5|$|More than 40 beetle {{species have}} been {{recorded}} in common house martin nests, but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds. The typical number of individuals, around 200, is relatively low compared to other bird species (1,400 individual beetles for house sparrow, 2,000 for sand martin). The beetles {{have no effect on}} the nesting birds, and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown, although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin's nests is also <b>quite</b> <b>small.</b>|$|E

NASC recently came third in their moors league division which is an achievement for the club as they have not finished that high {{for a very long}} time. Hambleton Seals Water Polo are a newly formed team which aims to attract local children to a <b>quite</b> <b>small,</b> yet fun sport.|$|E
30|$|Even after {{restricting the}} sample, {{callback}} rates associated to second-generation immigrants are <b>quite</b> <b>smaller</b> {{than the ones}} associated to Italians. This last result shows that discrimination {{in the labor market}} is relevant also for second-generation immigrants. Splitting immigrants by generation, we conducted our study considering two potential kinds of discrimination: statistical and taste-based.|$|R

More than 30 calves have been born at the center.|$|R
5|$|Some Lucian calypsonians {{recorded}} in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability of funding for musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played {{an increasing number of}} programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be <b>quite</b> <b>small,</b> especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and hair or feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} {{estimation of}} the Electric Dipole Moment(EDM) of the neutron in the SUSY SU(5) GUT model was <b>quite</b> <b>smaller</b> than one in the MSSM, despite of its increased degree of freedom. This paradoxical result can be resolved by appropriately estimating the CP-violation in the Higgs sector. As a result, the neutron EDM in this model is estimated lager than the existing one as expected. 1...|$|R

5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The width of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically <b>quite</b> <b>small,</b> to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E
5|$|The Kokinsh≈´, Tales of Ise and Tales of Yamato all {{describe}} Narihira leaving Kyoto {{to travel}} east through the T≈çkaid≈ç region and crossing the Sumida River, composing poems at famous places (see utamakura) along the way. The Tales of Ise implies this journey {{was the result}} of the scandalous affair between Narihira and Fujiwara no Takaiko. There are doubts as to whether this journey actually took place, from the point of view both that the number of surviving poems is <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> for having made such a trip and composing poems along the way, and in terms of the historical likelihood that a courtier could have gone wandering to the other end of the country with only one or two friends keeping him company.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} African Americans in the {{territory}} during this period was <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> but not insignificant. Newcomers continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show {{that most of those}} at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6,077 citizens {{in the territory}} (which excluded Native American tribes). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, {{from the start of the}} Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly antislavery thus ending the practice in this era.|$|E
5000|$|Euchalcia bellieri has a {{wingspan}} {{of about}} 33 - 34 mm. This rare species closely resemble Euchalcia variabilis, {{but it is}} <b>quite</b> <b>smaller.</b> The upperside of the forewings shows a well marked oblique inner line with a slight rosy border. The central area is dark brown, while the hind margin is rosy. The basal dark line is angulated. The orbicular stigma is double, with a yellow ring. Larvae are green with a white lateral line.|$|R

40|$|The {{elemental}} {{composition of the}} otolith was examined in {{both male and female}} surfperch, Ditrema temmincki. The determined concentrations of 22 elements were the same regardless of the fish's sex. K, Mg, and Na which are major elements in seawater, accumulations from seawater to otolith of those elements were <b>quite</b> <b>smaller</b> than other minor elements. This suggests that elemental discrimination might occur during the movement from blood plasma to endolymph after the branchial uptake from ambient water...|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} of the new state was <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> at first {{and there was a}} strong mix between the English-speaking American settlers that dominated in the eastern/northeastern portions {{of the state and the}} Spanish-speaking former Mexicans that dominated in the southern and western portions of the state. Statehood brought many new settlers. Because of the long Spanish presence in Mexico and various failed colonization efforts by the Spanish and Mexicans in northern Mexico, there were large herds of Longhorn cattle that roamed the state. Hardy by nature but also suitable for slaughtering and consumption, they represented an economic opportunity that many entrepreneurs seized upon, thus creating the cowboy culture for which Texas is famous. While in the early days of the republic cattle and bison were slaughtered for their hides, soon a beef industry was established with cattle being shipped all over the U.S. and the Caribbean (within a few decades, beef had become a staple of the American diet).|$|E
5|$|Persona was {{the first}} {{role-playing}} entry in the Megami Tensei series {{to be released in}} the west, with the first Megami Tensei release being action game Jack Bros. in 1995. While the main Megami Tensei series' use of Christian imagery made it unsuitable for localization at the time, Persona employed a different naming system to make it more acceptable. Persona was localized by Atlus' then-new North American branch Atlus USA. Persona was chosen as a series that could help define the company and compete with the likes of Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. The team that localized Persona was <b>quite</b> <b>small,</b> which made the process quite difficult: not only was there a large amount of text to translate, but the team needed to adjust or change the Japanese references as they feared it might alienate western players. Among the changes were altering the player character's hairstyle, the ethnic origins of multiple characters, the character and location names, and multiple pieces of dialogue. The entire Snow Queen route was also cut from the game, leaving only the SEBEC story route open for exploration.|$|E
5|$|Some Jesuit {{institutions}} {{still exist}} in the Chiquitania. For example, the towns of San Rafael de Velasco, San Miguel de Velasco, Santa Ana de Velasco and San Ignacio de Velasco have functioning town councils (cabildos), and the caciques and the sexton still retain their capacities. The {{majority of the population}} of the Chiquitania is staunchly Catholic; the Chiquitano cosmovision is now only a dimly understood mythology for its inhabitants. Between 1992 and 2009, the populations of San Xavier and especially Concepci√≥n tripled, and more than doubled in San Ignacio de Velasco, now the region‚Äôs fastest-growing municipality. In other mission towns the population also increased, albeit on a smaller scale. As of 2011, San Jos√© de Chiquitos, San Xavier and Concepci√≥n have around 10,000inhabitants each; and San Ignacio de Velasco, the largest town in the Chiquitania, has about 35,000 and is now boasts a campus of a national university. On the other hand, in Santa Ana de Velasco there are currently only a few hundred people. The remoter settlements of Santiago de Chiquitos and Santo Coraz√≥n are <b>quite</b> <b>small</b> as well. According to various sources, in Bolivia the number of ethnic Chiquitanos is between 30,000 and 47,000 of which less than 6,000‚Äì mainly elderly people‚Äì still speak the original language. Only a few hundred are monolingual in the Chiquitano language.|$|E
