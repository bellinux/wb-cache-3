A size bigger than the NAA Little Joe would be required, so the Little Joe II was built by General Dynamics/Convair. After an August 1963 <b>qualification</b> <b>test</b> flight, four LES test flights (A-001 through 004) were made at the White Sands Missile Range between May 1964 and January 1966.|$|E
25|$|In France {{during the}} chaotic {{years of the}} French Revolution and its aftermath, the younger Audubon {{grew up to be}} a {{handsome}} and gregarious man. He played flute and violin, and learned to ride, fence, and dance. A great walker, he loved roaming in the woods, often returning with natural curiosities, including birds' eggs and nests, of which he made crude drawings. His father planned to make a seaman of his son. At twelve, Audubon went to military school and became a cabin boy. He quickly found out that he was susceptible to seasickness and not fond of mathematics or navigation. After failing the officer's <b>qualification</b> <b>test,</b> Audubon ended his incipient naval career. He was cheerfully back on solid ground and exploring the fields again, focusing on birds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1870s the Hungarian {{government}} forced Emmanuil Hrabar {{to leave the}} country. Olga with children stayed under police surveillance at the Dobryansky manor in Čertižné (now in Slovakia). In 1880 the Hrabars temporarily reunited in Russia. Emmanuil passed <b>qualification</b> <b>test</b> to teach German and French and settled with Igor and Vladimir in Yegoryevsk. Olga returned to Hungary to continue pro-Russian propaganda; in 1882 {{she and her father}} were, at last, arrested for treason and brought to a trial that aroused public suspicion of a police provocation. She was acquitted for lack of evidence and emigrated to Russia {{for the rest of her}} life. In Russia the Hrabars lived under nom de guerre Hrabrov; Igor Grabar restored his real surname (transliterated from Russian with a G, unlike his brother Vladimir Hrabar) in the early 1890s.|$|E

Long after the U.S. version eliminated its Fastest Finger round, numerous other versions (including the Australian, Italian, Turkish, British, Russian, Dutch and French versions) followed suit by eliminating their respective Fastest Finger First rounds; additionally, some versions (such as the British, Dutch, French and Russian versions) have eliminated their respective Fastest Finger First rounds for special events wherein celebrities play for charity.|$|E
