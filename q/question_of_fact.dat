5|$|The Supreme Court {{directed}} {{the circuit court}} for the District of New Jersey to grant Jackalow a new trial. The Court held that, while the trial court should determine {{the description of the}} boundaries of New York and Connecticut, the ascertainment of their actual boundaries, and the application of those boundaries to the crime in question, should have been a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> for the jury. Jackalow was not retried and was released.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction is debatable, and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the judges}} {{considered}} there was any substance to {{the argument that the}} miners in stopping work had ceased to be employed before the award was made, holding as a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that the employees, while ceasing work, did not intend to end the employment relationship.|$|E

2500|$|However, errors <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> {{can cause}} {{injustice}} and unfairness to the individuals involved. In light of this, judges have suggested, albeit obiter, that the courts' [...] "supervisory jurisdiction over <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> might be broader {{than the traditional}} approach indicates".|$|R
5000|$|In philosophy, {{the concept}} fact is {{considered}} in epistemology and ontology. <b>Questions</b> <b>of</b> objectivity and truth are {{closely associated with}} <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> A [...] "fact" [...] {{can be defined as}} something that is the case—that is, a state of affairs.|$|R
25|$|The referee, who {{is usually}} located off the court, {{is the final}} {{authority}} about tennis rules. When called to the court by a player or team captain, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision if the tennis rules were violated (question of law) but may not change the umpire's decision on a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b> If, however, the referee is on the court during play, the referee may overrule the umpire's decision (This would only happen in Davis Cup or Fed Cup matches, not at the World Group level, when a chair umpire from a non-neutral country is in the chair).|$|E
25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; it is a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E
25|$|In United States v. Jackalow (1861), the Court {{held that}} Article Three venue must be {{established}} by facts found by a jury. The act of piratical murder by Jackalow was alleged to have occurred on the high seas, between the waters within {{the jurisdiction of the}} states of New York and Connecticut; New Jersey was the first state into which Jackalow was brought upon capture. An 1820 anti-piracy statute provided that, if the crime occurred on the high seas, venue was proper in the first state into which the defendant was brought after capture. The Court held that—although the boundary of New York and Connecticut state waters were a question of law for the judge—the location of the crime was a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> for the jury. Thus, Jackalow was granted a new trial.|$|E
50|$|While <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> are {{resolved}} by a trier <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> {{which in the}} common law system is often a jury, <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> law are always resolved by a judge or equivalent. Whereas findings <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> in a common law legal system are rarely overturned by an appellate court, conclusions of law are more readily reconsidered.|$|R

50|$|The Court hears appeals {{from people}} who were convicted or pleaded guilty and were sentenced by a Supreme or District court judge. The Court also hears appeals lodged by The Crown against the {{severity}} of a sentence. Decisions made by the Land and Environment Court, the Industrial Court or the Drug Court in criminal jurisdiction may also be brought for appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal may also grant leave to appeal in matters involving <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> or mixed <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and law. It may also grant leave to appeal {{in cases where the}} severity or adequacy of the sentence is challenged.|$|R
500|$|Conceptual {{uncertainty}} is the [...] "most fundamental in {{the validity of}} a trust or power", and is where the language used in the trust is unclear. Examples include where familiar but overly vague terms are used, such as [...] "good customers" [...] or [...] "useful employees"; if the concept cannot be certain, the trust fails. Evidential uncertainty, on the other hand, is {{where there is a}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> it is impossible to answer, such as when a claimant cannot prove he is a beneficiary. This does not necessarily invalidate the trust, as Jenkins J (as he was then) said in Re Coxen: ...|$|E
500|$|Standing, or locus standi (Latin for [...] "a {{place to}} stand"), is a {{threshold}} requirement that an applicant must satisfy before a court will permit {{him or her}} to proceed with a claim for judicial review. Depending on the facts of the case, the applicant has to establish one of the two categories of standing. The applicant seeks to establish private standing when he or she purports to represent his or her own interests. In contrast, the applicant seeks to establish public or representative standing when he or she purports to represent the interests of a larger group of people, or the public at large. Standing is a mixed <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and law, which the court determines based on legal principles.|$|E
500|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of uncertainty {{that can affect}} the validity of a trust: conceptual uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. [...] "Conceptual uncertainty" [...] is where the language is unclear, something {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. [...] "Evidential uncertainty" [...] is where a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. [...] "Ascertainability" [...] is where a beneficiary cannot be found, while [...] "administrative unworkability" [...] is where the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of getting around uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} {{to point out}} that the Amendment has removed the second stage of appeal process. Appeals to the High Council of Taxation could only be made on <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> non-compliance with the provisions of the Tax Act rather than <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|R
50|$|In some cases, a judge's {{presentation}} of the jury instruction {{is also known as}} summing up. In this case, the judge is merely articulating the law and <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> upon which the jury is asked to deliberate.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, Condorcet's jury theorem {{provides}} a theoretical basis for democracy, even if somewhat idealized, {{as well as}} a basis of the decision <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> by jury trial, and as such continues to be studied by political scientists.|$|R
500|$|Occasionally, the {{distinction}} between errors of law and errors of fact can be fuzzy. Where a public authority {{is alleged to have}} committed an error of mixed fact and law, the High Court is more likely to leave the matter to the authority and decline to intervene. This can be the case where a statutory term evaluated by the authority is so general and ambiguous that reasonable people may peg different meanings to it. In such a situation, it is generally left to the authority to evaluate the meaning of the term. This is illustrated by Puhlhofer v. Hillingdon London Borough Council (1986), which involved a public authority that bore a statutory responsibility for providing homeless people with accommodation. The applicants were a married couple who lived with their two children in a single room in a guest house. Their application for permanent accommodation was rejected because the authority claimed they were not [...] "homeless" [...] within the meaning of the statute. The House of Lords upheld this decision, determining that the issue of whether the applicants had accommodation was a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> to be determined by the public authority: ...|$|E
500|$|Hale {{was born}} on 1 November 1609 in West End House (now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange) in Alderley, Gloucestershire to Robert Hale, a {{barrister}} of Lincoln's Inn, and Joanna Poyntz. His father gave up his practise as a barrister several years before Hale's birth [...] "because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings". This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury, through claiming a (false) allegation about this right. Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors. Although in common use, Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and [...] "contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country". John Hostettler, in his biography of Matthew Hale, points out that his father's concerns about giving colour in pleadings {{could not have been}} very strong [...] "since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife's inherited income, but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law".|$|E

25|$|The word jury {{derives from}} Anglo-Norman juré ("sworn"). Juries are {{most common in}} common law adversarial-system jurisdictions. In the modern system, juries act as triers <b>of</b> <b>fact,</b> while judges act as triers of law (but see nullification). A trial without a jury (in which both <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> and <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> law are decided by a judge) {{is known as a}} bench trial.|$|R
2500|$|Substantial {{similarity}} is a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> that {{is decided}} by a jury. In situations where [...] "reasonable minds could not differ" [...] {{in the opinion}} that substantial similarity of expression does not exist, a court may make summary judgment for the defendant, closing a case without finding infringement. Since [...] "substantial similarity" [...] can require careful evaluation, however, infringement cases usually lead to full inquiry with appropriate tests developed by the courts.|$|E
2500|$|In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 633 (1996), the Court {{said that}} the {{government}} purpose must be [...] "independent and legitimate." [...] And in United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), the Court said the government purpose [...] "must be genuine, not hypothesized or invented post hoc in response to litigation." [...] Thus, the Court made it clear that, in the scrutiny regime established in West Coast Hotel v.

2500|$|Direct {{evidence}} of actual copying by a defendant rarely exists, so plaintiffs must often resort to indirectly proving copying.

Some courts also use [...] "probative similarity" [...] to describe this standard. This inquiry is a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>fact</b> determined by a jury.|$|E
