5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{began the}} 2009 season after {{finishing}} 7–6 in 2008, including a season-ending {{loss in the}} 2009 Gator Bowl to Nebraska. Heading into 2010, Clemson returned many of its 2009 players, but faced <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> those players would perform better with another year of experience. Also under question was head coach Dabo Swinney, who was beginning his first full season as {{head coach of the}} Tigers after assuming control in the seventh game of 2008. Clemson attempted to answer some of the questions about the team's potential in {{the first game of the}} season, a 37–14 win against Middle Tennessee State.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had. The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding {{and a lack of}} care shown towards breeding stock selection. Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in Saint-Maixent and La Roche-sur-Yon, created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed. Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|In ODI cricket, Strauss {{has scored}} six centuries during his career, {{the first of}} which came against the West Indies in 2004 at Lord's. He scored his second century the {{following}} season, reaching 152 against Bangladesh, at the time the third-highest total by an England batsman in ODIs. Strauss was dropped from the ODI side after the 2007 World Cup, but returned in 2009 when he was named as the national captain. He scored a patient century against the West Indies in the same year, but England's success without him at the 2010 World Twenty20 led to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> his batting temperament was suited to one-day cricket. Over the subsequent year, Strauss scored three centuries, twice surpassing his previous highest total. He scored 154 against Bangladesh, and during the 2011 World Cup reached 158 during a tied match against India. His three scores in excess of 150 are all among the highest five by England batsmen in ODI cricket.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the tenets}} of {{population}} genetics since its inception has been that macroevolution (the evolution of phylogenic clades at the species level and above) was solely {{the result of the}} mechanisms of microevolution (changes in gene frequency within populations) operating {{over an extended period of}} time. During the last decades of the 20th century some paleontologists raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> other factors, such as punctuated equilibrium and group selection operating on the level of entire species and even higher level phylogenic clades, needed to be considered to explain patterns in evolution revealed by statistical analysis of the fossil record. Near the end of the 20th century some researchers in evolutionary developmental biology suggested that interactions between the environment and the developmental process might have been the source of some of the structural innovations seen in macroevolution, but other evo-devo researchers maintained that genetic mechanisms visible at the population level are fully sufficient to explain all macroevolution.|$|E
5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one eye from infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E
5|$|Selänne {{finished}} {{eighth in}} NHL scoring in 2010–11 with 31 goals and 49 assists in 73 games. His 80 points was the third-highest in NHL history by a player {{over the age}} of 40 (Gordie Howe, 103 and Johnny Bucyk, 83). He also scored his 1,300th point, achieving the mark with a two-goal performance on January 16, 2011, against Edmonton. <b>Questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Selänne would return for another NHL season had become an annual topic of discussion, and his decision to return for 2011–12 was delayed by a knee operation that left him uncertain if he would be capable of playing. Nonetheless, Selänne appeared in every game for the Ducks and became the oldest player in NHL history to play an entire 82-game season while leading the team with 66 points. 15 years after the original Jets relocated, a new Winnipeg Jets franchise joined the NHL, and fans in the Manitoba capital continued to view Selänne as a local hero. In his first return to Winnipeg, he was cheered by exuberant fans who booed every other Ducks player. Selänne was named to the Western Conference roster for the 2012 NHL All-Star Game, but declined his invitation and asked the League to instead send his teammate Corey Perry.|$|E

5|$|Two researchers, Chris Bennett (1996) and David Peters (2000), {{have found}} pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or {{closely related to}} them. Peters used a {{technique}} called DGS, which involves applying the digital tracing features of photo editing software to images of pterosaur fossils. Bennett only recovered pterosaurs as close relatives of the protorosaurs after removing characteristics of the hind limb from his analysis, {{in an attempt to}} test the idea that these characters are the result of convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs. However, subsequent analysis by Dave Hone and Michael Benton (2007) could not reproduce this result. Hone and Benton found pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without hind limb characters. They also criticized previous studies by David Peters, raising <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> conclusions reached without access to the primary evidence, that is, pterosaur fossils, can be held to have the same weight as conclusions based strictly on first-hand interpretation. Hone and Benton concluded that, although more primitive pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships, pterosaurs are best considered archosaurs, and specifically ornithodirans, given current evidence. In Hone and Benton's analysis, pterosaurs are either the sister group of Scleromochlus or fall between it and Lagosuchus on the ornithodiran family tree. Sterling Nesbitt (2011) found strong support for a clade composed of Scleromochlus and pterosaurs.|$|E
