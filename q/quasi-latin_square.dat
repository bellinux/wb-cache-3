40|$|This paper gives {{a general}} method for {{constructing}} <b>quasi-Latin</b> <b>square,</b> quasi-Latin rectangle and extended quasi-Latin rectangle designs for symmetric factorial experiments. Two further methods are given for parameter values satisfying certain conditions. The construction of designs {{for a range}} of numbers of rows and columns is discussed so that the different construction techniques are covered. For some row and column combinations, different designs are compared. The construction of designs with rows and columns that are nested or contiguous is also discussed. C. J. Brien, R. A. Bailey, T.

40|$|Abstract-Five BASIC {{programs}} to select random samples from populations or to randomize treatments are presented. Program 1 {{is used to}} obtain randomization of any number of treatments in {{an equal number of}} positions or test units for any number of replicates. Program 2 produces latin squares of any size for treatment randomization. Program 3 is used to obtain a specific number of randomly selected samples from a population without replacement. Program 4 produces <b>quasi-latin</b> <b>squares</b> that have treatments repeated equally in all rows and columns, with identical treatments either spaced or not. Program 5 can be used with any size grid to place 3 - 100 treatments in equal proportions and with spacing of identical treatments. Both programs 4 and 5 allow for horizontal and vertical separation between identical treatments at sampling places while still retaining the quality of randomness. These programs should facilitate random sampling and randomization procedures which are required to correctly analyze experiments by the methods of statistical probability.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the effects of several potentially beneficial factors on the utilization of high urea rations. Specific objectives were: (1) To evaluate dehydrated alfalfa (5 %), molasses (5 %) and pelleting on ration digestibility and nitrogen retention. (2) To evaluate all possible two-way interactions of the above factors on these same responses. (3) To determine the nitrogen loss in drying feces at 70 C. and in allowing feces exposure to room temperature over a 24 -hour period. Four digestion trials were conducted, using eight Hereford steers which were randomly assigned to two 4 x 4 <b>quasi-Latin</b> <b>squares</b> to determine the value of dehydrated alfalfa meal, molasses and pelleting and all possible combinations of these factors on utilization of urea-containing rations. Consequently, eight rations, one-half meal and one-half pelleted, were used. The urea (1 %) was mixed in a supplement which contained dicalcium phosphate, limestone, salt, trace minerals, vitamins A and D, corn (for pelleting qualities), and the variables (5 % dehydrated alfalfa or 5 % molasses, or both). This supplement was fed with 57 % ground corn and 25 % GROUND CORN COBS. Advisor: F. G. Owe...|$|R
