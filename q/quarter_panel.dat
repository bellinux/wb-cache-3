5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|E
5|$|David Gilliland, who had {{the pole}} position, was passed {{immediately}} by teammate Dale Jarrett. The race lead changed 63 times, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. leading for the most laps (37). Earnhardt was leading on the final lap when he and Jimmie Johnson crashed after Vickers made contact with Johnson's right rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> causing the race to end under caution flag conditions. Vickers (Johnson's teammate) was determined the race winner by NASCAR and was later criticized since the crash lowered Johnson in the points standings.|$|E
5|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 178, with Earnhardt leading Johnson and Vickers. That lap, Burton (in fifth) had a flat left {{rear tire}} and lost a lap. The field then formed a single line, with most remaining in that formation {{for the rest}} of the race. On the final lap, Johnson and Vickers left turn two with Johnson moving out of line to pass Earnhardt. When Vickers tried to move out with Johnson to provide drafting assistance, he clipped Johnson's right rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Johnson clipped Earnhardt, sending both drivers into the infield. The yellow flag went out and the field was frozen in place, with the order of finish determined by where the drivers were when the caution began. This gave Vickers the victory (the first of his career), although he was booed by the crowd.|$|E

25|$|A {{unique to}} Mexico was the vehicle called the VAM Lerma, {{which was based}} on the Concord's 4-door chassis with the Spirit's front and rear {{liftback}} body parts and unique rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E
5|$|Green-flag pit stops {{began on}} lap 48. Edwards and Biffle made pit stops on lap 49, handing {{the lead to}} Riggs. Hornish hit the turn-two outside wall on the {{following}} lap after his right-front tire {{went down in the}} tri-oval, and sustained damage to his right-front <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> but no debris came off his car. After the pit stops, Edwards regained the lead and held a five-second lead over Kyle Busch; Martin moved into third place, Riggs regained fourth place, and Harvick moved up to fifth place by lap 65. Three laps later, a second caution was needed when debris was spotted at turn-two. Most of the leaders, including Edwards, made pit stops. Jeff Burton chose to remain on the track and led on the lap-75 restart, ahead of Earnhardt and Kyle Busch. On lap 78, Kyle Busch moved ahead of Earnhardt to take second place and began to close the gap to Burton. Kyle Busch passed Burton to reclaim the lead three laps later, and opened up a 1.3-second advantage over Burton by the 92nd lap. Earnhardt was passed by Edwards for fifth place on lap 94 and Biffle got ahead of Gordon for seventh on the same lap. Edwards gained fourth place when he passed Stewart on the 96th lap, and Burton lost second to Kenseth two laps later. On lap 102, Burton fell to fourth place after Edwards passed him.|$|E
25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The front fender line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that carefully followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|E

5000|$|MSP Motor Carrier Enforcement {{officers}} of the Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Division (CVED) who enforce truck safety laws, drive vehicles identical to regular MSP patrol vehicles, except {{that they have a}} [...] "Commercial Vehicle Enforcement" [...] designation on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> of the unit in gold lettering. CVED currently uses only the Chevrolet Tahoe. Starting in 2008, CVED moved to the Tahoe platform and began using the same paint scheme as the Troopers' vehicle. The words [...] "Commercial Vehicle Enforcement" [...] were added to the <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and the 'Motor Carrier Enforcement' decals on the rear were replaced with standard [...] "State Police" [...] decals.|$|R
25|$|The {{unpainted}} stainless body creates challenges during {{restoration of}} the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original ("straight") as possible and imperfections are sculpted back to form with body filler like Bondo or lead (body solder). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel).</b> With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grainâ€”which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to work-harden. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired; each DeLorean service center today {{has at least one}} experienced body repair person on staff, and there are decades worth of new stainless panels still available in most instances.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} {{race of the}} Contender Round at Talladega, Harvick was again in a tough situation. During a green-white-checker restart, Harvick's car was unable to accelerate, which {{triggered}} a multi-car wreck. Due to the caution being displayed quickly after the leaders crossed the line, the race was considered official, and Joey Logano was declared the winner. Denny Hamlin, who was competing with Harvick for {{a spot in the}} next round, was caught up in the wreck, and was eliminated from the Chase. Harvick managed to avoid the wreck, and finished 15th, advancing him to the next round in the Chase. Trevor Bayne, who was hit in the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> by Harvick which triggered the wreck, accused him of intentionally spinning him out in order to secure a spot in the next round. Kevin Harvick and his crew chief, Rodney Childers, claimed that they had tried {{to move out of the}} way during the restart, knowing that their engine was failing. In the first race of the Eliminator Round, Harvick finished 8th at Martinsville. The next week at Texas, he managed to finish 3rd, despite having a faulty shifter which forced him to drive with one hand for the last several laps. In the final race before the Championship Round, at Phoenix, Harvick dominated the race, leading 143 of 219 laps. Unfortunately, the race did not go the distance due to rain, and at the time Dale Earnhardt Jr was the leader of the race due to the caution coming out during green flag pit stops, and he was ultimately the winner as well. Kevin Harvick finished the race in the 2nd position, advancing him to the Championship Round at Homestead-Miami Speedway.|$|E
2500|$|The Chevelle Super Sport, or SS {{represented}} Chevrolet's {{entry into}} the muscle car battle. Early 1964 and 1965 Chevelles had a Malibu SS badge on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> [...] Chevelles with the mid-1965 Z16 option, priced at US$1,501 in 1965, had the emblem on the front fender as well as distinct in-house style numbers: 737 for the hardtop and 767 for the convertible.|$|E

50|$|The {{club was}} officially formed as Corstorphine RFC in 1950. Unlike RHSFP, this club {{represented}} the western Edinburgh suburb of Corstorphine {{rather than a}} former pupils' club. They played in different variations of navy and red strips. Most often in red and blue <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Martini's first {{sponsorship}} program {{happened at}} the Daytona 3 hours in 1962 with two Alfa Romeo Giulietta SZ Coda Troncas, {{but they had no}} Martini stickers or logos on them, only [...] "Martini & Rossi Racing Team" [...] written along the front <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
2500|$|PIT bumper: The Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) bumper {{attaches}} to the front frame of a patrol car. It is designed to end vehicle pursuits by spinning the fleeing vehicle with a nudge to the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> [...] Cars not fitted with a PIT Bumper can still attempt a PIT Maneuver at risk of increased front-end damage and possible disablement if the maneuver fails and the pursuit continues.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Gordon {{took the}} lead from Joey Logano on the final restart and sailed to victory lane for the 91st time in his career. Gordon had this to say, [...] "I got a really good restart, and I got to his <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> in Turn 1 and I was able to drag him back and it allowed me to get the {{momentum}} and get by him." [...] "I had (Gordon) cleared," [...] Logano said. [...] "I should have pulled {{down in front of}} him. He got next to me, and I couldn't get away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The LeSabre {{was offered}} in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. [...] The Limited was the premium trim level {{featuring}} alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels {{in the rear}} seat to access the trunk. [...] The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, Anti-lock brakes, and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> [...] Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator. [...] Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.|$|E
50|$|For the 2012 season, both Office Depot and Mobil 1 {{returned}} to sponsor Stewart {{as well as}} having a minor presence on Ryan Newman's 39 car's right left and right rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b> Burger King would leave the 14 car to sponsor the newly formed BK Racing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} {{there was less}} change, {{although}} the car received restyled taillights. Set in heavy chromed housings, they were mounted to the carryover <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and imparted a Dodge familial appearance to the rear, as one of Dodge's styling hallmarks of the time was round taillights.|$|R
5000|$|The 1986 model saw wider flared {{wheel wells}} {{as well as}} body-color bumpers, and the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> were {{designed}} specifically to accommodate factory ground effect style side skirts. 1986 turbo models were equipped with an ordinary hood, markedly losing the turbo [...] "scoop" [...] on the driver's side.|$|R
2500|$|The 1973 {{model was}} highly popular, {{due to the}} {{previous}} year's improvements, {{as well as the}} new four bolt 15" [...] with newly designed flat hubcaps, which replaced the original [...] "bowl type" [...] covers. The fuel filler neck was moved from inside the trunk to the right front <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> just above the fender. Inside, a matte black padded dashboard was introduced, resulting in greater comfort and less eye fatigue. The wiper/washer control was also moved from a button on the dashboard to a lever on the right of the steering column. Later that year, additional improvements appeared, including a four-spoke black steering wheel.|$|E
2500|$|Only a {{few changes}} {{were made to the}} 1978 VAM Gremlin. The {{dashboard}} design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the [...] "Gremlin X" [...] logo on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} 1969 GM vehicles, locking {{steering}} columns {{were incorporated into}} the Nova. Simulated air extractor/vents were added below the Nova script, which was relocated to the front fender behind the wheelwell instead of the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> The [...] V8 with four-barrel carburetor that came standard with the SS option was revised with a [...] increase to , while a two-barrel carbureted version of the [...] V8 rated at [...] was a new option on non-SS models. The SS option price remained US$312 A new Turbo-Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic was made available for non-SS Novas with six-cylinder and V8 engines, although the older two-speed Powerglide continued to be available on the smaller-engined Novas. 1969 SS models were the first Nova SS models to have standard front disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|Visually, the two {{commercial}} vehicles, the Utility and Panel Van, remained {{almost identical}} to the previous model, the FB. In fact, the FB rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and tail lights were carried over to the EK commercials. The carrying capacity was however increased from 8 cwt to 10 cwt by fitting upgraded springs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, due to Boudreaux's Butt Paste ads on the car, Ray's No. 90 Ford {{was named}} the fifth scariest NASCAR paint scheme of all time by ESPN The Magazine for having [...] "'BUTT PASTE' slapped on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> in giant red {{lettering}} and a cartoon baby riding on the hood." ...|$|R
5000|$|Australian-specification {{vehicles}} {{differ from}} cars {{delivered in the}} United States by following the Japanese models; primarily headlights, side indicators (on front <b>quarter</b> <b>panels),</b> rear tail lights, front and rear bumpers and a higher placing of the [...] "Outback" [...] badging {{on the front door}} bodywork (as opposed to being placed on the plastic cladding).|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Dodge {{took the}} Charger into NASCAR {{in hopes that}} the {{fastback}} would make their car a winner on the high-banks. However the car proved difficult to handle on the faster tracks because its body generated lift. Drivers would later claim that [...] "it was like driving on ice." [...] To solve this problem Dodge installed a small lip spoiler on the trunk lid that improved traction at speeds above [...] This was made a dealer-installed option in late-1966 and in 1967 because of NASCAR rules, making the '66 Charger the first U.S. production vehicle to offer a spoiler. (Small <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> extensions were added in 1967.) [...] David Pearson, driving a #6 Cotton Owens-prepared Charger, {{went on to win}} the NASCAR Grand National championship in 1966 with 14 first-place finishes.|$|E
2500|$|The 1961 Oldsmobile body design {{represented}} the after-effect of the 1958 recession. [...] While wheelbases {{remained the same}} as in 1960, the overall length and width were reduced slightly â€“ a trend seen throughout all of GM's marques. [...] Body design focused on a trimmer, fuselage design. [...] At the bottom of the rear quarters, a [...] "skeg" [...] - a downward fin - jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> Round tail lights, one on each side, were set into the rear cove. [...] For 1961, GM retired the compound curve windshields that it introduced in 1954, and the much hated body dogleg necessitated by the shape of the windshield. [...] Instead of adopting the cleaner straight angled [...] "A" [...] pillar, Harley Earl, who was nearing the end of his tenure at GM, pushed for a small curved switch back, used in 1961â€“62, at the outboard base of the windshield.|$|E
2500|$|The Mercury Sable is {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus sold under Ford's near-luxury Mercury brand. Developed jointly with the Taurus, the Sable shared most {{mechanical}} components but had a unique body and interior and a longer length. The Sable had an exterior design that was arguably more experimental than the Taurus, featuring rear windows that wrapped around the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and a front [...] "lightbar", a low-wattage lamp between the front headlamps, which later became a signature styling feature for all Mercury models through the early 1990s. Intended for a more upscale market, it was available in two models, base GS and high-end LS in sedan and station wagon body styles. Powertrain choices were the same, though no manual transmission was offered. The Sable was sold as the Ford Taurus in Mexico, New Zealand and western Europe. The first-generation Sable and Taurus were produced concurrently through the 1991 model year.|$|E
25|$|Also new was a variable-ratio power {{steering}} unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> on coupes and convertibles)for improved side impact protection {{as was the case}} with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.|$|R
50|$|All HJ models, {{aside from}} the One Tonner, were easily {{identified}} from the HQ by having a squared-off frontal treatment with wrap-around indicator lights. The rear of the sedan models featured a new bumper and wraparound triangular taillights, while all other body styles kept the previous HQ's rear styling. Sedan and wagon also had revised rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The VF Valiant was a facelifted {{version of}} the VE Valiant, {{featuring}} four new <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> new lights and a new grille. Parking and indicator lights were now mounted above the headlights. Seating, safety features and soundproofing were improved, Pacer and Regal 770 models were new and a hardtop body style was offered for the first time.|$|R
