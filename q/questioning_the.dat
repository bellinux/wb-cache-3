5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> {{accuracy}} of the Buddhagosha's work. This {{is because of the}} changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E

Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|During November 2002, Metropolitan Partners filed a grant {{request to}} the West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee. It {{received}} $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements.

5|$|Hamilton {{received}} a 25-second penalty, which demoted him to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to {{first and second}} positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal.

The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> decision.

However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider.|$|E
5|$|Keir Starmer, {{director}} of the CPS, announced on 24 May 2011 that a summons for manslaughter had been issued against Harwood.

5|$|Progressive rock {{elements}} {{appear in}} other metal subgenres. Black metal is conceptual by definition, {{due to its}} prominent theme of <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> values of Christianity.

Symphonic metal {{is an extension of}} the tendency towards orchestral passages in early progressive rock. Progressive rock has also served as a key inspiration for genres such as post-rock, post-metal and avant-garde metal, math rock, power metal and neo-classical metal.|$|E

Concerned that the escaped sleds would raise the alarm, Rogers immediately ordered a return to their last camp. His council disapproved of the return by the same route (a violation of Rogers' own ranging guidelines), but he overruled them, citing the need for speed and the deep snow.

5|$|As the {{expensive}} War of the Spanish Succession grew unpopular, {{so did the}} Whig administration. The impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, a high church Tory Anglican who had preached anti-Whig sermons, led to further public discontent. Anne thought Sacheverell ought to be punished for <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> Glorious Revolution, but that his punishment should only be a mild one to prevent further public commotion. In London, riots broke out in support of Sacheverell, but the only troops available to quell the disturbances were Anne's guards, and Secretary of State Sunderland was reluctant to use them and leave the Queen less protected. Anne declared God would be her guard and ordered Sunderland to redeploy her troops. In line with Anne's views, Sacheverell was convicted, but his sentence—suspension of preaching for three years—was so light as to render the trial a mockery.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{response}} to the Kazon was generally negative. Some reviewers praised their ability to capture Voyager and maroon its crew on a desolate planet, while others felt they were poorly developed copies of Klingons and that the second season focused too much on them. The Kazon were included on several lists ranking the worst villains in Star Trek history, and were cited {{as an example of}} the racist implications in the franchise's alien species. During her re-watching of the series, TrekToday Michelle Erica Green provided extensive criticism of the alien species, <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> decision to feature them as the primary antagonists instead of the Vidiians, and Captain Kathryn Janeway's refusal to share technology with them. The Kazon were also poorly received by the show's cast members, who did not find them to be strong villains or compelling additions to the narrative.|$|E
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even <b>questioning</b> <b>the</b> consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth was shaped by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E

Tactical <b>questioning</b> also facilitates <b>the</b> screening and selection of personnel for further exploitation by interrogation or debriefing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to study male <b>questioning</b> of masculinity. <b>The</b> study of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> will be {{conducted}} through a literature study, that will be done using an anthology that holds a critical perspective towards masculinity. The study of <b>the</b> <b>questioning,</b> will be done through mapping the most common patterns within <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> together with patterns in the form used for presenting <b>the</b> <b>questioning.</b> Apart from <b>the</b> focus on <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> and its form, which norms that are being questioned will also be studied. Apart from the focuses mentioned above, the last focus is directed towards finding patterns within the chosen themes vulnerability and homosociality. Since the focuses of the thesis will be studied through finding patterns within the material, thematic analysis {{will be used as}} a method. The method queer reading will also be used for studying norms. What has been found is that the form of <b>the</b> <b>questioning</b> mainly contains alternative thinking and reflections about ideals, as well as frustration related to trying to live up to these ideals. Overall few innovatory perspectives were brought up in <b>the</b> <b>questioning,</b> but <b>the</b> own father was rather commonly brought up in relation to reflection of the own masculinity. Regarding the chosen themes, avoiding to express emotions of vulnerability openly was found to be most common regarding vulnerability. Within the theme of homosociality, the most common pattern was that the men maintained a distance to each other. The most interesting discovery was found within the reflective form, which became interesting, since the stories contained an understanding that reflection should be avoided in order to uphold a masculine identity. Paradoxically then, the overall form of the material was reflective stories, making the form of the stories a break against a central norm found within their content...|$|R

Wilkinson won the primary, garnering 36 percent of the vote to 26 percent for Brown, 18 percent for Beshear, 12 percent for Stumbo, and 6 percent for Carroll. In total, Wilkinson spent a record $4 million during the primary campaign. Kentucky historian Thomas D.
