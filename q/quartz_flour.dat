40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental investigations on the early-age {{behavior of}} zero-slump concrete. In this context, compaction behavior and green-strength {{are used to}} characterize the early-age behavior of zero-slump concrete. First, {{the influence of the}} granulometric properties of the fines is discussed in detail. For this purpose, the early-age behavior of two different fines (<b>quartz</b> <b>flour</b> and fly ash) is investigated by means of the intensive compaction test (IC-test). The tests on the influence of the fines focus on effects caused by differences in the particle shape and the use of a plasticizing admixture. The conducted tests on the compaction behavior of the fines and their corresponding green-strength are extended to continuously graded granular mixes. Here, the influence of optimized particle packing on the early-age behavior is presented and a comparison based on the aforementioned <b>quartz</b> <b>flour</b> and fly ash is made...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Application of HPC (High {{performance}} concrete) is {{very popular}} and modern solution in current architecture. Higher mechanical and durability properties allow using of thin-walled cross-sections bringing savings of materials and internal space of buildings. This paper deals with development of HPC and UHPFRC (Ultra high performance fiber reinforced concrete) mix design and impact of composition to final mechanical properties. Mix design is focused first {{on the influence of}} various additives such as fly ash, silica fume and <b>quartz</b> <b>flour</b> and then to different dosage of steel fibers...|$|E
50|$|Grain fillers {{generally}} {{consist of}} three basic components; a binder, a bulking agent and a solvent. The binder is wood finish, {{and in the}} case of oil-based fillers is typically a blend of oil and varnish. In the case of water-based fillers, it is acrylic or urethane. The type of binder influences the type of solvent used; oil-based fillers usually use mineral spirits, while water-based fillers use water. Both types of filler use silica as a bulking agent as it resists shrinking and swelling in response to changes in temperature and humidity. Other binders may include <b>quartz</b> powder, wood <b>flour,</b> and talc.|$|R
40|$|Rocks of the Morenci-Metcalf {{district}} {{consist of}} Precambrian metaquartzite-schist, granodiorite, and granite overlain by Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments. Intrusion of igneous rocks, emplacement of breccia masses, and associated hydrothermal activity occurred in Laramide time. Breccias {{of the district}} {{are associated with the}} youngest sialic intrusive complex. This sequence includes intrusion of the Older Granite Porphyry stock, main stage district hydrothermal alteration, quartz veining, breccia formation, main stage district hydrothermal mineralization, and intrusion of the Younger Granite Porphyry plug. Breccia formation in the Morenci-Metcalf district is similar to breccia descriptions reported in the literature for other porphyry copper deposits. Three breccia types, of separate and distinct origins, are herein described as the Morenci, Metcalf and King, and Candelaria Breccias. The Morenci Breccia is an intrusion breccia that has formed along a pre-existing structural feature during the ascent and emplacement of the Older Granite Porphyry stock. It exhibits an oblate lenticular shape with angular to subrounded fragments in a matrix of quartz, K-feldspar, biotite, and minor rock flour. The Metcalf-King Breccias and numerous smaller breccia masses are the remnants of an original Older Granite Porphyry mantle above the ascending Younger Granite Porphyry complex. The breccia masses occur as large 'xenoliths' floating within the Younger Granite Porphyry plug and were formed by surging and collapse during emplacement of this intrusive. Fragments in the Metcalf and King Breccias grade from angular in the central core to rounded at the contacts and occur in a matrix of sericite, K- feldspar, <b>quartz,</b> and rock <b>flour.</b> The Candelaria Breccia is an explosion pipe and is the largest continuous breccia mass in the district. It is oval with an inverted cone appearance consisting of angular to subangular equidimensional fragments in a matrix of sericite, quartz, specularite, and rock flour. All the breccia masses occur within and subsequent to the district phyllic (quartz-sericite-pyrite) alteration zone. Main stage district copper mineralization postdates emplacement of the Older Granite Porphyry stock and breccia formation, and is prior to the intrusion of the Younger Granite Porphyry plug. Late stage quartz-sericite-pyrite-chalcopyrite veinlets occur in the Metcalf-King Breccia group. Field mapping and laboratory studies indicate that the Older Granite Porphyry stock appears to have been the main district mineralizer...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of sodium silicate-activated Class F fly ash in improving the thermal shock resistance and in extending the onset of hydration of Secar # 80 refractory cement. When the dry mix cement, consisting of Secar # 80, Class F fly ash, and sodium silicate, {{came in contact with}} water, NaOH derived from the dissolution of sodium silicate preferentially reacted with Class F fly ash, rather than the # 80, to dissociate silicate anions from Class F fly ash. Then, these dissociated silicate ions delayed significantly the hydration of # 80 possessing a rapid setting behavior. We undertook a multiple heating -water cooling quenching-cycle test to evaluate the cementâ€™s resistance to thermal shock. In one cycle, we heated the 200 and # 61616;C-autoclaved cement at 500 and # 61616;C for 24 hours, and then the heated cement was rapidly immersed in water at 25 and # 61616;C. This cycle was repeated five times. The phase composition of the autoclaved # 80 /Class F fly ash blend cements comprised four crystalline hydration products, boehmite, katoite, hydrogrossular, and hydroxysodalite, responsible for strengthening cement. After a test of 5 -cycle heat-water quenching, we observed three crystalline phase-transformations in this autoclaved cement: boehmite and # 61614; and # 61543;-Al 2 O 3, katoite and # 61614; calcite, and hydroxysodalite and # 61614; carbonated sodalite. Among those, the hydroxysodalite and # 61614; carbonated sodalite transformation not only played a pivotal role in densifying the cementitious structure and in sustaining the original compressive strength developed after autoclaving, but also offered an improved resistance of the # 80 cement to thermal shock. In contrast, autoclaved Class G well cement with and without Class F fly ash and <b>quartz</b> <b>flour</b> failed this cycle test, generating multiple cracks in the cement. The major reason for such impairment was the hydration of lime derived from the dehydroxylation of portlandite formed in the autoclaved cement, causing its volume to expand...|$|E
