40|$|The neo-classical {{framework}} {{ignores the}} interaction between individuals and {{is not at all}} interested {{in the nature of the}} relationship that links individuals through the market. However, the market is a place for social integration where the individuals necessarily use their interaction abilities. In other words, the integration depends directly on a rationality that we could call, inspired by Habermas 1, “communicative”. There exists no market without exchange and no exchange without interaction. The social interaction is the necessary condition to the building and the spatio-temporal organization of a financial market. In this paper, we propose a semiotic metaphor of the financial market where the fundamental value would be the signified of an asset and where its <b>quotation</b> (<b>exchange</b> value) would be the signifier, i. e. the abstract structure that evokes the signified (use value). This semiotic metaphor of the financial market sustains the idea of a flexible interdisciplinary knowledge that would try to interpret the signs and the meaning of a constantly changing financial reality...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the qualities of the mixed diffusion-jump process whose {{parameters}} are random variables. The hypothesis of a Wiener geometric process applied to exchange rate has become doubtful at the beginning of the nineties, fact determined by a high leptokurtosis of the empirical distributions. The alternative of another distribution was studied in several articles. The mathematical model proposed in this paper has as fundamental hypothesis the fact that the distribution of the continuous part of the variations in the logarithms of exchange rate is a mixture of two normal laws, whose parameters are random variables. In the final section we present the main results obtained by using the model developed in the second section and the method presented in the third section.

Violent swings on the foreign exchange markets and greatest uncertainty of interest rates plead for a more frequent use of currency cocktails international operators.

A comparison of the two credits is presented and their differences are exposed. The author concludes that the SDR could be, in practice, very different from a private transaction to the next.

40|$|Abstract- Business {{combinations}} under {{common control}} (BCUCC) : the Italian Experience. The {{aim of this}} paper was to analyze the phenomenon of business combinations under common control (BCUCC) with emphasis on the Italian experience, focusing on information deduced from a sample of Italian financial statements and comparing them {{with each other and with}} the same number of European listed companies. We started from a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon, contextualizing it within the IAS/IFRS framework, and discussing the different visions and possible solutions that have been suggested by other important national and international organizations (US GAAP, Assirevi, China GAAP), and then proceeded to analyze the financial statements of the most important Italian companies in detail. We subsequently considered the two different methodologies for accounting, delineating the analogies and differences between them, in an attempt to investigate the reasons why one of them could be preferable to the other and the different effects of each on consolidated financial statements. Finally we analyzed the different informational needs of users of the financial statement compared with cases of “normal ” business combinations.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} {{consists}} in examining the changes in the volatility of daily returns of EUR/RON exchange rate using on the one hand symmetric GARCH models (ARCH and GARCH) {{and on the other hand}} the asymmetric GARCH models (EGARCH, TARCH and PARCH), since the conditional variance is time-varying. The analysis takes into account daily <b>quotations</b> of EUR/RON <b>exchange</b> rate over the period of 04 th January 1999 to 13 th June 2016. Thus, we are modeling heteroscedasticity by applying different specifications of GARCH models followed by looking for significant parameters and low information criteria (minimum Akaike Information Criterion). All models are estimated using the maximum likelihood method under the assumption of several distributions of the innovation terms such as: Normal (Gaussian) distribution, Student’s t distribution, Generalized Error distribution (GED), Student’s with fixed df. Distribution, and GED with fixed parameter distribution. The predominant models turned out to be EGARCH and PARCH models, and the empirical results point out that the best model for estimating daily returns of EUR/RON exchange rate is EGARCH(2, 1) with Asymmetric order 2 under the assumption of Student’s t distributed innovation terms. This can be explained by the fact that in case of EGARCH model, the restriction regarding the positivity of the conditional variance is automatically satisfied...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{the present}} study is to verify the {{presence}} and the evolution of (voluntary) environmental disclosure with reference to Italian firms. We have examined the documentation of listed firms both in 2006 and 2009, that have been chosen because they immediately precede and immediately follow the emanation in Italy of the legislative decree n. 32 of 2007 that introduced {{for the first time in}} Italy – at least in voluntary terms - the information about environment. Therefore, the analysis of the two years mentioned allows us also to verify whether and how firms operated after this new legislative indication. Design/methodology/approach – We propose an approach based on multivariate regression analysis in order to assess the evolution and the determinants of voluntary environmental disclosure. The dependent variable is represented by the disclosure index, that we have estimated through the analysis of the corporate documents of the years 2006 and 2009. Independent variables are as follows: firm size, business industry, economic performance, financial situation, age, foreign markets, public shareholders, company ownership, audit, legislation and environmental performance. Originality/value – The first contribution provided by our work is to realize, for the first time, a specific analysis on environmental disclosure of Italian firms. Moreover (second contribution) our study has extended this analysis to all the informative documents of the entities. For this purpose, besides the individual, we have analyzed the consolidated financial reports, the management reports, the sustainability reports and the reports on corporate governance, if present. Finally (third contribution) the present work allows to examine the effects of the introduction of a new legislation which requires (without obligation) environmental information in the document of the corporate financial annual report. Practical implications – In contrast with the previous studies on this issue, the results of our analysis show an inverse (negative) and statistically significant relation between voluntary environmental disclosure and the level of minority shareholding, the presence of international audit firms (Big 4), environmental performance, profitability and <b>quotation</b> in foreign <b>exchange</b> markets. Finally, our analysis confirms the positive relation between environmental disclosure and firm size and with the presence of government shareholdings in the ownership structure.

40|$|During recent decades, {{the rapid}} pace of {{financial}} markets involving new modes of management, governance, and regulation has framed business firms. This corporate drift toward financialization is summarized under the “shareholder value” label. What do financial markets do? Unequivocally, they organize trading on shares that are securities: tradable financial entitlements established by law, which formalize expectations, and claims of financial rents {{paid by the}} issuing company. Actually, how continued <b>quotation</b> on share <b>exchanges</b> came to be the barometer of economic or social welfare is a different matter. The latter adoption has required quite a great leap from “the euthanasia of the rentier, of the functionless investor” involving changes in, and reforms of, monetary and financial architectures at policy-making and regulatory levels; banking and financial institutions; shareholding, monetary, and investment funds (including pension and insurance); and the management, organization, and accounting of business firms. This general trend has been further shaped by transnational imitation between various socioeconomic environments and regulatory regimes, led by some global institutions. This paper aims to address some theoretical problems with shareholder value that come from its misguided understanding of shareholding and the business firm. Shareholder value relies on complementary views that point to market and ownership to understand the dynamics of both securities markets and the enterprise activity. But what happens when shares, acquired at a definite price in a given circumstance, relate to the enterprise congeries of legal and economic systems involving flows and immobilizations that require an accounting system to explicate them? This Article engages this theoretical challenge by drawing upon {{the concept of the}} firm as an “enterprise entity,” which has significant implicationsfor governance and disclosure. It argues that the enterprise entity is a comprehensive approach to the firm that integrates accounting, economics, and law, thus improving on the received understanding of the firm. PartII discusses a framework based on the concept of the firm as an enterprise entity. Part III then contrasts this framework with three alternative views on the firm that jointly constitute the shareholder value rhetoric: the “black box,” the “proprietor-entrepreneur,” and the “legal person. ” Further, these views are criticized as “daydreams. ” Finally, Part IV applies this comparative assessment to matters of corporate governance and disclosure, clarifying the novel approach to governance and disclosure of the business firm...|$|R
