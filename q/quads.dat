5|$|West Campus, {{considered}} the main {{campus of the}} University, houses the sophomores and juniors, along with some seniors. Most of the academic and administrative centers are located there. Main West Campus, with Duke Chapel at its center, contains the majority of residential <b>quads</b> to the south, while the main academic quad, library, and Medical Center are to the north. The campus, spanning , includes Science Drive, which is the location of science and engineering buildings. The residential <b>quads</b> on West Campus are Craven Quad, Crowell Quad, Edens Quad, Few Quad, Keohane Quad, Kilgo Quad, and Wannamaker Quad. Most of the campus eateries and sports facilities—including the historic basketball stadium, Cameron Indoor Stadium—are on West Campus.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the site}} was {{threatened}} by garbage dumps or by passage of 4x4 vehicles or <b>quads.</b> The installation of gates by the municipality of Bavay solved the problem. Pedestrians rarely venture off the path. The anthropization is limited. The greatest threats to the species are primary succession and invasive plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{center of}} campus is Main <b>Quad,</b> often called God <b>Quad,</b> which hosts the Main Building and the Basilica, and other {{important}} buildings and residence halls. The North-West area of campus is mainly dedicated to residential buildings, the Central-East portion of campus is dedicated to academic spaces, while the South-East is dedicated to athletics. A part from Main <b>Quad,</b> there are 6 quadrangles: North <b>Quad,</b> Mod <b>Quad,</b> and West <b>Quad</b> (mainly residential), South <b>Quad</b> and Bond <b>Quad</b> (mixed residential and academic), and DeBartolo <b>Quad</b> (only academic).|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, many {{researchers}} have focused attention on developing better data structures for storing graphical information. Among the proposed data structures, the <b>quad</b> tree data structure provides {{a good way to}} organize objects on a 2 -D plane. Region searches proceed at logarithmic speeds a desirable characteristic, but no previously proposed VLSI <b>quad</b> tree data structure distributed objects to subdivide the spatial area. This has been a major drawback for operations such as tree searching and window query. In this paper, we present a new division method to reconstruct those <b>quad</b> trees including the multiple storage <b>quad</b> tree (MSQT) and the <b>quad</b> list <b>quad</b> tree (QLQT) into nearly balanced <b>quad</b> tree data structures. Nearly balanced <b>quad</b> trees based on our new spatial division method are constructed by dynamically translating unbalanced multiple storage <b>quad</b> trees or unbalanced <b>quad</b> list <b>quad</b> trees into balanced structures. All benefits of the original <b>quad</b> tree data structures are completely retained. In addition, this method is simple and balanced <b>quad</b> trees memory require less than the original <b>quad</b> trees. Experimental results illustrate that the improvement in region queries of the presented nearly balanced <b>quad</b> trees to both of the QLQT and the MSQT is better than the improvement of the QLQT to the MSQT...|$|R

5|$|On both ships, {{two more}} quadruple sets of 1.1in guns were added {{in place of}} two {{searchlights}} amidships. After she was torpedoed in 1942, North Carolina had these removed and ten quadruple sets of 40mm guns added. Fourteen were present by June 1943, while a fifteenth mount was added {{on top of the}} third main turret that November. Washington retained its six 1.1in <b>quads</b> until the middle of 1943, when ten quad 40mm guns replaced them. By August, she had fifteen. The two ships carried these through to the close of the war.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main gates to campus, at Cunningham Square (the {{intersection}} of River Avenue and Eaton Street) and on Huxley Avenue {{to the upper}} campus, and at {{the southeast corner of}} the lower campus, along Eaton Street. The campus consists of nineteen academic and administrative buildings, nine dormitories, five apartment complexes, three residences, four athletic buildings, a power plant, a physical plant, and a security office gate house. There is also a Dominican cemetery, two <b>quads,</b> four athletic fields, a six-court tennis court, an artificial turf field, and several parking areas (including a structure below the turf field).|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{personal}} best (PB) scores, i.e. the highest scores a skater or couple has achieved over their entire career, {{in terms of}} combined total and segment scores. However, PB scores are not completely comparable if achieved in different seasons because the ISU modifies requirements and rules between seasons. In different seasons, there may be different requirements to achieve a certain level or different elements may be required. New elements may become allowed (for example, two <b>quads</b> in the short program were permitted starting in the 2010–11 season). There may be a change in point values. For example, the values of <b>quads</b> were increased after the 2010 Olympics and a second step sequence in men is no longer assigned a level. As a result, the ISU now places more weight on SB.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{continued its}} expansion {{through the first}} half of the 20th century; opening several new professional schools, expanding the residential life on the Evanston campus, and establishing a campus for the professional schools in downtown Chicago. Although the University's tax-exempt status came into dispute, a 1908 Illinois Supreme Court removed the tax threat to university property. The original Patten Gymnasium was opened in 1908 to replace its dilapidated predecessor and house the burgeoning athletic programs. In 1914, the North <b>Quads</b> were completed as a part of a $500,000 Fraternity/Men's Dormitory plan. The buildings, designed by Palmer, Hornbostel, and Jones were planned in quadrangles and would house seven fraternities and four residence halls. Harris Hall opened in 1915, opposite University Hall, to house the social sciences and the new department of political science. Dyche Stadium, Northwestern's fourth football stadium, was completed in 1926 and opened with a capacity of 47,000 seats. The Women's <b>Quads</b> were dedicated in 1926 with 2 residential halls and 14 sororities. The Western Episcopal Seminary buildings were opened in 1928, and merged with the Seabury Seminary in 1933 to form the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} non-university courses for {{students}} over 16, mainly in vocational education subjects, is provided at the further education college, City College Brighton and Hove.
