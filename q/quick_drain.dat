50|$|A {{preliminary}} {{survey of the}} dam and facilities conducted in April 2011 noted that the breach occurred at the tallest section of the dam. Within the dam's fill, there were layers of organic residual soil that in one area contained a tree stump. The residual soil was used as foundation and in layers as well — above alluvium. This suggests that {{the foundation for the}} dam was not prepared properly, according to the study. In addition, the reservoir's auxiliary dam suffered a severe slope failure on its upstream face while areas around the rim of the reservoir had mild slope failures or distress. It could not be confirmed whether the earthquake or a <b>quick</b> <b>draining</b> of the reservoir was the cause of this.|$|R
50|$|As Li Su was {{not well}} known, and the Zhangyi forces had {{defeated}} Gao Xiayu and Yuan Zi previously, {{it was said that}} the Zhangyi forces did not consider Li a threat and did not take much precautions against him. Li, after receiving reinforcements from several circuits, began to carry out military actions in which he targeted Zhangyi officers, captured them, and then treated them well and incorporated them into his command structure, using their familiarity with Zhangyi's defenses against Zhangyi. Such Zhangyi officers he thus captured included Ding Shiliang (丁士良), Chen Guangqia (陳光洽), Wu Xiulin (吳秀琳), Li Xian (李憲, whose name Li Su changed to Li Zhongyi (李忠義)), and Li You. Meanwhile, with Zhangyi's food supplies running low, the people were forced to initially resort to eating water caltrop, fish, freshwater turtles, birds, and beasts, but after those plants and animals ran out, the people started surrendering to the imperial forces en masse. The Zhangyi forces, believing that detaining the people would merely lead to <b>quicker</b> <b>drain</b> on resources, did not stop them.|$|R

Although it requires substantially more storage, the tradeoff still favors PSPF because memory is inexpensive while additional computational load can, in general, lead to <b>quicker</b> battery <b>drain</b> {{and even the}} need of a more powerful processor. We note further that the complexity of PSPF can be further reduced if we adopt direct bandpass processing. This is achieved by first passing [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Musgums {{form part}} of a complex of housing units, granaries, and a central {{courtyard}} enclosed within a thatched compound wall. The walls are connected to provide access. The exterior surfaces are grooved so that rain water can drain easily. The complex also is protected with fencing. Space is provided for expansion of the dwelling units for each new wife or daughter-in-law or, for additions to the family. The technique adopted during construction is called the mud coil pottery technique. In this method, the mud layers are placed spirally with each lift of about 0.5 m. Each lift is allowed to dry before the next one is added. The walls are thicker at the base, gradually thinning out toward the top, thereby contributing to the structure's stability. The relief lines are created as the construction proceeds upward in the [...] "V" [...] shape or with straight line grooves to facilitate <b>quick</b> and easy <b>draining</b> of water when it rains.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} market penetration of smartphones, their utility {{has been and}} will remain severely limited by their battery life. A major source of smartphone battery drain is accessing the Internet over cellular or WiFi connection when running various apps and services. Despite much anecdotal evidence of smartphone users experiencing <b>quicker</b> battery <b>drain</b> in poor signal strength, there has been limited understanding of how often smartphone users experience poor signal strength and the quantitative impact of poor signal strength on the phone battery drain. The answers to such questions are essential for diagnosing and improving cellular net-work services and smartphone battery life and help to build more accurate online power models for smartphones, which are building blocks for energy profiling and optimization of smartphone apps. In this paper, we conduct the first measurement and modeling study {{of the impact of}} wireless signal strength on smartphone en-ergy consumption. Our study makes four contributions. First, through analyzing traces collected on 3785 smartphones for at least one month, we show that poor signal strength of both 3 G and WiFi is routinely experienced by smartphone users, both spatially and temporally. Second, we quantify the extra energy consumption on data transfer induced by poor wireless signal strength. Third, we develop a new power model for WiFi and 3 G that incorporates the signal strength factor and significantly improves the modeling accuracy over the previous state of the art. Finally, we perform what-if analysis to quantify the potential energy savings from op-portunistically delaying network traffic by exploring the dynamics of signal strength experienced by users...|$|R
40|$|Multi input multi output (MIMO) and {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (OFDM) {{are the key}} techniques for the future wireless communication systems. Previous research in the above areas mainly concentrated on spectral efficiency improvement and very limited {{work has been done}} in terms of energy efficient transmission. In addition to spectral efficiency improvement, energy efficiency improvement has become an important research because of the slow progressing nature of the battery technology. Since most of the user equipments (UE) rely on battery, the energy required to transmit the target bits should be minimized to avoid <b>quick</b> battery <b>drain.</b> The frequency selective fading nature of the wireless channel reduces the spectral and energy efficiency of OFDM based systems. Dynamic bit loading (DBL) is one of the suitable solution to improve the spectral and energy efficiency of OFDM system in frequency selective fading environment. Simple dynamic bit loading (SDBL) algorithm is identified to offer better energy efficiency with less system complexity. It is well suited for fixed data rate voice/video applications. When the number of target bits are very much larger than the available subcarriers, the conventional single input single output (SISO) -SDBL scheme offers high bit error rate (BER) and needs large transmit energy. To improve bit error performance we combine space frequency block codes (SFBC) with SDBL, where the adaptations are done in both frequency and spatial domain. To improve the quality of service (QoS) further, optimal transmit antenna selection (OTAS) scheme is also combined with SFBC-SDBL scheme. The simulation results prove that the proposed schemes offer better QoS when compared to the conventional SISOSDBL scheme...|$|R
50|$|Speed became Alabama A&M’s undoing in this meeting, as the Aggies sprinted to {{touchdown}} runs of 26, 59 and 80 {{and had a}} 95-yard {{kickoff return}} by junior Tony McRae, all in the first half. Sophomore Tarik Cohen was named the game’s MVP after rushing for 161 {{yards and two touchdowns}} on 10 carries. Junior quarterback Kwashaun Quick, making his third straight start on opening day, rushed for 94 yards including two touchdowns and threw for 94 yards on 9-for-16 passing. The Bulldogs of Alabama A&M kept NC A&T on the sideline early thanks to a 12-play drive. AAMU's Jaymason Lee’s completed pass Tevin McKenzie advanced the ball to the A&T 3-yard line, but it was short of the first down. The Bulldogs settled for a Ceaser Diaz-Ramon 20-yard field goal and a 3-0 lead. Diaz-Ramon’s botched onside kick that followed allowed the Aggies to take over at the A&M 37 yard line. After an 11-yard run on a reverse by Desmond Lawrence, Quick was able to make a 26-yard run for a touchdown. The Aggies never trailed again despite Alabama A&M’s efforts on its next drive. The Bulldogs again advanced the ball inside the A&T red zone only to settle for another Diaz-Ramon field goal that made it 7-6 with 16 seconds remaining in the first quarter. Once again A&T’s speed responded. McRae took the Diaz-Ramon’s kickoff for a 95-yard return for a touchdown. The Aggies led {{at the end of the}} first quarter 14-6. A&T directed that energy toward the scoreboard while <b>Quick</b> seemed to <b>drain</b> any energy the Bulldogs had left with a 59-yard touchdown run off of a fake to Cohen that left Bulldog defenders frozen. Cohen said that fake aided in his 80-yard touchdown run that gave the Aggies a commanding 28-6 lead. The Aggies’ 34-point win was their most lopsided win over a SWAC opponent in school history, surpassing the Aggies 28-12 win over Grambling in 1991. Fifth-year linebacker D’Vonte Grant and redshirt junior Denzel Jones led the Aggies defensively with 10 tackles apiece.|$|R
