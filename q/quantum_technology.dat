25|$|Graduate {{researchers}} Chris Hughes, Kate Erickson, André Marek, and David Stern follow Johnston to ITC {{and meet}} its founder Robert Doniger, who tells them Johnston has used their <b>quantum</b> <b>technology</b> {{to travel to}} the year 1357. Chris, Kate, and Marek agree to travel back themselves to recover him. When they arrive, though, they are immediately attacked by horsemen who kill the ITC military escorts. A grenade returns through the machine and explodes, damaging the present-day transit pad. Unable to return, Kate and Marek eventually find Johnston held by the men of Lord Oliver of Castelgard.|$|E

Precision timing, gravity sensors and imagers, cryptography, navigation, metrology, energy harvesting and recovery, biomedical sensors and imagers, and real-time optimisers all indicate the potential for <b>quantum</b> <b>technologies</b> to provide the basis of a technological revolution. From the field of Systems Engineering emerges a focused strategy for the development cycle, enabling the existence of hugely complex products. It is through the adoption of systems thinking that the semiconductor industry has achieved massive industrial and economic impact. <b>Quantum</b> <b>technologies</b> rely on delicate, non-local and/or entangled degrees of freedom - leading to great potential, but also posing new challenges to the development of products and industries.
