5000|$|The adult <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> overall {{body color}} can be {{described}} as blue to blue-green with yellow rims on its scales. Their pectoral and ventral fins are also yellow but their lips and the edges of their dorsal fins and anal fins are dark blue. <b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> are also known to have blue markings around each gill cover. Juveniles have dark blue bodies with yellow lips, gills, and tail and vertical bars ranging in color from light blue to white. The colors of the juvenile fish help them to blend in with the reefs. The <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> may live up to 15 years in the wild and reach up to 45 centimeters (17 inches) in length. <b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> are about three and a half pounds.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> feeds {{primarily}} on sponges, but also feeds on tunicates, jellyfish, and corals {{as well as}} plankton and algae. Juveniles serve as [...] "cleaners" [...] and feed on the parasites of larger fish at cleaning stations. Although in home aquariums, aquarists {{have been successful in}} providing the <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> a diet of meaty and algae based foods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> is {{considered}} to be moderate in difficulty to keep in captivity and is ill-suited for the inexperienced aquarist. They are a moderately aggressive species that require a large aquarium. Most aquarists recommend a minimum tank size anywhere from 150 on up to 180 gallons. The <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> may harass other fish, particularly similar sized angelfishes. It should be the last fish added to any system. It is not a reef safe fish, and larger specimens may nip at corals, particularly stony or soft ones, and ornamental invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Leduck Island is {{an island}} in the United States Virgin Islands, also spelled LeDuck Island, which is located 0.5 miles east of Sabbat Point in Johns Folly, {{separated}} from Saint John by the Sabbat Channel. LeDuck Island lies by the entrance to Coral Bay and is 85 feet high. Leduck Island is located within the Virgin Islands National Park {{and is one of the}} largest offshore islands to Saint John, along with Grass Cay and Congo Cay. Being home to numerous spur and groove reefs, it is a popular scuba diving destinations and its reefs are habitat for an abundance for endemic tropical fish species. Some of the fish species found here include the Fairy basslet, Sergeant major, French <b>angelfish,</b> Gray <b>angelfish,</b> <b>Queen</b> triggerfish, Jackknife-fish, Blue chromis, Schoolmaster snapper, Mangrove snapper, Red hind, Blacktip shark, Hawksbill sea turtle, Glassy sweeper, Squirrelfish, and numerous species of damsels and jacks.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Many reef fish, {{like this}} <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish,</b> {{have a body}} {{flattened}} like a pancake, with pectoral and pelvic fins that act with the flattened body to maximize manoeuvrability.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish,</b> {{grows to}} be 45 cm. With neon {{blue and yellow}} scales, with {{iridescent}} purple and orange markings, surprisingly it is not conspicuous, and actually hides very well, and is very shy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> inhabit {{reefs and}} are common near Florida, {{especially}} the Florida Keys, {{and also the}} Bahamas and the Gulf of Mexico. It is rarely seen in the Bermuda Triangle and ranges {{as far south as}} Brazil and as North as Long Island.|$|E
5000|$|... the Bermuda blue {{angelfish}} (Holacanthus bermudensis) {{usually called}} just blue angelfish, is {{a species of}} marine angelfish of the family Pomacanthidae. Holocanthus bermudensis {{should not be confused}} with Holocanthus ciliaris, or <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish,</b> despite very similar appearances. They are two separate species.|$|E
50|$|At the Parque Explora, {{teams have}} {{to view a}} digital {{animation}} of a <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish,</b> and identify the species of the same family in the aquarium. Once found, they had to report {{the number of the}} tank and the scientific name to a diver to receive the next clue.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>{{angelfish}}</b> (Holacanthus ciliaris) is {{a marine}} angelfish commonly found near reefs in the warmer {{sections of the}} western Atlantic Ocean. Other common names include blue angelfish, golden angelfish, queen angel, and yellow angelfish. Holocanthus ciliaris {{should not be confused}} with Holocanthus bermudensis, or the (Bermuda) blue angelfish, despite very similar appearances. They are two separate species.|$|E
5000|$|The Bermuda blue {{angelfish}} feeds {{primarily on}} sponges, but also feeds on tunicates, jellyfish, and corals {{as well as}} plankton and algae. Young blue angelfish eat parasites on other fish at [...] "cleaning stations". Also 95% of their diet consists on sponges. Although in home aquariums, aquarists {{have been successful in}} providing the <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> a diet of meaty and algae based foods.|$|E
50|$|The Bermuda blue {{angelfish}} {{can grow}} up to 18 inches in length. It has a large mouth and comb-like teeth. It is often collected for aquariums. This fish occasionally breeds with the <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish,</b> which {{is very similar to}} it. This hybrid is called the townsend angelfish. An adult blue angelfish can produce a loud thumping sound that warns predators and also startles divers.|$|E
5000|$|Shark species {{include the}} Caribbean reef shark, lemon shark, bull shark, tiger shark, hammerhead shark, silky shark, nurse shark, blacktip shark, {{and the great}} white shark. There are many areas of large {{tropical}} fish populations, including by Waterlemon Cay in Leinster Bay, which provides habitat for sergeant major, blue chromis, parrotfish, queen triggerfish and <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish.</b> Another island visited for its tropical fish- and bird life is Buck Island, a 19015-acre marine protected district, which offers great diversity of coral.|$|E
50|$|The yellowface {{angelfish}} {{grows to}} a maximum length of 38 cm and is laterally compressed. The mouth is just above {{the tip of the}} snout. The fins are large and rounded and are yellow, some edged with blue round the margins. The dorsal fin is set {{just in front of the}} caudal region, has a distinctive black eyespot at the base and has 13-14 spines and 16-18 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 16-18 soft rays. The scales are pale blue edged with yellow giving a reticulated pattern. The face is yellow with a dense network of brilliant blue lines on the bottom half and a plain yellow mask around the eyes. Juveniles are quite differently coloured with 6 vertical white bars separated by pale blue lines and a caudal fin barred in 2 shades of blue. The juveniles change colour gradually after reaching a length of 7 to 12 cm. This species can be confused with the <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Holacanthus ciliaris) or the blue angelfish (Holacanthus bermudensis), but both these have a completely blue face and lack the caudal eyespot.|$|E
50|$|Second is {{the patch}} reef community. Patch reefs form {{in shallow water}} (three to six meters deep), some in Hawk Channel and some on the outer reef, but mainly on White Bank between Hawk Channel and the outer reefs. Patch reefs start from corals growing on a hard bottom, but grow upward as new corals {{establish}} themselves on the skeletons of dead corals. Most {{of the structure of}} patch reefs is formed from star (Montastraea annularis, Siderastrea siderea) and brain corals (Diploria spp.). Other corals attach wherever there is an opening. Patch reefs may grow up {{to the surface of the}} water, and spread outwards. Dome-type patch reefs (such as Hen and Chickens), found in Hawk Channel and on White Bank, are round or elliptical, and are generally less than three meters high, but may reach up to nine meters high. Dome-type patch reefs are surrounded by sand which is kept clear due to browsing by long-spined sea urchins and grass-eating fish. Linear-type patch reefs are found on the outer reefs, and are linear or curved. They occur in single or multiple rows, trending the same direction as the bank reefs on the outer reefs. Linear-type patch reefs often include Elkhorn coral, which is rare on the dome-type patch reefs. As dead coral skeletons age and are weakened by the activities of boring sponges, worms, and mollusks and by wave action, parts of a patch reef may collapse. Patch reefs provide habitat for spiny lobsters and for many species of fish, including Bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), damselfish (Chromis spp.), Ocean surgeon, French and <b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Pomacanthus spp.), White, Caesar and Spanish grunts (Haemulon ssp.), Yellowtail and other snappers, Redband and Stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma ssp.), Sergeant major (Abudefduf saxatilis), Tomtate (Haemulon aurolineatum), Trumpetfish (Aulostomus maculatus), filefish, groupers, snappers, Bar jack (Caranx ruber), Great barracuda, pufferfish, squirrelfish, cardinalfish, and green morays (Gymnothorax funebris).|$|E
40|$|Cover photo: A <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Holocanthus ciliaris) swims over a {{coral reef}} off the U. S. Virgin Islands. <b>Queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> {{are one of}} the most brightly colored marine fish in the world, and are commercially {{harvested}} for the aquarium industry. They are distributed throughout the Caribbean, inhabiting coral reefs in shallow waters down to about 200 feet, feeding on a variety of invertebrates, particularly sponges. Similar to the cleaner wrasse, juvenile <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> have been known to set up cleaning stations on the reef, where larger fish gather to have parasites picked off their bodies. Adults are solitary or found in pairs, growing up to 18 inches long with a maximum lifespan of 15 years.

40|$|Research PaperThe {{saltwater}} aquarium hobby {{has increased}} dramatically {{in the last decade}} due to improvements in the technologies and knowledge needed to sustain mini-reef ecosystems. With this increased demand comes increased pressure on natural reef ecosystems that supply {{the vast majority of the}} live organisms for the commercial market. To combat high mortality rates and environmental damage that can result during collection, handling, and transport, the Marine Aquarium Council (MAC) launched a voluntary third-party certification program in November 2001. The program would ensure that certified marine ornamentals have been harvested to minimize losses and damage to the environment and that the stock is managed for sustainability. To ascertain the potential market and value of the MAC certification program, a conjoint survey of wholesalers, distributors, and retailers was conducted. Respondents were located worldwide. Species examined included <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Holacanthus ciliaris), peppermint shrimp (Lysmata wurdemanni), spotfin hogfish (Bodiamus pulchellus), and orange skunk clownfish (Amphiprion sandaracinos). These species were selected as a mix of traditionally tank-raised, collected, and those of high and low value. Characteristics included source (tank-raised, collected but not MAC-certified, or collected and MAC-certified), size, whether or not survival is guaranteed, and price. Respondents evaluated six hypothetical “products” for each species. Results were used to determine the price increase anticipated for a MAC-certified product that would allow a firm to break-even and the expected demand for MAC-certified products. Results indicate that MAC-certification would increase break-even prices from 10 to 35 percent depending on the species. However, demand is relatively low compared to uncertified species...|$|E
40|$|Reef fishes of the {{families}} Pomacanthidae (angelfish) and Chaetodontidae (butterflyfish) are popular ornamental species, intensively harvested for the aquarium trade. The impacts of such activity on intra-specific diversity and reef ecosystems are still poorly understood in the south Atlantic. In the present work, a fine-scale genetic analysis using RAPD markers was performed in distinct samples of the <b>queen</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Holacanthus ciliaris), French angelfish (Pomacanthus paru), and banded butterflyfish (Chaetodon striatus) along the Brazilian coast. Most of the genetic variation in the three species was related to intra-population diversity. However, AMOVA results demonstrated that H. ciliaris presents a subtle population structure (sigmast = 0. 132, P = 0. 003), while P. paru and C. striatus present low genetic differentiation, especially remarkable in the latter (sigmast = 0. 090, P = 0. 001 and sigmast = 0. 041, P = 0. 028, respectively). Gene flow (Nm) was also higher in C. striatus than in the angelfish species. The reported patterns of genetic differentiation contrast with the similar pelagic stage of the selected species, suggesting that larval dispersal per se is a poor predictor of population structure in these reef fishes. Ecological features coupled with biogeographic history and distinct local selective pressures might {{play a major role}} on the genetic composition of each species. Although preliminary, the present results provide a baseline for monitoring the genetic variability in these reef species. These differences in the genetic structure among co-occurring species should be taken into consideration for the conservation of eventual evolutionary units along the Brazilian Province...|$|E
