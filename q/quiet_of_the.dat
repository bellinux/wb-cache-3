5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

They also carefully integrated artillery support that was planned and registered on likely targets based on the squadron's obstacles and likely enemy approaches. The 393rd Regiment held {{the center and the}} 394th watched over the south.|$|E

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

500|$|The {{railroad}} strike carried {{implications for}} the remainder of local industry, as large amounts of goods could not be transported in or out of the city without the use of rail. As one man said, [...] "If the coal trains shall cease to carry the coal to market, the mining of coal must cease." [...] The strikers allowed some passenger trains to reach their destinations. They did not, however, allow mail to enter the city.

2500|$|After {{the success}} of The Ostrobothnians, Madetoja {{departed}} for France, staying for six months in Houilles, a small town just outside of Paris. Here, in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Parisian suburbs, Madetoja began to compose his Third Symphony, Op. 55, and upon returning to Finland in October (due to financial worries), {{his work on the}} project continued. The new symphony received its premiere in Helsinki on 8 April 1926, and although Madetoja received the usual praise, the audience and critics found the new work somewhat perplexing: with the monumental, elegiac Second Symphony having set expectations, the optimism and restraint of the Third came as a surprise, its (subsequent) significance eluding nearly everyone. Some years later, the French music writer, Henri-Claude Fantapié, described the cheerful, pastorale Third Symphony as a [...] "sinfonia Gallica" [...] in spirit and explained the premiere as thus: [...] "The listeners expected the opera [...] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem and were disappointed to hear something that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown it all, was lacking in pomposity and solemnity … the properties the majority of Finnish music-lovers always expect in a new work." [...] Nevertheless, today the Third Symphony is widely regarded as Madetoja's [...] "masterpiece", the rare Finnish symphony equal in stature to Sibelius's seven essays in the form.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, Georges Seurat, {{known as}} George in the musical, is {{sketching}} studies for his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. He announces to the audience: [...] "White, a blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring {{order to the}} whole, through design, composition, tension, balance, light and harmony." [...] He conjures up the painting's setting, a small suburban park on an island, and retains some control of his surroundings as he draws them. His longtime mistress, Dot, models for him, despite her frustration at having {{to get up early}} on a Sunday ("Sunday in the Park with George"). More park regulars begin to arrive: a quarrelsome Old Lady and her Nurse discuss how Paris is changing to accommodate a tower for the International Exposition, but the Nurse is more interested in a German coachman, Franz. The <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park is interrupted by a group of rude bathers. George freezes them with a gesture, making them the subjects of his first painting, Bathers at Asnières. The setting abruptly changes to a gallery where the painting is on display. Jules (a more successful artist friend of George's) and his wife Yvonne think George's work has [...] "No Life." [...] Back on the island, Jules and Yvonne have a short discussion with George and depart. They take their coachman Franz with them, interrupting his rendezvous with the Nurse. Dot, who has grown tired of standing still in the early morning sunlight, leaves the park mollified after George promises {{to take her to the}} Follies. George approaches the Old Lady, revealed to be his mother, and asks to draw her, but she bluntly refuses.|$|E

50|$|Franki piles {{can be used}} as {{high-capacity}} {{deep foundation}} elements without <b>the</b> necessity <b>of</b> excavation or dewatering. They are useful in conditions where a sufficient bearing soil can only be reached deeper in the ground, and are best suited to granular soil where bearing is primarily achieved from <b>the</b> densification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil around the base. They are not recommended for use in cohesive soils where compaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base is not possible.The Franki piling system is <b>the</b> <b>quietest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driven cast-in-place systems, and so is used in conditions where high noise levels could cause environmental problems.|$|R

2500|$|On 4 August 1795 in Sheffield a newly raised {{regiment}} {{complained that}} their bounties were being withheld from them. A crowd assembled in their support {{and refused to}} disperse. The Riot Act was read and the local Volunteers fired on the crowd, killing two and injuring others. Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke on 9 August: [...] "...the Volunteer corps have shewn their readiness to act in support of Law and Order, {{in a manner that}} must give great satisfaction to all those, who wish to see them maintain'd ... in the manner, in which it has ended, I trust it will be productive of good, and tend much to the future <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place". Fitzwilliam wrote on 6 October to George Ponsonby that the Foxites were supporting [...] "the most desperate system of universal subversion" [...] and could not be trusted: [...] "With my disinclination to the Ministry,with the affections I shall ever bear to the most conspicuous part of Opposition, I must...agree with my neighbours in thinking that before Opposition can be Ministers they must give to the public, security...for the maintenance of things as they are". On 8 December Pitt announced that the government was considering peace with the newly established Directory of France. The next day Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam: [...] "You are to judge, whether you ought to come down and make your Protest against this shameful and ruinous Business. You will certainly stand alone. But this is not always to stand disgraceful". Fitzwilliam gave his speech on 14 December, and said the war was [...] "of a nature different from all common wars" [...] and had commenced: ...|$|E
