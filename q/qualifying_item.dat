Traditional sequential pattern mining algorithms used the same model, i. e., finding all sequential patterns that satisfy one user-specified minimum support. However, using only one single minimum support implies that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the database. This is not often the case in real- life applications. In this paper, first we extended traditional one minimum support for all sequential patterns with multiple item supports. Second, we developed an effective algorithm called MS-PrefixSpan. Its general idea is using a conditional minimum support as a threshold to <b>qualify</b> <b>items</b> in each projected database for candidate length- 1 sequential patterns. According to each projected database the conditional minimum support is gradually adjusted to reflect the actual minimum support of each maximal sequential pattern.

The general custom (not yet a 'shall') is that new acquisitions are marked using cage code in Format 06 (17V, 1P, S), while legacy (older stuff, already owned, or purchased without the DFARS 252.211-7003 clause in the contract) is marked with DoDaac of the entity making the label, in format 06 also (7L, 1P, S).

Actual pyrotechnic device firings on spacecraft equipment or science instruments are performed when the influence of the pyros is localized and can be ignored at the system level. Full spacecraft system level shock tests, which include multiple firings of certain critical pyro devices, are conducted to verify the spacecraft design structural integrity and functions as well as to <b>qualify</b> hardware <b>items</b> which have not been previously qualified.

MÉTODOS: Questionário aplicado aos residentes, modificado de Sarker SK, Vincent C, e Darzi AW e usando-se a escala de Likert para qualificar o ítem pesquisado sobre as atitudes dos preceptores. A comparação da distribuição das respostas entre os dois hospitais foi analisada pelo teste de c² para tendências. RESULTADOS: No hospital universitário foram avaliados 12 preceptores por sete residentes. No hospital não universitário foram 11 preceptores avaliados por 13 residentes. O hospital não universitário apresentou a tendência de resposta discordante e indiferente (DC, D e I) maior que o hospital universitário. Só o resultado de uma pergunta apresentou significância estatística. Não houve diferença significativa na comparação das respostas nas demais perguntas entre os dois hospitais. CONCLUSÃO: Os hospitais apresentaram preceptoria semelhante. BACKGROUND: Medical residency is {{well known}} as the best training method after graduation. It is a moment when, in addition to receiving technical guidance, residents should also develop attitudes, ethics, and professionalism. In order for that to occur, preceptors should be prepared for their task. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the preceptorship in the Medical Residency in General Surgery program, {{in the operating room}} of a Teaching Hospital (TH) and a Non-teaching Hospital (NTH), from the viewpoint of the residents who entered in 2010 and 2011. METHODS: A questionnaire was applied to the residents, adapted from Sarker, Vincent and Darzi, and the Likert scale was used to <b>qualify</b> the survey <b>items</b> on the preceptors' attitudes. RESULTS: At the TH, 12 preceptors were evaluated by 7 residents. One of the residents did not answer the questionnaire. At the NTH, 11 preceptors were evaluated by 13 residents.

40|$|Extended SummaryINTRODUCTIONThe general aim of an {{education}} system is to raise individuals equipped with the qualifications required by the age {{in line with the}} predefined long, general and special goals. The outcomes of {{an education}} system are students' behaviors. When these behaviors are examined, it is observed that some of these behaviors are desired but insufficient while some are no desired (Baykul, 2000). One of the no desired behaviors is academic dishonesty which includes cheating and plagiarism. Cheating is defined in the Turkish Dictionary of Turkish Linguistic Society (1997) as “copy of an artistic work or a script” and “a prepared paper to be peeked during an examination in contravention of the rules” while the act of cheating is defined as “peeking a resource to answer the questions in contravention of the rules” generally in written tests. Plagiarism is defined in the Grand Turkish Dictionary (1998) as “appropriating a work partially or totally, theft of words and script, literal theft”. According to Kibler, Nuss, Paterson and Pavela (1988), academic dishonesty consists of behaviors such as cheating and plagiarism which include assistance received or given in an academic study without permission by students or borrowing another one's study by students (cited: Aluede, Omoregie and Osa-Edoh, 2006). Pavela (1978) defines plagiarism as “reproduction or adaptation of thoughts, words or statements of another author without reference as one's own original work” (cited: Aluede, Omoregie and Osa-Edoh, 2006) while Hawley (1984) defines as “a series ranging from citation without attention to translation word by word without reference” (cited by Larkham and Manns, 2002), and Harvey (1995) defines as “the act of lying, copying and theft by using the information, thoughts or words of another author without using quotation marks as one's own sentences”, and Isserman (2003) defines as “a kind of dishonesty, intellectual theft and breaking the intellectual values”, and Park (2003) defines as “literal theft and use of another's thoughts or scripts without reference (cited: Iyer and Eastman, 2006). When the research results are taken into account, why students display dishonesty behaviors becomes a significant question because academic dishonesty influences individuals' future behaviors and the level to reach the goals defined by educational institutions (Harding et. al., 2003). The reasons for academic dishonesty can be the perception of anything on internet as community goods by some students and not knowing what plagiarism or copyright means by new generation students according to Bricault (1998); considering cheating as acceptable in a society and finding refusal of a demand from a peer for cheating difficult by some students according to Schulman (1998) (cited: Moeck, 2002 : 483); ambition for grades and, thus with the pressure caused by this, {{hope to be able to}} satisfy parents according to Wein (1994); thinking to be academically accepted with high grades according to Aubrecht (1990); and considering courses not directly related to the future professional field is waste of time by some students and believing if the course is not related to the subject courses, that course is unimportant according to Harris (2001) (cited: Moeck, 2002 : 483). When the studies on academic dishonesty are examined, it is seen that academic dishonesty is not new; it frequently occurs and gradually increases in recent years (Whitley, 1998). Thus, the institutions must take precautions about academic dishonesty at the institutional and individual level and put these into implementation The Aim of the StudyAlthough there are many studies on determining at which level academic dishonesty occurs at which education level and at which countries (Iyer ve Eastman, 2006; de Lambert ve diğ, 2006; Chun-Hua ve Ling-Yu, 2007) there is no study on determining the tendency of students to the defined dishonesty behaviors in the literature. While the studies on the level of academic dishonesty behavior in related institutions are valuable, it is considered that studies on predetermining the individuals with a tendency to display such behaviors is of the same importance. From this point of view, this study tries to develop a scale to determine the tendencies of students to academic dishonesty behavior who study in universities which is one of educational institutions academic dishonesty is frequently observed. METHODScale Development Process Generating Tryout Items Firstly, the studies on academic dishonesty in the literature were examined. Then a group of students (n= 15) were asked to write an essay about academic dishonesty. As a result of the surveys, totally 40 statements, 20 of which represent high tendency (+ oriented) and 20 of which represent low tendency (- oriented), covering all dimensions of the concept of academic dishonesty were written. These statements were submitted to specialists to be examined in terms of context, clarity and similarity of statements and following the arrangements asked by the specialists, the number of statements was reduced to 25 to represent 14 high tendency (+) and 11 low tendency (-). Preparation and Implementation of Tentative Form For preparation of the tentative form of the scale, likert type scale format was taken into account. In this framework, 5 point scale was used as “completely agree”, “agree”, “indecisive”, “disagree”, “completely disagree” as choices in answers. The tentative form was applied to a group of 300 students studying in Abant İzzet Baysal University during 2006 – 2007 academic years. 38 students found to have not answered some statements or answered randomly were excluded from the study. 49, 20 % of the subjects (n= 262) were female (f= 129) while 50, 80 % were male (f= 133). 20, 99 % of the subjects were in the first grade (n= 55), 25, 95 % in the second grade (n= 68), 26, 72 % in the third grade (n= 54) and 26, 34 % in the fourth grade (n= 69). 42, 75 % of the subjects studied in the Faculty of Education (n= 112), 24, 05 % studied in the Faculty of Economic and Administrative Sciences (n= 63), 20, 60 % in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (n= 54) and 12, 60 % in the School of Physical Education and Sport (n= 33). Process and Analysis of Data The answers of the subjects to the statements given in the tentative form were scored and processed into SPSS 15. 0 package programme. During processing of answers, the positive statements were scored from 5 to 1 from “completely agree” to “completely disagree” choices while negative statements from 1 to 5 from “completely disagree” to “completely agree” choices. For determining the <b>qualified</b> <b>items</b> to be included in the final scale, two different item analysis method was used which is recommended to be used in the process of development of likert type scale (Tezbaşaran, 1997; Tavşancıl, 2006). These are the item analysis based on item-scale correlation and the item analysis based on difference of the sub-superior group averages. The construct validity of the scale was tested with explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis. The reliability of the scale was tested with internal consistency reliability estimating method (Cronbach alpha) and test-retest reliability. FINDINGSItem Analysis Item Analysis based on Item-Scale Correlation The correlation coefficients of the item score of each item and scale scores range between 0, 47 (m 9) and 0, 68 (m 23) and all the coefficients are statistically significant at a level of 0, 01. Item Analysis based on Difference of Sub-Superior Group Averages There is a statistically significant difference in score averages of answers to items of students in sub and superior groups at a level of 0, 01 for all items. Findings Related to the Validity of the ScaleConstruct Validity The construct validity of the scale was tested with the explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis. The results are given below. Explanatory Factor Analysis There are 4 factors whose eigen value is over 1. Since the eigen value difference between the first factor and other factors in terms of the eigen values is big (Kline, 1994), it is possible to say that the scale measures a certain construct as a whole. On the other hand, the values gained after conversion show that the scale has 4 factors. The total variance explained by the four factors is 53, 157 %. The number of the items in factors is 8, 7, 4 and 6 respectively. After analysis of the items in the contexts, the first factor was named “tendency towards cheating”, the second factor “tendency towards dishonesty in assignments, and studies such as projects – general”, the third “tendency towards dishonesty in the process of research and report” and the fourth factor “dishonesty tendency towards ascriptions”. Confirmatory Factor Analysis While explanatory factor analysis ensured determination of main factor related to the scale of tendency to academic dishonesty, the confirmatory factor analysis facilitated determination of the data related to the quality of the defined factors, general structure of the scale and to which level the scale explained the tendency to academic dishonesty. As a result of the analyses, the level of representation of own implicit variable of all items (observed variable) except for the 6 th, 7 th and 8 th items in the first factor was found to be meaningful at a level of 0, 05. The t values measured for these three items was lower than 1, 96 which was the critical value determined for the value of 0, 05. Therefore, considering that these three items which had a lower t value than the defined critical t value failed to represent own implicit variable, these items were removed from the model and the analyses were reiterated for 22 items taking into consideration the defined 4 factors. The analyses carried out following the removal of the related items showed that the level of representation of own implicit variable of all the items (observed variable) was statistically significant at a level of 0. 05. The t values measured for the total 22 items were higher than 1, 96. This means each item represents its own implicit variable well and thus can be included in the scale. After parameter estimations, goodness of fit indexes were reviewed which ensure evaluation of a model as a whole. It was observed that all the indexes used in this study were very close to or at the desired level. Findings Related to the Reliability of the Scale Cronbach Alpha Internal Consistency Reliability The Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients, which reveal whether all the items in each factor within the scale measured or not the desired qualification to be measured with the related factor and thus all the items under the scale as a whole, are given in table below. Alpha Reliability Coefficients of Each Factors and the Whole Scale 1 st Factor 2 nd Factors 3 rd Factor 4 th FactorWhole ScaleNumber of Items 574622 Cronbach α 0, 710, 8210, 7850, 7760, 90 According to the values given in Table, the Cronbach α internal consistency reliability coefficient of the scale is 0, 71 for the first factor; 0, 821 for the second factor; 0, 785 for the third factor; 0, 776 for the fourth factor and 0, 90 for the scale as a whole. Test-Retest Reliability The final form of the scale consisting of 22 items was applied to a group of 20 students twice at an interval of 15 days to determine the test-retest reliability level of the scale. The correlation coefficient between the results obtained from two applications was found to be 0, 88. CONCLUSIONAs a result of the item analysis carried out in line with the item-scale correlation (r) on the data obtained from the tentative implementation, all items were found to be significant at a level of 0. 01. This finding can be interpreted as that the qualification measured by each item within the scale is the same as the one measured by the scale as a whole. Accordingly, all the items subjected to tentative implementation may be included in the final scale. As a result of the item analysis carried out based on the differences of sub-superior group averages (t test) over the data obtained from the tentative implementation, all the items showed a meaningful difference at a level of 0, 01. This finding means that each item can well differentiate between the ones which have the qualifications and those which do not have the qualifications desired to be measured with that item. According to these results, all the items subjected to tentative implementation may be included in the final scale. The explanatory factor analysis carried out to test the construct validity of the scale show that the scale has 4 factors. The first factor includes 8 items, the second includes 7, the third includes 4 and the fourth factor has 6 items. After review of the structures of the items of the defined factor, these factors were named “tendency towards cheating”, “tendency towards dishonesty in assignments and studies such as projects – general”, “tendency towards dishonesty in the process of research and report” and “dishonesty tendency towards ascriptions” respectively. The total variance explained by the defined four factors is at an acceptable level of 53, 157 %. The main factors related to the scale of tendency to academic dishonesty were defined with the explanatory factor analysis while the confirmatory factor analysis facilitated determination of the data related to the quality of the defined factors, general structure of the scale and to which level the scale explained the tendency to academic dishonesty. As a result of the analyses, 6 th, 7 th and 8 th items in the first factor were removed from the scale since they did not have the required qualifications. The final scale consisted of 22 items, 5 of which in the first factor, 7 of which in the second, 4 of which in the third and 6 of which in the fourth factor. The internal consistency reliability coefficients of the scale is at an acceptable level both for each factor and the scale as a whole and it is possible to say that the scale has the internal consistency reliability. The coefficient obtained for the test-retest reliability shows that the scale yielded stable measurement results. In line with these results, it is possible to say that the developed scale can measure the tendencies of university students to academic dishonesty...|$|R
