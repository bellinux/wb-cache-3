The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can say about this film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. <b>Quite</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E

This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, he said, although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It {{became one of the}} favorite albums for English musician Richard Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. [...] "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told The Quietus. Along with On the Corner, it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication. In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences [...] "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the [...] "fringes of jazz" [...] and a place most other music has not explored since. In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album to be inarguably the [...] "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" [...] and declared [...] "there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music." ...|$|E

He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting {{that if the}} Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him {{no more than three}} months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that [...] "Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less."
