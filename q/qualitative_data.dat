The paper describes two stages in the analytic process: first, the forging of a case history from a longitudinal archive and second, bringing case histories into conversation with each other. The paper emphasises two aspects of a <b>qualitative</b> longitudinal <b>data</b> set: the longitudinal dimension that privileges the individual case, and the cross sectional dimension that privileges the social and the spatial context. It is argued that both aspects should always be kept in play in analysis. The paper concludes by reflecting on the ethical and practical challenges associated with the case history approach, heightened by the growing demand to archive and share <b>qualitative</b> longitudinal <b>data</b> sets...|$|R

25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> <b>data</b> {{analysis}} contains reviewing, summarizing, generalizing {{and interpreting}} data {{in an appropriate}} and accurate way. It is to describe and explain the phenomena or social worlds being studied. One {{of the most important}} steps in the qualitative research process is analysis of data. Analyzing <b>qualitative</b> <b>data</b> also requires researchers’ patience. There are two different analytical procedures: Meaning and discovery-Focused approaches. Meaning-focused approaches emphasize meaning comprehension. In other words, try to understand the subjective meaning of experiences for the participants, instead of placing those meanings into researchers’ own conceptions. Discovery-focused techniques aim to establish patterns and connections among elements of data. However, no matter which procedure is used, it is essential to apply an effective system for retrieving data because of the identity of <b>qualitative</b> <b>data</b> analysis, which is exploring data progressively.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, <b>qualitative</b> <b>data</b> {{can be used}} to {{strengthen}} quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, quasi-experimental) in particular. For example, in educational psychology, researchers could conduct a qualitative pilot study to determine which group of students should be selected for quantitative study by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E

25|$|Easton {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the “first generation of behavioral revolutionaries” in the discipline of political science. Like other early behavioralists, Easton initially sought to gain control over the masses of data being generated by social science research in the early 1950s, which they thought was overwhelming social scientists with quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>data</b> {{in the absence of an}} organizing theoretical framework. Easton argued for development of a proper science of political studies that would produce reliable, universal knowledge about social phenomena, and that the purpose of scientific rules of procedure was to make possible the discovery of a highly generalized theory of politics. Easton’s vision was one of a “general theory” of political science that would consist of a deductive system of thought so that a limited number of postulates, as assumptions and axioms, a whole body of empirically valid generalizations might be deduced in descending order of specificity and provide predictive causal explanations of political behavior.|$|E
