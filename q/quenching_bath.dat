40|$|A new {{finite element}} model is {{developed}} to predict the deformations, stresses, phase compositions and carbon concentration gradients that arise {{as a consequence of}} the physical processes involved in a carburization and quenching process of a large steel gear. Firstly, the diffusion of carbon at elevated temperatures in the austenitic range is studied in a diffusion model. Secondly, the calculated carbon concentration distribution is used as an input for a model that couples the thermal, metallographic and mechanical effects during the quenching process and calculates the evolution of the temperature, phase composition and deformation history at any point in the gear. Two effects typical for oil quenching of large gears are incorporated in the model. The first is the influence of the gear’s own weight while hanging on chains before, during and after entering the quench bath. The second is the three-dimensional effect that it takes time between the moment the gear enters the oil <b>quenching</b> <b>bath</b> and the moment when the gear is fully immersed. The non-uniform temperature distribution over the gear’s axis causes a non-homogeneous plastic deformation.

In turn, the hydrodynamic behavior {{in the vicinity of}} quench probes depends on the probe geometry and the physical properties of the <b>quench</b> <b>bath.</b> Building on previous findings, in this work we report CFD simulations of the pressure and velocity fields, as well as the streamlines, in the vicinity of cylindrical probes of various geometries. In particular, flat-end, conical-end, hemispherical-end and chamfered cylindrical probes were studied. The simulations were carried out for probes located concentrically in a cylindrical tube with water flowing parallel to the probe longitudinal axis. The system was assumed to be isothermal in order to separate the hydrodynamic from the thermal effects. To validate the model, cellophane ribbons were attached to the probe end in order to trace the streamlines near that region; the cellophane position was compared to the computed streamlines. Previously, the optimum water temperature required to obtain a faithful visualization using the ribbons was determined.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the heat}} {{transfer}} phenomena {{that take place}} during the industrial process of quenching are studied and modeled. This work incorporates into the modeling scheme of quenching {{the dynamics of the}} <b>quenching</b> <b>bath,</b> specially, the resolution of the flow near the treated piece and the thermal interaction of the fluid with the piece. Due to the high initial temperatures involved during the process, a multiphase liquid/vapor flow has to be taken into consideration. The vaporization of the fluid is incorporated in the heat transfer mechanisms and in the fluid dynamics of the flow. To describe the cooling of the piece, the thermal problem of the solid has to be solved coupled along the evolution of the multiphase flow. This approach requires the resolution of a much more complex problem than the heat equation of a solid. The increased complexity of the pursued approach affects the modeling, implementation and numerical aspects of the simulation. In order to select the most convenient multiphase flow model, the analysis of characteristic times, couplings between phases and non-dimensional numbers, was performed. The model that retains all the relevant dynamics of the problem at an affordable numerical and modeling cost, is the drift-flux mixture model. For this model, the multiphase flow is treated as a mixture of both phases with a kinematic relationship to describe the relative velocities between phases. In addition to the multiphase approach to describe the bath dynamics, a heat partition model is proposed to incorporate all the different heat transfer mechanisms. The model is set up based on different models independently generated. In this work, a variety of models are combined to describe the heat transfer from the very high temperature conditions (film boiling) up to single phase convection. The heat transfer models were adapted and/or fitted to be applied for oil as quenching liquid. To calibrate the models, a set of physical experiments over a standard probe was performed. The cooling rates and total heat fluxes were obtained from the tests, and based on these results, the heat transfer models were calibrated. To obtain the cooling rate curves from the rather scattered experimental measures, a non-linear diffusion filter was implemented. The use of this type of filter is a novel application for this type of problems and the obtained results are smoother than the ones obtained by current techniques. The total heat flux was obtained from the resolution of the inverse heat transfer problem for the standard tests. The inverse problem was solved by the iterative resolution of the direct problem with a correction function obtained from the comparison of the experimental and numerical cooling rate curves. The cost function of the inverse problem is based on the error of the cooling rate curves instead of temperature records. The iterative method to solve the inverse heat transfer problem {{and the use of the}} error of the cooling rate as cost function are two novel methods developed in this work. Once the experimental total heat flux was obtained for the set of tested conditions, the calibration of the heat transfer model was performed. The models for each mechanism and the blending functions responsible to generate transitions between them were fitted based on nominal values of the flow. This calibration gave place to a set of correlations sensitive to nominal (non local) conditions of quenching (mainly oil temperature and velocity), therefore any condition among the tests can be interpolated from these results. The model was setup for a given oil. For the standard tests performed over a vertical cylinder, the comparison between the numerical and experimental results is very satisfactory. The heat partition model was adapted to be sensitive to local values of the flow, in addition to the vapor fraction that surrounds the piece, being this feature a novel approach in this type of model. This model was incorporated into the multiphase simulation framework and some conditions were tested. For the standard tests, it was observed that both models (correlations and multiphase) yield similar results. Tests performed on non-standard probes were performed. The probe contained a stagnation point at its middle height. The tests consisted on the immersion of the probe in two different positions of the stagnation point compared to the flow direction. Experimentally, noticeable differences between orientations were found. The correlation models weren't able to capture this difference, while the multiphase heat transfer model capture it in a qualitative way. This is one of the first (if not the first one) application of a multiphase model to describe the heat transfer during quenching of pieces of complex geometries. A deep understanding of the involved physics and limitations of the applied models and numerical implementation are discussed. Several proposals to improve the behavior of the developed model are presented as future work...|$|E

The work reported here for the 6 FDA-DAM polyimide provides insight for the challenging fabrication of defect-free asymmetric hollow fiber membranes for this class of 6 FDA-polyimides, which behave rather different from lower free volume polymers. Specifically, the 6 FDA based materials show relatively slow phase separation rate in water <b>quench</b> <b>baths,</b> which presents a challenge for fiber spinning. For convenience, we refer to the behavior as more "non-solvent resistant" in comparison to other lower free volume polymers, since the binodal phase boundary is displaced further from the conventional position near the pure polymer-solvent axis on a ternary phase diagram in conventional polymers like Matrimid® and Ultem®. The addition of lithium nitrate to promote phase separation has a useful impact on 6 FDA-DAM asymmetric hollow fiber formation. 6 FDA-DAM phase diagrams using ethanol and water as non-solvent are reported, and {{it was found that}} water is less desirable as a non-solvent dope additive for defect-free fiber spinning.

A particular focus {{of the project was}} understanding how the strength and electrical conductivity of the composite are related to its microstructure in the hope that a conducting material with light weight, high strength, and high electrical conductivity can be developed to produce overhead high-voltage power transmission cables. The current power transmission cables (e. g., Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced (ACSR)) have acceptable performance for high-voltage AC transmission, but are less well suited for high-voltage DC transmission due to the poorly conducting core materials that support the cable weight. This Al/Ca composite was produced by powder metallurgy and severe plastic deformation by extrusion and swaging.

40|$|Heat-treating {{of solid}} alloy {{cylinders}} and tubes {{is an important}} practical problem for which no optimal production methods have been developed, {{especially in terms of}} the most crucial quenching stage. This study explores the use of spray quenching {{as an alternative to the}} commonly used <b>bath</b> <b>quenching,</b> which is known to yield relatively slow quench rates and provide few options for spatial optimization of cooling rate. A carefully configured spray cooling system is examined, which provides maximum coverage of the surface of a solid alloy cylinder and that of an alloy tube with full-cone pressure sprays. A new analytical model is derived to determine the shape and size of the spray impact zone, as well as the distribution of volumetric flux across the curved surface of the cylinder and tube. This distribution is combined with heat transfer correlations for all spray boiling regimes to generate a local boiling curve for every location across the impact surface. Using these boiling curves as boundary conditions, a transient analysis is conducted for aluminum alloy and steel cylinders and tubes. Increasing the nozzle pressure drop or decreasing the orifice-to-surface distance are shown to hasten the exit from the poor film boiling regime to the more efficient transition boiling regime, resulting in a quicker quench. Relatively high thermal diffusivity causes faster transmission of the spray cooling effect through the curved surface and milder temperature gradients in aluminum compared to steel. This also causes the outer surface to cool earlier but deeper points much slower for steel. Large temperature gradients are encountered on the surface during the quench because of different boiling regimes occurring at different locations exposed to the spray. This study highlights several practical advantages of spray <b>quenching</b> compared with <b>bath</b> <b>quenching,</b> including the ability to achieve a wide range of fast quench rates, uniformity and predictability of quench rate, and the ability to predict and guard against imperfections caused by thermal stresses. ...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{sampling}} and analysis techniques were applied to study the morphology and composition of pot exhaust particles from aluminium smelters. In this study the total spectrum of pot exhaust particles from prebake electrolysis cells was sampled on filters and in a standard cyclone. Application of a cascade impactor allowed for fractionation of raw gas dust into 12 fractions with particle diameters {{in the range from}} approximately 7 nm to 10 μm. The performed experiments demonstrated that the proposed methodology for {{sampling and}} analysis was useful to link changes in operational conditions to changes in particulate emissions. Alumina feeding proved to {{have a significant impact on}} emissions. The major part of the particulate emissions form the cells consisted of rather clean sodium fluoroaluminates in the sub-micron range, while a smaller amount of coarse particles contained the major part of the impurities (except S, K, and Pb). The sub-micron particles consisted mainly of <b>quenched</b> <b>bath</b> fumes typical for cryolite-based melts containing considerable amounts of NaAlF 4. Sulphur, potassium, and lead were the only impurity elements accumulating in the fines with approximately 6. 0, 0. 6, and 0. 1 wt%, respectively. Coarse particles represented the minor fraction in the pot exhaust but contained large amounts of impurities. The impurity content in particulate pot emissions increaseed rapidly with increasing particle diameters D i > 1 μm. The coarse particles originated most probably from the alumina feedstock, bath-cover material, electrolyte droplets and remains from anode consumption entrained into the off-gases by e. g. bubble burst due to gas evolution under alumina feeding and CO 2 release. The ICP-MS element analysis as well as IR, XPS and XRD-analysis results indicated that scale samples (depositions found in gas treatment centres) consisted of considerable amounts of coarse pot exhaust particulates. Additions of AlF 3 -solutions to coarse pot exhaust particles at 110 °C changed the crystal structure as cryolite and NaAlF 4 particles were recrystallized. The observations suggest hydrolysis and recrystallization as possible scale formation mechanisms. As proven in this work, impurities were concentrated to about 2. 3 wt% (Ni, Fe, P, V, Ti, Co, Cu, Zn, and Ga) in pot exhaust particles with an EPA standard cyclone operated with a cut-size of 11 μm. Removing the coarse particles with diameters larger than approximately 10 μm (14 wt% of the total dust) from the raw gas reduced trace elements in the remaining particles by approximately 25 %, while carbon and sulphur were reduced by 47 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. Based on these results it is claimed that removal of coarse particles (approximately 4 - 5 kg dust/metric ton Al) from the raw gas will prevent recycling of significant amounts of contaminants in the dry scrubbers, thereby improve current efficiency and metal quality. Still, the recycling of valuable fluoride from separated coarse fractions, the role of sulphur in the ultra-fines as well as the recrystallisation of particulate emissions have to be addressed in further work.

50|$|Martempering {{is similar}} to austempering, in that the steel is <b>quenched</b> in a <b>bath</b> of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in martempering, {{the goal is to}} create {{martensite}} rather than bainite. The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite start temperature. The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any bainite can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the martempered steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{solution was}} obtained for a transient phase-change heat transfer problem in thawing of frozen food. In the physical model, a sphere originally at a uniform temperature below the phase-change temperature is suddenly {{immersed in a}} fluid at a temperature above the phase-change temperature. As the body temperature increases, the phase-change interface will be first formed on the surface. Subsequently, the interface will absorb the latent heat and move towards the centre until the whole body undergoes complete phase change. In the mathematical formulation, the nonhomogeneous problem arises from the moving phase-change interface. The solution {{in terms of the}} time-dependent temperature field was obtained by use of Green's function. A one-step Newton-Raphson method was specially designed to solve for the position of the moving interface to satisfy the interface condition. The theoretical results were compared with numerical results generated by a finite difference model and experimental measurements collected from a cold water thawing process. As a good agreement was found, the theoretical solution developed in this study was verified numerically and experimentally. Besides thawing of frozen food, there are many other practical applications of the theoretical solution, such as food freezing, soil freezing/thawing, metal casting and <b>bath</b> <b>quenching</b> heat treatment, among others. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper dwells on {{the nature}} of the highly {{non-linear}} interactions occurring during heat treatments with the aim of developing an improved understanding of the process and of the residual strains and stresses formed in heat-treated components during processing. As an example, two industrial quench processes are analysed. A general analytical strategy is presented to study not only these processes, but is formulated in such a way that it may also be extended to other thermomechanical processes. This strategy may therefore serve as a roadmap for industrial designers to analyse thermomechanical processes for optimization. Results in the broad framework of thermomechanical processing indicate that careful characterization and correct representation of the heat transfer conditions leads to significant improvements in accuracy over the current quench modelling techniques. In addition to this, the nature of the thermomechanics involved in spray and <b>bath</b> <b>quench</b> processes is analysed. Neutron diffraction experiments and finite element analyses indicate that the use of water sprays reduces the depth of permanent deformation in quenched components compared to those treated in a water bath. It is shown that this is a direct consequence of the rewetting condition. Understanding the processes involved enables the processing engineer to perform optimization studies of the thermomechanical process, before processing. This ultimately allows production of engineering components with superior mechanical properties, reduced distortion and well-controlled beneficial residual stress states. © 2009 IMechE...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} Medium Carbon steel {{is well known}} now days. It has got such a variety of uses in {{distinctive}} commercial ventures because of its moderately low cost and great mechanical properties. The failure due to cyclic loading or dynamic loading is a crucial topic {{in the field of}} mechanical behaviour of materials since cyclic loading counts about ninety percent of the failures resulted from mechanical causes. In this work the cyclic loading behaviour of Medium Carbon Steel has been studied. The properties of steel are greatly influenced by various heat treatment techniques and tempering is the most common and important heat treatment technique. In the present work the effect of tempering on microstructure, tensile properties, hardness and most importantly on cyclic loading behaviour has been studied. The emphasis is given to the endurance limit. Attempts have been made to find out the best set of tempering conditions. The Medium Carbon Steel specimens were first austenitized at 850 oC, hold for 1 hr for soaking and then <b>quenched</b> in water <b>bath</b> maintained at room temperature. The quenched specimens were then tempered at three different temperatures 200 oC, 400 oC and 600 oC the duration of tempering treatment was 60 min., 90 min., and 120 min. for all of the above temperatures. Attempts have been made to correlate the microstructure with the mechanical properties of Medium Carbon Steel. The cyclic loading test was carried out in R. R. Moore Rotating Beam Testing Machine with a completely reversed stress pattern. Here the maximum stress and minimum stress are equal in magnitude but opposite in sense so the stress ratio i. e. the ratio of maximum stress to minimum stress becomes R= - 1, the mean stress becomes zero. From this work, it may be concluded that tempering significantly improves the mechanical properties as well as the fatigue life of the material, and the best results have been seen for low temperature tempering at 200 oC, for 60 min...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 capture from flue gases by {{membrane}} technology in post combustion power plants {{could be used}} for the reducing of CO 2 emissions. Previous work has demonstrated that the carbon membrane can achieve a high separation performance with respect to high CO 2 permeability and selectivity over the other gases, such as N 2 and O 2. The focus of the current work was to find a low-cost precursor and develop a simple process for the preparation of high performance hollow fiber carbon membranes (HFCMs) for CO 2 separation. The cellulose acetate (CA) hollow fibers were spun from a dope solution of CA / Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) / N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) (22. 5 % / 5 % / 72. 5 %) using an optimal spinning condition: bore fluid (water + NMP (85 %)), air gap (25 mm), bore flow rate (40 % of dope flow rate) and temperature of <b>quench</b> <b>bath</b> (50 °C). The cellulosic hollow fibers, regenerated from the spun CA fibers by deacetylation, were used as the precursors for preparation of HFCMs. The experimental results indicated that the precursors would influence significantly the separation performances of the prepared HFCMs. Therefore, the deacetylation process needed to be optimized, and the optimal deacetylation condition was found to be: soaking CA hollow fibers in a 10 % glycerol solution for 24 h, and then treated by immersion in a 0. 075 M NaOH (96 % ethanol) solution for 2 h. The carbonization parameters were also found to affect the separation properties of the HFCMs significantly. The carbonization condition was optimized based on an orthogonal experimental design method and statistical analysis. The optimal carbonization procedure was found to be: CO 2 as purge gas, a final temperature of 823 K, a heating rate of 4 K/min and a final soak time of 2 h (CO 2 - 823 K- 4 K/min- 2 h), and the importance of the investigated carbonization parameters was sorted out with respect to their influence on carbon membrane separation performances. The order of importance for the carbonization parameters was found to be: purge gas > final temperature > heating rate > final soak time. It was hence concluded that the purge gas was the most important parameter affecting the final carbon membrane performance, and CO 2 was found to be the most effective purge gas for preparation of the high performance cellulosic derived carbon membranes. A symmetric structure for the prepared HFCMs with a typical thickness of 25 um was identified from the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images, and a great shrinkage compared to the precursor could be seen. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra showed the decomposition and break down of the chemical groups in precursors in various carbonization environments, leading to the release of volatile gases. A typical d-spacing of the carbon membranes was found to be 4 A from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization. CO 2 and N 2 adsorption equilibrium isotherms were obtained by the gravimetric sorption measurements. A higher adsorption affinity of CO 2, obtained by fitting the experimental data using Langmuir-Freundlich model, indicated that CO 2 is more adsorbable than N 2. Two type of hollow fiber carbon membrane (HFCM-A and HFCM-B) has been prepared in the current work. The micropore volume and average pore size for the carbon membrane HFCM-B are around 0. 17 cm 3 /g and 5. 6 A, respectively, which are slightly larger than that of the HFCM-A (0. 15 cm 3 /g and 5. 2 A). The kinetic rate constants were also determined from the CO 2 kinetic adsorption experiments, and the higher kinetic rate constant of HFCM-B indicates the more open structure. Gas permeation tests were conducted with single gases (H 2, CO 2, O 2, N 2 and CH 4) as well as gas mixtures. The single gas permeation tests confirmed that the permeability values decreased with increasing kinetic diameter of the gas molecules, which indicated that the molecular sieving mechanism was dominating in the carbon membrane separation processes. The results also showed that the kinetic diameter had a larger effect than the Lennard-Jones well depth, which indicated that the diffusion was dominated by a molecular sieving process and that the sorption had relatively little influence. The gas permeability increased with temperature due to the activated transport process for the molecular sieve mechanism. The gas molecules with larger activation energy (e. g. CH 4 and N 2) were affected by the temperature more significantly, comparing to that with lower activation energy (e. g. CO 2). The strongly adsorbed CO 2 showed a more significant decrease of permeability with pressure compared to N 2, reflecting a stronger concentration dependence for the diffusion coefficient of CO 2. The gas permeability decreased with the presence of water vapor which might be caused by the pore blocking. The aging test results indicated that the permeability of carbon membrane decreased over time when exposed to air, and needed to be regenerated. The gas mixture measurements showed that the significant effects of the operating parameters, especially the feed pressure, on the membrane performance based on the fractional factorial design method and statistical analysis. Therefore, the operating conditions need to be optimized for the specific applications. The single stage membrane processes for CO 2 capture from flue gases with feed compression, permeate evacuation, and their combination were investigated using Aspen HYSYS simulation tool integrated with an in-house membrane simulation model called ChemBrane. The simulation results indicated that the single stage membrane process could not achieve high CO 2 purity and CO 2 recovery simultaneously using these HFCMs. The plotted characteristic diagrams could be easily used to identify the required operating conditions and membrane areas to accomplish specific targets for a given separation process. A two stage membrane system was also designed for the evaluation of process feasibility, and the simulation results indicated that a CO 2 purity of 90 % and a recovery of 80 % could be achieved by optimizing of the process conditions. Although the cost of carbon membranes is still unknown, the membrane/module cost could be greatly reduced by further improving the membrane separation performance (especially increasing the gas permeance by reducing the wall thickness of HFCMs) and simplifying the membrane production process. The capital cost estimation for two-stage cascade membrane process indicated that the potential application for carbon membrane technique could be promising compared to chemical absorption.

40|$|Present {{investigation}} {{is carried out}} to determine the relation between microstructural aspects and wear properties of spheroidal graphite (SG) cast iron material {{to be used for}} production of automotive parts such as gears, camshafts and cylinder pistons. SG cast iron due to its better damping capacity, strength to weight ratio, elongation and tribological properties is the most preferable and widely used material among all type of cast irons. The considerable amount of ductility achieved in SG cast iron is due to the spherical form of graphite rather than flakes as present in grey cast iron which eliminates the stress concentration effect when subjected to different loading conditions and for which it is preferred in automotive parts manufacturing. In order to determine the optimum wear resistance of SG cast iron, the current investigation involves annealing, normalizing, quench & tempering and austempering heat treatments leading to transformation of as-cast matrix to ferritic, pearlitic, tempered martensitic and coarse upper bainitic matrices respectively. Specimens with varying alloying elements were austenitized to 1000 °C for 90 minutes, followed by furnace cooling, air cooling, oil and salt <b>bath</b> <b>quenching</b> followed by air cooling for respective heat treatments. Vickers hardness test (at 20 Kg applied load) & dry sliding wear test were performed under 20 N, 40 N & 60 N for a distance of 7. 54 m using Vickers hardness tester & ball-on-plate wear tester respectively. The quench tempered specimen for alloy SG- 02 has maximum hardness whereas in case of alloy SG- 01 normalized specimen has maximum hardness, the first one has tempered martensitic and second one has pearlitic matrix. The lowest hardness was obtained for annealed specimen having ferritic matrix for both the alloys, whereas the hardness values of other specimen were in between these two for respective alloys. There was not much difference in hardness of ferritic, pearlitic and bainitic matrices, but marginal difference was observed in as-cast and tempered martensitic matrices. The reason for this difference is attributed to the fact that in as-cast condition alloy SG- 01 (higher hardness) has bull’s eye ferritic/pearlitic matrix, whereas that of alloy SG- 02 is fully ferritic resulting lower hardness. For quench & tempered as well as austempered specimens alloy SG- 01 has lower hardness value than alloy SG- 02 because of presence of more C, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo and Si. These elements may cause strengthening of solid solution of ferrite in ductile cast iron. When operating under 20 N load weight gain was observed in every specimen due to the formation of oxides over the worn surface, whereas no such phenomenon was observed for 40 N and 60 N. The major wear mechanism observed in softer matrix phases were adhesive type signified by delamination layers over graphite nodules while in the harder phase wear rate decreases because of plastic deformation...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the microstructures of different matrix samples and correlate to the wear system response by varying matrix microstructure. SG iron {{is used for the}} production of different automobile parts such as camshaft and gears. SG iron is most important member among different members of cast iron family due to its high strength, toughness together with ductility. The main reason of this high ductility is presence of nodular structure of graphite that is present in it unlike present in grey cast iron as the flakes. In grey cast iron, stress concentration is high at the corners of these flakes but has been removed in the case of spheroidal graphite cast iron with the nodular shape. As a result of this its ductility increases along with toughness. In order to obtain the optimum wear resistance of SG cast iron, the current investigation involves annealing, normalizing, quench & tempering and austempering heat treatments leading to transformation of as-cast matrix to ferritic, pearlitic, tempered martensitic and coarse upper bainitic matrices respectively. Specimens having different alloying elements were austenitized to 1000 °C for soaking time 90 min, followed by furnace cooling, air cooling, oil and salt <b>bath</b> <b>quenching</b> followed by air cooling for respective heat treatments. Vickers hardness test was conducted over the samples under 20 Kg followed by wear test was carried over DUCOM TR- 208 M 1 ball on plate type wear monitor under 10 N, 30 N and 50 N loads respectively in dry sliding condition for the sliding distance of 7. 54 m with the speed 0. 063 m/s. The hardness was maximum for quenched & tempered specimen in case of SG- 02 samples due to presence of tempered martensitic matrix phase while, in case of SG- 01, normalized specimen has maximum hardness due to presence of pearlitic matrix phase. The lowest hardness was observed to be for annealed sample with ferritic matrix phase. On the other hand hardness of ferritic, pearlitic and bainitic matrices was observe to be in between these range, also marginal difference was observed in as-cast and tempered martensitic matrices. The cause of this difference is that in as-cast specimen of iv SG- 01 has bull’s eye ferritic/pearlitic matrix which may cause its hardness increases, whereas in case of as-cast sample of SG- 02 fully ferritic phase is obtained as a result of which hardness decreases. For quench & tempered as well as austempered specimens of SG- 01 has lower hardness value in comparison of that of in SG- 02 because of more percentage of C, Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo and Si in SG- 02 specimens that has tendency of strengthening solid solution of ferrite in ductile cast iron. It was observe that when sample of as-cast specimen subjected to load in between 10 N- 20 N it lost its weight continuously, while with increase in load to 30 N subsequently weight gain was observe. This weight gain is due to the formation of oxide layer. There was no weight loss or gain observe for normalized specimen however in case of austempered specimen weight gain was observe for 20 N and 30 N due to formation of oxide which can be investigated by means of EDAX analysis. Finally it has been concluded that for the samples having ferritic, pearlitic, bainitic matrices phase, adhesive wear is main wear mechanism along with shallow pits are produced due to delamination and deposited over the sites where graphite nodules have already formed before...|$|R
