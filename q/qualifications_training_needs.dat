40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} determining appropriate provider qualifications {{in a variety of}} adventure settings, in which adventure-based activities are used, but particularly the <b>qualifications</b> and <b>training</b> <b>needs</b> of adventure therapists. The model is {{based on the premise that}} the skill and educational needs of providers increase with the physical and emotional risk associated with adventure activities, with the increased needs of participants, and with program goals. Adventure-based activities are utilized with a variety of populations ranging from emotionally healthy to emotionally unstable. Program goals can reflect recreation, education/enrichment, adjunctive, or therapeutic goals, which require different levels of skills in providers. This model suggests that many people will have the basic educational and technical background needed to provide services to low-risk populations, who are engaged in recreational or educational activities with little or no risk. Few providers will have th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The European industry, {{especially}} {{mechanical engineering}} industry, has lost {{step by step}} its competitiveness {{in the years that}} followed the global crisis. Implementing new management approaches that sustain the strategic objectives of the company is part of the solution for recovering the lost market share. One of the important issues that influence the reaching of the organizationâ€™s strategic objectives regards the <b>qualification</b> and the <b>training</b> <b>needs</b> of its employees. In the present paper coaching was used to develop a competencies development matrix (CDM) that responds to a Romanian company strategy. The matrix was used to define the <b>training</b> <b>needs</b> and the first stage of prioritization of the competencies development for the company (technical and management CDMs). The results are going to be used in the next step of coaching within the company and are also useful for the industrial management specialists in the process of competencies defining, prioritizing and modelling in mechanical engineering...|$|R

40|$|The lack {{of skilled}} workers {{is one of}} the key {{challenges}} faced by call centre (CC) managers in the local industry, particularly with the shift towards more knowledge intensive work. CC's are one of the fastest growing service sector occupations, but concerns have arisen about the sustainability of the industry due to the inability to fill higher skilled jobs. This paper explores the role that perception plays in defining the value of training and development experiences in CC's. Questionnaires and focus groups conducted in ten CC's show that whilst employees are in fact gaining skills due to their employment, training programs are yet to be widely formalised and frequently have little connection to industry standards and <b>qualifications.</b> Furthermore, while <b>training</b> <b>needs</b> have increased due to ICT, and work has become more knowledge intensive, the invisible elements of work associated with simultaneously managing customer service, work queues and technology fail to be recognised. Hence, the questions raised concern whether employee perception can influence the value of the training and development experience in call centres...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine: (1) what attempts colleges and universities in Georgia had made to facilitate a successful college exit (i. e. a baccalaureate degree or completion of a prescribed segment of course work sufficient for job <b>qualification</b> or additional <b>training</b> <b>needed</b> in connection with a vocational choice) of educationally inferior students who, upon entrance, failed to meet the traditional entrance requirements; (2) whether provisions of this type differed between historically white and historically black institutions; and (3) whether there was any difference between state supported and private institutions in those provisions. A questionnaire constructed to obtain information on changes made and the procedures used to help educationally disadvantaged students successfully to exit from college was sent to 23 colleges and universities in Georgia, of whom 17 responded. Fourteen of these used GPA's, SAT scores, a predicted equation, or high school class rank in their standard admission criteria. Institutions indicating change or addition to their admissions procedure did admit students not meeting the standard requirements, generally on a probationary basis. The majority of institutions did not provide any further aid or support to these students. (AF...|$|R
