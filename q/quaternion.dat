25|$|In 1878 Elements of Dynamic was {{published}} by William Kingdon Clifford.

40|$|Though Combination of <b>Quaternions</b> and matrix {{has been}} a popular tool in {{skeletal}} animation for more than 20 years, classical <b>quaternions</b> are restricted to the representation of rotations.

In fact, Algorithms based on dual <b>quaternions</b> show better properties than those based on <b>quaternions,</b> including increased computational efficiency, reduced overhead and coordinate invariance. In this paper we show how to generalize established techniques for <b>quaternions</b> to dual <b>quaternions</b> to include all rigid transformations, and implement real-time character animation with dual <b>quaternions</b> under the platform of OpenGL in order to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of dual <b>quaternions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Dual <b>quaternions</b> give a {{neat and}} succinct way to {{encapsulate}} both translations and rotations into a unified representation {{that can easily}} be concatenated and interpolated. Unfortunately, the combination of <b>quaternions</b> and dual numbers seem quite abstract and somewhat arbitrary when approached for the first time. Actually, the use of <b>quaternions</b> or dual numbers separately are already seen as a break in mainstream robot kinematics, {{which is based on}} homogeneous transformations. This paper shows how dual <b>quaternions</b> arise in a natural way when approximating 3 D homogeneous transformations by 4 D rotation matrices. This results in a seamless presentation of rigid-body transformations based on matrices and dual <b>quaternions</b> which permits building intuition about the use of <b>quaternions</b> and their generalizations.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize {{established}} techniques and blending algorithm for <b>quaternions</b> to dual <b>quaternions</b> {{to include all}} rigid transformations, and implement real-time character animation with dual <b>quaternions</b> under the platform of OpenGL.

25|$|This {{suggests}} that the usual split of a <b>quaternion</b> into scalar and vector parts would be better represented as a split into scalar and bivector parts; if this is done the <b>quaternion</b> product is merely the geometric product.

25|$|Oliver Heaviside in England and Josiah Willard Gibbs, a {{professor}} at Yale University in Connecticut, also felt that <b>quaternion</b> methods were too cumbersome, often requiring the scalar or vector part of a result to be extracted.
