40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} to design of stable tile-effect-free multiresolutional image compression schemes. Rather than discussing convergence and other formal mathematical properties of multiresolutional analysis, the paper focuses on how <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> in decomposition coefficients affect the quality of the decompressed picture, how the errors propagate in a multiresolutional decomposition, and how to design a compression scheme where the effect of <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> is minimized (visually and quantitatively). The paper also {{introduces a}}nd analyzes the simplest family of Laplacian pyramids which yield multiresolutional piecewise-linear image decompositions. The error propagation analysis presented in the paper has lead to discovery of particular Laplacian pyramids where <b>quantizations</b> <b>errors</b> do not amplify as they propagate, but quickly decay. Examples are provided and extensions of the family of decompositions to give piecewise-quadratic approximations are discussed. [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The {{main goal}} of this paper has been to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> on the binaural GSC. Several extensions to the basic theme can be followed. Topics for future work include studying the effect of reverberation and ambient diffuse noise {{on the performance of}} the beamformer. Binaural localization cues such as interaural time and level differences have been shown to contribute towards speech intelligibility. Future work could analyze the effect of <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> on these binaural cues.|$|R

For example, a 16-bit ADC has a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of 6.02 × 16 = 96.3 dB, and therefore the <b>quantization</b> <b>error</b> is 96.3 dB below the maximum level. <b>Quantization</b> <b>error</b> is distributed from DC to the Nyquist frequency, consequently if part of the ADC's bandwidth is not used (as in oversampling), some of the <b>quantization</b> <b>error</b> will fall out of band, effectively improving the SQNR. In an oversampled system, noise shaping can be used to further increase SQNR by forcing more <b>quantization</b> <b>error</b> out of the band.|$|E

The effect is that the <b>quantization</b> <b>error</b> is low-pass filtered by a 2-sample rectangular filter (also known as an averaging filter). As a result, compared to before, the <b>quantization</b> <b>error</b> has lower power at higher frequencies and higher power at lower frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Quantization for a {{probability}} distribution {{refers to the}} idea of estimating a given probability by a discrete probability supported by a finite number of points. In this paper, firstly a general approach to this process is outlined using independent random variables and ergodic maps; these give asymptotically the optimal sets of n-means and the nth <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> for all positive integers n. Secondly two piecewise uniform distributions are considered on R: one with infinite number of pieces and one with finite number of pieces. For these two probability measures, we describe the optimal sets of n-means and the nth <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> for all n∈ N. It is seen that for a uniform distribution with infinite number of pieces to determine the optimal sets of n-means for n≥ 2 one needs to know an optimal set of (n- 1) -means, but for a uniform distribution with finite number of pieces one can directly determine the optimal sets of n-means and the nth <b>quantization</b> <b>errors</b> for all n∈ N.
