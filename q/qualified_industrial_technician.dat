40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop and verify a list of the job duties and tasks of <b>industrial</b> {{plastics}} <b>technicians</b> for use in developing plastics education and training programs which meet the needs of the greater Michiana area plastics industry;Research questions were as follows: (1) What tasks are considered to be essential to the success of the <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> in the greater Michiana area? (2) What tasks are considered to be performed by entry-level <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area? (3) What is the degree of importance of each task? (4) What is the frequency of performance of each task? (5) What is the degree of difficulty in learning each task?;An occupational analysis was conducted using <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in a Developing a Curriculum (DACUM) process. One hundred and thirty-five (135) tasks in thirteen (13) duties or general areas of responsibility were identified;Questions were developed utilizing the 135 tasks. Respondents were asked to determine whether each task is expected of entry-level <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians.</b> Respondents rated each task for importance, frequency of performance and difficulty in learning on a four-point Likert-type rating scale;The findings indicated the following: (1) The use of the DACUM process was appropriate to develop a task list for <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area. (2) The <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> job is varied and consists of 13 broad areas of expertise or duties. (3) The 135 identified tasks are the basic performances required for adequate preparation to enter employment as an <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> in the greater Michiana area. (4) No competency was rated 2 ̆ 2 unimportant, 2 ̆ 2 therefore, it was concluded that an adequate curriculum for <b>industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area must include all of the 135 identified tasks. (5) <b>Industrial</b> plastics <b>technician</b> students or trainees in the greater Michiana area should be able to master all of the 135 tasks identified by this study. (6) <b>Industrial</b> plastics <b>technicians</b> in the greater Michiana area should be required to use most of the 135 tasks identified shortly after their initial job entry and should have mastered each competency in their job setting prior to full employment...|$|R
