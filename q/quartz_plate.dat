5000|$|The {{experimental}} setup was impressive, and it {{was driven}} by a 2 kW oscillator that had been designed for a furnace, allowing for the generation of very high output powers. The frequencies they used ran from 100 kHz to 700 kHz. The most impressive display of the output power of the setup is perhaps how strongly the output sound waves can fight even against gravity. When the <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> transducer was suspended in oil, {{it would make a}} mound of oil up to 7 cm higher {{than the rest of the}} surface of the oil. While at low powers, the mound was low and lumpy, at high powers, it would rise up to the full 7 cm, [...] "its summit erupting oil drops like a miniature volcano." [...] These drops could reach heights of 30 - 40 cm. Similarly, when an 8 cm diameter glass plate was placed on the surface of the oil, up to 150 g of external weight could be placed on top of the glass plate, and supported by the strength of the ultrasound waves alone. This was achieved by the waves reflecting and re-reflecting between the transducer and the glass plate, allowing each generated wave to impart its momentum to the glass plate multiple times.|$|E

40|$|Background: In vitro {{measurements}} of sunscreen products {{are used to}} assess their reliability in terms of photoprotection and photo-stability. Objective: In this study, several substrates have been fully characterized for in vitro sunscreen testing. Methods: The following different substrates have been utilised in the study: roughened PMMA plates, Transpore, Vitro-Skin, roughened <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> and a laboratory prepared roughened PTFE plate. The suitability of these substrates for SPF evaluation has been investigated by performing total absorbance {{measurements of}} seven sunscreen products with different SPF values produced by the same manufacturer. Results and conclusions: Application of sunscreen products on Transpore, roughened <b>quartz</b> <b>plate,</b> PMMA, PTFE and Vitro-Skin was performed efficiently. With regard to photo-stability of the substrate materials, only PMMA plate, PTFE and roughened <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> showed to be photo-stable after UV irradiation. With regard to SPF tests, our results indicate that Transpore, roughened <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> and Vitro-Skin are preferable to assess SPF values because of a better correlation between in vitro and in vivomeasurements. Our study also confirms that an initial calibration must be performed for sunscreen products labelled with different SPF values.

40|$|AbstractDue to an {{expected}} increase in radiation damage in LHC, we propose to transform CMS Hadronic EndCap calorimeters to radiation hard <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> calorimeters. Quartz is {{proved to be}} radiation hard by the radiation damage tests with electron, proton, neutron and gamma beams. However, the light produced in quartz comes from Cerenkov process, which yields drastically fewer photons than scintillation. To increase the light collection efficiency we pursue two separate methods: First method; is to use wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers, which {{have been shown to}} collect efficiently the Cerenkov light generated in quartz plates. A <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> calorimeter prototype with WLS fibers has been constructed and tested at CERN to show that this method is feasible.

Here, the test beam, bench test and simulation efforts on these methods are reported. We also outline the future directions on these possible upgrade scenarios for the CMS HE calorimeter...|$|E

The data in the Majorana search correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5. 0 inverse fb of pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess of events are observed beyond the expected standard model background and therefore upper limits are set on the square of the mixing element, |VμN|^ 2 as a function of Majorana neutrino mass. These are the first direct upper limits on the heavy Majorana-neutrino mixing for mN 90 GeV. The second part of this thesis is the results of performance tests of a 20 -layer <b>quartz</b> <b>plate</b> calorimeter prototype.

The influence of various components for optical properties like refractive indices and absorption from 0. 3 to 3. 0 THz of nematic liquid crystal mixtures are shown. Chosen applications of liquid crystals in the THz range have been described. The interest of terahertz (THz) radiation has increased in the last decade. The THz region is between a microwave and an infrared frequency range {{and it is the}} least explored spectrum region. THz technology is now developing rapidly, there is high requirement for devices which modulate and control the THz frequency region. Potential applications of the THz range enclose: detection of weapons and illegal chemical and biological substances, medical imaging, epithelium cancer screening, productive processes control, etc. These applications require different active and passive optic elements such as lenses, phase shifters, modulators, filters, phase gratings, switches, etc. A good solution seems to utilize liquid crystals because of their high dielectric anisotropy and possibility of tuning by an electric or magnetic field [1 − 4]. The measurements of liquid crystals (LCs) properties were performed using a conventional Time-Domain Spectrometer (TDS) at room temperature. The setup was described in many books and papers [5 − 7]. The LC cells for these measurements consisted of two <b>quartz</b> <b>plates,</b> each 1. 5 mm thick.
