5|$|In September 2010, Volvo Cars and Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, {{issued a}} report {{regarding}} {{the results of the}} first phase of the Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid demonstration program. Among other findings, before the trial drivers participating in the field testing were concerned about being a danger to pedestrians and cyclists due to the <b>quietness</b> of the electric-drive vehicle. After the test several of them change their opinion and said that this issue was less of a problem than expected. Nevertheless, some test drivers said they experienced incidents of not being noticed while others said they had taken extra care in their driving with regard to this issue.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its <b>quietness,</b> {{well-appointed}} and ergonomic interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E

25|$|NAC Breda’s longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest neighbour, Willem II from Tilburg, colloquially known as Stillem II (English: <b>Quietness</b> II). This rivalry {{originated}} in the twenties of the 20th century. Matches between the two {{are referred to as}} the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that it is city against city with local pride at stake.|$|E
25|$|Lexus has {{positioned}} the ES in {{the comfort}} luxury segment, {{with an emphasis on}} interior amenities, <b>quietness,</b> and ride quality, in contrast with more firm-riding sport sedans. Buyers seeking more performance-focused models are targeted by the Lexus IS and rival makes, with such models offering a sportier drive with differently tuned suspensions. In Europe, Japan, and other markets where it is not available, the Lexus GS sport sedans occupy the mid-size category in the Lexus lineup. In the United States, the Lexus ES has been the best-selling Lexus sedan for over fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{official}} firing tests {{recorded the}} De Lisle produced 85.5dB of noise when fired. As a comparison, modern testing on {{a selection of}} handguns has shown that they produce 156 to 168dB when firing without a suppressor, and 117 to 140dB when firing with one fitted. The de Lisle's <b>quietness</b> {{was found to be}} comparable to the British Welrod pistol. However, the Welrod was useful only at very short range and used fabric and rubber components in the suppressor that required replacement after a few shots. The de Lisle was able to fire hundreds of rounds before the suppressor required disassembly for cleaning.|$|E
25|$|The routes {{are drawn}} and the {{timetables}} set by HSL, but operated by independent companies. HSL tenders a route or {{a set of}} routes and the company offering to operate the route for the best quality-price ratio will get the contract. The quality is measured with a pointing system which gives points for such aspects as the <b>quietness,</b> environmental efficiency {{and the size of}} the buses that would be used. The biggest bus operators are Nobina Finland, Veolia Transport Finland and Helsingin Bussiliikenne (HelB). These companies run a majority of the contract services. One rapidly expanding company is the VR (state rail) owned Pohjolan Liikenne, which has recently been very successful with the tendering. Mostly the expansion has been at the cost of HelB.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} his affliction was duty-related, he was in 1812 appointed to the Naval Knights of Windsor, with a lifetime grant of care in Windsor Castle. This position demanded he attend church service twice daily as his only duty in return for room and board, but the <b>quietness</b> of such a life harmonized so poorly with his active habits and keen interests, physically making him ill, that he requested multiple leaves of absence on health grounds, first to study medicine and literature at the University of Edinburgh, then to go abroad on a Grand Tour from 1819 to 1821 when he journeyed through France, Italy, Switzerland, the parts of Germany bordering on the Rhine, Belgium and the Netherlands. On his return he published The Narrative of a Journey through France, etc. (London, 1822).|$|E
25|$|The {{sturdiness}} and <b>quietness</b> of the LCA proved invaluable during Operation Dragoon, {{the invasion}} of southern France in July 1944. Operation Romeo had LCAs of the RCN disembark the 1er Commando Français de l'Afrique du Nord to disable German artillery atop the cliffs of Cap Nègre. Canadian LCAs also landed the U.S.-Canadian 1st Special Service Force on the difficult, sharp-rocked shores of Île du Levant in a pre-dawn operation to silence batteries there that threatened the main force. The LCA was a strong little craft, in this instance standing up better to the pounding in rough landings than other LC types, especially on these rocky offshore islands, when many LCVPs were lost. Following the landings in southern France, the RN's LSI units remained in the Mediterranean or began moving to the Indian Ocean in anticipation of joining the war against Japan.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in the loneliness of the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent <b>quietness</b> of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E
25|$|The guqin {{is nearly}} always used a solo instrument, as its <b>quietness</b> of tone {{means that it}} cannot compete {{with the sounds of}} most other {{instruments}} or an ensemble. It can, however, be played together with a xiao (end-blown bamboo flute), with other qin, or played while singing. In old times, the se (a long zither with movable bridges and 25 strings) was frequently used in duets with the qin. Sadly, the se has not survived, though duet tablature scores for the instruments are preserved in a few qinpu, and the master qin player Wu Jinglüe was one of only a few in the twentieth century who knew how to play it together with qin in duet. Lately there has been a trend to use other instruments to accompany the qin, such as the xun (ceramic ocarina), pipa (four-stringed pear-shaped lute), dizi (transverse bamboo flute), and others for more experimental purposes.|$|E

Watts-Russell later said [...] "that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say," [...] and by that time, Santiago's <b>quietness</b> had been noted by those close to the band.

[...] In its review of Ruddigore, The Theatre wrote, [...] "Better comic acting than his, or more highly finished, I have never seen and never wish to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Hitler's {{relative}} <b>quietness</b> as the [...] "Reich" [...] {{absorbed the}} Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping {{to persuade the}} French to hasten their rearmament and to persuade Mussolini {{to be a positive}} influence on Hitler. However several of his Cabinet members, led by the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was now convinced that Munich, though [...] "better than a European war", had been [...] "a horrid business and humiliating". Public revulsion over the pogrom of Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a [...] "rapprochement" [...] with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.|$|E
500|$|The school {{uses the}} fictional sœur system where any second- or third-year student, the grande sœur ("big sister"), might pick a younger girl {{who will become}} her [...] "sœur" [...] (sister in French). The grande sœur gives her the petite sœur ("little sister") a rosary and {{promises}} to look after her and guide her. The basic etiquette demands the petite sœur to call her grande sœur [...] "onee-sama" [...] (older sister in Japanese). Aside from being used in prayer, the rosary is the instrument that certifies the sœur union and relationship between two students. There is an implicit code of behavior between sœurs, especially in the Yamayuri Council—the student council of the school: <b>quietness,</b> measure and respect towards each other; values deeply attached to traditional Japanese education.|$|E
500|$|The two {{met again}} in July at Fremland in Essex. Garnet told Catesby that he [...] "wished {{him to look}} what he did if he {{intended}} anything. That he must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then he must not have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge we all had of <b>quietness</b> and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} the actual figures upon the urn, {{the image of the}} lovers depicts the {{relationship}} of passion and beauty with art. In [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on Melancholy", Keats describes how beauty is temporary. However, the figures of the urn are able to always enjoy their beauty and passion because of their artistic permanence. The urn's description as a bride invokes a possibility of consummation, which is symbolic of the urn's need for an audience. Charles Patterson, in a 1954 essay, explains that [...] "It is erroneous to assume that here Keats is merely disparaging the bride of flesh wed to man and glorifying the bride of marble wed to <b>quietness.</b> He could have achieved that simple effect more deftly with some other image than the richly ambivalent unravished bride, which conveys... a hint of disparagement: It is natural for brides to be possessed physically... it is unnatural for them not to be." [...] John Jones, in his 1969 analysis, emphasises this sexual dimension within the poem by comparing the relationship between [...] "the Eve Adam dreamed of and who was there when he woke up" [...] and the [...] "bridal urn" [...] of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn". Helen Vendler expands on the idea, in her 1983 analysis of Keats's odes, when she claimed [...] "the complex mind writing the Urn connects stillness and <b>quietness</b> to ravishment and a bride". In the second stanza, Keats [...] "voices the generating motive of the poem – the necessary self-exhaustion and self-perpetuation of sexual appetite." [...] To Vendler, desire and longing could be the source of artistic creativity, but the urn contains two contradicting expressions of sexuality: a lover chasing after a beloved and a lover with his beloved. This contradiction reveals Keats's belief that such love in general was unattainable and that [...] "The true opponent to the urn-experience of love is not satisfaction but extinction." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{initiated the}} F1 project ("Flagship" [...] and [...] "No. 1" [...] vehicle; alternatively called the [...] "Circle-F" [...] project), as a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world-class luxury sedan for international markets. The F1 development effort {{did not have}} a specific budget or time constraints, and the resulting vehicle did not utilize existing Toyota platforms or parts. Instead, chief engineer Ichiro Suzuki sought to develop an all-new design, aiming to surpass rival American and European flagship sedans in specific target areas, including aerodynamics, cabin <b>quietness,</b> overall top speed, and fuel efficiency. During development, the 60 designers with 1,400 engineers in 24 teams, 2,300 technicians and over 200 support workers built approximately 450 flagship prototypes and 900 engine prototypes. The teams logged [...] of testing on locations ranging from winter Europe roadways, to deserts in Arizona, Australia, or Saudi Arabia, to U.S. highways and wilderness areas.|$|E
500|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a dysfunctional family, comprising a father, a mother, their daughter and the father's mother. The story begins with two lovers, whose relationship is running dry. They decide {{to have a}} child, which the woman believes may save their relationship ("Between Love and Fire"). The birth of a baby girl destroys in the mother her hopes for a brilliant professional career and smothers her passion. On the other hand, the newborn child causes in the father a stiffening of his feelings and the refusal to compromise his career for a [...] "spoilt brat" [...] ("Sins of Idealism"). The girl, perceived in the family as an unwanted burden, tries {{to adapt to the}} psychological abuse she receives, but she is the object of frequent quarrels and grows sad and depressed ("Beautiful Emptiness"). She searches for <b>quietness</b> and strength in her inner fantasy world, and friendship and love on the internet, becoming ever more detached from the real world and eccentric in the eyes of her schoolmates and parents ("Eccentric", [...] "Digital Deceit", [...] "Through Square Eyes"). The line of pain that connects the child to her parents appears indestructible and the situation gets worse when the father thinks of leaving ("Blind Pain", [...] "Two Sides"). The intervention of the girl's grandmother reveals that the father was himself a neglected child and a victim of his family ("Victim of Choices"). The father's anger is a reaction to his abuse as a child and this realization seems to soften the girl's pain, bringing her out of her defensive shell ("Reflections"). In conclusion, the grown-up daughter, now a mother herself, faces the same dilemmas of her parents and is bound to repeat her parents' mistakes, closing the invisible circle that endures from one generation to another ("Life's Vortex").|$|E
500|$|Lerew {{was posted}} to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in December 1943. He {{travelled}} via the United States, meeting film stars Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour {{on the set}} of Road to Utopia at Los Angeles in February 1944. In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the invasion of France on 6June 1944, he wrote: [...] "There has been no rejoicing. A hushed <b>quietness</b> has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it." [...] Later in the year, Lerew was invested with his Distinguished Flying Cross by King GeorgeVI at Buckingham Palace. He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a Royal Air Force night-fighter pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced. In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General George Vasey; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew. Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director. Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the notorious feud between the service's two senior officers, Air Vice Marshals George Jones and Bill Bostock, Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.|$|E

This idea, adds Wiltshire, reflects the assumption in the ancient thought that man influences his own environment and situation, causality is equitable, and [...] "good volitional acts conduce pleasant situations, while bad volitional acts conduce unpleasant situations". The Maitri Upanishad teaches, states Juan Mascaró, that peace begins in one's own mind, in one's longing for truth, in looking within, and that [...] "a <b>quietness</b> of mind overcomes good and evil works, and in <b>quietness</b> the soul is one: then one feels the joy of eternity." ...|$|E
