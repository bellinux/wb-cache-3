Three days later, Chicago offensive <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> coaches Carson Walch and Brendan Nugent were fired.

5|$|Chaffee {{was given}} a variety of assignments, and participated in {{numerous}} training duties {{over the next few}} years, spending {{most of his time in}} photo reconnaissance squadrons. He was stationed at NAS Jacksonville as safety officer and <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> officer for Heavy Photographic Squadron 62 (VAP-62) flying the A3D. He wrote a <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> manual for the squadron, although some of his peers saw this as too demanding. By coincidence, he was assigned to a mission where he flew over Cape Canaveral, during which aerial photographs of future launch sites were taken.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{was constructed}} in six sections, each consisting of several sub-sections. One of the main criteria {{of the project was}} that Australian industries contribute to at least 60% of the work; by the conclusion of the project 70% of the construction and 45% of the software preparation had been completed by Australian-owned companies. Work was sub-contracted out to 426companies across twelve countries, plus numerous sub-sub-contractors. In many cases, components for the first submarine were constructed by companies outside Australia, while those for the following five boats were replicated by an Australian-owned partner or subsidiary. The project prompted major increases in <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> standards across Australian industries: in 1980, only 35Australian companies possessed the appropriate <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> certifications for Defence projects, but by 1998 this had increased to over 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or imputed (dense coverage), very stringent <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E

5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water <b>Quality</b> <b>Control</b> Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water <b>Quality</b> <b>Control</b> Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research will test how the new fuels affect engine durability and <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> standards.|$|E

5|$|<b>Quality</b> <b>control</b> and {{standards}} were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By {{the rise of}} consumerism in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the modifications that pertain to all habeas corpus cases, AEDPA enacted special review provisions for capital cases from states that enacted <b>quality</b> <b>controls</b> {{for the performance of}} counsel in the state courts in the post-conviction phase.
