40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>quindoxin</b> on the {{synthesis}} of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid, and protein in Escherichia coli KL 399 was examined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the absence of oxygen {{the synthesis of}} DNA was completely inhibited by 10 ppm of <b>quindoxin,</b> whereas the syntheses of ribonucleic acid and protein were not affected. Quinoxalin-di-N-oxides (QdNO) induce degradation of DNA in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. polA, recA, recB, recC, exrA, and uvrA mutants were more susceptible than the corresponding repair-proficient strains. All strains were more resistant {{in the presence of}} oxygen. <b>Quindoxin</b> was reduced to quinoxalin-N-oxide by intact E. coli cells or by a cell-free E. coli extract. Electron spin resonance measurements demonstrated the generation of free radicals during the reduction of <b>quindoxin.</b> Oxygen or deficiency of energy sources impaired the antibiotic activity and the reduction of QdNO. The QdNO reductase activity was demonstrated to be lower in QdNO-resistant mutants than in the susceptible parent strain. Based on these results it is concluded that an intermediate of reduction, probably a free radical, is responsible for the lethal effect of <b>quindoxin.</b> With three independent techniques no evidence has been found for binding of <b>quindoxin</b> to DNA...|$|E
40|$|The quinoxaline-di-N-oxides carbadox, olaquindox, and <b>quindoxin,</b> {{which are}} potent {{antibacterial}} agents, were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella microsomal system. They all induced base pair substitutions and frameshift mutations in Salmonella, and occurred {{independently of the}} presence of a rat liver microsomal fraction in the test system. Mutagenicity was dependent on the presence of their N-oxide groups, since quinoxaline, a completely reduced derivative of <b>quindoxin,</b> was not mutagenic, whereas the partially reduced quinoxaline-N-oxide exhibited a lower mutagenic activity than <b>quindoxin.</b> recA and uvrB Salmonella were found to be more susceptible to mutagenic quinoxaline derivatives than wild-type strains. The mutagenicity of quinoxaline-di-N-oxides was enhanced under anaerobic incubation as was the antibacterial activity. These results suggest that both the antibacterial and mutagenic activity of quinoxaline-di-N-oxides depend upon the same bacterial activation mechanism...|$|E
