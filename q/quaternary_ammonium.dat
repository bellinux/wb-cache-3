5|$|Nitrogen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in organic chemistry. Many organic functional groups involve a carbon–nitrogen bond, such as amides (RCONR2), amines (R3N), imines (RC(=NR)R), imides (RCO)2NR, azides (RN3), azo compounds (RN2R), cyanates and isocyanates (ROCN or RCNO), nitrates (RONO2), nitriles and isonitriles (RCN or RNC), nitrites (RONO), nitro compounds (RNO2), nitroso compounds (RNO), oximes (RCR=NOH), and pyridine derivatives. C–N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen. In these compounds, nitrogen is usually trivalent (though it can be tetravalent in <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> salts, R4N+), with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton. This may be offset by other factors: for example, amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond (though they may act as acids at very low pH, being protonated at the oxygen), and pyrrole is not acidic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring. The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method. In particular, nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids, amino acids and thus proteins, and the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth.|$|E

The apparent affinity of these blockers varied {{as a function of}} membrane voltage. As a consequence, the channel conducted K+ current more efficiently in the inward than the outward direction; i. e., inward rectification. Although the size of some monovalent <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> is rather large, the zδ values (which measure voltage dependence of their binding to the pore) were near unity in symmetric 100 mM K+. Furthermore, we observed that not only the apparent affinities of the blockers themselves, but also their dependence on membrane voltage (or zδ), varied {{as a function of the}} concentration of extracellular K+. These results suggest that there is energetic coupling between the binding of blocking and permeating (K+) ions, and that the voltage dependence of channel blockade results, at least in part, from the movement of K+ ions in the electrical field. A further quantitative analysis of the results explains why the complex phenomenon of inward rectification depends on both membrane voltage and the equilibrium potential for K+...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCO 2 {{mitigation}} {{represents a}} major industrial and scientific challenge of this century, therefore CO 2 capture and sequestration is a route {{to solve a}} part of the problem, especially for the industries in which the gases to be treated are well localized. CO 2 capture by using hydrate formation has revealed to present an energetic interest because it is less intensive than other methods. In this process the cost of the separation is due to compression of gases to reach the gas hydrate formation conditions at which water and gas forms a solid that encapsulates preferentially CO 2. In fact, the hydrate formation requires high pressures and low temperatures, which explains the use of thermodynamic promoters to decrease the operative pressure. <b>Quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> salts represent an interesting family of components because of their thermodynamic effect, but also because they can generate crystals that are easily handable. In this work, we have made experiments concerning the equilibrium of pure gas hydrates (CO 2, N 2 and CH 4) in presence of the tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and compared these data to literature. We have applied the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, to the results obtained and the literature data, thus observing that the hydrates have a pure component behavior. In the specific case of N 2 -TBAB semi-clathrates, observations showed that the pressure is first order depending on the temperature only and independent from the TBAB concentration. For the CO 2 -TBAB and CH 4 -TBAB semiclathrates the results are different. In fact, the equilibrium pressure is clearly dependent on both the temperature and TBAB concentration, for that reason the constant B from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation becomes a function of the TBAB concentration. Another point of our investigation is the effect of other types of <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> to find an additive that allows the formation of hydrates close to room temperature and atmospheric pressure...|$|R

25|$|Lithium {{aluminium}} hydride {{is widely}} used in organic chemistry as a reducing agent. It is {{more powerful than the}} related reagent sodium borohydride owing to the weaker Al-H bond compared to the B-H bond. Often as a solution in diethyl ether and followed by an acid workup, it will convert esters, carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, aldehydes, and ketones into the corresponding alcohols (see: carbonyl reduction). Similarly, it converts amide, nitro, nitrile, imine, oxime, and azide compounds into the amines (see: amide reduction). It reduces <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> cations into the corresponding tertiary amines. Reactivity can be tuned by replacing hydride groups by alkoxy groups. Due to its pyrophoric nature, instability, toxicity, low shelf life and handling problems associated with its reactivity, it has been replaced in the last decade, both at the small-industrial scale and for large-scale reductions by the more convenient related reagent sodium bis (2-methoxyethoxy)aluminium hydride, which exhibits similar reactivity but with higher safety, easier handling and better economics.|$|E
40|$|Both {{the study}} {{and the use of}} extractions with highmolecular-weight amines (including <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums)</b> in organic {{solution}} are increasing extensively. While equilibria have been measured in the extraction of an increasing range of acids and Aetal ions, a difficulty remains unresolved in that the amine concentration powerdependence of extraction often indicates a different stoichiometry of the complex existing in the organic phase than do limiting loading and other considerations. Nevertheless, amine extraction serves as a useful tool in studying complexes formed in aqueous systems. Process applications have progressed especially in nitrate and chioride systems, in addition to the sulfate systems first emphasized. Systematic surveys, together with information accruing from process development, have extended the ranges of extractions that can be correlated in usefully generalized patterns, which in turn should accelerate the development of new applications.

25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> compound which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated. The ethanolic grapefruit seed and pulp extract tested was prepared or contaminated with ethanol, a chemical solvent used in the extraction process.

The pendent groups include tertiary amines, sulfobetaine (SB) zwitterions, <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums,</b> and sulfonates, providing solubility in polar solvents. Particular {{emphasis is placed}} on zwitterions functalized structures. Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) and Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) coupling reactions proved valuable for the preparation of the hydrophilic conjugated polymers, while the Prato reaction afforded the functional fulleropyrrolidines. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) probed the interactions between the hydrophilic conjugated polymers and conductive metal substrates. In particular, UPS revealed that conjugated polymer zwitterions (CPZs) substantially reduce work function (Φ) of metals, represented by a negative interfacial dipole (Δ). Their solubility properties and interactions with metals make CPZs attractive for integration into solar cells, specifically at the interface between a photoactive layer and high Φ metal cathode. This thesis thus provides routes to improve polymer-based solar cell (PSC) technology through the implementation of novel hydrophilic semiconductors. Initial syntheses focused on the preparation of polythiophene with pendent SB groups, producing CPZs that were incorporated into PSCs as cathode modification layers. Tuning the electronic properties of CPZs with different polymer backbones further enhanced their effectiveness as interlayers in PSCs.

In darkness or in green light, trans-QAQ blocks voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels and silences action potentials in pain-sensing neurons. Upon photo-isomerization to cis with near UV light, QAQ blockade is rapidly relieved, restoring neuronal activity. However, the molecular mechanism of cis and trans QAQ blockade is not known. Moreover, the absorption spectrum of QAQ requires UV light for photo-control, precluding use deep inside neural tissue. Experimental ApproachElectrophysiology and molecular modelling {{were used to}} characterize the binding of cis and trans QAQ to voltage-gated K+ channels and to develop <b>quaternary</b> ammonium–ethylamine–azobenzene–quaternary <b>ammonium</b> (QENAQ), a red-shifted QAQ derivative controlled with visible light. Key Resultstrans QAQ was sixfold more potent than cis QAQ, in blocking current through Shaker K+ channels. Both isomers were use-dependent, open channel blockers, binding from the cytoplasmic side, but only trans QAQ block was slightly voltage dependent. QENAQ also blocked native K+ and Na+ channels preferentially in the trans state. QENAQ was photo-isomerized to cis with blue light and spontaneously reverted to trans within seconds in darkness, enabling rapid photo-control of action potentials in sensory neurons.
