500|$|O'Hara {{made her}} screen debut in Walter Forde's Kicking the Moon Around (1938), {{although}} she did not consider it {{a part of her}} filmography. Richman had introduced her to Forde at Elstree Studios, but as she was not cast in the film in a notable role, she agreed to deliver one line in it as a favor to Richman for helping with her screen test. Laughton arranged for her to appear in the low-budget musical My Irish Molly (1938), the only film she made under her real name, Maureen FitzSimons. In the film she plays a woman named Eiléen O'Shea who rescues an orphan girl named Molly. Biographer Aubrey Malone stated of it: [...] "One could argue that O'Hara never looked as enticing as she does in Little Miss Molly, even if she isn't 'Maureen O'Hara' <b>quite</b> <b>yet.</b> She wears no makeup, and there's no Hollywood glamour, but despite (or because of?) that, she is rapturously beautiful. Her accent is thick, which is perhaps why she didn't mention the film much. It also looks as if it were made in the 1920s rather than the 1930s, so primitive are the sets and characters". Malone added that though the lot was [...] "ham-fisted", it is a [...] "quaint film which O'Hara scholars should view if only to see early evidence of her natural instinct for dramatic timing and scene interpretation".|$|E

500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly {{seems to have a}} solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge <b>quite</b> <b>yet,</b> but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is [...] "certainly cool enough to the wet the palate for any X-Men fans", and particularly noted the [...] "strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool. With a new director stepping behind the camera, perhaps this was a choice that we'll see in" [...] Deadpool 2.|$|E

[...] "The feeling that if he got out almost all was over never {{affected}} his play," [...] Wisden commented of his efforts across the season.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, pieces {{have been}} fired in wood-fueled kilns or simple in a pile with wood. This is low-fire method as the {{temperatures}} achieved do not exceed 800°C. Better wood kilns and gas kilns can reach temperatures of between 900 and 1000C, which is not <b>quite</b> <b>yet</b> high-fire, but allows the use of more types of low lead or lead free glazes. [...] Another reason for the higher temperatures is that wood is becoming scarce in parts of Mexico and gas kilns easily achieve these temperatures, which produce better pieces.|$|E

2500|$|David Jeffries of Allmusic {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five saying [...] "What doesn't happen is that {{satisfying}} overall album flow, {{and when it comes to}} production, the highlights are mentioned above with the rest of the album sounding mixtape rough or just plain old. It might not be the grand arrival showcase that was expected but Papoose hasn't fallen off the [...] "ones to watch" [...] list <b>quite</b> <b>yet,</b> even when he's been on there longer than most anyone else." [...] Grant Jones of RapReviews gave the album a 6.5 of 10, saying [...] "The Nacerima Dream is as strong as any of Papoose's mixtapes, combining effective storytelling with displays of advanced lyricism is everything rap fans have come to expect from him. Much like fellow lyricists Canibus and Ras Kass, Papoose has been let down by some second-rate, mixtape-ish production. Whether it is a product of being stuck in mixtape territory for so long or having to work on a limited budget, The Nacerima Dream is neither dream nor nightmare. Whether you are a fan of Papoose or need convincing, you'll find something on here that you'll enjoy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ascension}} of Minamoto no Yoritomo to {{the title}} of shogun, following the Hōgen and Heiji rebellions, and {{the victory of the}} Minamoto clan over the Taira, {{marked the beginning of the}} Kamakura period (1185–1333 A.D.), but not <b>quite</b> <b>yet</b> to a return to peace and tranquility. The era is sometimes called [...] "the age of the warriors" [...] and a broad transition from court influences to a leading role of the military establishment pervaded the culture. It is also, however, a time when exchanges with China of the Song dynasty continued and Buddhism greatly flourished. Zen monks such as Shunjo studied in China and the copybooks that he brought with him are considered highly influential for the karayō [...] tradition of the time, expressing a clear kaisho style. But this was not the only example, indeed a succession of Chinese monks were naturalized at that time, encouraged by regent Hōjō Tokiyori. Rankei Doryū founded the Kenchō-ji temple in Kamakura and many of his works have been preserved. However, with the rise of the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism a less technical style appeared, representative of Zen attitudes and exemplified in the works of Musō Soseki who wrote in a refined sosho style, or Shūhō Myōcho (1282–1337; better known as Daito Kokushi), the founder of Daitoku-ji in Kyoto, who had not traveled to China to study. In terms of wayō [...] style, the works of Fujiwara no Shunzei and Fujiwara no Teika are considered outstanding examples of the late Heian [...] and early Kamakura.|$|E
2500|$|Zhu Ci {{made it a}} {{priority}} to capture Fengtian to extinguish the hopes of Emperor Dezong's being restored. [...] He left Li Zhongchen and Qiu Jingzhong (仇敬忠) in charge of Chang'an, and personally led his army, assisted by Yao Lingyan and Zhang Guangsheng, to Fengtian. [...] He put Fengtian under siege, and {{despite the efforts of}} the Tang generals Hang Yougui (韓遊瓌) and Hun Jian in fighting off the Qin siege, Fengtian was soon in a desperate state, with its food supplies cut off. [...] Tang resistance forces were then harassing the Qin forces left at Chang'an, and in response, Zhu intensified his siege of Fengtian. [...] However, after Fengtian was under siege for more than a month, Li Huaiguang, who had been fighting Wang Wujun and Tian Yue to the east but immediately headed toward Chang'an upon hearing of Emperor Dezong's plight, arrived with his elite Shuofang Army. [...] On December 18, with Li Huaiguang not <b>quite</b> <b>yet</b> at Fengtian but having defeated Qin forces at Liquan (醴泉, in modern Xianyang), Zhu, fearful that he would be defeated by Li Huaiguang, lifted Fengtian's siege and returned to Chang'an. [...] He would not threaten Fengtian again, although he tried to keep the morale of his forces in check at Chang'an by periodically spreading rumors that Fengtian had fallen. [...] By this point, however, it was said that he controlled little more than Chang'an itself. [...] It was the consensus at the time that if Li Huaiguang had arrived three days later than he actually did, Fengtian would have fallen.|$|E
