"I do not {{sympathize with}} the {{measures}} the men are taking to obtain redress for what they regard as a grievance; but I do sympathize very deeply {{with the amount of}} suffering which they are undergoing from the introduction of machinery and the high prices of provisions; and I am not surprised that, desperate as they are, and ignorant as they are, they should be led astray by bad advice.

"Well, sir," [...] {{the captain}} said, [...] "even admitting {{that you have}} had some luck, there is no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{utilized}} your opportunities and have an extraordinary record, and if you don't get shot I prophesy {{that you will be}} an admiral before many officers old enough to be your father.
