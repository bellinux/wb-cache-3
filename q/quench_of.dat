50|$|At the {{necessarily}} large toroidal currents (15 megaamperes in ITER) the tokamak concept {{suffers from}} a fundamental problem of stability. The nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamical instabilities leads to a dramatic <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> the plasma current within milliseconds. Very energetic electrons are created (runaway electrons) and finally a global loss of confinement happens. At that point very intense radiation is inflicted on small areas. This phenomenon is called a major disruption.The occurrence of major disruptions in running tokamaks has always been rather high, {{of the order of}} a few percent of the total numbers of the shots. In currently operated tokamaks, the damage is often large but rarely dramatic. In the ITER tokamak, it is expected that the occurrence of a limited number of major disruptions will definitively damage the chamber with no possibility to restore the device.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} exploits {{the critical}} slowing {{down in the}} neighbourhood of the critical point, this is, the divergence of the relaxation time of the system.As the system approaches the critical point from the high symmetry phase, its dynamics becomes increasingly slow, and eventually ceases to be adiabatic. Under a linear <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> the control parameter, this happens at the freeze-out time scale, when the relaxation time matches the time left for the system to reach the critical point. KZM predicts the typical size of the domains in the broken symmetry phase to be fixed by {{the value of the}} equilibrium correlation length at freeze-out time. The inverse of this length scale can be used as an estimate of the density of topological defects, and it obeys a power law in the quench rate. This prediction is universal, and the power exponent is given in terms of the critical exponents of the transition.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} fate of the 2 d kinetic q-state Potts model after a sudden quench to zero temperature. Both ground states and {{complicated}} static states are reached with non-zero probabilities. These outcomes resemble those found in the <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> the 2 d Ising model; however, the variety of static states in the q-state Potts model (with q>= 3) is much richer than in the Ising model, where static states are either ground or stripe states. Another possibility is that the system gets trapped on a set of equal-energy blinker states where a subset of spins can flip ad infinitum; these states are similar to those found in the <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> the 3 d Ising model. The evolution towards the final energy is also unusual [...] -at long times, sudden and massive energy drops may occur that are accompanied by macroscopic reordering of the domain structure. This indeterminacy in the zero-temperature <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> the kinetic Potts model is at odds with basic predictions from the theory of phase-ordering kinetics.

40|$|Binary {{mixtures}} {{have strong}} influence on activities of polymers and biopolymers even at low cosolvent concentration. Among the several aqueous binary mixtures studied, water-DMSO especially stands out for its unusual behavior at certain specific concentrations of DMSO. In the present work, we study {{the effect of}} water-DMSO binary mixture on polymers and biopolymers by taking a simple linear hydrocarbon chain of intermediate length (n = 30) and the protein lysozyme, respectively. We find that at a mole fraction of 0. 05 of DMSO (x(DMSO) = 0. 05) in aqueous solution, the hydrocarbon chain adopts the collapsed conformation as the most stable and rigid state. In this case of 0. 05 mole fraction of DMSO in bulk, the DMSO concentration in the first hydration layer around the polymer {{is found to be}} as large as 17 %. Formation of such hydrophobic environment around the polymer is the reason for the collapsed state gaining so much stability. Interestingly, similar <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> conformational fluctuation is also observed for the protein investigated. It is observed {{that in the case of}} alkane polymer chains, long wavelength fluctuation gets easily quenched, the polymer being purely hydrophobic. However, in case of the protein, <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> fluctuation is prominent only at the hydrophobic surface, and <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> long wavelength fluctuation becomes insignificant for the full protein. As protein contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, the extent of <b>quench</b> <b>of</b> conformational fluctuation with respect to that in pure water is almost half for the biopolymer complex (16. 83 %) than the same for pure hydrophobic polymer chain (32. 43 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Guided by {{the recent}} {{observational}} result that the meridional circulation of the Sun becomes weaker {{at the time of}} the sunspot maximum, we have included a parametric <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> the meridional circulation in solar dynamo models such that the meridional circulation becomes weaker when the magnetic field at the base of the convection zone is stronger. We find that a flux transport solar dynamo tends to become unstable on including this <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> meridional circulation if the diffusivity in the convection zone is less than about 2 * 10 ^{ 11 } cm^ 2 /s. The <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> alpha, however, has a stabilizing effect and it is possible to stabilize a dynamo with low diffusivity with sufficiently strong alpha-quenching.

In both triads the {{switching function}} of the photochromic dithienylcyclopentene unit is retained. For CSC an overall 50 % <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> the coumarin fluorescence is observed upon ring-closure of the dithienylcyclopentene component, which, taken together with the low PSS (< 70 %), indicates that energy transfer <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> the coumarin component by the dithienylcyclopentene in the closed state is efficient. Upon ring opening of the dithienylcyclopentene unit the coumarin emission is restored fully. The PSC triad shows efficient energy transfer from the coumarin to the perylene bisimide unit when the dithienylcyclopentene unit is in the open state. When the dithienylcyclopentene is in the closed (PSS) state a 60 % decrease in sensitized perylene bisimide emission intensity is observed due to competitive <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> the coumarin excited state and partial <b>quenching</b> <b>of</b> the perylene excited state by the closed dithienylcyclopentene unit.
