5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought to be a Republican candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This <b>quasi-judicial</b> post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{function}} delegated by a public authority is crucial in determining whether such delegation offends the law. Where functions are considered administrative, delegation may not be wrongful. In R. v. Race Relations Board, ex parte Selvarajan (1975), it was accepted that the Board could establish a committee in order to investigate and conduct preliminary inquiries, {{and that it was}} not practical for the whole body to be engaged in such a task. On the other hand, it is an established principle that no tribunal can delegate judicial or <b>quasi-judicial</b> functions such as disciplinary powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of judicial {{members on the}} Council may also pose additional problems. There is a possibility of conflict of interest for judges who sit {{as members of the}} Council if they find themselves having to review the very Acts of Parliament that they have either endorsed or rejected previously. This is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} Council, in examining the legitimacy of Bills, plays a <b>quasi-judicial</b> role. There may be confusion as regards the legality of a piece of legislation if, for example, it was initially condemned by the Council but enacted by the Government and later endorsed by the courts upon judicial review. When the potential conflict between the Chief Justice's role as head of the judiciary and as Chairman of the Council was raised in 2010 by Githu Muigai, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Tolerance, he was informed that the Chief Justice would recuse himself from any matter in which a conflict arose.|$|E
5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and <b>quasi-judicial</b> powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E

25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or <b>quasi-judicial</b> officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E
500|$|Later during January 2013, Solis {{confirmed}} {{her interest}} in the County Board of Supervisors race, saying [...] "I'm {{going to take a}} look at it." [...] In explaining why a former U.S. Representative and Cabinet member would be interested in a county-level body, analysts stated that the board is the most powerful county-level legislative body in the United States, and exercises some executive and <b>quasi-judicial</b> powers as well. [...] It controls a workforce larger than the Labor Department's and its $26 billion budget is equivalent to that of an average U.S. state. Each member presiding over some two million constituents, three times that of Solis' old congressional district, and that it is quite possibly the fourth most powerful position in California politics, after Governor, U.S. Senator, and Mayor of Los Angeles. [...] The supervisors have long been nicknamed [...] "the five little kings".|$|E
500|$|The King's Remembrancer was {{the chief}} clerk of the Exchequer, {{handling}} all bills of equity. He {{was the equivalent of}} the Court of Chancery's Master of the Rolls, in that he headed up the clerical side of the court. As well as his duties to the judicial body, the King's Remembrancer also handled the revenue side of the Exchequer, a jurisdiction established in the 14th century. He was originally able to appoint all the sworn clerks, but by the 16th century this jurisdiction had been limited to appointing one of the 24 side clerks, with the sworn clerks appointing the rest. In a similar way, while he was originally in charge of the court's records and the enrolment of writs, by the 17th century he no longer possessed the keys to the record office, and the sworn clerks had the exclusive right to search the records. His main job was instead <b>quasi-judicial,</b> examining certain witnesses, taking minutes in court and settling disputes over [...] "scandal and impertinence".|$|E
500|$|This {{has led to}} the {{development}} of the [...] "nature test". In R. v. Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, ex parte Datafin plc. (1986), In this case, the issue was whether a body discharging functions that are <b>quasi-judicial</b> in nature and which wields considerable de facto public powers is amenable to judicial review. The Panel on Take-overs and Mergers is an unincorporated association and does not derive its power directly from a legal source such as legislation. Rather, it is an informal body which has adopted a self-regulatory code to govern its members. However, Sir John Donaldson, the Master of the Rolls, observed that the Panel possesses [...] "immense power de facto by devising, promulgating, amending and interpreting the City Code on Take-overs and Mergers" [...] and its decisions could lead to sanctions which indirectly affect the rights of citizens. Lord Justice Timothy Lloyd acknowledged that the source test is usually decisive, but disagreed that it is the sole test to determine whether a public body is subject to judicial review. He explained that it is instead helpful to look at the nature of the power‚Äì whether the body in question exercises public law functions or if the exercise of its functions has public law consequences.|$|E
500|$|In France, satirical {{magazine}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken}} to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. [...] In Canada a human rights commission investigated The Western Standard, a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a <b>quasi-judicial,</b> mandatory process) against the publication. These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate {{about the role of}} government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, [...] "Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations." [...] Tim Cavanaugh wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws, writing, [...] "The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and with any luck to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it." ...|$|E
500|$|Republicans {{claimed that}} Taylor's suit, {{by virtue of}} having been filed two hours before Beckham's, gave the case {{precedence}} in Louisville. By mutual consent, the parties consolidated the suits, which were heard before Judge Emmet Field in Jefferson County circuit court. Both sides knew that Field's decision, whatever it might be, would be appealed, but both agreed {{to abide by the}} outcome of the final court's decision. The case was heard on March 1 and 2, 1900. Taylor's attorney's contended that the General Assembly had acted in a <b>quasi-judicial</b> manner, violating the principle of separation of powers. Further, because the contest committee's report did not specify how many votes were invalid, Republicans argued that all 150,000 votes cast in the contested counties had been invalidated by the General Assembly's vote, and consequently, the voters of those counties had been illegally disenfranchised. The most the Assembly {{should have been able to}} do, they claimed, was to invalidate the entire election. Finally, they contended that the alleged illegal activities of the General Assembly had deprived Taylor and Marshall of their property rights ‚Äì the [...] "property" [...] in question being the offices they claimed ‚Äì and their liberty to hold an elected office. Attorneys for Beckham contended that legislative actions historically had not been subject to judicial review, and indeed were not subject to such under any provision of the state constitution.|$|E
