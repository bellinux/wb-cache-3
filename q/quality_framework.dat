40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to compare}} {{the ways in which}} a range of <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> have been {{validated}} and to identify a number of factors that have an impact on validation processes. Design/methodology/approach – Seven examples of published <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> applicable to the field of e-learning are described and the methods used to validate each of the frameworks are identified and compared. The article concludes by considering a range of factors that have the potential {{to have an impact on}} such validation processes. Findings – Six methods of validation were found to have been used in relation to development of the seven frameworks that were examined: reviewing the research literature related to effectiveness in online learning; seeking input from an expert panel; undertaking empirical research; undertaking survey research; conducting pilot projects; and drawing on case studies. From the variety of approaches used and the ways in which they were used it was concluded that a recognised set of procedures for validation of <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> has not yet emerged. Research limitations/implications – The most important limitation of this study is that its findings are dependent on the particular <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> selected for inclusion. Practical implications – The paper draws attention to the need for more attention to be paid to the development of methods of validation that are both objective and robust. Originality/value – No previous studies were located that have looked specifically at the processes used to validate <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks.</b> This paper therefore provides some initial baseline data upon which to base future work...|$|R

They {{are also very}} helpful to established researchers in assisting with the review of research papers and articles submitted to conferences and journals {{as well as for}} the examination of research dissertations. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of research quality criteria in quantitative and qualitative research before presenting a synthesis of <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> and procedural checklists emerging from the field of mixed methods research. Cameron (2010) studied the methodological incidence of research approaches utilised in Australian vocational education and training (VET) based research and found that qualitative (45 %) and mixed methods research (15 %) were dominant. The recent development of mixed methods research <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> is presented and compared to those used in quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. The <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> emerging from the mixed methods research movement include: a set of four criteria developed by Sale and Brazil (2004); quality prompts from Bryman, Becker and Sempik (2008) and; a six item framework developed by O’Cathain, Murphy and Nicholl (2008) referred to as, Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS). The paper concludes with some future projections on research training for new VET researchers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the research {{carried out in}} the area of software product quality modelling. Its main endeavour is to consider software product quality with regard to maintainability. Supporting this aim, execution tracing quality, which is a neglected property of the software product quality at present in the <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> under investigation, needs to be described by a model that offers possibilities to link to the overall software product <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks.</b> The report includes concise description of the research objectives: (1) the thorough investigation of software product <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> {{from the point of view}} of the quality property analysability with regard to execution tracing; (2) moreover, extension possibilities of software product <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks,</b> and (3) a pilot quality model developed for execution tracing quality, which is capable to capture subjective uncertainty associated with the software quality measurement. The report closes with concluding remarks: (1) the present software <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> do not exhibit any property to describe execution tracing quality, (2) execution tracing has a significant impact on the analysability of software systems that increases with the complexity, and (3) the uncertainty associated with execution tracing quality can adequately be expressed by type- 1 fuzzy logic. The section potential future work outlines directions into which the research could be continued. Findings of the research were summarized in two research reports, which were also incorporated in the thesis, and submitted for publication: 1.

Today internet is flourishing in {{all sectors of}} our life. As Web applications are part of global economy, growing demand for Web-based applications enhanced the need to compare various Web <b>quality</b> <b>frameworks</b> popularly in use. Most of the work on Web application is making them more powerful and relatively less {{attention has been given}} to ensure their quality. Quality check is essential for both the user as well as developer satisfaction.

Based on the TQM Philosophy, various <b>quality</b> excellence <b>frameworks</b> known as business excellence models and related quality awards have been established in different countries. Dubai Quality Award in Dubai is one such <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> that is being applied since 1994 by many organisations within Dubai to gain benefits in terms of profits, employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. To gain anticipated business benefits through <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework,</b> role of senior management during implementation is crucial as highlighted by most researchers. However, what are the other factors that may affect at senior management level {{for the implementation of}} <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> such as Dubai Quality Award are not comprehensively reflected in the literature. Therefore, many researchers have suggested investigating factors affecting implementation of <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> at a senior management level. Accordingly there has not been any study conducted in Dubai for the same concern. The main aim of this research was "to investigate factors affecting implementation of <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> at a senior management level in the context of Dubai". This research has adopted a phenomenological philosophy and has employed multiple case studies as a research strategy. Two case study organisations were selected from Dubai based manufacturing and service organisations. The relevant data was collected through diverse sources of evidences including semi-structured interviews, documentation, archival records and direct observations. Explanation building method was used to analyse the collected data. The following contributions to knowledge have emerged from this research. This study has identified a list of factors which affect the implementation of <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> at a senior management level in the context of Dubai. The list of factors include empirically recognised two unique factors related to the implementation of <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> at a senior management level, thus contributing towards enhancement of the existing literature. Two unique factors identified are 'system thinking view of the excellence model' and 'managing diversity of workforce'. Another contribution of this research to the TQM Philosophy and related body of knowledge for <b>quality</b> excellence <b>frameworks</b> is a proposed theoretical framework with implementation steps which will benefit senior management in improving the implementation of <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework.</b> In addition, the findings of this research strengthen the current literature on <b>quality</b> excellence <b>framework</b> such as Dubai Quality Award and reduce the gap in knowledge in the context of Dubai...|$|R

Information systems deployment has; {{in recent years}} undergone radical change; the traditional deployment where the architecture, user and access device were known {{at the time of}} development, have been replaced by more diverse situations. These diverse situations include web interfaces, traditional client server and a mobile devices revolution.

The Graduate <b>Qualities</b> <b>framework</b> is closely {{aligned with the}} Professional Requirements of the Australian accounting professional bodies and the generic skills of the Australian Council for Educational Research. The pressure to embed the development of generic skills into university courses comes from three areas: the government, employers and the universities.
