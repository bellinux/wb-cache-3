5|$|When Burnet {{returned}} to Australia, {{he continued his}} work on virology, including the epidemiology of herpes simplex. He was also involved in two projects that were not viral, the characterisation of the causative agents of psittacosis and <b>Q</b> <b>fever.</b> After finding that parrots and cockatoos were infected with psittacosis and were responsible for transmission, he lobbied the government for a ban {{in order to prevent}} human infection, but he was rebuffed and later came to agree with the government position that there was not much danger. During the time he worked on <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> with Australian scientist E.H. Derrick, the causative organism of which was named Coxiella burnetii in Burnet's honour, he became the first person to acquire the disease in the laboratory. His epidemiological studies of herpes and <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> displayed an appreciation of the ecology of infectious disease that became a characteristic of his scientific method.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or <b>Q</b> <b>fever),</b> systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|Ticks are {{implicated in}} the {{transmission}} {{of a number of}} infections caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Sometimes the tick harbours more than one type of pathogen, making diagnosis of the infection more difficult. Species of the bacterium Rickettsia are responsible for typhus, rickettsialpox, Boutonneuse fever, African tick bite fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Flinders Island spotted fever and Queensland tick typhus (Australian tick typhus). Other tick-borne diseases include Lyme disease and <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> Colorado tick fever, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Bourbon virus and tick-borne meningoencephalitis, as well as bovine anaplasmosis and probably the Heartland virus.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{to other}} rodents, brown rats may carry {{a number of}} pathogens, which can result in disease, {{including}} Weil's disease, rat bite fever, cryptosporidiosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the United Kingdom, brown rats are an important reservoir for Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium that causes <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> with seroprevalence for the bacteria found to {{be as high as}} 53% in some wild populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{differential diagnosis}} is extensive and requires consideration {{of many other}} infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, shigellosis, rickettsial diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, EHEC enteritis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, plague, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> candidiasis, histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, measles, and viral hepatitis among others.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{considered}} for or {{known to be}} used as a weapon include anthrax, ebola, Marburg virus, plague, cholera, typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, brucellosis, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> machupo, Coccidioides mycosis, Glanders, Melioidosis, Shigella, Psittacosis, Japanese B encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever, and smallpox.|$|E
25|$|The Legionellales are {{an order}} of Proteobacteria. Like all Proteobacteria, they are Gram-negative. They {{comprise}} two families, typified by Legionella and Coxiella, both of which include notable pathogens. For example, <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> is caused by Coxiella burnetii and Legionella pneumophila causes Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever.|$|E
25|$|Some {{parasitic}} forms affect {{humans and}} other mammals, causing damage by their feeding, {{and can even}} be vectors of diseases, such as scrub typhus, rickettsialpox, Lyme disease, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> Colorado tick fever, tularemia, tick-borne relapsing fever, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and tick-borne meningoencephalitis. A well known effect of mites on humans is their role as an allergen and the stimulation of asthma in people affected by respiratory disease.|$|E
25|$|Infections {{that are}} {{transmitted}} from animals to humans are called zoonoses. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, {{but others are}} much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are Brucellosis, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> leptospirosis, and toxocariasis. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. Allergic reactions to animal semen may occur, including anaphylaxis. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.|$|E
25|$|The filmmakers asked {{permission}} {{to bring in}} twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the Ice Queen's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland. To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport's Creature Effects, Inc. created four animatronic reindeer {{that were used in}} shots where the deer were standing in place. The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas's and white for those of the White Witch.|$|E
500|$|The {{guinea pig}} was most {{extensively}} implemented {{in research and}} diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs {{are one of the}} few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the [...] "ascorbutic factor" [...] in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} tick-borne {{diseases}} {{can be transmitted}} by I.ricinus {{to a variety of}} mammal hosts. Dogs can be infected with Lyme disease (borreliosis), caused by the spirochaete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, B.afzeli, and B.garnii. Cattle can become infected with redwater fever (from the protozoans Babesia divergens, B.bovis, and B.ovis), Lyme disease (from B. burgdorferi), sheep tick pyemia (Staphylococcus aureus), cattle tick-borne fever (Anaplasma [...] phagocytophila), <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> (Coxiella burnetii), Boutonneuse fever (Rickettsia conorii), and the bacterium Anaplasma marginale. Horses may be infected with Lyme disease, Anaplasma [...] phagocytophila, and the viral infection louping ill. Humans can become infected with Lyme disease, louping ill, <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> and tick-borne encephalitis.|$|E

Tetracycline tablets {{were used in}} the plague outbreak in India in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, several {{workers on}} Laysan {{contracted}} a feverish illness previously unknown there or anywhere else. It affected workers on Laysan in {{varying levels of}} severity: one woman was evacuated for persistent fever, but others exhibited very mild symptoms. Cedric Yoshimoto, of the University of Hawaii at Mānoa School of Public Health, wrote that [...] "surveillance has identified a newly-described illness of humans termed 'Laysan fever (LF)' It is associated with bites of the seabird tick Ornithodoros capensis... joins {{a short list of}} human illnesses associated with seabird colonies..." [...] The symptoms of <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> overlap significantly with those of Laysan fever, and scientists have speculated as to their possible common causes.|$|E
2500|$|Reports {{from the}} 1980s and 1990s {{suggested}} RRV infection {{was associated with}} arthralgia, fatigue and depression lasting for years. More recent prospective studies have reported a steady improvement in symptoms over the first few months, with 15–66% of patients having ongoing arthralgia at 3 months. Arthralgias have resolved in the majority by 5–7 months. The incidence of chronic fatigue is 12% at 6 months and 9% at 12 months, similar to Epstein-Barr virus and <b>Q</b> <b>fever.</b> The only significant predictor of the likelihood of developing chronic symptoms is {{the severity of the}} acute illness itself. No other aspects of the patient's medical or psychiatric history {{have been found to be}} predictive. However, in those with the most persisting symptoms (12 months or more), comorbid rheumatologic conditions and/or depression are frequently observed [...]|$|E
2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause souring and spoilage of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also.|$|E
2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of <b>Q</b> <b>fever,</b> toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu. Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis and mainly affects the immunocompromised.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century {{there was no}} robust {{knowledge}} of what time and temperatures combinations would inactivate pathogenic bacteria in milk, and so {{a number of different}} pasteurization standards were in use. [...] By 1943, both HTST pasteurization conditions of 72°C for 15 seconds, as well as batch pasteurization conditions of 63°C for 30 minutes, were confirmed by studies of the complete thermal death (as best as could be measured at that time) for a range of pathogenic bacteria in milk. [...] Complete inactivation of Coxiella burnetii (which was thought at the time to cause <b>Q</b> <b>fever</b> by oral ingestion of infected milk) as well as of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which causes tuberculosis) were later demonstrated. For all practical purposes, these conditions were adequate for destroying almost all yeasts, molds, and common spoilage bacteria and also to ensure adequate destruction of common pathogenic, heat-resistant organisms. [...] However, the microbiological techniques used until the 1960s did not allow for the actual reduction of bacteria to be enumerated. [...] Demonstration of the extent of inactivation of pathogenic bacteria by milk pasteurization came from a study of surviving bacteria in milk that was heat treated after being deliberately spiked with high levels of the most heat-resistant strains of the most significant milk-borne pathogens.|$|E
