40|$|Aflatoxins {{are highly}} toxic cancer causing fungal {{metabolites}} {{known to cause}} immune-system suppression, growth retardation, liver disease, and death in both humans and domestic animals. Human exposure to aflatoxins is limited by regulations that prohibit the use of crops containing excess quantities of aflatoxins for foods and feeds. Aflatoxins are regulated in part per billion (ppb) ranges with the maximum allowable level varying with country and intended use of the commodity. The <b>quantity</b> <b>permitted</b> in U. S. foods ranges from 0. 5 ppb to 20 ppb. Aspergillus flavus, the asexual species responsible for most aflatoxin contamination of many crops, is composed of many genetic groups, called vegetative compatibility groups, that vary widely in several characteristics. Aspergillus flavus is not sufficiently aggressive as a pathogen to cause meaningful losses in yield. However, infection of crop components predisposed by stress, insect damage or the environment can result in high aflatoxin levels. Relatively small proportions of a crop infected with highly toxic isolates can result in unacceptable crop aflatoxin content. Isolates of A. flavus belonging to different vegetative compatibility groups may produce widely different quantities of aflatoxins and fungal communities resident in different areas frequently vary in average aflatoxin-producing potential.

40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{the direct}} {{interrogation}} of peptides harboring covalently modified serines in nonribosomal peptide synthetases, streamlined methodologies described here employ proteolysis and reporter-coenzyme A analogues of four types. The chromophoric and fluorescent coenzyme A analogues pyrene-maleimidyl-S-CoA and BODIPY-FL-N-(2 -aminoethyl) maleimidyl-S-CoA were enzymatically loaded onto the active site serines harbored in the ArCP, PCP 1, and PCP 2 thiolation domains of PchE and PchF, the nonribosomal peptide synthetases {{responsible for the}} biosynthesis of the siderophore pyochelin. During the chromato-graphic separation of cyanogen bromide digests, observation of the absorbance (at 338 and 504 nm) or fluorescence (after irradiation at 365 nm) enabled the selective detection of peptides containing each active site serine. This resulted in quick detection of each active site peptide by Fourier transform mass spectrometry in the fully reconstituted pyochelin system. The loading of short acyl chain reporters in equimolar <b>quantities</b> <b>permitted</b> further insights into digestion heterogeneity and side reactions by virtue of a mass shift signature on each active site peptide. The chromatographic shift of the reporter-loaded peptides relative to peptides carrying on pathway intermediates was 2 min at 7 kDa, providing a general strategy for efficient localization of “carrier ” peptides in complex digests of thiotemplate enzymes.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a Ground Water Heat Pump (GWHP) is often impaired by the thermal recycling between the injection and the extraction well(s), and hence this phenomenon should be evaluated {{in the design of}} open loop geothermal plants. The numerical flow and heat transport simulation of a GWHP requires an expensive characterization of the aquifer to obtain reliable input data, which is usually not affordable for small installations. To provide a simple, fast and inexpensive tool for preliminary and sensitivity analyses, an open-source numerical code was developed, which solves the hydraulic and thermal transport problem of a well doublet {{in the presence of a}} subsurface flow. The code, called TRS (Thermal Recycling Simulator), is based on a finite-difference approximation of the potential flow theory. The method was validated through the comparison with flow and heat transport simulations with FEFLOW. Subsequently, TRS was run with different values of the aquifer and plant parameters.

40|$|The most {{suitable}} techniques {{and use of}} F 1 hybrids enable greenhouse production to achieve high yields, with crops all year round. In Sicily, greenhouse production of cucumber is for fresh use (slicers), producing large fruit. The cultivation technique most suited to greenhouses is the vertical single stem. However, an innovative technique being proposed is of cultivation on a trellis, eliminating lower branches, and training the remaining branches upwards (vertical shoot positioning, VSP). Cucumbers {{in the south of}} Italy are grown as the main crop or as a catch crop between 2 main crops. The crop should be rotated on the same soil only after 3 - 4 years with another crop, unless the land is thoroughly weeded, which is usually prohibitively expensive. One alternative to soil decontamination is hydroponic culture, which produces high yields and high quality. The cucumber has substantial nutritional requirements, but an excess of N can provoke a significant accumulation of nitrates, which in particular conditions (long storage periods, heat, and acidic pH) can transform into nitrites which are harmful to humans. This research therefore set out to investigate the possibility of cucumber cultivation using VSP and modifying the electrical conductivity of the nutrition solution from 1. 5 mS/cm to 2, 5 mS/cm, starting from the same mother solution.

However, there are four major challenges facing the long-term development of nuclear energy {{as a part of the}} world’s energy mix: improvement of the economic competitiveness, meeting increasingly stringent safety requirements, adhering to the criteria of sustainable development, and public acceptability. Meeting the sustainability criteria is the driving force behind the topic of this paper. More specifically, in this context sustainability has two aspects: natural resources and waste management. IAEA’s activities in the area of Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) are mostly in response to the latter. While not involving the large quantities of gaseous products and toxic solid wastes associated with fossil fuels, radioactive waste disposal is today’s dominant public acceptance issue. In fact, small waste <b>quantities</b> <b>permit</b> a rigorous confinement strategy, and mined geological disposal is the strategy followed by some countries. Nevertheless, political opposition arguing that this does not yet constitute a safe disposal technology has largely stalled these efforts. One of the primary reasons that are cited is the long life of many of the radioisotopes generated from fission. This concern has led to increased R&D efforts to develop a technology aimed at reducing the amount of long-lived radioactive waste through transmutation in fission reactors or accelerator-driven hybrids.
