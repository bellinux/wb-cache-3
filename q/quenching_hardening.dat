Further both the carbon steels are compared {{on the basis of}} their mechanical properties as well as the rate of corrosion, then the hardness of both the carbon steel are noted before and after the heat treatment processes. The heat treatment processes i. e. Annealing, Tempering & Oil <b>quenching</b> (<b>hardening)</b> are done. The hardening temperature for EN- 31 varies from 8200 C- 8600 C whereas the hardening temperature for EN- 8 varies from 7500 C- 9000 C. The mechanical properties such as the hardness and tensile strength among three process, the oil quenching sample posses highest hardness and the annealed sample posses highest elongation.

40|$|The heat {{treatment}} method {{was used in}} early 1000 B. 0 when the artifact of crude iron was found. Heat treatment is a method used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, and impact resistance. Heat treatment {{involves the use of}} heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening of a material [...] There are many types of furnace are used for heat treating but the basic types of furnace are batch furnace and continuous furnace. Selection of. a material for specific application required a full understanding of its mechanical properties including tensile properties, elastic and plastic behavior, brittle fracture, strength and hardness. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain the most optimum value of UTS (ultimate tensile strength), Y (yield strength) and strain by using suitable {{heat treatment}} method such as <b>quenching,</b> <b>hardening</b> and tempering. After heat treatment process, these metals were test using tensile test machine to investigate the mechanical properties. Evaluation was based on the value of UTS (ultimate tensile strength), Y (yield strength) and strain. It was found out that the annealing process was the best method of heat treatment to produce the most optimum value of UTS (ultimate tensile strength), Y (yield strength) and strain. The finding suggest that there are should used other method of heat-treatment such as case hardening, carbon nitriding and so on to understand more about mechanical properties of low carbon steel or mild steel and how to change the microstructures in metal or to improve the mechanical properties of mild steel...|$|E

This is done by heating the material to a certain temperature, depending on the material. This produces a harder material by either surface hardening or through-hardening varying on {{the rate at which}} the material is cooled. The material is then often tempered to reduce the brittleness that may increase from the <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> process. Items that may be quenched include gears, shafts, and wear blocks.|$|R

Based on the experimental results obtained, a numerical model for simulation of continuous cooling of <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> steel was developed. For the simulation of the kinetics of diffusion phase transformations, the Avrami equation and additive rule were applied. A new model was also developed for martensitic transformation which was validated using metallographic analysis and hardness tests. Experimental and simulation results indicated a good agreement.

50|$|Typically, large ovens {{are used}} for the {{annealing}} process. The inside of the oven {{is large enough to}} place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired conveyor furnaces are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are removed from the oven. Once removed from the oven, the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as <b>quench</b> <b>hardening.</b> Typical methods of <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of brine (salt water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water air bubbles form {{on the surface of the}} object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of air bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. <b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys.|$|R
25|$|Around the 10th century, {{the use of}} {{properly}} <b>quenched</b> <b>hardened</b> and {{tempered steel}} started to become much more common than in previous periods. The Frankish 'Ulfberht' blades (the name of the maker inlaid in the blade) were of particularly consistent high quality. Charles the Bald tried to prohibit the export of these swords, as they were used by Vikings in raids against the Franks.|$|R
50|$|As one of {{the last}} {{processes}} in fabricating a sword is quenching and tempering it. <b>Quenching</b> <b>hardens</b> the metal so it holds an edge longer but this also makes it very brittle. To restore some ductility and durability the sword is tempered. With swords, due to their length, the challenge is greater as in a typical quenching it is possible to bend or warp the blade if it is not introduced to the quenchant smoothly and evenly.|$|R
25|$|There {{are other}} {{variations}} of part formation that integrate impression-die forging. One method incorporates casting a forging preform from liquid metal. The casting is removed {{after it has}} solidified, but while still hot. It is then finished in a single cavity die. The flash is trimmed, then the part is <b>quench</b> <b>hardened.</b> Another variation follows the same process as outlined above, except the preform is produced by the spraying deposition of metal droplets into shaped collectors (similar to the Osprey process).|$|R
50|$|This {{process is}} often used for knife making, by heating only {{the edge of a}} {{previously}} quenched and tempered blade. When edge turns the proper color temperature, it is <b>quenched,</b> <b>hardening</b> only the edge, but leaving {{most of the rest of}} the blade at the lower hardness. The knife is then tempered again to produce the final differential hardness. However, unlike a blade that has been evenly heated and differentially <b>quenched,</b> flame <b>hardening</b> creates a heat-affected zone. Unlike the nioi, the boundary between the hot and cold metal formed by this heat-affected zone causes extremely rapid cooling when quenched. When combined with the stresses formed, this creates a very brittle zone between the hard and softer metal, which usually makes this method unsuitable for swords or tools that may be subjected to shear and impact stresses.|$|R
40|$|<b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> is {{the process}} of {{strengthening}} and hardening ferrous metals and alloys by heating the material to a specific temperature to form austenite (austenitization), followed by rapid cooling (quenching) in water, brine or oil to introduce a hardened phase called martensite. The material is then often tempered to increase toughness, as it may decrease from the <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> process. The austenitization process is highly energy-intensive and many of the industrial austenitization furnaces were built and equipped prior to the advent of advanced control strategies and thus use large, sub-optimal amounts of energy. The model computes the energy usage of the furnace and the part temperature profile as a function of time and position within the furnace under temperature feedback control. In this paper, the aforementioned model is used to simulate the furnace for a batch of forty parts under heuristic temperature set points suggested by the operators of the plant. A model predictive control (MPC) system is then developed and deployed to control the the part temperature at the furnace exit thereby preventing the parts from overheating. An energy efficiency gain of 5. 3 % was obtained under model predictive control compared to operation under heuristic temperature set points tracked by a regulatory control layer...|$|R

A trouble happened in 1943, when a P1Y tested the torpedo released at altitude 100 m in high-speed power gliding. That torpedo veered the running direction. The hard impact on water entry made a front blade get cracked by the hit of a rear blade.

5000|$|Induction {{hardening}} is {{a surface}} hardening technique which uses induction coils {{to provide a}} very rapid means of heating the metal.

40|$|Austenitizing during <b>quench</b> <b>hardening</b> of the ductile {{cast iron}} {{influences}} the content of carbon in austenite depending on the soaking heat. On the other hand, the saturation of austenite impacts its transformation in the ausferritizing process of a metal matrix and forming of microstructure. Ductile cast iron with the ferrite matrix was hardened with isothermal transformation {{in the range of}} ausferritizing in temperature tpi = 400 i 300 0 C and the range of time τpi = 7, 5 �� 240 min. Specimens were gradually austenitized. They were soaked in the nominal temperature tγ = 950 0 C, then precooled to the temperature tγ’ = 850 and 800 0 C. Microstructure was investigated, there were also defined the proportion of austenite in the matrix of the cast iron and the content of carbon in it and hardness and impact strength in unnotched specimens. It was stated, that the precooling temperature deciding on the content of carbon in austenite influences kinetics of the ausferritic transformation, the content of carbon in the γ phase and impact strength and, in a less degree, hardness. As a result of gradual austenitizing the cast iron after <b>quench</b> <b>hardening,</b> in some conditions of treatment, reached mechanical properties corresponding, according to the ASTM A 897 standard, with high grades of ADI.

5000|$|Polybius (2.33) {{reports that}} the Gauls at the Battle of Telamon (224 BC) had {{inferior}} iron swords which bent at the first stroke {{and had to be}} straightened with the foot against the ground. Plutarch, in his life of Marcus Furius Camillus, likewise reports on the inferiority of Gaulish iron, making the same claim that their swords bent easily. These reports have puzzled some historians, since by that time the Celts had a centuries long tradition of iron workmanship. In 1906 a scholar suggested that the Greek observers misunderstood ritual acts of sword-bending, which may have served to [...] "decommission" [...] the weapon. Such bent swords have been found among deposits of objects presumably dedicated for sacred purposes. The speculation has been repeated since. Radomir Pleiner, however, argues that [...] "the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point. To judge from the swords examined in this survey, only one third could be described as conforming to the quality which he ascribed generally to Celtic swords. Even so, {{it is quite possible that}} even some of the better quality swords would have failed in battle." [...] Nevertheless, he argues that the classical sources are exaggerated. Plutarch's claim that Celtic swords would bend completely back is implausible, as only a slight bending would be likely. Pleiner also notes that metallurgical analysis performed on Celtic swords suggests that they were only work hardened and only very few were <b>quench</b> <b>hardened,</b> even though they frequently contain enough carbon to be hardened (in particular the swords made from Noric steel). <b>Quench</b> <b>hardening</b> takes the full advantage of the potential hardness of the steel, but leaves it brittle, prone to breaking. Quite probably this is because tempering wasn't known. Tempering is heating the steel at a lower temperature after quenching to remove the brittleness, while keeping most of the hardness.|$|R

Above approx 150 deg C dilatation effects were observed below the global yielding point of the material. Microstraining around dislocations in the body centred tetragonal crystallographic structure or viscous flow at higher temperatures was a probable explanation to this material behaviour.

50|$|Flame {{hardening}} {{is often}} used to harden only a portion of an object, by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area, and then quenching the steel.

Flame hardening is a very common surface hardening technique, which {{is often used}} to provide a very wear-resistant surface. A common use is for hardening the surface of gears, making the teeth more resistant to erosion.

50|$|Before a tool is {{differentially}} tempered, it {{is first}} heated to red-hot and then <b>quenched,</b> <b>hardening</b> the entire tool.

Instead, the heat is applied to {{only a part of}} the tool, allowing the heat to thermally conduct toward the cooler cutting edge. The quenched-steel is first sanded or polished, to remove any residual oxidation, revealing the bare metal underneath. The steel is then heated in a localized area, such as the hammering-end of a chisel or the handle-end of an axe. The smith then carefully gauges the temperature by watching the tempering colors of the steel. As the steel is heated, these colors will form, ranging from yellow to brown, purple, and blue, and many shades in between, and will indicate the temperature of the steel. As heat is applied, the colors will form near the heat source, and then slowly move across the tool, following the heat as it conducts toward the edge.|$|R
