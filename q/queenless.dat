5|$|In the <b>queenless</b> ant Streblognathus peetersi, {{policing}} {{helps to}} select gamergates. The workers immobilize gamergates with lowered fertility, enabling high-ranking workers {{to take over}} as new gamergates.|$|E
5|$|The ant species Aphaenogaster smythiesi japonica also display {{evidence}} of policing. When researchers separated and then reunited workers from colonies that {{did or did}} not have queens, workers from the queen-containing colonies attacked the workers with activated ovaries from the <b>queenless</b> colonies.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both <b>queenless</b> and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E
25|$|Workers have {{morphological}} specializations, {{including the}} pollen basket (corbicula), abdominal glands that produce beeswax, brood-feeding glands, and barbs on the sting. Under certain conditions (for example, if the colony becomes <b>queenless),</b> a worker may develop ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Virgin queens {{appear to}} have little queen {{pheromone}} and often {{do not appear to}} be recognized as queens by the workers. A virgin queen in her first few hours after emergence can be placed into the entrance of any <b>queenless</b> hive or nuc and acceptance is usually very good, whereas a mated queen is usually recognized as a stranger and runs a high risk of being killed by the older workers.|$|E
25|$|Queen loss is {{a crisis}} for a colony of social insects, which may cause {{increased}} aggression and work inefficiencies. Also, if the colony can produce a new queen, it could be slow to produce eggs. After queen loss, replacement queens do not mate in the 12 days following queen removal and few had mature eggs in their ovaries. After a month, most replacement queens develop ovaries and mate. Nest growth decreases with colonies that lose their queen, which can be expected if increased dominance behavior interfered with other essential behaviors or if the new queen is not competent at egg laying. Among <b>queenless</b> colonies of P. dominula, individuals demonstrated an increased level of chewing and climbing, but not of lunging and biting. These are all dominance behaviors. No difference of foraging behaviors occurs between colonies with and without queens. Subordinates are kept reproductively suppressed enough {{not to be a}} threat to the existing queen, as indicated by the high cost of queen replacement.|$|E
500|$|... {{conditions}} (as in {{founded by}} a single queen that hunts for food to feed her young), but {{the development of a}} colony straight after colony founding is very slow, whereas other Rhytidoponera species tend to grow faster. There is also a clear sign of division of labour between the queens and workers. Upon the death of a queen, workers may sometimes compete and exhibit sexual calling behaviour, which means that workers are able to reproduce in <b>queenless</b> nests. Despite the near-absence of queens, long-range dispersal with winged queens may still be an option. Colonies start small but can rapidly expand to the point they are considered mature.|$|E

2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} can distinguish nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and specific colony odours. Workers prefer {{to dig into}} nest materials from their own colony and not from soil in unnested areas or from other red imported fire ant colonies. One study suggests that as a colony's diet is similar, {{the only difference between}} nested and unnested soil was the nesting of the ants themselves. Therefore, [...] workers may transfer colony odour within the soil. Colony odour can be affected by the environment, as workers in lab-reared colonies are less aggressive than those in the wild. Queen-derived cues are able to regulate nestmate recognition in workers and amine levels. However, these cues do not {{play a major role in}} colony-level recognition, but they can serve as a form of caste-recognition within nests. Workers living in monogyne societies tend to be extremely aggressive and attack intruders from neighbouring nests. In <b>queenless</b> colonies, the addition of alien queens or workers does not increase aggression among the population.|$|E
2500|$|The {{eleventh}} {{game was}} played on 23 November 2014. As in the seventh and ninth games, the opening resulted in the well-analyzed <b>queenless</b> middlegame of the Berlin Defence. In this game, Anand gained an initiative with the line opening pawn sacrifice 23...b5! Carlsen declined the sacrifice, but Anand still had a somewhat easier position until he sacrificed an exchange by 27...Rb4 {{in return for a}} protected passed pawn and free play for the bishops. Both players criticised this move afterwards, Anand describing it as [...] "a bad gamble". Carlsen found a flaw in Black's plan and with 29.Nh5! followed by 30.f4 he opened up lines for the white rooks to penetrate on the d-file. After the capture of the black pawn on f7, [...] the white pawn on e5 became a dangerous passed pawn. White's king was in position to block the black pawns while the white pawns proved unstoppable. Anand resigned on move 45, thus conceding the match and Carlsen retained the title of World Chess Champion.|$|E
60|$|There are {{yet other}} ants, {{such as the}} workerless Anergates, in which the {{degradation}} of slaveholding has gone yet further. These wretched creatures are the formican representatives of those Oriental despots who are no longer even warlike, but are sunk in sloth and luxury, and pass their lives in eating bang or smoking opium. Once upon a time, Sir John Lubbock thinks, the ancestors of Anergates were marauding slaveowners, who attacked and made serfs of other ants. But gradually they lost not only their arts but even their military prowess, and were reduced to making war by stealth instead of openly carrying off their slaves in fair battle. It seems probable that they now creep into a nest of the far more powerful slave ants, poison or assassinate the queen, and establish themselves by sheer usurpation in the <b>queenless</b> nest. 'Gradually,' says Sir John Lubbock, 'even their bodily force dwindled away under the enervating influence to which they had subjected themselves, until they sank to their present degraded condition--weak in body and mind, few in numbers, and apparently nearly extinct, the miserable representatives of far superior ancestors maintaining a precarious existence as contemptible parasites of their former slaves.' One may observe in passing that these wretched do-nothings cannot have been the ants which Solomon commended to the favourable consideration of the sluggard; though it is curious that the text was never pressed into the service of defence for the peculiar institution by the advocates of slavery in the South, who were always most anxious to prove the righteousness of their cause by most sure and certain warranty of Holy Scripture.|$|E
50|$|There is much {{variation}} in the social structure of ant colonies with gamergates. Some species such as Harpegnathos saltator, Pseudoneoponera tridentata, Gnamptogenys menadensis, and Rhytidoponera confusa have a winged alate queen caste as well as gamergates. <b>Queenless</b> species with only gamergates and workers may have a monogynous structure with a single gamergate or {{they may have a}} polygynous structure with multiple gamergates. Examples of monogynous <b>queenless</b> species include Pachycondyla krugeri, P. sublaevis, Diacamma australe, D. rugosum, Dinoponera quadriceps, Platythyrea lamellosa, and Streblognathus aethiopicus. Examples of polygynous <b>queenless</b> species include Ophthalmopone berthoudi, O. hottentota, and all known <b>queenless</b> species of Rhytidoponera. In the <b>queenless</b> Ophthalmopone berthoudi, foreign males visit underground nests to mate with young workers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Queenless</b> colonies {{therefore}} face a reproductive dilemma. Once {{a colony}} becomes <b>queenless,</b> some workers activate their ovaries within {{just four days}} and lay eggs in a last effort to ensure gene survival before the colony disappears via absconding behavior. In <b>queenless</b> colonies, worker policing decreases as all workers lay male eggs. However, the dilemma occurs when other workers parasitize a <b>queenless</b> colony and thus worker policing may be re-installed to some extent in this case. Workers that contribute resources and/or time to a <b>queenless</b> colony may succumb to the Concorde fallacy, in which investing in a colony with high rates of parasitism diminishes reproductive success {{and the benefits of}} remaining within that colony. Therefore, <b>queenless</b> colonies are observed to abscond within three weeks of losing a queen. This further supports the notion that Apis florea prefer to have a queenright colony and use worker policing as an ESS.|$|E

50|$|In studies, A. andreniformis {{has shown}} a lack of {{recognition}} for its own species and nestmates. This {{has been shown in}} studies where <b>queenless</b> colonies of A. florea have joined the colony of A. andreniformis without facing aggression upon their initial arrival. Similarly, <b>queenless</b> colonies of A. andreniformis have been seen to join A. florea colonies, but in these cases, any A. andreniformis larva are usually destroyed by the host colony, preventing parasitism from the foreign species. Worker bees of A. florea have complete reproductive dominance over A. Andreniformis in a <b>queenless</b> nest because they have recognition and kin selection, while A. Andreniformis does not. However, when a queen is present, worker bees do not reproduce and parasitism is turned off.|$|E

50|$|Queen bees {{can control}} {{oogenesis}} in worker bees by suppressing juvenile hormone (JH) in the workers, which regulates egg development. Among <b>queenless</b> B. terrestris workers, the corpora allata, which secrete JH, was noticeably enlarged compared to queenright workers. JH concentrations were also {{higher in the}} hemolymph of <b>queenless</b> workers. This suggests {{that the presence of}} a queen is enough to prevent workers from laying eggs, which helps her maintain genetic control over her colony's brood. The mechanism through which the queen induces this behavior is likely through pheromones.|$|E
50|$|Diacamma rugosum, {{also known}} as Bornean <b>queenless</b> ant, is a species of ant of the {{subfamily}} Ponerinae. It is found from many countries throughout the world. 20 subspecies are recognized.|$|E

50|$|Slide in {{floor in}} place: By sliding the floor into the Cloake board, the single {{functioning}} colony is now {{divided into two}} parts - a queenright lower colony and a <b>queenless</b> upper colony. The lower entrance is re-opened, allowing bees in the queenright section to exit the hive. When those bees return, they will do so to the upper entrance, but {{not be able to}} enter the lower colony. This results in a higher population of bees in the upper colony. The upper colony is typically left alone for 24 hours for a settling period, in which the bees determine that they are <b>queenless,</b> and prepare to replace their missing queen.|$|E

50|$|Dinoponera {{quadriceps}} is a <b>queenless</b> {{species of}} ants in the subfamily Ponerinae. The species, known from Brazil, {{is similar to}} Dinoponera mutica and uses venom for subduing large live prey and defense. Its venom could be of use to the pharmaceutical industry.|$|E
50|$|Dinoponera lucida {{is a large}} <b>queenless</b> {{species of}} ant in the {{subfamily}} Ponerinae. The species, endemic to Brazil, is threatened by habitat destruction. Workers range from 27 to 30 mm in body length, which is slightly larger than the related species Dinoponera australis, but smaller than other large ants. Males are unknown.|$|E
50|$|Even in {{a normal}} hive, about 1% of workers have ovaries {{developed}} enough to lay eggs. However the usual number of the laid eggs is very small. Only eight eggs (seven moderately and one fully developed) were found after examining of 10,634 worker bees (strong colony contains about 100,000). Workers eventually lay significant numbers of eggs only in <b>queenless</b> colonies.|$|E
50|$|Grafted cells Installed: The <b>queenless</b> upper colony is now {{prepared}} to raise queens, and by inserting queen rearing bars with grafted larvae, the beekeeper provides candidates for new queens. At this time any emergency queen cells {{will be removed}} by the beekeeper. Stage three continues for one to two days, {{long enough for the}} cells to be fully accepted and built up.|$|E
50|$|Virgin queens {{appear to}} have little queen {{pheromone}} and often {{do not appear to}} be recognized as queens by the workers.
