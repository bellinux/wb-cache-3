2500|$|Metolazone is a quinazoline, a {{derivative}} of the similar diuretic <b>quinethazone,</b> {{as well as}} a sulfonamide. It is related to analogs of 1,2,4-benzothiadizine-1,1-dioxide (benzothiadiazine). These drugs are called benzothiadiazides, or thiazides for short. Chemically, metolazone is not a substituted benzothiadiazine, and therefore is not technically a thiazide. However, since metolazone, as well as other drugs like indapamide, act on the same target as thiazides and behave in a similar pharmacologic fashion, they are considered [...] "thiazide-like diuretics". Therefore, they are often included in the thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves.|$|E

40|$|Medical student {{participation}} in a controlled doubleblind clinical bioassay provides an effective introduction to clinical pharmacology and perhaps the best stimulus to the future rational evaluation and use of drugs. In one such exercise, 27 volunteers were divided into three groups: one received 50 mg. <b>quinethazone,</b> one 500 mg. chlorothiazide and the third a lactose placebo. Urine was collected for three 90 -minute periods, volume and pH being recorded; sodium and potassium were measured with a flame photometer, and chloride by the Volhard technique. Although this study was primarily a comparative bioassay of two established diuretics against a placebo, no previous direct comparisons of these diuretics {{could be found in}} the literature. The diuretic activity of chlorothiazide and <b>quinethazone</b> compared to placebo therapy was confirmed in both humans and rats, the use of controls was illustrated, and a higher mean sodium-potassium ratio for <b>quinethazone</b> than for chlorothiazide was demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Modulation {{of kidney}} cyclic AMP pdase by diuretics and antihypertensives was studied. It {{was found that}} {{spironolactone}} activates pdase and that furosemide, ethacrynic acid, triameterine, <b>quinethazone,</b> metolazone, chlorothiazide, propranolol and hydralazine, inhibit pdase. The relative tissue specificity (medulla or cortex) {{for some of the}} compounds appears to be in agreement with the proposed sites of drug action via pharmocological mechanisms which do not involve Inter action with cAMP pdase. The specific activity of pdase in the medulla was found to be double that in the cortex. Pdase was found to be a complex enzyme with at least two separate sets of kinetic parameters...|$|E
