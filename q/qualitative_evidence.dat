2500|$|Speakers of Cornish reside {{primarily}} in Cornwall {{which has a}} population of just 536,000 (2014). There are also some speakers living outside Cornwall, particularly in the countries of the Cornish diaspora, as well as other Celtic nations. Estimates of the number of Cornish speakers vary according to the definition of being a speaker, and is difficult to accurately determine due to the individualised nature of language take-up. Nevertheless, there is recognition that the number of Cornish speakers is growing. One figure for the mean number of people who know a few basic words, such as knowing that [...] "Kernow" [...] means [...] "Cornwall", was 300,000; the same survey gave the figure of people able to have simple conversations at 3,000. The Cornish Language Strategy project commissioned research to provide quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>evidence</b> for the number of Cornish speakers: due {{to the success of the}} revival project it was estimated that 2,000 people were fluent (surveyed in spring 2008), an increase from the estimated 300 people who spoke Cornish fluently suggested in a study by Kenneth MacKinnon in 2000.

Compared with the deflecting and attracting types of spur-dike, the repelling type has the property of promoting deposition in the wake region of the spur-dike. This property is caused by the difference of flow structure in the vicinity of spur-dike.

30|$|The Madaling slope was not {{instrumented}} {{before and}} during the landslide occurrence. Therefore, direct validations of the simulated run-out behaviours become practically impossible. These limitations have restricted the possibility of performing quantitative comparisons between the numerical simulation results and the field data. Nonetheless, the computations of important quantities such as run-out velocity and distance, as well as thickness of deposition can still be verified from the post-failure field investigation. These indirect validations/comparisons could increase the level of confidence towards the validity of the simulated results. Crosta et al. (2003) reported that in situ evidences like major tension or shear cracks, post-event descriptions of the main failure surface and depositions could be useful <b>qualitative</b> <b>evidences</b> to validate the simulation results. Numerous researchers adopted laboratory scaled granular flow experiments or down-scaled slope models to validate the actual run-out behaviours of landslides (Major 1997; Lajeunesse et al. 2006; D’Agostino et al. 2010). These laboratory experiments can be performed in future studies to improve the insightfulness of the investigation.|$|R

Also, job satisfaction and visibility are other aspects raised by the interviewees when getting mature in agile methods. For instance, interviewee B stated, “People are happier, people understand what they are doing, the corporate climate is coolest”. In Company G, the perception of benefit is similar. The project is owned by the team. Some people became more motivated with agile methods. People are more creative and deliver what makes the difference for the client.

The paper analyzes the partner selection factors in bilateral alliances projects, accordingly to the type of the partner and the type of innovation project. The data come from the case study in one Brazilian petrochemical company, analyzing in-depth 20 alliances projects with different partners – competitors, customers, suppliers, universities; and embodying different innovativeness degree - incremental innovation, platforms, breakthrough and basic science. Founded on the resources based view background, it was possible to identify the more prevalent selecting factors and alliances characteristics depending on the partner type and project type.

5000|$|Holistic Resource Management, {{an acronym}} {{commonly}} mistaken for [...] "Holistic Ranch Management," [...] {{is a system}} of resource management which emphasizes decision making for the long-term. This is a concept identified by Allan Savory, the famed Zimbabwean biologist, rancher, and environmentalist. This concept focuses on healing damaged land, while increasing productivity and sustainability. Range Condition Scoring {{is an important factor}} in this process as it serves as a quantifier. Even though <b>qualitative</b> <b>evidence</b> like [...] "the range looks better" [...] or [...] "it looks like there is better ground cover" [...] or [...] "the grass seems more resilient to drought than in the 1930's because of the way ranchers manage things today," [...] it is important that we use quantitative evidence rather than qualitative. A number of concepts and principles may be in place to solve rangeland health and degradation issues, but none of them are possible if monitoring and quantitative evidence are not present. Savory also developed the Savory brittleness scale which reflects the distribution of humidity throughout the year and how well the land can recover if left after being cleared.|$|E
5000|$|A 2011 {{article that}} {{examines}} the long-term relationship between natural resource reliance and regime type {{across the world}} from 1800 to 2006 reports that increases in natural resource reliance do not induce authoritarianism. With a focus on alleviating the methodological biases of earlier studies, the authors find evidence which suggests that increasing reliance on natural resources promotes democratization, {{the opposite of what}} the Resource curse theory suggests. The researchers provide <b>qualitative</b> <b>evidence</b> for this fact across several countries both here, and in another article; as well as evidence that there is no relationship between resource reliance and authoritarianism in Latin America. The main methodological bias of earlier studies, the authors claim, is the assumption of random effects: [...] "Numerous sources of bias may be driving the results earlier studies on the resource curse, the most serious of which is omitted variable bias induced by unobserved country-specific and time-invariant heterogeneity." [...] In other words, this means that countries might have specific, enduring traits that gets left out of the model, which could increase the explanation power of the argument.
