Although these samples are non-superconducting, they can be employed to generate high quality superconducting samples if used as precursors in the following electrochemical synthesis step. Samples made from Cu 0. 15 Bi 2 Se 3 reliably exhibit zero-resistance even under the non-optimal <b>quenching</b> <b>condition,</b> while samples made from pristine Bi 2 Se 3 require fine tuning of the quenching conditions to achieve similar performance. Moreover, under the optimal <b>quenching</b> <b>condition,</b> the average superconducting shielding fraction was still lower in the samples made from pristine Bi 2 Se 3 than in the samples made from Cu 0. 15 Bi 2 Se 3.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of premixed laminar flame in ducts {{of circular cross-section}} considering a thermal-diffusive model is investigated numerically. Heat losses by conduction to the channels walls {{are taken into account}} using the thermally thin wall regime. The effects and the relationship between thickness and diameter of the tube with the flame speed propagation are studied and the <b>quenching</b> <b>condition</b> is obtained {{as a function of the}} heat-loss parameter. The mathematical model employs the axisymmetric energy and species equations. The calculations are based on a two-step chemistry, with an Arrhenius, energetically neutral, radical production reaction followed by an exothermic radical recombination reaction. For large values of the heat-loss parameter, the wall temperature is close to the free stream temperature and all the heat losses through the wall are convected away. No heat feedback occurs. On the other hand, for small values of the heat-loss parameter, a feedback mechanism occurs by transferring heat from the burned gas to the fresh mixture along the tube wall. For values of the heat-loss parameter of order unity, the heat feedback mechanism is able to sustain the flame propagation and the <b>quenching</b> <b>condition</b> disappears, producing an almost planar flame front as the propagation velocity reduces. For this two-step reaction mechanism, the radical species behaviour at the duct walls seems to have negligible effect on the quenching process...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results from characterization of the failure behaviour of hot stamped USIBOR® 1500 -AS steel sheet with tailored properties. A phenomenological approach is used in which failure strain is characterized {{as a function of}} stress state and as-hot stamped condition, {{based on the results of}} an extensive experimental campaign. A range of material <b>quench</b> <b>conditions</b> are investigated, resulting in a multitude of material microstructures. Considering the framework for tailored hot stamping using in die heating to achieve different material responses, six different material <b>quench</b> <b>conditions</b> were considered in this work, ranging from fully martensitic (Vickers microhardness of 485 HV) to a mixed ferrite-bainite microstructure (185 HV). Four of the material <b>quench</b> <b>conditions</b> investigated were produced using laboratory equipment, while the remainder were obtained from tailored axial crush components that were quenched with die temperatures of 400 and 700 °C. Miniature shear, butterfly, hole expansion, hole tensile, and hemispherical dome tests were developed for fracture characterization of sheet metal and digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were used extensively in order to obtain fracture strains and strain paths for the different experiments. Notched tensile specimens were also tested, however these specimens were not used for fracture characterization, due to their non-proportional loading paths and indeterminate fracture locations. Considering fracture strain to be a function of stress state and assuming the material investigated in this work to be isotropic and von Mises yielding, the equivalent strain at fracture and stress triaxiality of each experiment was determined from DIC-measured major and minor strains. Fracture loci were then calibrated for different material <b>quench</b> <b>conditions.</b> The validity of the experimental fracture locus was probed using a number of non-proportional loading experiments, in which specimens were initially pre-strained in equi-biaxial tension, before being subjected to loading states of simple shear or uniaxial tension. Additionally, work was done to adapt and apply the experimental fracture loci to impact simulations of hot stamped components with tailored properties, requiring development of “model dependent fracture loci”. There was found to be an inverse relationship between material hardness and measured fracture strain, with the fully martensitic material <b>quench</b> <b>condition</b> (485 HV) possessing the lowest ductility, while the greatest fracture strains were measured in the samples produced through die quenching at 700 °C (185 HV). For the range of material conditions considered, the lowest fracture strains corresponded to a plane strain loading condition, while the fracture strains measured in simple shear were considerably greater. The material <b>quench</b> <b>conditions,</b> ordered in increasing ductility, are as follows (fracture strains for simple shear and plane-strain tension included in parentheses) : fully martensitic (0. 54, 0. 15), intermediate forced air quench (0. 68, 0. 22), fully bainitic (0. 90, 0. 36), 400 °C die quench (1. 01, 0. 38), and 700 °C die quench (1. 05, 0. 44) ...|$|R

Opposite to normal hardness distribution it shows lower hardness at the surface and higher hardness in the core. This phenomenon takes place dependent on: hardenability of the steel, cross-section size of the workpiece and on <b>quenching</b> <b>condition.</b> It {{is related to the}} delayed quenching with discontinuous change of cooling rate, and to the incubation period consumed before changing the cooling rate. Own experiments using cylindrical specimens of 50 mm Dia, made of the same heat of AISI- 4140 stee 1 have shown that polymer solutions (PAG) of high concentration may reproducible cause delayed quenching and yield inverse hardness distribution. This Controllable Delayed Quenching (CDQ) technology, influencing intentionally the dynamics of heat extraction, has a great potential to increase the depth of hardening, compared to conventi onal quenching practice. After tempering a workpiece having inverse hardness distribution to suitable tempering temperature, uniform microstructure of tempered martensite, giving the best impact toughness, can be obtained through the whole cross-section.

40|$|As a {{fundamental}} study to understand characteristics in catalyst-assisted combustion, numerical simulations of two canonical models are performed. For a stagnation-point flow combustor with a catalytic surface, parametric studies are conducted {{to investigate the}} effects of strain rate, equivalence ratio and heat loss on the combustion and extinction modes. The steady results showed that catalysis largely extends the strain-induced extinction limit, while suppressing the gas phase reaction at lower strain rates. The temperature versus strain rate response curves exhibit multiple branches of stable solutions, implying a possibility of hysteresis behavior in a coupled homogeneous-heterogeneous reactor. In the lean extinction limit investigation, {{results show that the}} level of flammability extension by surface reaction depends strongly on the mixture dilution, such that the benefit of catalyst-assisted lean combustion can be fully realized only with a diluted system. These observations are explained by consideration of characteristic time scales calculated from the fuel consumption rate. The extinction response to an oscillatory strain rate also shows consistent behavior. Experimental validation was carried out to demonstrate simulation conclusions. It was found the substrate surface heat loss condition is a key factor to match simulation result with experimental results. Radiation and conductive heat loss through the surface in the experiment could be modeled as one effective heat loss coefficient, and that coefficient is relevant to both the flow rate (related with strain rate) and the surface temperature at that time. Thus an iteration process could be used to find the extinction condition for a fixed flow rate. Parametric studies on heat loss, equivalence ratio and device dimension for micro-channel flow configuration are conducted to research the combustion stability at near quenching conditions. A parallel DNS code supplemented by flame position capturing ability is applied. The results show the flame <b>quenching</b> <b>condition</b> is mainly affected by channel width and equivalence ratio at current parameter range. Channel wall heat loss shows influence on flame propagation speed but not on quenching conditions. Flame shape is affected by both equivalence ratio and heat loss.

40|$|Nanoparticles {{represent}} {{a very exciting}} new area of research. Their small size, ranging from several nanometers to tens of nanometers, is responsible for many changes in the structural, thermal, electromagnetic, optical and mechanical properties {{in comparison with the}} bulk solid of the same materials. However, promoting the use of such material requires well-controlled synthesis techniques to be developed. Inductively coupled thermal plasma (ICTP) reactors have been shown to offer unique advantages over other synthesis methods. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a numerical model to assist the design of an ICTP reactor for the efficient and controlled production of nanoparticles at industrial scale. The complete model describes the evaporation of the micron-sized precursor particles in the plasma flow and the subsequent formation of the nanoparticles in the quenching reactor. The plasma flow is described by a coupled system of the fluid mechanics equations of continuity, momentum, and energy with the vector potential formulation of Maxwell's equations. The solid particles precursors are treated following a Lagrangian approach, taking into account the vapor production field in the plasma flow. An Eulerian model based on the method of moments with interpolative closure is used to describe the formation of nanoparticles by simultaneous nucleation and growth by condensation and coagulation. The coupled plasma torch, particle evaporation and nanoparticle formation models are implemented in 2 D and 3 D configurations, using the OpenFoam source code. The results show that the effects of the particle evaporation on the temperature field are substantial, even for low particle mass loading. The associated vapor concentration which enters in the reactor has then a direct influence on the formation of nanoparticles. The effects of the plasma torch parameters and the quenching configuration (quench type, position, injection angle and cooling rate) on the contribution of the different formation mechanisms and on the generated particle's size and distribution are studied in both 2 D axi-symmetric and 3 D geometries. The quench mechanism strongly affects the temperature and the vapor concentration in the reactor, and consequently has an impact on the final particle size distribution. It is shown that the size of the nanoparticles obtained for different quenching conditions is not only a consequence of the cooling rate but also of the trajectories of the vapor and the generated particles imposed by quenching gas. The results have also demonstrated that the predicted particle are smaller and more sensitive to the modifications of the <b>quenching</b> <b>condition</b> when quenching at high temperature. The sensitivity of the complete model to the physical properties of the vapor (vapor pressure and surface tension) is also investigated, in order to identify their effect on the final particle size. The results obtained provide an insight into the phenomena involved during the production of nanoparticles and enable the improvement of ICTP rectors design and nanoparticles synthesis process.

Final mechanical properties, such as residual stress and hardness profiles, therefore depend on optimum parameters of a quenching process and monitoring of the process itself. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of sound emission in the course of quenching process. Due to heat transfer from a specimen’s surface to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur round a heated specimen, which strongly affects quenching. An investigation of sound emission in the quenching process was carried out with cylindrical specimens made of chrome-molybdenum heat-treatable steel 42 CrMo 4 quenched in different quenching media. Sound-pressure signals demonstrated by different amplitudes depending on time at different frequencies are shown in 3 D diagrams.

40|$|Cast {{aluminum}} alloys are usually subject to solution treatment, quenching, and aging hardening for improved mechanical properties. Cooling rate during quenching {{plays an important}} role in residual stress, distortion, and mechanical property distributions in the resultant cast aluminum components. As the cooling rates of work pieces heavily depend on the interfacial heat transfer coefficient (HTC) between work pieces and quenchants, it is important to understand how HTC varies with different <b>quenching</b> <b>conditions</b> so that optimal quenching process can be achieved. In this study, a quenching system and an experimental procedure of obtaining HTC are presented. A series of experiments have been conducted to study the variations of HTC with respect to air temperature, air humidity, air velocity, and part orientation...|$|R
40|$|Spin {{hardening}} is {{the most}} popular induction gear hardening approach, and it is particularly appropriate for gears having fi ne- and medium-size teeth (Figure 8). Gears are rotated during heating to ensure an even distribution of energy. Single-turn or multi-turn inductors that encircle the whole gear can be used (Ref. 1). When applying encircling coils, there are fi ve parameters that play major roles in obtaining the required hardness pat-tern: frequency, power, cycle time, coil geometry and <b>quenching</b> <b>conditions.</b> Figure 9 illustrates a diversity of induction hardening patterns that were obtained with variations in heat time, frequency and power (Ref. 1). As a rule, when it is necessary to harden only the tooth tips, a higher frequency and high power density should be applie...|$|R
40|$|We {{overview}} {{experimental and}} theoretical studies of energy transfer in the photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes LH 1, LH 2, and LHCII performed {{during the past}} decade since the discovery of high-resolution structure of these complexes. Experimental findings obtained with various spectroscopic techniques makes possible a modelling of the excitation dynamics at a quantitative level. The modified Redfield theory allows a precise assignment of the energy transfer pathways together with a direct visualization of the whole excitation dynamics where various regimes from a coherent motion of delocalized exciton to a hopping of localized excitations are superimposed. In a single complex it is possible to observe the switching between these regimes driven by slow conformational motion (as we demonstrate for LH 2). Excitation dynamics under <b>quenched</b> <b>conditions</b> in higher-plant complexes is discussed. © the Owner Societies 2006...|$|R
