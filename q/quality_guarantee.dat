40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{constraint}} optimization (DCOP) is {{a promising}} approach to coordination, scheduling and task allocation in multi agent networks. DCOP is NP- hard [6], so an important {{line of work}} focuses on developing fast incomplete solution algorithms that can provide guaran-tees {{on the quality of}} their local optimal solutions. Region optimality [11] is a promising approach along this line: it provides <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees</b> for region optimal solutions, namely solutions that are optimal in a specific region of the DCOP. Region optimality generalises k- and t-optimality [7, 4] by allowing to explore the space of criteria that define regions to look for solutions with better <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees.</b> Unfortunately, previous work in region-optimal <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees</b> fail to exploit any a-priori knowledge of the reward structure of the problem. This paper addresses this shortcoming by defining reward-dependent re-gion optimal <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees</b> that exploit two different levels of knowl-edge about rewards, namely: (i) a ratio between the least minimum re-ward to the maximum reward among relations; and (ii) the minimum and maximum rewards per relation. ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{commercial}} organisations, open-sourcing {{their own}} designs obviously means {{they can no}} longer make large profits through the traditional engineering business model of acting as the monopoly manufacturer or seller, because the open design can be manufactured and sold by anyone including direct competitors. Profit from engineering can come from three main sources: design, manufacturing, and support. As with other open source business models, commercial designers typically make profit via their association with the brand, which may still be trademarked. A valuable brand allows them to command a premium for their own manufactured products, as it can be associated with high quality and provide a <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> to customers. The same brand is also used to command a premium on associated services, such as providing installation, maintenance, and integration support for the product. Again customers will typically pay more for the knowledge that this support is provided directly by the original designer, who therefore knows the product better than competitors.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{demand in}} {{relation}} to food is increasingly shifting towards products that are safe, nutritious, and of good eating quality. Beef consumers are demanding for experience quality that matches their quality expectations formed prior to consumption, {{particularly with respect to}} beef tenderness. The development of a beef <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> system, backed up by objective knowledge obtained through muscle profiling research, can allow the beef industry to meet these consumer demands. A qualitative consumer study has been carried out to assess European consumers’ opinions about beef quality and beef related technologies. This paper reports on consumer opinions and perceptions about muscle profiling and a beef <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> system. Findings indicate that both concepts are well accepted by European beef consumers, although not unconditional. The insights obtained from this study indicate good opportunities {{for the development of a}} beef <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> system in Europe.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{an approach to}} provide approximate, anytime algorithms for DCOPs that can provide <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees.</b> At this aim, we propose the divide-and-coordinate (DaC) approach. Such approach amounts to solving a DCOP by iterating (1) a divide stage in which agents divide the DCOP into a set of simpler local subproblems and solve them; and (2) a coordinate stage in which agents exchange local information that brings them closer to an agreement. Next, we formulate a novel algorithm, the Divide and Coordinate Subgradient Algorithm (DaCSA), a computational realization of DaC based on Lagrangian decompositions and the dual subgradient method. By relying on the DaC approach, DaCSA provides bounded approximate solutions. We empirically evaluate DaCSA showing that it is competitive with other state-ofthe-art DCOP approximate algorithms and can eventually outperform them while providing useful <b>quality</b> <b>guarantees...</b>|$|R

This work proposes a fast mapmatching algorithm which exploits tracking data error estimates in a provably correct way and offers a <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the computed result trajectory. A new model for the map-matching task is introduced which takes tracking error estimates into account. The proposed Adaptive Clipping algorithm (i) provably solves this map-matching task and (ii) utilizes the weak Fréchet distance to measure similarity between curves. The algorithm uses the error estimates in the trajectory data to reduce the search space (error-aware pruning), while offering the <b>quality</b> <b>guarantee</b> of finding a curve which minimizes the weak Fréchet distance to the vehicle trajectory among all possible curves in the road network. Moreover, this work introduces an outputsensitive variant of an existing weak Fréchet map-matching algorithm, which is also employed in the Adaptive Clipping algorithm. Output-sensitiveness paired with error-aware pruning makes Adaptive Clipping the first map-matching algorithm that provably solves a well-defined map-matching task. An experimental evaluation establishes further that Adaptive Clipping is also in a practical setting a fast algorithm {{that at the same time}} produces high-quality matching results. ...|$|E
