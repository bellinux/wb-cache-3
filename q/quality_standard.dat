The theoretical part of the piece of work deals with defining the terms pertaining to the <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> of social services in care homes for the elderly. These are the terms ?old age?, ?need?, ?care home for the elderly?, ?social services?, ?<b>quality</b> <b>standards?,</b> and ?client?. The aim of the dissertation was to map the fulfilment and realisation of selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> in care homes for the elderly. Partial aims were {{to determine the extent of}} fulfilment of <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> from the point of view of the client and to compare the individual levels of application of the <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> for social services. Two care homes were chosen for the study, the Care Home for the Elderly Tep in Veselí nad Lužnicí and the Care Home for the Elderly in Horní Stropnice. Two hypotheses were established. Quantitative research was chosen to facilitate reaching the aims and verifying the hypotheses, utilising questioning methods, interviewing techniques and questionnaire enquiry. Furthermore, analysing the data was accomplished using secondary document analysis. The research file contained the clients and staff of both selected care homes for the elderly. Following the evaluation of the results I believe that the aims of the dissertation were fulfilled. Selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are realised well in both care homes for the elderly and the essential criteria of individual <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are fulfilled as well. In addition, the research study proved both hypotheses to be correct. Selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> are fulfilled from the point of view of the clients and at the same time applied in accordance with their needs. The dissertation can provide the selected care homes for the elderly with feedback regarding the fulfilment and realisation of selected <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> of social services.

The strikes occurred after Apple implemented a stricter <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> on their products, which includes a 0.02mm restriction on indentations inflicted during production, and imposed demands related to scratches on frames and back covers. The strikes were also attributed to the employer forcing employees {{to work on a}} public holiday.

During the strike, conflicts between quality control inspectors and employees resulted in brawls. China Labor Watch also claimed that concerns raised by inspectors were not addressed by factory management.

The magazine was very popular in Wallonia, but struggled in Flanders, where The Adventures of Tintin was not yet as well known. A popular Flemish author would give the sales a boost, while it could mean the breakthrough on the French language market for Vandersteen. However, Hergé, as editor-in-chief, set a very high <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> for his magazine, and Vandersteen had to improve and stylize his drawings, and had to remove the more Flemish, popular aspects of his comics. Vandersteen obliged, and the stories of Suske en Wiske he created for Kuifje are now considered the best of his career, with the first one, Het Spaanse Spook (The Spanish Ghost), which started on 16 September 1948, as his masterpiece.
