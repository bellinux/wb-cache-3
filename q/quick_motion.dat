2500|$|The poem's conceit has {{numerous}} parallels in Shakespeare's plays. Sidney Lee compares [...] "flatter" [...] (line 2) to {{a similar}} usage in King John 3.1.77-80. Steevens, Edward Capell, and Henry Brown note parallels in other plays. Edmond Malone glosses [...] "rack" [...] (line 6) as [...] "the <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of the clouds"; [...] "region" [...] (10), a term for {{a division of the}} atmosphere, echoes and amplifies the reference. Rolfe notes that [...] "forlorn" [...] (line 7) was in Elizabethan pronunciation with the accent on the first syllable when it follows an unaccented syllable.|$|E
6000|$|Then, with a <b>quick</b> <b>motion,</b> {{he flung}} the apples to a distance, all save one, which he {{presented}} to {{a tall man}} who stood near, adding: ...|$|E
60|$|The other constable {{was facing}} the clock-case, where he saw {{reflected}} in the glass a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> by the landlady. Turning sharply, he caught her closing the oven-door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined Mr. Bumble, {{making a}} <b>quicker</b> <b>motion</b> towards the door. 'I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear! You are so very violent, that really I--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{butterfly}} {{fish are}} remarkably active," [...] said the Princess, [...] "and their <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> {{protect them from}} their enemies. We like to meet them; they are always so gay and good-natured." ...|$|R
60|$|Admiral Bluewater, who {{had taken}} his usual lolling {{attitude}} in the most comfortable chair he could find, while his more mercurial friend kept pacing the room, now raised his head in surprise, following the <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> of the other, with his eyes, as if he doubted whether he had rightly heard the question.|$|R
60|$|Teddy {{was about}} to ask if he could take off the pack, for the cords were cutting into his flesh in a painful manner; but the Indian checked him with a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of the hand.|$|E
60|$|The man {{lowered his}} head as if to see the {{interior}} more plainly, and, unperceived by any one in the little apartment, made a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> with his hand, evidently for the benefit of those aboard the brig.|$|E
60|$|Miss Heydinger made no answer. Her silence {{astonished}} him. For {{nearly twenty}} seconds perhaps they sat without speaking. With a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> she stood up, {{and at once}} he stood up before her. Her face was flushed, her eyes downcast.|$|E
30|$|Unlike the FS {{which has}} a fixed search range, search points and search range of ACQPPS depend on video {{sequence}}s. ACQPPS search points will be increased, if a video sequence contains considerable or <b>quick</b> <b>motions.</b> On the contrary, search points can be reduced, if a video sequence includes slow or small amount of motions.|$|R
50|$|The {{beads and}} rods are often {{lubricated}} to ensure <b>quick,</b> smooth <b>motion.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind him, and then, with his <b>quickest</b> <b>motion,</b> raised the lid and put within the box, just under the bit of work on which she was employed, a light small paper parcel. It {{contained}} the purse which she had worked for him, and had given to him with such sweet affection at the Chiswick flower-show.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl was}} no enchantress, and knew no magic spell; yet {{what she said}} took almost magical effect on her young mistress. She lifted her head with the <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of revived sensation; she shot, not a languid, but a lifelike, {{questioning}} glance at Fanny.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be found out," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "Duck now, so they won't see us." [...] And with a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of the oar he possessed he sent the flat-bottomed boat in among some tall grass which bordered the creek at this point.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it's in my pocket," [...] he flashed, {{and with}} a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> he tore out the {{marriage}} license and thrust it upon her. As her dark eyes took in {{the meaning of the}} paper, and her expression changed, Lane gazed down upon her with a commingling of emotions.|$|E
5000|$|Although Flying Scooters are {{generally}} considered a mild ride, a skilled rider can [...] "snap" [...] the cables suspending the vehicle. Snapping {{is caused by}} the cables slacking due to <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> of the vehicle. Snapping is made easier on a faster Flying Scooters ride; however, some newer models are designed to prevent snapping. Snapping is sometimes discouraged due to maintenance and safety reasons.|$|R
5000|$|Long's {{signature}} defensive {{move was}} the [...] "rip," [...] which employed a <b>quick,</b> uppercut-like <b>motion</b> designed to break an opposing blocker's grip.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{was a man}} of splendid {{stature and}} of {{enormous}} strength. His appearance was in some respects rather Saxon than Norman, for his hair was light and his complexion clear and bright. He wore the moustache and pointed beard at that time in fashion; and although his expression was generally that of frankness and good humour, there might be observed in his <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> and piercing glances signs of the hasty temper and unbridled passion which went far to wreck the success of the enterprise upon which he was embarked.|$|R
60|$|She made a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> forward. Then {{she stopped}} short, {{and lifted her}} eyes to the door. Her cheeks burned, and her heart beat fast. Sir Allan Beaumerville was {{standing}} on the threshold, looking at her in mute amazement, and over his shoulder was the pale stern face of Mr. Brown.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly Norrak pushed one {{blade of}} his paddle among the straps and cordage, overset the kayak, and worked himself up {{again with a}} <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of the other blade. Of course this was not done either easily or quickly. Nevertheless, it was {{accomplished}} by both lads to the entire satisfaction of their critics.|$|E
60|$|Billy Byrne {{would have}} {{asserted}} with some show of asperity {{that he was}} nothing if not American; but Bridge was quick to see a possible loophole for escape for his friend in Pesita's belief that Billy was no gringo, and warned the latter to silence by a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of his head.|$|E
6000|$|With one {{of those}} <b>quick,</b> {{impulsive}} <b>motions</b> which were so natural to her in doing a kindness, she drew off her own and said, 'Take mine if they will serve you.' ...|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} he heard {{a step in the}} hall and a hand on the door, and as he did so with <b>quick</b> eager <b>motion</b> he hid the {{document}} under the book.|$|R
40|$|Low power {{actuation}} of sessile droplets is {{of primary}} interest for portable or hybrid lab-on-a-chip and harmless manipulation of biofluids. In this paper, {{we show that}} the acoustic power required to move or deform droplets via surface acoustic waves can be substantially reduced through the forcing of the drops inertio-capillary modes of vibrations. Indeed, harmonic, superharmonic and subharmonic (parametric) excitation of these modes are observed when the high frequency acoustic signal (19. 5 MHz) is modulated around Rayleigh-Lamb inertio-capillary frequencies. This resonant behavior results in larger oscillations and <b>quicker</b> <b>motion</b> of the drops than in the non-modulated case...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father! hush--father! I come--I come!" [...] he darted by his keeper and was {{the next}} moment pinned to the wall by the bayonet of another of the band. Fortunately, his <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> had caused him to escape a thrust aimed at his life, and it was by his clothes only that he was confined.|$|E
60|$|The boat now {{moved at}} the rate of five miles in the hour, or faster than a man walks, even when in <b>quick</b> <b>motion.</b> Its rising and falling denoted the long heavy swell of the ocean, and the wash of water began to be more and more audible, as she settled into the {{sluggish}} swells.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{this order}} was received, all the surveyor's men obeyed, opening the order of their march, and {{spreading}} themselves {{in a way to}} extend their means of observing materially. When all was ready, a sign was made to the Indian to proceed. Susquesus obeyed, and we were all soon in <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> again.|$|E
60|$|He {{would have}} {{approached}} her nearer, but she drew back, twitching her long white skirt behind {{her with a}} single <b>quick</b> feminine <b>motion</b> of her hand, as if to save it from contamination.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Olive, {{giving a}} <b>quick,</b> forward <b>motion</b> on the bench, [...] "you think I ought {{to settle this}} matter immediately, and relieve myself at once from the {{imputation}} of trifling with earnest affection?" ...|$|R
60|$|The puma {{had struck}} on his back. Now {{he had turned}} over and was {{crouching}} down, like a cat getting ready to pounce upon a bird, his bushy tail sweeping the grass with <b>quick,</b> nervous <b>motion.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} it, Jamie, as a loan {{wherewith}} to begin anew the life I {{was about to}} fling away as readily as I do this;" [...] and with a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> he sent a vial whirling down into the street. [...] "I'll try the world once more in a humbler spirit, and have faith in you, at least, my little Providence." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} {{paused in the}} act of twirling the spindle, turned round {{to the rest of the}} party, lifted her withered, trembling, and clay-coloured hand, raised up her ashen-hued and {{wrinkled}} face, which the <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> of two light-blue eyes chiefly distinguished from the visage of a corpse, and, as if catching at any touch of association with the living world, answered, [...] "What gars the Glenallan family inter their dead by torchlight, said the lassie?--Is there a Glenallan dead e'en now?" ...|$|E
60|$|He laid hold of Francesco's leg to {{drag him}} to the ground, but the Count {{wrenched}} it free by a <b>quick</b> <b>motion</b> that left a gash from his spur upon the captain's hands. Simultaneously he raised his whip, and would have laid the lash of it across the broad of Fortemani's back--for it had angered him beyond words to have a ruffian of this fellow's quality seeking to ruffle it with him--but at that moment a female voice, stern and imperative, bade them hold in their quarrel.|$|E
50|$|A {{cut back}} to reality shows Radhika still {{confused}} and blaming her friend Rita for not helping her out. Rita then propounds her thesis with a plate of biscuits and a knife. There’s Radhika and the unborn baby, Sakshi, Nikhil and Krish, all represented by the biscuits. Rita moves the biscuits around the plate showing her the various permutations and combinations, and finally narrows {{it down to a}} straight choice between Krish and Nikhil, alternating the knife in <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> on the two biscuits that represent them. Finally, Rita asks Radhika to eat up, and the two women now spontaneously break out into laughter at the situation Radhika is so tightly meshed up in.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a novel and unsupervised approach for discovering "sudden" movements in video surveillance videos. The proposed approach automatically detects <b>quick</b> <b>motions</b> in a video, corresponding to any action. A set of possible actions {{is not required}} and the proposed method successfully detects potentially alarm-raising actions without training or camera calibration. Moreover, the system uses a group detection and event recognition framework to relate detected sudden movements and groups of people, and provide a semantical interpretation of the scene. We have tested our approach on a dataset of nearly 8 hours of videos recorded from two cameras in the Parisian subway for a European Project. For evaluation, we annotated 1 hour of sequences containing 50 sudden movements...|$|R
