The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the best working conditions to be utilised to improve a wine making technology (cryomaceration) to produce wines characterised by high qualitative level and an elevated degree of safety. To put in evidence the possible differences on must and wines produced, grapes coming from the same vineyard was macerated at low temperatures utilising both an heath exchanger than the direct addition of CO 2,solid, and the obtained results was compared with that obtained by traditional wine making. The final wines obtained by different operative modalities utilised during prefermentation cold maceration were significantly different according to their phenolic composition, volatile acidity and total -amino nitrogen content. On the basis of the experimental results, the cryomaceration of musts can be considered a prefermentation treatment which allows to obtain high <b>quality</b> <b>white</b> <b>wines,</b> making them more equilibrated, rich of phenolic substances and characterised by a significant flavour so to make them strongly related to their production area (terroir) and then easily identifiable by consumers.

It also explores the attitudes of drinkers with respect to their choice of alcohol type and the practices of papsak drinkers, in order to identify target groups for community level interventions and to inform the consent and monitoring of developmental and/or restrictive interventions.

50|$|Porongurup is {{the fifth}} of the subregions of the Great Southern, just East of Mount Barker; and especially, the slopes facing north and north-east. The Porongorups are a small, {{isolated}} range of intrusive granite, of which slopes enjoy outstanding air drainage. The Porongorups ranges {{has one of the}} richest concentrations of plant species worldwide and is one of only 34 internationally significant hotspots for biodiversity. The Porongurup range {{is one of the oldest}} mountain ranges in the world, dating roughly around 1.1 to 1.4 billion years old which places its formation in the ‘Proterozoic’ Eon. It owes its formation to the massive tectonic forces that have shaped the southern and western coasts of Australia, a likely result of a collision between the Australian and Antarctic landmasses. The climate is Mediterranean with cool to mild winters and warm, sunny summers. While conditions are cooler and more humid higher up in the ranges with occasional snow on the taller peaks for short periods during winter and spring. The soils are ancient, deep karri loams derived from weathered granite. Porongurup is strongly indicated for all high <b>quality</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> varieties such as Riesling, Traminer, Chardonnay, and red wine varieties such as Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier.|$|R

50|$|As of 2008, the Mendoza region {{contained}} {{more than}} 356,000 acres (144,000 hectares) of planted vineyards-producing {{nearly two-thirds of}} the entire Argentine wine production. The principal wine producing areas fall into two main departments - Maipú and Luján, which includes Argentina's first delineated appellation established in 1993 in Luján de Cuyo. With vineyards planted at altitudes between 800 - 1100 m, the Luján de Cuyo region is known particular for its Malbec which seems to thrive in this region as a mean annual temperature of 15 C. Historically the San Rafael region to the south and San Martín region to the east of the city of Mendoza were important centers for wine production. San Rafael was also awarded DOC status in 1993. However the switch to premium wine production of international varieties has diminished their importance. One area of emerging importance in the Mendoza wine region is the Valle de Uco which includes the Tupungato Department featuring vineyards planted nearly 1200 m above sea levels and is emerging as a source for premium <b>quality</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> varietals such as Chardonnay.In the Luján department, areas that may appear on wine labels include the towns of Anchoris, Agrelo, Carrodilla, Chacras de Coria, Las Compuertas, Mayor Drummond, Perdriel, Tres Esquinas, Ugarteche and Vistalba.

40|$|Bentonite fining {{is used in}} the {{clarification}} of <b>white</b> <b>wines</b> to prevent protein haze. This treatment results in the loss of {{a significant portion of the}} wine itself, as well as aroma compounds important for the <b>quality</b> of <b>white</b> <b>wines.</b> Among other interesting effects on wine quality, yeast cell wall mannoproteins have been shown to stabilize wine against protein haze. A previous work showed that wine yeast strains engineered by deletion of KNR 4 release increased amounts of mannoproteins and produce wines showing attenuated responses in protein haze tests. This paper describes the technological properties of several new recombinant wine yeast strains, deleted for genes involved in cell-wall biogenesis, as well as the regulatory gene KNR 4. Stabilization of wines produced by three of the six recombinant strains analyzed required 20 − 40 % less bentonite than those made with their nonrecombinant counterparts. The availability of multiple targets for genetically improving yeast mannoprotein release, as shown in this work, is relevant not only for genetic engineering of wine yeast but especially for the feasibility of genetically improving this character by classical methods of strain development such as random mutagenesis or sexual hybridization.

Low - density plantings of Aromatnyi variety (2222 vines per ha) were characterized by harvest that slightly exceeded the grapes obtained from dense plantations (4000 vines per ha) in terms of carbohydrate - acid and phenolic complexes. The most optimal in terms of the mass concentration of sugars, phenolic substances, polymer forms, macerating ability of must, activity of oxidizing enzyme system was cultivation of this variety on a 160 cm – high trunk. Growing grapes of Zagrey variety with vine spacing, corresponding to 4000 plants per ha, contributed to obtaining harvest with optimal parameters of carbohydrate - acid complex, low technological reserve and mass concentration of phenolic compounds, moderate macerating ability and activity of monophenol monooxygenase in must. Training vines of this variety on a 40 cm high trunk with vertical shoot positioning led to significant deterioration of grape quality due to increased content of phenolic substances and their polymer forms, high macerating capacity of must. </p...|$|R
