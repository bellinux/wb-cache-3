30|$|Since {{nanomaterials}} are substances {{within the}} meaning of REACH, they also have to be registered if the yearly manufactured or imported <b>quantity</b> reaches 1 <b>tonne.</b> As it is not regulated otherwise, a manufacturer/importer who manufactures/imports not only a nanomaterial but also the corresponding bulk material with the same chemical identity registers the nanomaterial and the bulk material together in one registration. Nanomaterials are not regarded as separate substances within {{the meaning of}} the current REACH rules, but as substances in a certain form. The sum of the quantities (nanomaterial(s)[*]+[*]bulk) is decisive for the calculation of the aforementioned tonnage threshold. If no corresponding bulk material is manufactured or imported by the same registrant, the nanomaterial has to be registered on its own accordingly.

The supercapacitive behavior of mill scale directly from the steel plant, and after various cheap and scalable physical and chemical treatments, has been studied in electrodes formed by spraying mill scale containing suspensions onto large area current collectors. Half-cell and full-cell supercapacitors in cheap, nontoxic aqueous sodium sulphite electrolyte were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and delivered a capacitance of up to 92 F g- 1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s- 1, which was maintained at more than 80 % after 5000 cycles. The approximate costs of commercial and mill scale-based supercapacitors were compared, and showed that although mill scale absolute capacitances were lower than more expensive laboratory synthesized metal oxides, the cost per kilo-watt performance can be competitive, especially for very large grid scale storage applications...|$|R
30|$|As in {{many other}} cities of the {{developing}} countries, the rapid urbanization and high population growth of Dire Dawa (Ethiopia’s 2 nd largest city) have resulted into {{a significant increase in}} generation of wastes from domestic and commercial activities, posing numerous questions concerning the adequacy of the current waste management systems, and their associated environmental, economical and social implications. A report by Beneberu et al. (2012) depicted that, despite the great efforts made by the Dire Dawa city municipality, it has been hardly possible to meet the ever-increasing waste management service demand of the city adequately and effectively. The per capita waste generation rate of the city is reported to be 0.3  kg day− 1 and the city generates an estimated <b>quantity</b> of 77 <b>tonnes</b> of solid wastes per day (Community Development Research 2011). The same report indicated that, as there is very limited or no effort to recycle, reuse or recover the waste that is being generated; waste disposal has been the major mode of waste management practice. It has been observed that the indiscriminate dumping of wastes into the landfill is resulting in unexpectedly faster filling up of the city’s sanitary landfill which would, thus, likely be abandoned in the near future than anticipated 30  years (Beneberu et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} examples of large-scale commercial microbial synthesis routes for organic bioproducts, few studies have addressed the obvious potential for microbial systems to produce inorganic functional biomaterials at scale. Here we address this {{by focusing on the}} production of nano-scale biomagnetite particles by the Fe(III) -reducing bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens, which was scaled-up successfully from lab-scale to pilot plant-scale production, whilst maintaining the surface reactivity and magnetic properties which make this material well suited to commercial exploitation. At the largest scale tested, the bacterium was grown in a 50 L bioreactor, harvested and then inoculated into a buffer solution containing Fe(III) -oxyhydroxide and an electron donor and mediator, which promoted the formation of magnetite in under 24 hours. This procedure was capable of producing up to 120 g biomagnetite. The particle size distribution was maintained between 10 and 15 nm during scale-up of this second step from 10 ml to 10 L, with conserved magnetic properties and surface reactivity; the latter demonstrated by the reduction of Cr(VI). The process presented provides an environmentally benign route to magnetite production and serves as an alternative to harsher synthetic techniques, with the clear potential to be used to produce kg to <b>tonne</b> <b>quantities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Paper mill sludge {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{economic}} and environmental problems for paper and board industry, million <b>tonnes</b> <b>quantity</b> of sludge is produced in the world. It is essential to dispose these wastes safely without affecting health of human being, environment, fertile land; sources of water bodies, economy as it adversely affect the strength, durability and other properties of building materials based on them. Moreover, in developing countries like India where there is low availability of non-renewable resources and large need of building material like cement therefore it is essential to develop eco-efficient utilization of paper sludge. Primarily in functional terms paper sludge comprises of cellulose fibers, calcium carbonate, china clay, low silica, residual chemical bonds with water. The material is sticky and full of moisture content which is hard to dry. The manufacturing of paper usually produce loads of solid waste. These paper fibers are recycled in paper mills to limited number of times till they become weak to produce high quality paper. Thereafter, these left out small and weak pieces called as low quality paper fibers are detached out to become paper sludge. The material is by-product of de-inking and re-pulping of paper. This hypo sludge includes all kinds of inks, dyes, coating etc inscribed on the paper. This paper presents an overview of the published work on the use of hypo sludge in M 25 concrete formulations as a supplementary cementitious material exploring its properties such as compressive strength, splitting and parameters like modulus of elasticity, density, applications and most importantly investigation of low cost concrete by using hypo sludge are presented...|$|R
40|$|CAESAR and the REACH {{legislation}} REACH {{is the new}} European {{legislation for}} the safe use of chemicals [1]. It is an enormous initiative, which requires information for all chemicals which are currently {{on the market in}} Europe in <b>quantities</b> above one <b>tonne</b> per year. A huge amount of data on each compound is required, and alternative methods to direct experimentation such as in silico models are listed as possible sources of this information. In silico models are those aiming to predict the properties of a chemical compound {{on the basis of its}} chemical structure. However, this poses the problem of the correct use of these methods. CAESARisauniqueprojectfundedbytheEuropean Commission, dedicated to developing in silico models specifically designed for the REACH legislation. The legislation has shaped each step of the modeling process. There are thousands of in silico models which address new descriptors, new algorithms, or adopt a new method to predict a certain endpoint. Indeed, activities in the in silico area exploded in a multitude of aspects. However, typical in silico models are not suitable for regulatory purposes, as they have not taken into account one or more factors essential for validation, quality assurance, or for a specific application of a given compound. The typical approach for in silico modelling is to develop a model and then propose its use. However, it is clear that this is a generic approach, not addressing a specific application. The REACH requirements To propose an in silico model for REACH, we must consider the use of the resulting data within REACH. REACH promotes the use of all data, but it contain...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of waste biomass {{is an increasing}} problem. The high water content and mixed composition make its wider utilisation difficult. In addition, there are certain invasive species of flora in the UK which cause significant damage to the natural and built environment. One of the most publicised and problematic species is Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica) or JKW. There is a growing recognition that global resources are being consumed at an increasing rate that is not sustainable for the long-term stability of our society. One such commodity material is activated carbon, which is mostly made from coal and imported to the UK in significant <b>quantities</b> (16, 000 <b>tonnes</b> per annum). Thus, this research has focussed on investigating the feasibility of utilising waste biomass as a potentially novel and renewable source of activated carbon. This research required the characterising and assessment of the suitability of green (biomass) waste and JKW as potential feedstock {{for the production of}} activated carbon. The JKW biomass was separated into rhizomes (JKWR) and stems (JKWS) and experiments were conducted independently. Some of the characterisation tests conducted included CHNS analysis, thermal degradation behaviour and lignocellulosic content analyses. Using high temperature carbonisation and steam activation, waste biomass was converted into activated carbon. For the purpose of this work, the parameters that were investigated were activation temperature, time and water flow rate. The resulting adsorbents were characterised using established international as well as peer-reviewed methods in order to determine their capabilities as activated carbons. These included BET surface area measurement, butane working capacity, phenol adsorption tests as well as iodine number determination. Green waste was not suitable to undergo steam activation as it had high ash content and low carbon content. As a result, the research focussed on the carbonisation and subsequent steam activation of JKW. JKW biomass was carbonised at 600 °C for 1 h and the JKW chars were activated under optimised conditions at 925 °C for 1 h under 0. 5 ml/min water flow rate. BET surface areas in excess of 900 m 2 /g were achieved and this compared very favourably with a benchmark international commercial carbon, Filtrasorb 400. It was observed that increased steam activation temperatures resulted in activated carbons with high degrees of microporosity and the relative microporosity decreased with activation temperature. The carbons were also superior to Filtrasorb 400 in phenol and iodine adsorption tests. Further, Langmuir phenol adsorption capacities of 256 mg/g and 222 mg/g and iodine numbers of 1307 mg/g and 1190 mg/g, respectively were measured for JKWS and JKWR carbons. There are growing concerns over new water pollutants which arise from plastic use. These molecules are known to exhibit oestrogenic activity and hence, their removal is becoming a priority. The application of these carbons for this purpose was tested, using bisphenol-A (BPA) as a surrogate chemical of interest. JKWS activated carbon was able to perform as well as Filtrasorb 400 in BPA adsorption tests achieving at least 300 mg/g capacity, which is extremely promising for a novel, biomass derived activated carbon. Overall, this research work has clearly demonstrated that rather than regarding waste biomass, and particularly Japanese knotweed, as a problem, it may be an opportunity to provide the UK with a home-sourced and renewable feedstock for commercial activated carbon. Adopting this feedstock would be a major step towards resolving two UK government goals; reducing waste arisings and creating a more sustainable economy by reducing demand for imported products.
