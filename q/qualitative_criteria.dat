Automated {{configuration}} procedures play {{an increasingly}} {{prominent role in}} realising the performance potential inherent in highly parametric solvers {{for a wide range}} of computationally challenging problems. However, these configuration procedures have difficulties when dealing with inhomogenous instance sets, where the relative difficulty of problem instances varies between configurations of the given parametric algorithm. In the literature, instance set homogeneity has been assessed using a <b>qualitative,</b> visual <b>criterion</b> based on heat maps. Here, we introduce two quantitative measures of homogeneity and empirically demonstrate these to be consistent with the earlier <b>qualitative</b> <b>criterion.</b> We also show that according to our measures, homogeneity increases when partitioning instance sets by means of clustering based on observed runtimes, and that the performance of a prominent automatic algorithm configurator increases on the resulting, more homogenous subsets...|$|R

It is now widely recognized that the days of systematics as a field populated by mildly eccentric individuals pursuing knowledge in splendid isolation from funding priorities and economic imperatives are rapidly drawing to a close. In order to attract both personnel and resources, systematics must transform itself into a “large, coordinated, international scientific enterprise” [...] Many have identified use of the Internet— especially via the World Wide Web — as the medium through which this transformation can be made. While establishment of a virtual, GenBank-like system for accessing morphological data, audio clips, video files and so forth would be a significant step in the right direction, improved access to observational information and/or text-based descriptions alone will not address either the taxonomic impediment or low identification reproducibility issues successfully. Instead, the inevitable subjectivity associated with making critical decisions on the basis of <b>qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> must be reduced or, at the very least, embedded within a more formally analytic context.|$|E

He began {{collecting}} posters {{when he was only}} 16, possibly inspired by a gift to his father of three life-size prints of Sarah Bernhardt signed by Alphonse Mucha. In 1903-4 he served a year in the army, and again for some months in 1914-15. He was educated as a chemist, receiving his doctorate in 1904 in chemistry, physics, and mathematics; and then another in dentistry. He then interned for six months in the United States. He was married {{for the first time in}} 1910. While he was successful as a dentist, with Albert Einstein among his patients, and wrote a number of standard works on periodontosis, his avocation was posters. He regularly worked from three o'clock in the afternoon into the night on his passion, making a detailed index card for each poster, each of which was identified by a numbered label. His poster collection grew, and in 1905 he was one of the principal founders and then the president of the Verein der Plakatfreunde (Society of Poster Friends), which soon had regional chapters. In 1910 it founded a quarterly Das Plakat (The Poster), with Sachs as both editor and publisher. [...] The purpose of Das Plakat was to promote poster art, for both collectors and scholars. While there were a number of magazines devoted to posters, of Das Plakat it was said “And the clarion of this German poster exuberance was a magazine called Das Plakat, which not only exhibited the finest poster examples from Germany and other European countries, but its high standards underscored its exquisite printing, established <b>qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> that defined the decade of graphic design between 1910 and 1920.” Moreover, “[...] [...] [...] given its focus on conventional and avant garde sensibilities (it) emerged as a more historically influential review than any of the others.” During its short life from 1910 to 1921, its circulation grew from 200 to over 10,000. The Verein der Plakatfreunde ended a year later. It is unclear why the poster group and its magazine ended, possibly because of conflicts between collectors, art lovers, commercial artists, and business.|$|E

40|$|URL] audienceDepending on {{the general}} {{condition}} of fetal remains, forensic specialists might face difficulties concerning age estimation. Reference tables and regression equations are helpful devices in this task, although they are generally applied for complete fetuses or fetal remains including soft tissues. However, the problem of age estimation stays for osseous remains, both for entire bones and ossified parts, {{since most of the}} reference tables come from ultrasonographic measurements, which are not easily reproducible on fetal osseous remains. Furthermore, the ultrasonographic measurements contain slight errors in comparison to the real anatomical ones. This study describes a radiographic protocol and a measurement technique that facilitate and improve bone measurements, and therefore, facilitate age estimation, too. A <b>qualitative</b> <b>criterion,</b> namely a clear-cut bony endplate, was defined and tested. Its reliability (repeatability and reproducibility) turned out to be good, showing nonsignificative differences to the threshold of 0. 05, with average errors of 0. 26 and 0. 44 mm respectively. Moreover, concerning the test of eventual size differences between the right and left femurs showed a P value < 0. 0001. The test of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>criterion</b> was based on the comparison of the radiographic in situ femur measurements and the radiographic measurements of the same bones after dissection. The results were satisfactory, since an average error of 0. 58 mm was obtained, which did not give any significant differences to the threshold of 0. 05. It was concluded that this methodology provides an easy and precise new measurement tool for forensic practice, and can allow us to establish some nonultrasonographic tables, which fit our population...|$|R

The proposed approach takes into account not only quantitative criteria (i. e. transportation and environmental impacts) but also <b>qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> (i. e. social impacts). The qualitative evaluation of the TDM alternatives is assumed to be intrinsically uncertain and subjective because decision-makers have to base their judgements on subjective personal experience.

These alternatives were: expansion of County Medical Assistance Programs, state-purchased health insurance policies, Medicaid expansion, revenue pool to redistribute charity care losses, all-payer rate system, mandated employer-purchased health insurance, and charity care districts. ^ These alternatives were subjected to both cost and sensitivity analysis, then ranked on the basis of both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>criteria.</b> <b>Qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> were: maintenance of the 1985 level of health, inclusion of preventive health measures, equity in distribution of unreimbursed medical expenses, and reduced incentives for cost-shifting. Quantitative criteria were cost, and percentage of medically indigent served. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> were integrated using the Delphi Method, and Saaty 2 ̆ 7 s Analytical Hierarchy via Expert Choice. ^ Impact analysis for each alternative on Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s health care delivery system was also performed, including the effect on total state disposable income. The alternatives were tested further under four scenarios representing expected future changes in the health care delivery system. These scenarios are: federal matching funds reduction, charity care reductions, state funding reduction, and increase in medical indigents. In this analysis the effects of varying factors, previously held constant at 1985 levels, were assessed for all criteria. The alternatives were then reranked, with state-purchased health insurance scoring highest most consistently. ^ It is recommended that the state adopt a combination of Medicaid expansion and state-purchased health insurance. This combination would best meet all <b>qualitative</b> <b>criteria</b> at a minimum system cost per indigent served. ^ If the recommended comprehensive program cannot be undertaken, a combination of programs is suggested for further research. These include Medicaid expansion, local health department expansion, state-paid insurance continuation, revenue pool, on-site medical teams and patient-imposed care limits. Because it is cost effective, prevention is emphasized by these programs. ...|$|E

Baurschmidt [36] reported that the formation of thrombus on the biomaterial surface is correlated with charge transferring from fibrinogen to the material surface. Fibrinogen can transform to fibrin monomer and fibrinopeptides when it losses charge. The crosslink of fibrin monomer causes an irreversible thrombus. Thus, the suitable density of charge will promote the hemocompatibility [37, 38]. A suitable ratio of sp 3 C-N to sp 2 C-N can provide the optimum density of charge to promote hemocompatibility. The possible reason for the decrease of platelet adhesion rates is the {{significant change in the}} electronic characteristics due to the increase of sp 3 C-N bond.|$|R
