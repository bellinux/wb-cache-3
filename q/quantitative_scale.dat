40|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>scaling</b> into percent signal {{change is}} helpful to detect and {{eliminate}} “bad” results with abnormal extreme values. While cognitive effects give signal changes {{on the order of}} 1 % (and larger in the visual and auditory cortices), signal variations of over 10 % may arise from motion and other artifacts in the data. Thus, a quantitative check on measured effect size can be used to screen abnormally large values likely caused by artifacts in the data. Percent signal change for fMRI is limited in applicability because it is difficult to relate measured signals to neuronal excitations. However, percent signal change is easily defined for an fMRI block design experiment when the noise is small and the response is relatively flat (Figure 1). Our objective is to quantify the imaging pipeline starting from this collected data. This note describes the <b>quantitative</b> <b>scaling</b> laws that make the General Linear Model (GLM) estimation output from SPM consistent with this definition.

5000|$|After Katz (1960) and Smith’s (1956) seminal studies, the {{functional}} approach to attitudes was effectively abandoned. Citing {{the lack of}} empirical methodological tests to quantify attitude functions as {{the main reason for}} the detriment of functional attitude theory, in 1986 Gregory Herek set out to create a new approach to functional attitude theory (Herek, 1986). Recognizing the validity of both the reasoned action (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975, 1980) and the symbolic approaches (Kinder & Sears, 1981) to attitudes, Herek proposed that both approaches may be equally appropriate to employ depending on certain person characteristics, attitude domains, or situations (Herek, 1986, 1987). Herek posited that attitudes serve two general purposes: they are either evaluative or expressive. Within evaluative attitudes, Herek proposed three evaluative functions: experiential and specific, experiential and schematic, or anticipatory-evaluative. Likewise, expressive attitudes served three separate functions: social-expressive, value-expressive, or defensive. Herek’s Neofunctional Approach to Attitudes, then, proposed that these different attitudes regarding the same attitude object may form for different purposes in different situations or domains, and, likewise, individuals may hold the same attitudes toward the object, but for a variety of different functions. By allowing for multiple attitudes to be held for different functions, Herek created a <b>quantitative</b> <b>scale</b> that allows for empirical comparison of multiple attitudes regarding the same object (Carpenter, 2013).|$|E

We consider a previously introduced class of models which, in the limit of large number $N$ of coupled scalar fields, approaches the so-called `ideal' model (in terms of its potential to lead to network frustration). We consider values of $N$ between N= 2 and N= 20.

Study 1 developed a set of <b>quantitative</b> <b>scales</b> for measuring the different components of intercultural competence using students from the University of Surrey, while Study 2 tested these scales further using students from the University of Kuwait. These two studies showed that 12 different components of intercultural competence could be measured using these scales. Study 3 used the same scales to collect data from secondary school students in Kuwait at the beginning {{and at the end of}} a school year. Study 3 showed that the intercultural competence of these school students did not develop over the year, and was not enhanced by an educational intervention. Study 3 also showed that the intercultural competence of these school students was sometimes but not always related to their attitudes to people from other cultural groups. Taken together, the three studies revealed that the components of intercultural competence can be measured using <b>quantitative</b> <b>scales,</b> that these components tend to be positively correlated with each other, and that females, older individuals, minority individuals and individuals who speak multiple languages tend to have higher levels of intercultural competence.
