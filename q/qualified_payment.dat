40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} {{the performance of}} a compensation mechanism that has received increasing attention in recent experimental literature. Our purpose is two-fold: (i) to characterize endogenous payments that can induce (mutual) cooperation in prisoner’s dilemma in the absence of social preferences; (ii) using models of quasi-maximin and inequality-aversion preferences to evaluate the possibility and likelihood of cooperation in relation to the characteristics of the endogenous <b>payments</b> <b>qualified</b> for inducing cooperation. We establish conditions that are necessary and sufficient for endogenous <b>payments</b> to be <b>qualified</b> for inducing cooperation. We show that both quasi-maximin and inequality-aversion preferences imply that <b>qualified</b> <b>payments</b> that narrow the gap in the mutual-cooperation (material) payoffs are more effective than those that expand the gap. This is consistent with findings in two recent experimental tests of the performance of the compensation mechanism...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} saving {{behavior}} of banks retail customers. Our unique dataset comprises the contract and cash flow information for approximately 2. 2 million individual contracts from 1991 to 2010.

The probability {{of an early}} contract termination decreases by approximately 40 %, and cash flow volatility drops by about 25 %.
