40|$|Adapting {{conventional}} aspatial {{forest management}} tools to a {{geographic information system}} will require more than merely writing a suitable software interface. There is a conflict between the forest inventory data collected presently and the spatial requirements of a GIS. A similar conflict exists between categorical map data and statistical techniques which utilize continuous dependent variables. Finally, neither GIS nor the statistical techniques generally used to develop <b>quantitative</b> forest <b>management</b> tools can accomodate uncertainty of individual measurements. Yet these latter can be significant sources of errors for map-based forestry data. This paper discusses problems inherent in existing forestry data collection and analytical approaches and spatial errors that must be considered to include a spatial component in existing <b>quantitative</b> forest <b>management</b> tools...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a survey about use of <b>quantitative</b> <b>management</b> indicators in a Japanese software development organization. This survey is conducted {{in order to}} investigate possible criteria for selecting and customizing organizational standard indicators according to the context of each project.

The system EPDG+ (Electronic Process Data Guidebook Plus) helps project planners select / customize indicators to be employed in process control. Derived software project plans including measurement and analysis activities can be browsed in detail with this system. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Quantitative</b> risk <b>management</b> {{allows for}} {{qualitative}} notions such as optimality and expected returns {{to be put}} on a quantitative footing. It complements subjective risk considerations with an objective, statistical perspective. Broadly, <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>management</b> consists of two distinct elements. The first is measurement, which involves quantifying the overall risk of a portfolio. The second step is analysis, which involves gaining insight into the sources of risk, and determining whether or not they accurately reflect the views of the portfolio manager. Risk analysis is most commonly considered {{in the context of a}} particular risk measure, leading to concepts such as mean-variance optimization, and a definition of beta in terms of variances and covariances. Many volatility (or variance) based analytics can be extended to cover a broad class of risk measures, allowing for new perspectives of risk to be understood using standard analytics. The 2008 market turmoil provides fresh motivation to take as broad a view of risk as possible. Financial risk is multi-faceted and must be measured and analyzed from multiple perspectives. More generally, the lackluster performance of conventional <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>management</b> practices highlights the need for an expansive, dynamic framework that is effective in all economic climates. To this end, we unite the academic literature on financial risk with...|$|R
