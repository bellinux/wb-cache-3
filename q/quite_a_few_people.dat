2500|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, {{announced}} that he had with regret accepted the resignations of Bishops Burnham and Newton. The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales gave assurance of a warm welcome for those who wished to be part of an ordinariate. In a pastoral letter concerning his resignation as Bishop of Richborough, Newton stressed that he had done so not for [...] "negative reasons about problems in the Church of England but for positive reasons in response to our Lord's prayer the night before he died, [...] 'they may all be one'." [...] Ruth Gledhill, religious affairs correspondent of The Times, said that the announcement could prompt [...] "hundreds, possibly thousands" [...] of lay ministers to follow the bishops' example. She added: [...] "It's quite significant as it means the ordinariate – that <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> have been saying might not get off the ground – could be {{a force to be reckoned}} with.".|$|E
2500|$|Rawle {{explained}} that Silas has accepted {{he is to}} be in the secure psychiatric unit until he dies so he plans to manipulate the outside world from inside as a means of living out his murderous fantasies. Rawle revealed that Silas has a [...] "nagging feeling" [...] that he made a mistake in killing India and that he wishes he could put it right. He said that his character meant to murder Texas so he now wants to kill her as she is the [...] "one that got away". Hendrickse-Spendlove also commented that Silas initially intended to kill Texas so she is [...] "the final piece of the puzzle for him, and then his 'work' will be complete". Silas tells Texas another murder will soon occur which is an opportunity to [...] "play games". He is [...] "delighted" [...] to have an audience during the visits and begins to [...] "make lots of threats". Rawle {{explained that}} Silas sees that Texas has India's ring which is [...] "symbolic" [...] for Silas as he had previously taken it as a trophy. Texas taunts Silas with the ring and agrees to exchange it for information on Lynsey's murder. Rawle explained that Silas tells Texas that Will Savage (James Atherton) is responsible for Lynsey's murder which is because [...] "Silas knows that Texas and Will are close, so he points the finger of suspicion his way". He said that Silas would [...] "put <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in the frame" [...] for the murder. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that Texas is [...] "manipulated" [...] by Silas when he makes her believe Will is responsible for Lynsey's murder. Silas escapes from hospital and goes to visit Texas. Hendrickse-Spendlove explained that Texas [...] "opens her front door, sees Silas and thinks, 'This is it - my life is over', to see him standing there with no police restraint, knowing that he murdered her sister India, is absolutely petrifying". Silas tells Texas that he now intends to complete what he began. Hendrickse-Spendlove would not reveal whether Texas survives the ordeal but said that Texas is [...] "never going to be safe again" [...] regardless of the outcome. In August 2012, Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap confirmed that there were no current plans for Silas to return, but the door had been left open for him. On 20 January 2016, Silas is set to return to visit Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison after he was framed by Lindsey Butterfield (Sophie Austin) for the murders and attempted murders at Dee Valley Hospital. Silas left again after he killed Lindsey.|$|E

The inhabitants included Anton Mauve (teacher of Vincent van Gogh), Jan Sluijters, Ferdinand Hart Nibbrig and American art collector William Singer, whose collection became the basis for the Singer Laren museum. Today Laren and Blaricum are residential towns for television personalities, retirees and people who struck it rich during the internet boom in the 1990s. According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the residents of Blaricum are the richest of any municipality in the Netherlands. The residents of Laren are the oldest.

Many of these things were so different from anything a doctor would have ever said that they thought that it would be good if they could put together some kind of network where people who came up with these kind of ideas could advertise them and could share them with other patients who might benefit.

Feminist vegetarianism has been playing an important role in criticizing the ﾒdominant maleﾓ tendency among animal rights activists. However, feminist vegetarianism has been criticized as monoculturalism, because they stress that vegetarianism is common among people living in white elite circumstances. The criticism suggests the necessity for a conceptual construction of vegetarianism from the perspective of multiculturalism.

Argall says making the film was unsatisfactory: I {{spent too much time}} and put too much energy into making {{everybody}} else happy and doing the right thing by everybody else instead of doing the right thing by myself. There's a point where you need to actually focus on what is there.

The romance between the main character and his girlfriend - there was a great desire on the part of <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the <b>people</b> who were financing it, to develop this and to make it a strong element.

In this Surah, Allah's punishment which was inflicted {{on the people of}} the elephant is referred to and described very briefly because it was an event of recent occurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully aware of it.
