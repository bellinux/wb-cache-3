Nitromethane solvate {{was found to be}} more stable compared to other known solvates.

Stabilization of quinapril by forming strong hydrogen bonding network as in case of co-crystals was further studied by forming co-crystal with tris(hydroxymethyl) amino methane. Quinapril free base forms a stable salt with tris(hydroxymethyl) amino methane not reported earlier. Quinapril tris(hydroxymethyl) amino methane salt found to be stable even at 80 &# 176; for 72 h i. e. hardly any formation of diketopiperazine and diacid impurity.

40|$|Chemical {{stability}} of drug substances in the solid state {{is critical to}} the efficacy and safety of the solid dosage forms. Different forms of a solid drug may differ in chemical stability. For drugs in the amorphous state the chemical instability is often a major concern and may override the benefits of the amorphous state, which include enhanced solubility, faster dissolution, and better bioavailability. In the current research, emphasis is placed upon studying the controlling factors for the chemical {{stability of}} the selected amorphous dipeptide angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which leads {{to the development of the}} stabilization strategies. In addition, many large peptides and proteins exist in the amorphous form in the solid state. The study may also provide insight into how to stabilize the large peptides and proteins against chemical instability. ^ Amorphous lisinopril is much less stable than its crystalline counterpart. The temperature-dependence of the reactivity of the amorphous lisinopril correlates very well with that of the structural relaxation time. Moisture plasticizes the amorphous form and significantly decreases the chemical stability. In addition, amorphous lisinopril, with a higher Tg, shows better chemical stability than structurally similar compounds (e. g. <b>quinapril</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and spirapril hydrochloride). We conclude that the Tg and the structural-relaxation time are closely related to the chemical stability of amorphous lisinopril. ^ The chemical stability of amorphous lisinopril and <b>quinapril</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is improved by preparing the binary amorphous molecular mixtures (solid molecular dispersions) with certain excipients. PVP, which has only proton acceptors for H-bonding, destabilizes amorphous lisinopril but stabilizes amorphous quinapril HCl. On the other hand, dextrans and trehalose, which have both proton acceptors and donors, were found to stabilize amorphous lisinopril. Glass transition temperature does not correlate with the chemical stability of the drugs in their binary amorphous mixtures with the excipients. Specific molecular interactions (H-bonding) between the drugs and excipients have to be considered. It is postulated that the local mobility relevant to the cyclization reaction is more important than the bulk mobility to the chemical stability of the compounds. ^ In addition, six other crystalline forms of lisinopril besides the dihydrate are characterized in this research. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of two 20 -mg <b>quinapril</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> tablet preparations; Quinaril ® (The Biolab Ltd, Bangkok, Thailand) as {{the test and}} Accupril ® as the reference. Material and Method: The present study was a single dose, randomized, two-period crossover design conducted in 24 healthy volunteers under fasting conditions with a 7 -day washout period. Serial plasma concentrations of quinapril and its active metabolite quinaprilat up to 24 h after dosing were determined by HPLC with UV detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis and the ANOVA was carried out using logarithmically transformed data of the AUC and Cmax as well as untransformed Tmax. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} between the two preparations regarding the Tmax of quinapril and quinaprilat and their median Tmax were 0. 5 h and 1. 4 - 1. 5 h, respectively. The half-life of quinapril (1. 2 h) was faster than quinaprilat (1. 8 - 1. 9 h) although the volume of distribution (Vd/F) of quinapril (1. 1 L/kg) was larger than quinaprilat (0. 3 L/kg), however, its clearance rate (CL/F) was faster when compared to quinaprilat (20 - 26 ml/min/kg vs. 1. 7 ml/min/kg). The mean (90 % CI) for the ratios Reference of quinapril were 0. 99 (0. 89 - 1. 10), 0. 99 (0. 90 - 1. 09) and 1. 01 (0. 90 - 1. 14), respectively for AUC 0 - 24, AUC 0 - ∞ and Cmax. Similarly, the corre-sponding values for quinaprilat were 0. 95 (0. 90 - 1. 01), 0. 95 (0. 90 - 1. 01) and 1. 03 (1. 00 - 1. 07), respectively. These values were within the bioequivalence range of 0. 80 - 1. 25, thus, demonstrated the bioequivalence o...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{stability}} {{is a critical}} issue in the drug development process. Since {{a vast majority of}} drug products are administered as solid dosage forms, understanding the molecular details of a solid-state reaction becomes very important to the pharmaceutical industry. The following thesis describes the studies of two common solid-state degradation reactions. ^ The first study investigates the UV-induced oxidation of small methionine-containing peptides in the solid state. scDL-Ala- scDL-Met, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe methyl ester, and Met-Enkephalin acetate salt were chosen as models to examine the effect of sample crystallinity and moisture on a solid-gas reaction. This study shows that the amorphous forms are more susceptible to methionine oxidation than the corresponding crystalline forms. A correlation between reactivity and the looseness of molecular packing is indicated. Additionally, this study shows that moisture can influence the oxidation rate by inducing physical changes in the solid sample. ^ The second study investigates the solid-state cyclization of two model N-carboxyalkyl dipeptide ACE inhibitors [...] spirapril hydrochloride and <b>quinapril</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The temperature dependence of the cyclization rate of the crystalline and amorphous forms of the compounds was examined. The cyclization rates of the amorphous forms with different water contents were also measured. This study shows that: (1) amorphous forms are more reactive and have a lower activation energy than their crystalline counterparts; and (2) increasing the water content lowers the glass transition temperature of the amorphous forms and accelerates the reaction. The results indicate the importance of molecular mobility in this solid-state intramolecular reaction. 13 C solid-state NMR is also exploited in this study to investigate mobility in the model compounds and to further examine the relationship between mobility and reactivity. A preliminary study utilizing a combination of pulse techniques indicates different mobility in the phenyl ring between the crystalline and amorphous forms. Variable temperature 13 C T 1 measurements were performed to probe large amplitude motion near the reaction site, and a correlation between glass transition and MHz frequency motion is indicated. ...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{solubility}} of {{new drug}} candidates {{resulting in low}} bioavailability is becoming {{a major problem in}} drug formulation development. Amorphous pharmaceuticals are being increasingly investigated to improve dissolution rate and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. However, physical and chemical stability issues often limit the application of amorphous systems in drug product development. Preparation of amorphous drugs using silicates, in particular, has been shown to vastly improve physical stability. However, the catalytic activity of silicates to facilitate chemical reactions may accelerate drug degradation. In this study, several factors and mechanisms affecting the chemical stability of amorphous drugs prepared with silicates (Neusilin and Aerosil) were investigated using <b>quinapril</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (QHCl) as a model drug. Amorphous samples were prepared by cryo-grinding. The effects of pH grade of silicates, drug:silicate ratio and relative humidity (%RH) on chemical stability of the co-ground amorphous drug were determined. ^ The pH grade of silicates significantly affects the chemical stability of co-ground amorphous QHCl with greater degradation observed in lower pH grades of Neusilin. The addition of acidic or basic pH-modifiers influences QHCl degradation in accordance with the pH-stability profile of the drug in the amorphous state. However, the pH-stability profile of amorphous QHCl prepared with different pH grades of silicates was not consistent with the pH-stability profile of the drug in solution. A solid-state equivalent pH (pHeq) of amorphous samples was measured using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and the results indicate that pHeq provides a more accurate prediction of the effective surface acidity and degradation of QHCl in amorphous formulations than the suspension pH. The chemical stability of co-ground amorphous QHCl was also influenced by drug:silicate ratio and %RH. The degradation of amorphous QHCl co-ground with Neusilin was low at both lower and higher percentages of Neusilin with maximum degradation observed at intermediate percentages. This effect of drug:Neusilin ratio was correlated with the pHeq of the amorphous formulation, which changes with percentages of Neusilin. Amorphous QHCl co-ground with Neusilin showed greater degradation at both lower and higher %RH with maximum stability observed at intermediate %RH. This complex relationship between degradation rate and %RH is consistent with the competitive adsorption of drug and water molecules on silicate surfaces. ^ In conclusion, the effects of pH grade of silicates, drug:silicate ratio and %RH all contribute to the chemical stability of the amorphous drug prepared with silicates. Solid-state surface acidity measurement is the best predictor of pH-stability profiles of amorphous formulations. pH-modifiers were shown to improve chemical stability without compromising the physical stability of the amorphous formulation. ...|$|E
