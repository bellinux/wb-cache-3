The condition of possibility of virtual reality, as embodied by HMDs, is reconstructed as the circular coupling of machine response to human action and perception, in contrast to perception of space through the eyes...|$|R

After the time is up, the judge checks the player's answers against a checklist of ten answers on the question card. Every answer found on the checklist is worth one point. Some cards have italicised answers, these are worth two points each. The player's counter moves as many places forward as the player has scored points. Some places have special instructions to follow.|$|R
