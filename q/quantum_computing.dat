5|$|Most {{important}} is the interaction of vacancies and interstitials with nitrogen. Carbon interstitials react with substitutional nitrogen producing a bond-centered nitrogen interstitial showing strong IR absorption at 1450 cm−1. Vacancies are efficiently trapped by the A, B and C nitrogen centers. The trapping rate is the highest for the C centers, 8 times lower for the A centers and 30 times lower for the B centers. The C center (single nitrogen) by trapping a vacancy forms the famous nitrogen-vacancy center, which can be neutral or negatively charged; the negatively charged state has potential applications in <b>quantum</b> <b>computing.</b> A and B centers upon trapping a vacancy create corresponding 2N-V (H3 and H2 centers, where H2 is simply a negatively charged H3 center) and the neutral 4N-2V (H4 center). The H2, H3 and H4 centers are important because they are present in many natural diamonds and their optical absorption can {{be strong enough to}} alter the diamond color (H3 or H4 – yellow, H2 – green).|$|E

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that time-optimal quantum {{computation}} is attained by using the Cartan decomposition of a unitary matrix. We extend this approach by noting that the unitary group is compact. This allows us to reduce the execution time of a quantum algorithm U_ alg further by adding an extra gate W to it. This gate W sends U_ alg to another algorithm WU_ alg which is executable in a shorter time than U_ alg. We call this technique warp-drive. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that the execution time of Grover's algorithm is reduced in two-qubit NMR quantum computer. Warp-drive is potentially a powerful tool in accelerating algorithms and reducing the errors in any realization. of a <b>quantum</b> <b>compute...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} {{established that}} in principle, {{it is possible}} to <b>quantum</b> <b>compute</b> using passive linear optics with photo-detectors (quant-ph/ 0006088). Here we describe techniques based on error detection and correction that greatly improve the resource and device reliability requirements needed for scalability. The resource requirements are analyzed for ideal linear optics quantum computation (LOQC). The coding methods can be integrated both with loss detection and phase error-correction to deal with the primary relaxation processes in non-ideal optics, including detector inefficiencies. The main conclusion of our work is that the resource requirements for implementing quantum communication or computation with LOQC are reasonable. Furthermore, this work clearly demonstrates how special knowledge of the error behavior can be exploited for greatly improving the fault tolerance and overheads of a physical quantum computer.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of {{an interpretation of}} quantum theory following the line of Everett’s many-realities lead to the theoretical possibility of computers that could tractably solve satisfiability problems, and hence other NP-complete problems widely considered to be intractable for classical computers and presently considered probabilistic quantum computers. The extra capability is seen {{to come from the}} ability of composite quantum systems (CQS) to process noninterfering realities through quantum observers; probabilistic quantum computers can only process interfering realities by using classical (decohered) observers. The total time for a CQS computer to determine whether a 3 SAT propositional formula is satisfiable or unsatisfiable would be linear in the number of variables and logarithmic in the number of clauses. The apparatus size and energy requirements would be linear in both quantities. Keywords: NP-complete, satisfiability, 3 SAT, many-worlds, manyrealities, <b>quantum</b> <b>compute...</b>|$|R
