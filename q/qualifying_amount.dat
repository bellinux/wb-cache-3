50|$|Pak'nSave offers fuel {{discounts}} to shoppers {{for spending}} a <b>qualifying</b> <b>amount</b> on shopping. Pak'nSave stores with on-site Pak'nSave fuel filling stations offer vouchers {{to use at}} these stations. The Pak'nSave fuel vouchers are unique in that they can only be used at the fuel site associated with the store of purchase, whereas all other New Zealand supermarkets' fuel discount vouchers operate at any participating station across the country. Stores without on-site Pak'nSave fuel filling stations offer vouchers for use at Mobil service stations (before January 2013, the vouchers were accepted at Mobil instead). Competition for fuel discounts has grown {{in the past few}} years, with cases of offering discounts of 50 cents per litre to customers when they spend at least $400 in store.The standard fuel price at the Pak'nSave pump can often be higher than that of neighbouring service stations, thereby partially negating the Pak'nSave discount.|$|E

50|$|The borough {{consisted}} initially of {{the parish}} of East Retford, a market town which by 1830 had a population of around 2,500. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, the right to vote was restricted to the resident freemen of the town, but there was some dispute over who had a right to claim the freedom. (The House of Commons debated the borough's franchise seven times in a few years following 1700, coming to a different resolution each time, and never definitively settling all the details.) East Retford was not subject to the abuses common in many other freeman boroughs, where non-resident freemen could often vote and outnumbered the residents, but as elsewhere the town corporation was able to exert considerable control by deciding who to admit as freemen. In {{the second half of the}} 18th century, the <b>qualified</b> electorate <b>amounted</b> to about 150.|$|R

40|$|Vegetation plays a {{key role}} in {{reducing}} ambient temperature, moisture and pollutant capture, energy use and subsequent ground level ozone reduction. In recent years vegetation mapping has become increasingly important, especially with advancements in environmental economic valuation. The spatial information from the remote sensing satellites enables researchers to quantify and <b>qualify</b> the <b>amount</b> and health of vegetation. The present study highlights significance of remote sensing in the vegetation mapping of western ghat region of Maharashtra using satellite imageries from Landsat TM. A supervised (full Gaussian) maximum likelihood classification was implemented in our approach. The final classification product provided identification and mapping of dominant land cover types, including forest types and nonforest vegetation. Remote sensing data sets were calibrated using a variety of field verification measurements. Field methods included the identification of dominant forest species, forest type and relative state-of-health of selected tree species. Ground truth information was used to assess the accuracy of the classification. The vegetation type map was prepared from the classified satellite image. The moist deciduous forests constitute major portion of the total forest area. The application of remote sensing and satellites imageries with spatial analysis of land use land cover provides policy and decision makers with current and improved data for the purposes of effective management of natural resources...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{biosensor}} {{technology is the}} integration of biosensing assays in microfluidic devices. These devices allow automated, high throughput analyses, in combination with significantly reduced amounts of sample and reagents. An upcoming category of microfluidics is the droplet based microfluidics, involving the transport of individual droplets by a carrier flow. In this two- or multiphase systems, thousands of nanoliter droplets (from 3000 per second to 1 per minute) can be formed, merged, mixed and split. Hence, this platform serves as a powerful tool to create high-throughput nanoreactors. This work presents the production and use of a droplet based lab-on-a-chip in poly(dimethyl) siloxane (PDMS). The nanodrops are generated by mixing two immiscible fluids: perfluorocarbon oil (as carrier phase) and water (as nanoreactor). In the PDMS channels, at the T-junction, the water phase is injected in the perfluoroil, forming drops of water in a continuous oil phase. In a first phase, the mechanism of droplet formation and internal droplet flow is investigated by particle image velocimetry (PIV) using fluorescent nanoparticles. This technique allows the visualization of the velocity profile inside the droplet {{as a function of}} the used parameters (flow speed, surfactant concentration, viscosities of the fluids…). Secondly, an optimization study is executed to accurately control droplet volume and inter-droplet distance. These parameters are influenced by channel dimensions, the total flow speed, the flow ratio (of water and oil) and the concentration of surfactants. The chip will be used for the execution of an IgE-bioassay, utilising magnetic nanoparticles. Antibodies are immobilised on the surface of these particles and capture the IgE-molecules in the sample. Separating the beads from most of the sample volume (using external magnets), results in an increased concentration of IgE, thereby improving detection limits. A second fluorescent labelled antibody is used to <b>qualify</b> the <b>amount</b> of captured IgE. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is that of {{emphasize}} the most relevant features of direct and indirect gender discrimination in the statutory and occupational old-age pension systems in Europe, following the Report on Direct and Indirect Gender Discrimination in Old-Age Pensions in 33 European Countries of the European Commission Network Of Legal Experts In The Field Of Gender Equality. This {{with the aim of}} offering a contribution to the reinforcement of the effectiveness of the principle of gender equality in the field of old-age pensions. The crucial features, as regards gender equality, of the statutory old age pension system will be examined, such as <b>qualifying</b> conditions, pension <b>amount,</b> derived rights, caring credits, exceptions to directive 79 / 7 /EEC. Furthermore, the occupational old age pensions schemes will be analysed on the light of gender equality; to this purpose, attention will be paid to: coverage, calculation of benefits and contributions, use of actuarial factors, caring credits, vesting and reimbursement rules, pensionable age. Finally, possible answers to gender inequalities in the old age pensions system will be put forward {{and the role of the}} principle of equality as an important instrument in attaining common standards in social protection will be highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Retirees beware. The {{easy money}} policy of the Federal Open Market Committee and the 15 percent tax rate on {{qualified}} dividends have encouraaged retirees, especially middle-income retired savers, to reorient their nest eggs away from certificates of deposit, treasuries, and money market funds to dividend-paying stocks and mutual funds. According to the IRS, 43 percent of taxpayers age 65 or older reported <b>qualified</b> dividend income <b>amounting</b> to {{nearly half of the}} qualified dividend income reported by all taxpayers. By contrast, 46 percent of taxpayers age 65 or older reported net capital gains amounting to 30. 5 percent of the net capital gains reported by all taxpayers. But 2013 is coming, and unless Congress extends the current rates or reaches an agreement on tax reform, dividends will be taxed as ordinary income at a marginal rate as high as 39. 6 percent and most net capital gains will be taxed at 20 percent. For those whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds a specified amount (for example, $ 250, 000 for a married couple filing jointly and $ 200, 000 for an unmarried individual), a 3. 8 percent Medicare tax will be added to the taxation of their net capital gain, dividend income, interest, and other investment income, bringing the highest marginal rate to 43. 4 percent...|$|R
30|$|We {{also use}} the IPEDS data to {{construct}} measures related to college “quality” and cost. The first quality measure is the Barron’s ranking of how competitive admission is at a particular college. We focus on using this information to classify {{whether or not a}} school is ranked by Barron’s as either a “highly” or “most” competitive institution. 11 The second is the selectivity defined as the fraction of applicants who are admitted. Because these variables reflect the characteristics of applicants and students enrolled at a given institution, they should be thought of as indicators for how prestigious a school is rather than as a proxy for some output-based measure of effectiveness. However, the admission rate closely corresponds to what “selectivity” is commonly understood to mean, as are the Barron’s rankings (Hoxby, 2001). This notion of “quality” also corresponds with what is meant in public discussions about access to “elite” universities. For cost, we use the tuition “sticker price” students face at a particular institution (for which we use the 2009 tuition as listed in IPEDS). It {{is important to recognize that}} this is a limited proxy for the actual tuition students will have to pay since many of the students in our sample come from fairly disadvantaged backgrounds and would <b>qualify</b> for substantial <b>amounts</b> of financial aid. Nonetheless, because selective institutions generally charge a higher “sticker price”, tuition is useful for characterizing the type of institutions students attend. Moreover, other studies examining college choice have found that tuition influences the college students attend (Long 2004 a; Jacob et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To raise private savings for workers' retirement, federal law provides tax incentives for contributions to pension plans. Company sponsors of private defined benefit (DB) pension plans can claim a tax deduction for their contribution amount to a tax-qualified pension plan, and employees' taxes on contributions and investment earnings are deferred until they retire and start receiving benefit payments. To achieve and maintain tax-qualified status, DB plans must comply with multiple federal requirements {{that are designed to}} ensure that executives and other highly compensated employees (HCE) do not receive excessively high benefits, both in an absolute sense and relative to nonhighly compensated employees (NHCE). These include limits on total benefit levels, limits on the amount of compensation that can be included in determining benefit levels, and limits on disparities in benefits between HCEs and NHCEs. The goal of the nondiscrimination requirements is to encourage expanded coverage and greater distribution of benefits between the highly paid and workers at lower earnings levels. To demonstrate compliance, plan sponsors may use an IRS preapproved plan or develop a customized plan, which must pass general nondiscrimination tests. These tests generally require a plan sponsor to perform mathematical calculations that compare the proportion of NHCEs who benefit under a tax-qualified plan with the proportion of HCEs who benefit, taking into account their respective benefit accrual rates. Due to the restrictions placed on benefits in a tax-qualified plan, some private sponsors of tax-qualified retirement plans provide additional nontax-qualified supplemental retirement benefits to certain HCEs as part of the HCE's total compensation. These benefits do not enjoy the tax advantages conferred upon qualified plans. In addition, any assets backing these benefits generally remain company assets and, depending on the funding arrangement, could be withdrawn by the sponsor or made available to creditors {{in the case of a}} sponsor bankruptcy. Utilizing flexibilities in the nondiscrimination rules, some plan sponsors have designed ways to indirectly transfer some of these nontax-qualified supplemental executive benefits into their existing tax-qualified DB plans. In effect, plans accomplish this by increasing the benefits under the qualified plan, with an offsetting reduction in the benefits under the nonqualified plan, which extends to the HCE the security of DB plan funding and the tax benefits of a qualified plan. These arrangements, commonly referred to as Qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (QSERP), can provide HCEs with a higher <b>qualified</b> benefit <b>amount,</b> the tax advantages provided by a qualified plan, as well as the increased benefit security provided by the backing of qualified plan assets. Since QSERPs are provided to HCEs, but are funded by the assets used to pay qualified plan benefits for all employees, some observers have questioned whether these arrangements affect the benefits promised to NHCEs. ...|$|R
