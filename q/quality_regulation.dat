40|$|The use of {{cost-benefit}} analysis by federal regulatory agencies has expanded greatly {{in scope and}} sophistication. Unfortunately, agencies continue to employ private cost, rather than social cost, to evaluate environmental <b>quality</b> <b>regulations.</b> Furthermore, general equilibrium impacts and intertemporal effects of regulations are typically {{not included in the}} evaluation. In this paper, the authors estimate the social cost of environmental <b>quality</b> <b>regulations</b> mandated by the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. They construct an econometric general equilibrium model of the United States to demonstrate that social costs estimates diverge sharply from private costs estimates. The authors also demonstrate that general equilibrium impacts are significant and pervasive. Copyright 1990 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R

When developing a drugdevice combination product, should a pharmaceutical company supplement its quality system by incorporating device quality system elements into a GMP-based quality system to create a hybrid quality system? Uncertainty exists over FDA’s expectations for quality systems that control combination product design, development and manufacture.
