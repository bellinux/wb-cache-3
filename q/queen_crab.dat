5000|$|During combat missions, {{players will}} face {{a wide variety of}} enemies, {{including}} an evolving assortment of aliens. Some of the most challenging enemies that players {{will face a}}re bus-sized, boss aliens. For example, one alien boss is called a <b>Crab</b> <b>Queen.</b> Among its abilities, a <b>Crab</b> <b>Queen</b> will be able to create a microbial mist which reveals to the aliens on the battlefield any soldiers who enter it and which can buff or revive aliens. This mist will create a literal fog of war which actively works to advantage aliens in battle and otherwise bolsters the horror themes of the game. A <b>Crab</b> <b>Queen</b> also will be able to spawn new aliens during combat that will quickly mutate in to threats for soldiers on the battlefield. [...] These abilities of the <b>Crab</b> <b>Queen</b> and those of other aliens often will be locked to their use of a particular body parts that can be targeted by weapons. Tactical targeting therefore will be able to help players to defeat giant boss aliens like a <b>Crab</b> <b>Queen.</b> Early screenshots of a game prototype show that Phoenix Point will have a targeting system which will work similarly to the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (VATS) used in Fallout. This targeting system will provide a wider selection of tactical choices that players can make in combat to take down difficult foes. For example, a soldier might target a claw of an alien boss to disable a melee attack, an arm to disable a weapon, or an organ that gives the alien boss a special ability. These tactical options allow players to combat adversaries which may be significantly tougher than those found in more traditional X-COM games.|$|R

40|$|For {{over two}} decades the Alaskan snow crab {{industry}} {{has been an important}} component of the economic health of the Alaskan crab fisheries. This has been particularly true given the substantial historical stock declines in the Alaskan king and Tanner crab fisheries. However, dwindling local stocks, combined with substantial increases in snow (<b>Queen)</b> <b>crab</b> from Canada and other countries, has raised considerable concern over the sustained economic health from these fisheries. This paper reports on an econometric model of the Alaskan and Canadian snow crab fishery designed to both document the exvessel and wholesale price and revenue responses to harvest and market conditions, and to document the pre-crab rationalization market performance of the Alaskan snow crab fishery on the eve of the historic implementation of both harvester and processor quotas.
