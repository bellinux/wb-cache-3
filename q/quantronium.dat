5000|$|The three superconducting qubit archetypes are the phase, {{charge and}} flux qubits, though many hybridizations exist (Fluxonium, Transmon, Xmon, <b>Quantronium).</b> For any qubit implementation, the logical quantum states [...] {{are to be}} mapped to the {{different}} states of the physical system, typically to the discrete (quantized) energy levels or to their quantum superpositions. In the charge qubit, different energy levels correspond to an integer number of Cooper pairs on a superconducting island. In the flux qubit, the energy levels correspond to different integer numbers of magnetic flux quanta trapped in a superconducting ring. In the phase qubit, the energy levels correspond to different quantum charge oscillation amplitudes across a Josephson junction, where the charge and the phase are analogous to momentum and position correspondingly of a quantum harmonic oscillator. Note that the phase here is the complex argument of the superconducting wavefunction, {{also known as the}} superconducting order parameter, not the phase between the different states of the qubit.|$|E
40|$|Bloch {{oscillations}} {{predicted to}} occur in current-biased single Josephson junctions have eluded direct observation up to now. Here, we demonstrate similar Bloch oscillations in a slightly richer Josephson circuit, the <b>quantronium.</b> The <b>quantronium</b> is a Bloch transistor with two small junctions in series, defining an island, in parallel with a larger junction. In the ground state, the microwave impedance of the device is modulated periodically with the charge on the gate capacitor coupled to the transistor island. When a current flows across this capacitor, the impedance modulation occurs at the Bloch frequency, which yields Bloch sidebands in the spectrum of a reflected continuous microwave signal. We have measured this spectrum, and compared it to predictions based on a simple model for the circuit. We discuss the interest of this experiment for metrology and for mesoscopic physics...|$|E

40|$|Dispersive {{readouts}} for superconducting qubits {{have the}} advantage of speed and minimal invasiveness. We have developed such an amplifier, the Cavity Bifurcation Amplifier (CBA) [10], and applied it to the readout of the <b>quantronium</b> qubit [2]. It consists of a Josephson junction embedded in a microwave on-chip resonator. In contrast with the Josephson bifurcation amplifier [17], which has an on-chip capacitor shunting a junction, the resonator is based on a simple coplanar waveguide imposing a pre-determined frequency and whose other RF characteristics like the quality factor are easily controlled and optimized. Under proper microwave irradiation conditions, the CBA has two metastable states. Which state is adopted by the CBA depends on the state of a <b>quantronium</b> qubit coupled to the CBA's junction. Due to the MHz repetition rate and large signal to noise ratio we can show directly that the coherence is limited by 1 /f gate charge noise when biased at the sweet spot - a point insensitive to first order gate charge fluctuations. This architecture lends itself to scalable quantum computing using a multi-resonator chip with multiplexed readouts. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures To be published in Physical Review...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} superconducting tunnel {{junction}} circuit which behaves as a controllable atom, and whose ground and first excited state form an effective spin 1 / 2. By applying microwave pulses, we have performed on this circuit experiments demonstrating the controlled {{manipulation of the}} spin: Rabi precession, Ramsey interferences, and spin echoes. The state variables of an electrical circuit, like voltages and currents {{can be made to}} behave quantum mechanically by minimizing the coupling to external degrees of freedom through a proper design. Circuits based on superconducting tunnel junctions have displayed signatures of macroscopic quantum behavior [1 – 7], but the level of coherence of the quantum states remained until now much smaller than for isolated atoms or ions. In the “quantronium ” circuit presented here, a coherence quality factor of more than 104 has been obtained, thus allowing the coherent manipulation {{of the state of the}} system like in atomic physics and NMR experiments [8]. The <b>quantronium</b> consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by two adjacent small Josephson tunnel junctions with capacitance Cj/ 2 and Josephson energy EJ/ 2 each, which define a low capacitance super-conducting electrode called the “island”, and by a large Josephson junction with large Josephson energy (EJ 0 ≈ 20 EJ) (see Fig. 1).

We propose a way to analyze low frequency fluctuations in terms of fictitious correlated fluctuations of external parameters. We discuss a specific implementation, namely the <b>Quantronium</b> setup of a Cooper-pair box, showing that optimizing the trade-off between efficient coupling and protection against noise may allow us to observe coherent population transfer in this nanodevice...|$|E

40|$|During this thesis, we {{have used}} superconducting {{circuits}} with Josephson junctions, derived from the Cooper pair box, in order to implement quantum bits (qubits). To implement two-qubit gates, we have developed a new circuit, the quantroswap, which consists in two capacitively coupled Cooper pair box, each of them being manipulated and read separately. We have demonstrated coherent exchange of energy between them, but we have also observed a problem of qubit instability. In order to avoid this spurious effect, we have implemented another circuit based on a charge insensitive split Cooper pair box coupled to a non-linear resonator for readout-out purpose. We have measured large coherence time, and obtained large readout fidelity (90 %) using the bifurcation phenomenon.

40|$|We {{investigate}} by {{theory and}} experiment, the Josephson junction switching current detector {{in an environment}} with frequency dependent damping. Analysis of the circuit's phase space show that a favorable topology for switching can be obtained with overdamped dynamics at high frequencies. A pulse-and-hold method is described, where a fast switch pulse brings the circuit close to an unstable point in the phase space when biased at the hold level. Experiments are performed on Cooper pair transistors and <b>Quantronium</b> circuits, which are overdamped at high frequencies with an on-chip RC shunt. For 20 us switch pulses the switching process is well described by thermal equilibrium escape, based on a generalization of Kramers formula {{to the case of}} frequency dependent damping. A capacitor bias method is used to create very rapid, 25 ns switch pulses, where it is observed that the switching process is not governed by thermal equilibrium noise.

40|$|These notes {{provide an}} {{introduction}} to the solid state quantum electrical circuits developed during recent years, following recent propositions for quantum machines. If no quantum-classical frontier indeed exists between the microscopic world and the macroscopic one, quantum machines could indeed take advantage of the richness of quantum physics for performing specic tasks more e-ciently than classical ones. Although no quantum machine has been operated yet, probing quantum mechanics with collective variables involving a large number of underlying microscopic degrees of freedom is already an important goal. As expected, decoherence plays there an important role. We present here the systematic investigation carried out on the <b>quantronium</b> circuit developed by our team. 2 Towards quantum machines Very interesting propositions for truly quantum machines, in which state variables are ruled by quantum mechanics, appeared in the domain of processors after Deutsch and Josza showed that the concept of algorithmic complexity is hardware dependent. It was shown that a simple set of unitary operations on an ensemble of coupled two level systems, called quantum bits (qubits), is sucient to perform some specic computing tasks in a smaller number of algorithmic steps tha...|$|E
40|$|The "quantronium" is a superconducting qubit {{consisting}} of a split Cooper pair box in which a large tunnel junction is inserted. This circuit has a special bias point where the Larmor frequency is, to first order, insensitive to fluctuations in the bias parameters [...] the charge of the box island and the phase of the large junction. At this optimal working point, {{the state of the}} qubit can be determined by dispersive measurements that probe the second derivative of the state energy with respect to these bias parameters. We use the <b>quantronium</b> phase degree of freedom to perform a non-linear, dispersive measurement of its inductive response using bifurcation amplification. This novel readout projects the state of the qubit in a few nanoseconds, and its latching property allows us to record the resulting information in a few hundred nanoseconds. We have measured, using this technique, Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes with an improved signal to noise ratio and contrast. The speed of this new readout scheme also opens the door for a new class of experiments which would characterize the relaxation processes associated with the measurement protocol.

40|$|The superconducting charge-phase "quantronium" qubit is {{considered}} {{in order to}} develop a model for the measurement process used in the experiment of Vion [Science 296, 886 (2002) ]. For this model we propose a method for including the bias current in the readout process in a fundamentally irreversible way, which to first order is approximated by the Josephson junction tilted-washboard potential phenomenology. The decohering bias current is introduced {{in the form of a}} Lindblad operator and the Wigner function for the current-biased readout Josephson junction is derived and analyzed. During the readout current pulse used in the <b>quantronium</b> experiment we find that the coherence of the qubit initially prepared in a symmetric superposition state is lost at a time of 0. 2 ns after the bias current pulse has been applied, a time scale that is much shorter than the experimental readout time. Additionally we look at the effect of Johnson-Nyquist noise with zero mean from the current source during the qubit manipulation and show that the decoherence due to the irreversible bias current description is an order of magnitude smaller than that found through adding noise to the reversible tilted-washboard potential model. Our irreversible bias current model is also applicable to persistent-current-based qubits where the state is measured according to its flux via a small-inductance direct-current superconducting quantum interference device...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{technological}} progress in quantum-state engineering in superconducting devices {{there is an}} increasing demand for techniques of quantum control. Stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) is a powerful method in quantum optics which has remained largely unknown to solid-state physicists. It is used to achieve highly efficient and controlled population transfer in (discrete) multilevel quantum systems[1]. Apart from other potential applications in solid-state physics, adiabatic passage offers interesting possibilities to manipulate qubit circuits, in particular for the generation of nonclassical states in nanomechanical or electromagnetic resonators[2]. In this contribution, we study in detail a possible implementation of the STIRAP protocol in the <b>Quantronium,</b> a superconducting nanocircuit based on Josephson junctions in the so called charge-phase regime. Il has been proposed[2] that this devices is {{a good candidate for}} observing coherent adiabatic population transfer for its characteristics of low decoherence and efficient addressability by external AC electromagnetic fields. In particular we present a detailed analysis of the efect of broadband charge noise, which is the main source of decoherence for this device, extending to a three level system the theory proposed in Ref. [3]. It is shown that the effect of high-frequency noise is similar to the quantum optical case. The main problem in solid state devices comes from low-frequency noise, which has the 1 /f form. In this case it may produce stray two-photon detunings which prevent the device to evolve adiabaticaly towards the correct target state. However inducing Zener tunneling between Autler-Townes states it is shown to increase the population transfer efficiency, minimizing the effect of low-frequency noise...|$|E
