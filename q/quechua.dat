5|$|Jim Elliot {{first heard}} of the Huaorani in 1950 from a former missionary to Ecuador, and {{afterwards}} indicated that God had called him to Ecuador to evangelize the Huaorani. He began corresponding with his friend Pete Fleming about his desire to minister in Ecuador, and in 1952 the two men set sail for Guayaquil as missionaries with the Plymouth Brethren. For six months they lived in Quito {{with the goal of}} learning Spanish. They then moved to Shandia, a <b>Quechua</b> mission station deep in the Ecuadorian jungle. There they worked under the supervision of a Christian Missions in Many Lands missionary, Wilfred Tidmarsh, and began exposing themselves to the culture and studying the <b>Quechua</b> language.|$|E
5|$|The Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), {{also known}} as tunki (<b>Quechua),</b> is a large {{passerine}} bird of the cotinga family native to Andean cloud forests in South America.

5|$|Spanish missionaries {{found that}} fever was treated by Amerindians near Loxa (Peru) with powder from Peruvian bark (later {{established}} to be from any of several trees of genus Cinchona). It {{was used by the}} <b>Quechua</b> Indians of Peru to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills. Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the <b>Quechua</b> using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the “fever tree” bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only “intermittent fever” was amenable to the fever tree bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, <b>Quechua,</b> Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated that half of the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
5|$|Tintin barely escapes {{the ship}} with his life, {{and he and}} Haddock alert the authorities; but the abductors evade the police and take Calculus to the Andes {{mountain}}s. Tintin and Haddock pursue them to the mountain town of Jauga, where they board a train that is sabotaged {{in an attempt to}} kill them. When they attempt to investigate the whereabouts of Calculus, the local Indios prove to be peculiarly tight-lipped, but then Tintin befriends a young <b>Quechua</b> boy named Zorrino after saving him from Spaniard bullies. A mysterious man observes this act of kindness and gives Tintin a medallion, telling him that it will save him from danger. Zorrino informs Tintin that Calculus is taken to the Temple of the Sun, which lies deep within the Andes, and offers to take them there.|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a woolen mask, the ukukus (spectacled bear) {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims.

When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In <b>Quechua</b> mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E

5|$|Castelli {{set up his}} {{government}} in Chuquisaca, where he presided over the change of regime for the entire region. He planned the reorganization of the Mines of Potosi, and a reform at the University of Charcas. He proclaimed the end of native slavery and servitude in Upper Peru, and the natives were granted political rights equal {{to those of the}} criollos. Castelli forbade the establishment of new convents and parishes to avoid the common practice that, under the guise of spreading Christian doctrine, the natives were forced into servitude by religious orders. He authorized free trade and redistributed land expropriated from the former workers of the mills. The decree was published in Spanish, Guarani, <b>Quechua,</b> and Aymara; he established several bilingual schools as well. Several Indian chiefs participated in {{the first anniversary of the}} May Revolution, celebrated in Tiahuanaco, where Castelli paid tribute to the ancient Incas and encouraged the people to rise against the Spanish. Despite their welcome, however, Castelli was aware that most of the aristocracy supported the auxiliary army out of fear instead of genuine support.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Evo {{returned to his}} family, who had escaped the agricultural devastation of 1980's El Niño storm cycle by relocating to the Tropics of Cochabamba in the eastern lowlands. Setting up home {{in the town of}} Villa 14 de Septiembre, El Chapare, using a loan from Evo's maternal uncle, the family cleared a plot of land in the forest to grow rice, oranges, grapefruit, papaya, bananas and later on coca. It was here that Morales learned to speak <b>Quechua,</b> the indigenous local language. The arrival of the Morales family was a part of a much wider migration to the region; in 1981 El Chapare's population was 40,000 but by 1988 it had risen to 215,000. Many Bolivians hoped to set up farms where they could earn a living growing coca, which was experiencing a steady rise in price and which could be cultivated up to four times a year; a traditional medicinal and ritual substance in Andean culture, it was also sold abroad as the key ingredient in cocaine. Evo joined the local soccer team, before founding his own team, New Horizon, which proved victorious at the August 2nd Central Tournament. The El Chapare region remained special to Morales for many years to come; during his presidency he often talked of it in speeches and regularly visited.|$|E
25|$|South Bolivian <b>Quechua</b> is a Quechuan {{language}} spoken by some 800,000 people, mostly immigrants who have {{arrived in the}} last years. There are 70,000 estimated speakers in Salta Province. The language {{is also known as}} Central Bolivian <b>Quechua,</b> which has six dialects.

40|$|Two Bolivian samples {{belonging}} to the two main Andean linguistic groups (Aymaras and <b>Quechuas)</b> were studied for mtDNA and Y-chromosome uniparental markers to evaluate sex-specific differences and give {{new insights into the}} demographic processes of the Andean region. mtDNA-coding polymorphisms, HVI-HVII control regions, 17 Y-STRs, and three SNPs were typed in two well-defined populations with adequate size samples. The two Bolivian samples showed more genetic differences for the mtDNA than for the Y-chromosome. For the mtDNA, 81 % of Aymaras and 61 % of <b>Quechuas</b> presented haplogroup B 2. Native American Y-chromosomes were found in 97 % of Aymaras (89 % hg Q 1 a 3 a and 11 % hg Q 1 a 3 *) and 78 % of <b>Quechuas</b> (100 % hg Q 1 a 3 a). Our data revealed high diversity values in the two populations, in agreement with other Andean studies. The comparisons with the available literature for both sets of markers indicated that the central Andean area is relatively homogeneous. For mtDNA, the Aymaras seemed to have been more isolated throughout time, maintaining their genetic characteristics, while the <b>Quechuas</b> have been more permeable to the incorporation of female foreigners and Peruvian influences. On the other hand, male mobility would have been widespread across the Andean region according to the homogeneity found in the area. Particular genetic characteristics presented by both samples support a past common origin of the Altiplano populations in the ancient Aymara territory, with independent, although related histories, with Peruvian (<b>Quechuas)</b> populations...|$|R
25|$|Lexical {{modernization}} {{has also}} been critical {{to the development of}} <b>Quechua.</b> Language planners have attempted to create new <b>Quechua</b> words primarily through <b>Quechua</b> morphemes, which are combined in new ways to give new meanings. In general, loanwords from other languages are considered only when there are no possibilities to develop the word through existing <b>Quechua</b> structures. If loanwords are adopted into the language, linguists attempt to phonologically adapt the word to match typical <b>Quechua</b> pronunciation norms.|$|E
25|$|The major {{obstacle}} to a more widespread use of the <b>Quechua</b> language {{is the fact that}} multiple dialects of this language exist. <b>Quechua,</b> along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages, was originally and remains essentially an oral language. Therefore, {{there is a lack of}} modern media which use it: for example books, newspapers, software, magazines, technical journals, etc. However, non-governmental organizations, as well as state sponsored groups, are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the <b>Quechua</b> language; for instance, in late 2005 a version of Don Quixote was presented in <b>Quechua.</b> There has also been an increasing and organized effort to teach <b>Quechua</b> in public schools in the areas where <b>Quechua</b> is spoken.|$|E

25|$|The {{search for}} a unified {{alphabet}} reflects the process of standardization.
