In 2011, experiments were conducted to create nihonium, flerovium, and moscovium isotopes in the reactions between calcium-48 projectiles and targets of americium-243 and plutonium-244. The targets included lead and bismuth impurities and hence some isotopes of bismuth and polonium were generated in nucleon transfer reactions. This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively moscovium and livermorium.

Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH3, McH3, PoH2, and LvH2 are needed before chemical investigations take place. Moscovium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future, a property livermorium would then share with its lighter congener polonium.

IR 125, is shown to react with OH, and be sufficiently less reactive with other tropospheric oxidants that when exposed to tropospheric air samples, changes in the dye fluorescence are related to the ambient OH concentration. A near-infrared fluorimeter was constructed to determine IR 125 concentrations. Detection of 10 - 12 M IR 125 in solution was obtained. This sensitivity allows observation of changes in IR 125 concentrations due to reaction with typical tropospheric OH concentrations. Changes in the fluorescence of IR 125 when sampling the ambient air using dye impregnated <b>quartz</b> <b>wool</b> cartridges were shown to follow predicted OH concentrations for the observed environmental conditions.

TPD analysis was carried out from ambient temperature to 600  °C at a heating rate of 10  °C/min. The ammonia concentration in the effluent stream was monitored with the thermal conductivity detector and the area under the peak was integrated using the software GRAMS/ 32 to {{determine the amount of}} desorbed ammonia.|$|E
30|$|The {{oxidation}} of cyclohexane {{was carried}} out in a fixed bed vertical downward flow glass reactor (internal diameter 6  mm), operated under atmospheric pressure. About 2  ml of the pretreated catalyst was placed at the hot zone of the reactor, supported on either side with a thin layer of <b>quartz</b> <b>wool</b> and ceramic beads. The reaction temperature was monitored by a thermocouple placed {{in the middle of the}} catalyst bed. The catalyst was activated at 250  °C for 2  h, before reaction in a controlled stream of air as a carrier gas with a flow rate of 50  ml min− 1. The cyclohexane reactant was fed into the reactor with the required flow rate (3  ml/h) using a syringe infusion pump. The collected products in the receiver flask were analysed in a gas chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a HP- 1 capillary column (60  m ×  0.32  mm ×  0.5  μm) and a flame ionization detector.|$|E
