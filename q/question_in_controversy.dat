Though a Catholic priest and professor of history at the Catholic university of Lyon, the Abbé (afterwards Canon) Chevalier maintained an independent critical attitude even on religious <b>questions.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>controversy</b> on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin (sudario), he worked by tracing back the history of the cloth, which was undoubtedly used as a shroud, but he argued was not produced before the 14th century and was probably no older (Le Saint Suaire de Lirey-Chambéry, Turin et les défenseurs de son authenticité). In 2006 French historian Emmanuel Poulle wrote in a peer-reviewed journal that Ulysse Chevalier showed in this case intellectual dishonesty. According to Poulle, Chevalier deliberately did not correctly mention the Papal bulls of antipope Clement VII issued in 1390. In fact Clement VII never opted for the forgery thesis.|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} paradigm that prostaglandins (PGs) are {{of central}} {{importance in the}} initiation of labor has been challenged. A group of investigators has recently reported that the amniotic fluid concentrations of PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) increase only late {{in the course of}} labor implying that 2 ̆ 7 the accumulation of prostaglandins in amniotic fluid is an after-effect of labor and not indicative of a role of these compounds in the initiation of human parturition 2 ̆ 7. The present study was conducted to determine whether amniotic fluid prostaglandin concentrations increase prior to the onset of human labor, the central <b>question</b> <b>in</b> this <b>controversy.</b> Three amniocenteses were performed in 17 women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy - the first two prior to the onset of labor and the third during early spontaneous labor. PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) were measured with sensitive and specific radioimmunoassays. Amniotic fluid concentrations of PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) increased prior to the onset of spontaneous labor. An additional increase in the concentrations of PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) was found in samples obtained in early labor. We conclude that an increase in prostaglandin bioavailability precedes the onset of spontaneous human parturition...|$|R

Once the threat has been agreed to, the critical <b>question</b> <b>in</b> addressing this <b>controversy's</b> political dimension is asking which nations should be involved. This project discusses the rewards afforded by a particular nation’s inclusion and the accompanying costs. I do not intend this project to be comprehensive. Rather this paper documents the political prerequisites for a joint missile defense. If a certain joint missile defense option {{does not make sense}} politically, then there is little reason to detail such a program's fiscal costs or technical feasibility. Likewise, if certain options are politically desirable, they should be subjected to the further possibility of policy rejection from economic and technological standpoints.

40|$|A {{forgotten}} 18 th-Century Poet: Greta Giädda on the Bales, Boons and Blessings of Marriage (En bortglömd 1700 -talspoet. Greta Giädda om äktenskapets ve, väl och välsignelse In {{this paper}} we meet Greta Giädda (ca 1680 – 1753), a (minor) poet fairly unknown to posterity {{from the first}} part of the 18 th century. However, she happened to enter the history of Swedish literature when she rose strong objections to the Swedish poet, Johan Runius, and his energetic defence in a wedding poem, 1712, of matrimony and the supposed happy life together as hus­band and wife. As a matter of fact, she started a versified quarrel with her "Contra-vers" — the term is hers. This quarrel is well known but not her identity as author of this "Contra-vers", nor her text. Thanks to the discovery of her manuscripts in the Linköping Diocese Library, we can now get a better knowledge of this controversy about marriage, compulsion and freedom. Some of her poems handed down to us, foremost occasional poetry, were printed. An appendix registers all of her poems. Another appendix presents an early text by Samuel Triewald, who in this way contributed to the on-going discussion. The paper also describes two cultural places that were very likely important to Greta Giädda, namely first a vicarage in Stockholm and later on, a manor in Östergötland. Not least this rural manor was obviously a place where the burning <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> the <b>controversy</b> between Greta Giädda and Johan Runius in the year 1712 were continuously discussed...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, federal courts have {{adjudicated}} proliferating challenges to novel policy responses to terrorism. Judges often resolve the {{individual rights and}} statutory interpretation <b>questions</b> implicated <b>in</b> those <b>controversies</b> by deploying presumptions or rules of thumb derived from the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s Separation of Powers. These 2 ̆ 2 structural constitutional presumptions 2 ̆ 2 serve as heuristics to facilitate adjudication and to enable judicial bypass of difficult legal, policy, and factual questions. This Article challenges {{the use of such}} structural presumptions in counterterrorism cases. Drawing upon recent empirical research in political science, political psychology, and security studies, it demonstrates that abstract eighteenth-century Separation of Powers ideals do not translate into robust and empirically defensible generalizations for twenty-first-century security decisions. Structural constitutionalism thus cannot serve as a foundation for heuristics or shortcuts in the judicial consideration of new security measures. To the extent courts properly pass on the legality of counterterrorism policies, judges should rely instead on the ordinary tools of doctrine, statutory construction, and fact finding. The ensuing jurisprudence of counterterrorism would look much more like ordinary public law...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{plant hormone}} abscisic acid (ABA) regulates diverse {{processes}} of plant growth and development. It {{has recently been}} proposed that GCR 2 functions as a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for ABA. However, the structural relationships and functionality of GCR 2 have been challenged by several independent studies. A central <b>question</b> <b>in</b> this <b>controversy</b> is whether gcr 2 mutants are insensitive to ABA, because gcr 2 mutants were shown to display reduced sensitivity to ABA under one experimental condition (e. g. 22 degrees C, continuous white light with 150 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1)) but were shown to display wild-type sensitivity under another slightly different condition (e. g. 23 degrees C, 14 / 10 hr photoperiod with 120 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1)). It has been hypothesized that gcr 2 appears only weakly insensitive to ABA because two other GCR 2 -like genes in Arabidopsis, GCL 1 and GCL 2, compensate {{for the loss of}} function of GCR 2. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to test this hypothesis, we isolated a putative loss-of-function allele of GCL 2, and then generated all possible combinations of mutations in each member of the GCR 2 gene family. We found that all double mutants, including gcr 2 gcl 1, gcr 2 gcl 2, gcl 1 gcl 2, as well as the gcr 2 gcl 1 gcl 2 triple mutant displayed wild-type sensitivity to ABA in seed germination and early seedling development assays, demonstrating that the GCR 2 gene family is not required for ABA responses in these processes. CONCLUSION: These results provide compelling genetic evidence that GCR 2 is unlikely to act as a receptor for ABA in the context of either seed germination or early seedling development...|$|R
