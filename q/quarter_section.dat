50|$|In November 2012, the Town of Beaumont {{unveiled}} {{a proposal to}} annex twenty-four <b>quarter</b> <b>sections</b> (560 ha) from Leduc County including twelve <b>quarter</b> <b>sections</b> to the north, eight {{to the west and}} four to the south. Four months later in March 2013, after Edmonton's city council voted 11-1 in favour, Mayor Mandel announced the city's intent to annex approximately 15600 ha of land from Leduc County along {{the entire length of the}} city's southern boundary, including the Edmonton International Airport (EIA). The area included eight of the twelve <b>quarter</b> <b>sections</b> previously identified for annexation by Beaumont. Two months later in May 2013, Beaumont amended its notice of intent to annex after consulting with the public and conducting negotiations with Leduc County, which changed the configuration and reduced the amount of <b>quarter</b> <b>sections</b> to its north. The amendment reduced the overlap from eight to five <b>quarter</b> <b>sections.</b> Nearly a year later, Edmonton expanded its notice of intent to annex in April 2015 to include lands adjacent to Beaumont's northern boundary, increasing the overlap from five to nine <b>quarter</b> <b>sections.</b> A merit hearing before the Municipal Government Board (MGB) was conducted in June 2016 on Beaumont's annexation application, after which the MGB recommended to the provincial government to approve the application. The provincial government approved Beaumont's annexation application in November 2016 with an effective date of January 1, 2017.|$|R

25|$|After {{passage of}} the federal Homestead Act in 1862, a few hardy {{settlers}} were drawn {{by the promise of}} free 160-acre (65ha) parcels. After the claimant filed for the land, they had gained full ownership after five years of residence or by paying $1.50 per acre within six months. Each claim was for 160 acres, a <b>quarter</b> <b>section</b> of free government land. The first to file a land patent was Micheal Pfeiffer on January 20, 1883, who claimed two sections of land he already resided on near and immediately north of the mouth of Sycamore Canyon. They had six more children later on.|$|E
25|$|Howard {{continued}} {{to push for}} Congress to appropriate land for allocation to freedmen. With support from Thaddeus Stevens and William Fessenden, Congress began to debate a new bill for Black settlement of public lands in the South. The result was the Southern Homestead Act, which opened 46,398,544.87 acres of land in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas to homesteading; initially 80-acre parcels (half-quarter section) until June 1868, and thereafter 160-acre parcels (<b>quarter</b> <b>section).</b> Johnson signed this bill and it went into effect on June 21, 1866. Until January 1, 1867, the bill specified, only free Blacks and loyal Whites would be allowed access to these lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} land {{grant to}} an entire class of people was not so unusual in the 1700s and 1800s as it seems today. For example, Thomas Jefferson {{proposed}} a grant of 50 acres to any free man who didn't already have at least 50 acres in his draft of a revolutionary constitution for Virginia in 1776. More proximately, various Homestead Acts were passed 1862–1916, granting 160–640 acres (a <b>quarter</b> <b>section</b> to a full section), depending on the act, and earlier homesteading occurred under statutues such as the Preemption Act of 1841. Freedmen were not generally eligible for homesteading, {{because they were not}} citizens, which changed with the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, when they were granted citizenship.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll be damned if a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this <b>quarter</b> <b>section</b> Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E

50|$|During its war of {{independence}} from Spain, {{the government of}} Gran Colombia had incurred a number of debts to private European creditors. Its three daughter states: Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, split the debts amongst themselves. In 1837, Ecuador assumed responsibility for 21.5 percent of the debt. In the 1850s, a committee of holders of Latin American bonds organized itself and sent several representatives to Ecuador to arrange settlement of the debt. On September 21, 1957, George S.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{identifying}} quantitative imaging (e. g.

Determining CaP extent on in vivo MRI is difficult to do; however, with the availability of ex vivo surgical whole mount histological sections (WMHS) for CaP patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, co-registration methods can be applied to align and map disease extent onto pre-operative MR imaging from the post-operative histology. Yet obtaining digitized images of WHMS for co-registration with the pre-operative MRI is cumbersome since (a) most digital slide scanners are unable to accommodate the entire section, and (b) significant technical expertise is required for whole mount slide preparation. Consequently, most centers opt to construct <b>quartered</b> <b>sections</b> of each histology slice. Prior to co-registration with MRI, however, these <b>quartered</b> <b>sections</b> need to be digitally stitched together to reconstitute a digital, pseudo WMHS.
