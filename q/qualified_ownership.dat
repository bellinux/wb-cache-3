50|$|Under early English common law, estrays were {{forfeited}} to {{the king}} or lord of the manor; under modern statutes, provision is made for taking up stray animals and acquiring either title to them or a lien for the expenses incurred in keeping them. A person taking up an estray has a <b>qualified</b> <b>ownership</b> in it, which becomes absolute if the owner fails to claim the animal within the statutory time limit. Whether the animal escaped through the owner's negligence or through the wrongful act of a third person is immaterial. If the owner reclaims the estray, he is liable for reasonable costs of its upkeep. The use of an estray {{during the period of}} <b>qualified</b> <b>ownership,</b> other than for its own preservation or {{for the benefit of the}} owner, is not authorized. Some statutes limit the right to take up estrays to certain classes of persons, to certain seasons or places, or to animals requiring care.|$|E
40|$|English {{opportunities}} {{regulation is}} confused about {{its relationship to}} the concepts of ownership and property. Recent reform proposals from the Company Law Review Steering group would have changed English law's dominant regulatory lens: {{the way in which it}} thinks about the opportunities problem, from an approach focused on conflicts of interest to one focused on the 'ownership' of opportunities. This ownership approach is commonly referred to as the corporate opportunities doctrine. This article argues that the proposal failed as it did not consider the interpretative possibilities generated by changing the regulatory lens. However, the proposal inadvertently makes a contribution to the debate as it directs our attention to the function and meaning of ownership concepts in the opportunities context. Property in the opportunities setting is simply a label for <b>qualified</b> <b>ownership</b> as between the director and the company. However, the article argues that by understanding references to property in terms of traditional notions of property English law and commentary has obstructed the consideration and development of a long-standing English corporate opportunities doctrine...|$|E

The property law has special protection in the legal system, we can highlight the importance of this subject, especially economic. This discussion t is constantly evolving, changing according to the political system and the economic system of each society. Initially, attributed to an individual and absolute character of private property, in the interests solely of the owners. With the evolution of constitutionalism today assign by a socialistic character, the exercise of property law is subject to the social function. It is important show that the performance are different for urban and rural property, but are related, in short, we need a better distribution of land, access to decent housing, and protection of values such as the environment, heritage and cultural. In order to make it effective, the Constitution and the infra-constitutional legislation established rules for expropriation, creating a differentiated regime to not fulfill their social function.

The civil code further provides that ‘immovable assets in Ethiopia which are vacant and without a master shall be {{the property of the}} state’ (Civil Code Art 1194).

5000|$|In Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.S. 468 (2003), the Supreme Court {{determined}} {{that in order}} for a government owned corporation to qualify as a Foreign State under the FSIA because a majority of its [...] "shares or other ownership interest" [...] are owned by a foreign state or political subdivision, the foreign state must directly own a majority of the corporation's shares. In Dole, two chemical corporations indirectly owned by the Israeli government sought to remove a case from Hawaii State Court to Hawaii Federal Court on the basis that the FSIA applied. The Supreme Court concluded that because the Israeli government did not directly own a majority of the companies shares, the corporations could not be considered [...] "Foreign States" [...] and the FSIA therefore did not apply. The court specifically rejected the companies' argument that Israel's majority interest in the companies through indirect <b>ownership</b> <b>qualified</b> as an [...] "other ownership interest" [...] under the FSIA or that Israel's actual control over the corporations would qualify. In reaching its conclusion the court also held that the determination as to whether a defendant qualifies as a Foreign State is made at the time the plaintiff files the complaint.|$|R
40|$|The 1979 Hawaii State Legislature {{authorized}} {{the issuance of}} $ 125 million in revenue bonds for the Hawaii Housing Authority’s and Mortgage Program more commonly known as Hula Mae. The proceeds of the bonds were used to provide loans to low- and moderate-income families at lower than conventional mortgage interest rates. On June 17, 1980, Governor George Ariyoshi signed into law, legislation for a second $ 100 million Hula Mae offering. Since high interest rates cause higher monthly mortgage payments, the Hula Mae program was geared towards “the gap group” - a group with income too high to qualify for federal rent subsidies, and too low to <b>qualify</b> for home <b>ownership.</b> The Hula Mae program was intended to {{provide an opportunity for}} home ownership to people who could not have qualified in any other way. The purpose of the Hula Mae program was to alleviate the shortage of long term financing at affordable interest rates, which the Legislature felt was a major cause of the continuing housing problem in Hawaii. This paper is designed to analyze the characteristics {{of the participants in the}} first Hula Mae offering and determine whether these borrowers could have qualified under various mortgage financing alternatives. The null hypothesis is: The Hula Mae program participants could not have qualified for alternative mortgage financing during the period of the Hula Mae loan program.

40|$|This study locates late-twentieth-century roadlogues (nonfiction, prose {{accounts}} of American road trips) by British writers within {{the tradition of}} the postwar American highway narrative in travel writing, novels, and film. It exposes the discursive structures and textual constraints underlying seven case studies published in the 1990 s by comparing them to texts from various genres in diachronic and synchronic contexts. It contributes to scholarship on the American highway narrative, which largely overlooks British texts. It complements research on British travel writing, which tends to be biased towards pre-twentieth-century texts by travellers whose culture is in a dominant relation to that of travellees. It adds to postcolonial studies through analysis of representations of the other where otherness is reduced and complicated by a history of cultural exchange. The methodology combines several approaches including discourse theory, discourse analysis, narrative theory, feminist criticism, and theories of tourism. Three main areas are considered: identity, in relation to nationality and gender; the road writer's gaze, with regard to vehicles and roads; and intertextuality, on the margins (in maps) and inside roadlogues (in direct and indirect allusions). The study concludes that contemporary British roadlogues are in what is almost a subordinate relation to American highway narratives, evidenced by extensive influence of American texts. However, this subordination is <b>qualified</b> by joint <b>ownership</b> of western and New World myths, vestiges of imperial superiority, and selective deference by British writers. The latter is demonstrated through a consumer approach to American culture afforded by the episodic structure of the road trip and encouraged by the niche-oriented nature of the current market for travel writing. While American writers regard roadscapes with imperial eyes and experience the road trip as a rite of passage, contemporary Britons generally engage in superficial role play and remain untransformed by American highways...|$|R
40|$|Some of the {{developed}} Western European countries and countries of East Europe that are in transition process, found themselves at different conceptual and ideological positions, regarding the notional characteristics of ownership and understanding it's absoluteness. The East of Europe, which was, for decades, known for excessive state interventionism and drastic reducing of private property, is today dominated by the neoliberal concept. In the West, which is traditionally regarded as symbol of liberty and democracy, the state increasingly interferes in property rights, and limits ownership to a substantial extent. In legal systems of almost all European countries, exist norms which grant the owner of things {{a great deal of}} freedom, while, at the same time, they prescribe the possibility for the ownership rights to be limited. The difference, however, {{lies in the fact that}} in the majority of Eastern European countries, it is prescribed that the limitations can be introduced only through laws, while in certain Western European countries, it is possible to do so, by means of general acts of lower legal strength, enacted by bodies of executive power. Such normative solution exists in the French Civil Code. It allowed for the <b>ownership,</b> <b>qualified</b> as the most absolute, to be substantially limited, by means of special laws, and bylaws. Certain limitations have been introduced through practice of the Court of Cassation. A testimony to that is provided by the so called historical decisions, based on which, theories on abuse of rights (Théorie de l'abus de droit) and excessive disturbance of neighborhood (Théorie des troubles anormaux du voisinage), were developed. Some court decisions and legal literature state that ownership is no longer absolute. Similar conceptual positions are shared by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which is responsible for shaping the supranational law The liberal model which is widespread in the East of Europe offers the citizens a greater level of legal certainity, since limitations can be introduced only by law. On the other hand, the interventionistic (etatistic) approach, developed in France and in some other countries, allows for a more efficient protection of public interests, by the bodies of executive power, which can be of great importance, in the times of economic crisis and social instability. The choice of regulative model and direction of development of ownership relations lies in the domain of legal politics...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} discussing issues of ownership in connection to virtual worlds. We explore how divergent interests in virtual property can be mediated by applying a constructivist perspective to ownership. Virtual property is an important area of study {{for at least two}} reasons: First, the virtual trade has far-reaching consequences in the real world, including extensive economical consequences. Second, there is no agreement and no established practice regarding rights to virtual objects. Virtual worlds, where {{hundreds of thousands of people}} engage in thrilling scenarios, are a relatively new arena for social intercourse. To a large and increasing group of people virtual worlds are an important source of emotional and social well-being. The average player spends almost 20 hours a week in these environments. (Castronova, 2001) The trade with virtual property is constantly in progress and involves astonishing amounts of money. During a two week period in april 2004 the value of the trade on Ebay for the game Ultima Online reached 156 857 US$, have in mind that these is merely one game at one auction site under a short period of time. (Dibbell, 2004) The extensive trade shows that many players treat their virtual property as if it were their real private property. Meanwhile many license agreements explicitly state that all rights belong to the game developers. For instance, before playing Star Wars Galaxies, you must grant Sony Online Entertainment "a universal, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise all rights of any kind or nature associated with your Content". (Sony Online Entertainment, 2003) Evidently, there is a serious conflict of interest. This question of virtual ownership may at first seem quite abstract, yet sooner or later one of the game-companies will start to lose money and shut down their virtual world. When this happens, virtual property worth millions of dollars will instantaneously vanish. A player who has spent several years in the game and has had the option of selling his virtual assets for hundreds of dollars will face a considerable financial loss. (Thompson, 2004) Maybe the best known conflict of interest in the area so far is BlackSnow Interactive v. Mythic Entertainment, Inc. BlackSnow Interactive was a company in California who hired unskilled mexican labourers to develop high-level characters by regular gaming. BlackSnow later sold these characters for a decent profit. Mythic, the producer of the game played by BlackSnow’s labourers, found out about the enterprise and shut down all BlackSnow-related accounts, claiming infringement of the license agreement. BlackSnow, on the other hand, sued Mythic for unfair business practises. The opportunity to try the relevant rights and interests in a court of law unfortunately vanished when BlackSnow found itself unable to continue the process due to economical and legal problems unrelated to the lawsuit. At the moment there is no guidance at all concerning how conflicts of this sort should be solved. This paper continue the work in Laws of Virtual Worlds (Lastowka & Hunter, 2003) where the authors established that virtual property interests are indistinguishable from real world property interests, yet left the question of how these interests should be weighed unanswered. Richard Bartle has also considered the issue and concluded that legislators sooner or later will have to decide how to deal with virtual trade and that when they do so it should be in favour of the game-producers. (Bartle, 2004) Within the utilitarian tradition, it is a well established practice to view property rights as social and legal conventions that should be evaluated according to how well they contribute to the general welfare. (Bentham 1843) This instrumental approach to property has led to the development of theories about ownership as a bundle of rights. One need not endorse the normative claim about the general welfare in order to accept the bundle analysis of property. Henry Sidgwicks provides one early analysis of property as composed of three rights: a right to excluxive use, a right to destroy and a right to alienate. (Sigdwick 1891) Sidgwicks account has been followed by numerous alternative accounts, the most influental of which is Tony Honoré’s list of eleven components of ownership: The right to possess, the right to use, the right to manage, the right to income, the right to the capital, the right to security, the incident of transmissibility, the incident of absence of term, the duty to prevent harm, liability to execution, and a residuary character. (Honoré, 1961) Sidwick and Honoré attempt to account for the content of a full or complete or maximally extensive ownership. But in practice (as they are aware) not all cases of what we call ownership include all of the listed rights. Depending on the local legislation, you may not be allowed to decorate or refurbish your house the way you like, you may not be allowed to destroy the bills in your wallet, and you may not be allowed to bequeth your belongings the way you want. Still we call these things ours. Other things that we have some component rights to, such as a flat we rent, do not <b>qualify</b> as <b>ownership</b> in the common language. Though Honoré settles for a Wittgensteinian interpretation of family resemblence between different instances of ownership, with no core component, the right to sell (by Honoré included in the right to capital) is what often draws the line between ownership and rights without ownership. The division of bundles into ownership and simply legal rights is, however, but a terminological question. Bundles of rights can be legally construed in many different ways and new bundles are continousely created to handle new challenges resulting from technological change or innovative economical solutions. Thus such immaterial pieces of property as shares, options, patents and copyrights have become common to law and practice. By adopting a constructivist perspective on ownership, the property interests in virtual worlds can be analyzed in their own right, without relaying too heavily on inadequate notions of ownership. Whether gamers should have a right to sell their virtual belongings or not might determine whether or not we should call their interest in these belongings ownership. But regardless of how this matter is dealt with, there are other interests that are separable from those in trading that might deserve legal protection. An interest analyzis of the area will prepare the ground for future solutions to conflicts of interest that are bound to demand attention from court rooms and legislators sooner or later.
