25|$|The {{development}} of quadraphonic records {{was announced in}} 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of <b>matrixed</b> <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>records</b> produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.|$|R
50|$|KQIV {{continued}} to identify {{itself as a}} quadraphonic station {{in the hope that}} Quadraplex testing eventually would be permitted. Meanwhile, the station broadcast music from phonograph records encoded in various <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>matrix</b> formats.|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} heavily {{promoted}} by RadioShack {{stores in the}} USA, and there were quite a few companies that released albums encoded in this format. It is {{said it was the}} first commercial <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>matrix</b> system in the market. In America it was the first commercial quadraphonic system.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Vox and its {{subsidiaries}} issued {{a number of}} compatible quadraphonic/stereophonic recordings using the Sansui QS <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>matrix</b> system; some of the ambience can still be heard when the CD versions are played with an amplifier with Dolby decoding and four speakers. One of these was the first album made by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, led by Robert Shaw, a 2-LP set entitled Nativity.|$|R
50|$|<b>Matrix</b> <b>quadraphonic</b> {{systems are}} where four {{channels}} are converted (encoded) {{down to two}} channels. These two <b>matrixed</b> channels are <b>recorded</b> on to tape or vinyl record. Reproduction occurs Via a two-channel transmission medium in most cases a vinyl record, these are decoded back to four channels and reproduced via four loud speakers.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{virtually}} all films are released in stereophonic sound as the Westrex Stereo Variable-Area system developed in 1977 for Star Wars {{is no more}} expensive to manufacture than mono. The format employs the same Western Electric/Westrex/Nuoptix RA-1231 recorder, and coupled with QS <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>matrixing</b> technology licensed to Dolby Labs from Sansui, this SVA system can produce the same Left, Center, Right and Surround sound of the original CinemaScope system of 1953 by using a single standard-width optical track. This important development finally brought stereo sound to so-called Flat (Non-Wide-Screen) films presented at the most common aspect ratio of 1.85:1 although a number of `flat' films are photographed and presented {{at a ratio of}} 1.66:1, common in Europe or 1.75:1 common in museums.|$|R

5000|$|In April 1970 RCA {{announced}} the first quadraphonic 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges ("Quad-8", later called just Q8). RCA then began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by Japan Victor Corporation (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA's trade name became [...] "Quadradisc". The CD-4 format required a special cartridge {{that had a}} ±1 db frequency response out to 50 kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded {{the difference between the}} front and rear channels from a 30 kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4-4-4 quadraphonic systems. Columbia introduced a <b>quadraphonic</b> <b>matrix</b> system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4-2-4 matrix system. The Warner Music Group labels also adopted the Quadradisc format, but RCA and Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording within a few years; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for Dolby encoding (same as Peter Scheiber's original matrix system) and released on CD. This included Charles Gerhardt's series of albums devoted to classic film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, and others, performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra in London's Kingsway Hall.|$|R
