5|$|Fireforce was {{a variant}} on the {{vertical}} envelopment tactic in which ground {{troops would be}} carried directly to the target by air and dropped. It was designed to react instantly to guerrilla ambushes, farm attacks and sightings, and could also be called upon {{by members of the}} security forces as reinforcements. Preparatory deployment was very flexible: all that was required for a base was an airstrip. There would usually be three main Fireforces in operation at each time, each of which would be handled by a company-sized body of men, usually one of the RLI Commandos or a company of the Rhodesian African Rifles. The unit in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> posted at a forward airfield for six weeks (though sometimes for longer) and given responsibility for thousands of square kilometres of Rhodesian countryside. The Selous Scouts' hidden forward observation posts (OPs) allowed for instant reactions by Fireforce to sightings of the enemy guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E

A person who does not hold a certificate of suitability may not be admitted to an institution of higher learning as a student. A {{person who has been}} refused a certificate may appeal to the Home Affairs Minister, whose decision on the matter is final and cannot be called into question in any court.|$|E

500|$|However, what is of {{significance}} {{is that his}} Lordship did not expressly reject the effectiveness of such ouster clauses where the decision is valid. He recognized that [...] "ndoubtedly such a provision protects every determination {{which is not a}} nullity". Peter Cane has written that Lord Reid thus affirmed that [...] "the ouster clause in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> effective to prevent the award of a judicial review remedy only if the error of law was within jurisdiction". However, it appears that Anisminic had defined the concept of jurisdictional error of law so broadly that it had made redundant the old divide between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors and had [...] "led {{to the use of the}} word 'jurisdictional' in a wide sense to cover all errors of law which entailed illegality". The judgment thus had the effect of reducing the effect of statutory ouster clauses and expanding the limits of judicial review.|$|E
500|$|On 23 December 2011, the Croatian Parliament made a {{preliminary}} decision on EU membership {{and determined that}} the EU accession referendum would be held on 22 January 2012. Furthermore, no other referendum <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> presented at that time. The preliminary accession decision was supported by 129 MPs, with the 6 Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja (HDSSB) MPs abstaining. During the debate that preceded the vote, the HDSSB MPs requested that the EU accession referendum be postponed for {{three to six months}} in order to allow a broader discussion on EU accession. Their specific concern was that Croatia might lose elements of its statehood and sovereignty, and the postponement was requested to present to the voters the effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on Croatia before the referendum was held. The parliamentary decision to hold the referendum on 22 January 2012 was supported by 124 MPs, with 6 HDSSB MPs and 6 Croatian Labourists – Labour Party MPs voting against the decision. The Labour party advocated postponing the referendum until 12 February in order to give more time to provide information on the consequences of EU membership. The referendum question was announced by the newly elected Prime Minister designate Zoran Milanović as [...] "simple and bare": [...] "Are you for the membership of the Republic of Croatia in the European Union?" [...] The 2012 Croatian EU accession referendum was the first referendum held in Croatia since the Croatian independence referendum in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|The words, [...] "Lift a Stone" [...] {{are used}} instead to {{substitute}} capability.

[...] If God is capable of being incapable, it means that He is incapable, because He {{has the potential to}} {{not be able to do}} something. Conversely, if God is incapable of being incapable, then the two inabilities cancel each other out, making God have the capability to do something.|$|E
2500|$|The Edinburgh Agreement {{stated that}} {{the wording of the}} <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> decided by the Scottish Parliament and {{reviewed}} for intelligibility by the Electoral Commission.

[...] The Electoral Commission tested the proposed question along with three other possible versions.

2500|$|In 1948, Congress {{enacted the}} Act of June 25, 1948 (the [...] "1948 Act") which codified {{existing}} federal habeas corpus statutes and judicial habeas practice at 28 U.S.C. sections 2241 to 2255. [...] The 1948 Act provided only those individuals in-custody (as {{a result of}} a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus. Thus, for those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in-custody, it was undetermined whether the act eliminated any review of their convictions or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

2500|$|Lifting covers up the {{definition}} of translation, which means moving something from one point in space to another. With this in mind, the real <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> [...] "Can God move a rock from one location in space to another that is larger than possible?" [...] For the rock to be unable {{to move from one}} space to another, {{it would have to be}} larger than space itself. However, it is impossible for a rock to be larger than space, as space always adjusts itself to cover the space of the rock. If the supposed rock was out of space-time dimension, then the question would not make sense—because it would be impossible to move an object from one location in space to another if there is no space to begin with, meaning the faulting is with the logic of the question and not God's capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, 67 {{claims for}} {{compensation}} were lodged against Cunard, which were all heard together in 1918. Judge Julius Mayer, who {{was chosen to}} hear the case, had previously presided over the case brought following {{the loss of the}} Titanic, where he had ruled in favour of the shipping company. Mayer was a conservative who was considered a safe pair of hands with matters of national interest, and whose favourite remark to lawyers was to [...] "come to the point". The case was to be heard without a jury. The two sides agreed beforehand that no <b>question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> raised regarding whether Lusitania had been armed or carrying troops or ammunition. Thirty-three witnesses who could not travel to the US gave statements in England to Commissioner R. V. Wynne. Evidence produced in open court for the Mersey investigation was considered, but evidence from the British closed sessions was not. The Defence of the Realm Act was invoked so that British witnesses could not give evidence on any subject it covered. Statements had been collected in Queenstown immediately after the sinking by the American Consul, Wesley Frost, but these were not produced.|$|E

Carp's newspaper pro-Bessarabian and anti-Russian gazette Moldova, which stood by the belief that [...] "Germany is invincible". Nour also expanded on his wartime vision in the Germanophile daily Seara. In 1915, he stated the need for Romania to join the Central Powers' effort of liberating Bessarabia, Ukraine and Poland from Russia, prophesied that Austria-Hungary would inevitably collapse, and depicted future Romania as both a Black Sea and Danubian power. With time, the Bessarabian journalist claimed, the Straits <b>Question</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> solved, Romanian rule over Odessa and Constanța would create commercial prosperity, and Romania, a great power, would be entitled to a share of the British, French or Belgian colonial empires. Another of his Seara articles, published in April 1916, argued that German victory in the Battle of Verdun was a matter of days or weeks, after which Europe would be dominated by an [...] "industrious, healthy and conscious, 70 million-strong" [...] German people. Reviewing Nour's project some 90 years later, historian Lucian Boia assessed: [...] "One finds in Nour the drama of the Bessarabian who assesses all things, often in a purely imaginary pitch, around his own ideal of national emancipation." ...|$|E
