5000|$|The [...] "Jean Louis" [...] fencing style {{which was}} passed down was quite {{different}} to modern styles, with a central on guard position. As a result, fencers would develop a universal circular <b>quarte</b> parry, keeping the point on target followed by a quick direct riposte. This simple strategy mixed with excellent footwork meant that a beginner fencer {{was a very difficult}} opponent.|$|E
50|$|Moncey was {{not expecting}} the Spanish {{to put up}} a serious fight at Valencia. On 28 June he ordered two brigades to attack the city, one against the gate of San José and one against the gate of <b>Quarte.</b> Both attacks failed, {{although}} the French did reach the front of the barricades. Moncey then attempted to use his field artillery to bombard the Spanish defences, but his guns were soon silenced by the Spanish guns within the city.|$|E

Leaving his party under cover he went forward alone, swam across the river, and, having cut the [...] "leads" [...] from the charges, returned the same way, {{despite the fact that}} the bridge and all approaches thereto were swept by enemy shells and machine-gun fire at close range.

50|$|In the 20th century, harmony {{explicitly}} {{built on}} fourths and fifths became important. This {{became known as}} quartal harmony for chords based on fourths and quintal harmony for chords based on fifths.In the music of composers of early 20th century France, fourth chords became consolidated with Ninth chords, the Whole tone scale, the Pentatonic scale, and polytonality {{as part of their}} language, and quartal harmony became an important means of expression in music by Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and others. Examples are found in Debussy's orchestral work La Mer (The Sea) and in his piano works, in particular La cathédrale engloutie (The Sunken Cathedral) from his Préludes for piano, Pour les <b>quartes</b> (For Fourths) and Pour les arpéges composées (For Composite Arpeggios) from his Etudes.|$|R
5000|$|The nine {{classical}} parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry {{that most}} fencers learn is <b>quarte,</b> known commonly as [...] "parry four". Parries are {{named for the}} line that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line. Offensive bladework consists of the various means of scoring a touch on an opponent. The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target. As it is easily defended against, fencers often use numerous feints to deceive their opponent into parrying and then disengage around the blade. As a preparation for an attack, fencers may execute a prise de fer, or attack on the blade. This includes the simple beat, a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex bind, in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line.|$|E
5000|$|In 1672 Leibniz met the {{mathematician}} Huygens who convinced Leibniz {{to dedicate}} significant {{time to the}} study of mathematics. By 1673 he had progressed to reading Pascal’s Traité des Sinus du <b>Quarte</b> Cercle and it was during his largely autodidactic research that Leibniz said [...] "a light turned on" [...] Like Newton, Leibniz, saw the tangent as a ratio but declared it as simply the ratio between ordinates and abscissas. He continued this reasoning to argue that the integral was in fact the sum of the ordinates for infinitesimal intervals in the abscissa; in effect, the sum of an infinite number of rectangles. From these definitions the inverse relationship or differential became clear and Leibniz quickly realized the potential to form a whole new system of mathematics. Where Newton {{over the course of his}} career used several approaches in addition to an approach using infinitesimals, Leibniz made this the cornerstone of his notation and calculus.|$|E
5000|$|The bind {{takes the}} opponent's blade from any line diagonally to the {{opposing}} line. The action {{can be done}} from high to low line or vice versa. For example, from sixth, the opponent's blade is taken to seventh, or from eighth, the blade is taken to fourth. The bind {{is also known as}} a Transport or a Transport and Glide. As with all other prise de fer actions, there are numerous fencing doctrines. Luigi Barbasetti teaches that the bind is only done from prime, seconde, tierce, <b>quarte,</b> and quinte. C-L. de Beaumont teaches that the bind is done by [...] "making a half-circular movement with the blades continually in contact, carrying the opponent's blade diagonally from a high to a low line {{on the opposite side of}} the target or vice versa. The attack is then made by extending the arm and lunging, while holding the opponent's blade." [...] Julio Martinez Castello recommends that the bind be followed by a glide, but any attack is possible. To complete the bind from low line, first the forearm and blade are raised with the blade slightly off line. Once the blade is sufficiently raised to high line, the arm and blade are carried across to the new line until in position. Also see liement and flanconade below.|$|E

40|$|Considering the {{hypothesis}} that intervals of fourths work in Debussy's Étude pour les <b>Quartes</b> as an every-level structuring cell, this article proposes a harmonic analysis where all chords are drawn from a twelve-tone quartal space. The hypothesis is that Debussy tests {{the capacity of the}} quartal matrix to supersede conventional triadic harmony. On another hand, because of this novel networking, the high-level formal articulation demands complementary resources to be more effective, especially concerning perception. For this reason, in a second phase, an analysis of secondary dimensions, such as density and relative range, is attempted to highlight their function. The conclusion points to "unsolved" interactions between the lower- level harmonic system, which recycles some aspects of the tonal rhetoric, although in an experimental quartal space, and a surface that avoids sensation of both continuity and causality...|$|R
25|$|When {{the camp}} was ready, {{trenches}} began to be dug, both from the horn of Blerick and from three other locations. At the same time were made the approaches and at each <b>quartes</b> was built a battery of five cannons that began to beat the town incessantly. At first the garrison of Venlo and the burghers responded to this fire with their artillery, but when the Spanish advanced in their approaches and {{set fire to the}} town with their shells, the burghers rebelled against Van Brederode and went to City Hall to demand to the magistrates that sued the governor for a cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, the women climbed the walls and begged for mercy to the Spanish. Van Brederode decided then to send a drummer called Corneille Poorter to negotiate the surrender with the Cardinal-Infante.|$|R
