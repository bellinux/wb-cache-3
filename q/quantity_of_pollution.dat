50|$|Ideally, a {{sustainable}} city creates an enduring {{way of life}} across the four domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture. However, minimally {{a sustainable}} city should firstly be able to feed itself with a sustainable reliance on the surrounding countryside. Secondly, it {{should be able to}} power itself with renewable sources of energy. The crux of this is to create the smallest possible ecological footprint, and to produce the lowest <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> possible, to efficiently use land; compost used materials, recycle it or convert waste-to-energy, and thus the city's overall contribution to climate change will be minimal, if such practices are adhered to.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent {{tendency}} to extol tradeable or marketable pollution permits or similar permits to use or exploit some natural resources, such as fish. They are often seen as a very effective way of maintaining environmental conditions in a desired way. However, considerable care is required in adopting such systems. If they are inappropriately designed, the government will lose its flexibility to control {{the state of the}} environment. Permits which give their owners absolute rights to emit certain <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> in perpetuity or entitle holders to use or appropriate a particular <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> a natural resource in perpetuity can cause particular problems for government. They can for example, involve expensive buy-back schemes. There are, however, ways around the problem. Furthermore, holders or rights may have to pay fees to cover enforcement costs. Where tradeable permits have a very long-life, the question arises of how they should be allocated and whether those allocated these rights should be allowed to capture the rents. As discussed, changing ambient conditions may have to be allowed for in designing systems involving tradeable permits...|$|R
50|$|In an {{emissions}} trading system, the government sets an overall limit on emissions, and defines permits (also called allowances), or limited authorizations to emit, {{up to the}} level of the overall limit. The government may sell the permits, but in many existing schemes, it gives permits to participants (regulated polluters) equal to each participant's baseline emissions. The baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions. To demonstrate compliance, a participant must hold permits at least equal to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> it actually emitted during the time period. If every participant complies, the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits. Because permits can be bought and sold, a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly (by reducing its own emissions); or to emit less than its permits, and perhaps sell the excess permits; or to emit more than its permits, and buy permits from other participants. In effect, the buyer pays a charge for polluting, while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions.|$|E

30|$|Pollution {{abatement}} {{investments are}} {{not statistically significant}} {{for any of the}} types of inefficiency scores that are examined. This result indicates that a large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> abatement investment decreases capital productivity in manufacturing sectors. One of the reasons for this effect may be that legal considerations involving environmental regulations caused many factories to purchase a large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> treatment equipment. However, due to the weakness of regulation implementation in China, these factories only use the abatement equipment during certain specific moments known as a “show”. This practice allows the factories in question to reduce their operational costs of running the equipment. Another reason for the lack of a significant relationship between pollution abatement investments and inefficiency scores may be that our data only reflect the quantity of investments that were devoted to end-of-pipe treatments. Although end-of-pipe treatment equipment directly affects pollution reduction, it does not directly affect the total amount of pollution emissions. This result suggests that environmental regulations and the monitoring of pollutant emissions should be more strictly implemented in China.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing markets for bankable emissions permits. The innovation of this work is to incorporate the effects of uncertainty in downstream market prices {{on the price of}} permits and the price of alternative compliance measures. Air quality regulations allow firms to choose between making investments in abatement equipment and purchasing allowances to release specified <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution.</b> Equilibrium conditions for the industry provide a link between the price of permits (allowances) and the price of alternative abatement measures. This paper shows that under ordinary circumstances, these prices will be such that the cost of compliance by abatement will be higher than the cost of compliance by permits. This result contradicts the conventional static analysis, but does a better job explaining empirical data. The research is motivated by evidence from the US Acid Rain program. The analytical model is developed with this industry in mind, and data from early implementation of the program illustrates an application of the model. The paper also introduces some policy implications, identifying how the results developed here could affect the determination of the optimal number of permits to issue.

Also, effect of two very important factors, soil and water qualities on rice production were considered in relation to rice productivity. Some parameters common to the two factors analyzed included, the pH, Sodium, Iron, Potassium, Copper, Manganese and Zinc while the remaining water and soil properties were investigated using standard procedures.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project was to demonstrate the feasibility of using Total Cost Assessment (TCA) as an effective decision-making tool for evaluating {{the costs and benefits}} <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> prevention investments in the metal finishing industry. TCA is a capital budgeting method that compares all relevant costs and benefits between alternative investments or process changes. Traditional capital budgeting methods compare different capital investment alternatives using only labor and equipment costs and, more recently, environmental costs such as energy use and waste disposal. Under TCA, the scope of these environmental costs is expanded to include more indirect and intangible costs for a more complete view of the potential environmental impacts of any given change. Pollution prevention is the reduction or elimination of waste at the source, or closed-loop recycling that takes place in a facility. In some cases, pollution is reduced not by reducing the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> material used but by substituting a less-toxic and/or non-regulated material for the material previously used.

Applying this notion of stability in the IEA context we assume that, when a country or a sub-coalition contemplate exiting or joining an agreement, it takes into account the reactions of other countries ignited by its own actions. We identify what would be the resulting stable structures and the LCS, examining the indicator of countries’ environmental awareness proposed by the model.
