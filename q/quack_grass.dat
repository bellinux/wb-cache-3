5000|$|Panicum repens is {{a species}} of grass known by many common names, {{including}} torpedograss, creeping panic, panic rampant, couch panicum, wainaku grass, <b>quack</b> <b>grass,</b> dog-tooth grass, and bullet grass. Its exact native range is obscure. Sources suggest that the grass is native to [...] "Africa and/or Asia", [...] "Europe or Australia", [...] "Eurasia", [...] "Australia", [...] "Europe, Asia, and Africa", or other specific regions, including the Mediterranean, Israel, and Argentina. It is present in many places as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. It has been called [...] "one of the world's worst weeds." ...|$|E
5000|$|Most of the forested {{areas in}} Pinckney are on land too steep or deemed {{otherwise}} unsuitable for agriculture. The stands that remain {{are smaller than}} 100 acre and consist of deciduous trees, like white oak, red oak, black oak and hickory. The flatter terrain that was originally used as farmland was allowed to become overgrown with native plants like goldenrod and black-eyed susan, but invasive plants like knapweed, <b>quack</b> <b>grass,</b> timothy-grass, and white sweet clover have also taken hold. Other plants found in Pinckney, like the white lady's-slipper and rosepink, are classified as [...] "threatened" [...] and are protected under Michigan law. Other species found in the park, like English sundew, are classified as [...] "special concern." ...|$|E
50|$|Tan spot {{is found}} {{primarily}} on wheat, {{but is also}} found to infect other cereals and grasses including triticale, barley, and rye, but are less frequently affected.Other grass species effected by the pathogen include Siberian wheat grass, sand bluestem, meadow brome, sheep fescue, June grass, little bluestem, green foxtail, needle and thread, and tall wheatgrass.While these are not necessarily agriculture crop hosts such as wheat, the pathogen is able to form and survive on many grass hosts, which can eventually venture into wheat fields. Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as <b>quack</b> <b>grass</b> that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|E
40|$|The <b>quack</b> {{and wheat}} <b>grasses</b> of Iowa, eastern North America, and the Rocky Mountains are important, {{not only as}} weeds, but as forage plants. One of the most {{valuable}} of these is the western wheat grass, ranging from the eastern slopes of the Rockies into western Iowa. Besides this species there are several others more or less common in the western and northwestern portion in the state. Some of these are considered valuable as forage plants, yet during the past season many complaints have been made of the abundance and weedy nature of the <b>quack</b> <b>grasses</b> in North America. It seems wise, therefore, to consider the <b>quack</b> and wheat <b>grasses</b> not only as weeds, but also from the standpoint of their value as forage plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{strain of}} Ascochyta agropyrina var. nana was {{isolated}} from Elytrigia repens (<b>quack</b> <b>grass),</b> a noxious perennial weed widespread through the cold {{regions of the}} northen and southern hemispheres. Papyracillic acid was isolated {{for the first time}} from the fungal solid culture and identified using spectroscopic methods, including X-ray diffractometric and CD analysis for the assignment of the relative and absolute stereochemistries. Some key derivatives were prepared and used in a structure−activity relationship study. Tested by leaf disk-puncture assay, papyracillic acid at the concentration of 1 mg/mL was shown to be phytotoxic both for the host plant and a number of nonhost plants of the fungus. Papyracillic acid was active against bacteria (Xanthomonas campestris and Bacillus subtilis) and the fungus Candida tropicalis at 6 μg/disk. Derivatives of papyracillic acid were significantly less active than original toxin. However, the monoacetyl derivative of the toxin did not possess antimicrobial activity but remained highly phytotoxic to <b>quack</b> <b>grass.</b> Hence, papyracillic acid and its analogues have potential as nonselective herbicides of natural origin. Some structure−activity relationship observations for papyracillic acid and its derivatives were also made...|$|E
40|$|Greatly {{increased}} interest {{has been shown}} recently thruout Iowa in the recognition of weeds which are injurious to the farmer. The county weed demonstrations put on by the extension service of Iowa State College have been very helpful in extending {{the knowledge of the}} weeds of the state. It ls very important that new serious weeds be recognized promptly, and timely measures employed to prevent them from becoming a menace to agriculture. Thirty years ago the extermination of <b>quack</b> <b>grass</b> in the state might have been accomplished at the cost of {{a quarter of a million}} dollars; today, however, several millions of dollars would not be sufficient to remove the weed...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} weeds {{continues}} to interest the farmers of the state, as much, perhaps, as any problem {{connected with the}} farm. An abundance of weeds in a crop seriously interferes with production, not only by shading and crowding the agricultural crop, but by removing useful and necessary constituents from the soil. We receive annually many inquiries from farmers who desire information about the character of weeds, and the best methods of dealing with them. The results of some experiments conducted by the Botanical Section to determine the value of several means of weed extermination are presented in this bulletin. W e are indebted to Professor J. B. Davidson for the chapter on spraying machinery. W e are also indebted to, Mr. Lyle Clapper, who had charge of the <b>quack</b> <b>grass</b> experiments on a farm near Ames and who assisted in the experiment of burying seeds in compost...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of bulletins 88 and 99 {{on the subject of}} seed investigation, the Botanical Section has continued a study of the seeds offered for sale to the farmers of Iowa. Bulletin 88 contains the studies for 1906, bulletin 99 the studies for 1907, and the present publication contains the results of our work for 1908 and 1909. Since the operation of the Iowa law it has been our experience that the quality of the seed sold to the farmers is much better than formerly. Hundreds of samples sent to us by the farmers of this state for analysis indicate that they desire to protect themselves from the introduction of noxious weeds, especially dodder, <b>quack</b> <b>grass,</b> buckhorn, dock, and Canada thistle. The farmers have also learned that it is far better to buy a better quality of seed, seed that does not contain these noxious weeds, than that containing a goodly number of weed seeds that would prove harmful to agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Elytrigia repens L. Desv. ex Nevski (commonly {{known as}} <b>quack</b> <b>grass),</b> is a {{perennial}} weed widespread through the cold temperate regions {{all over the}} world. It is managed only by chemical herbicides 1, 2 because it easily spreads by seed and rhizomes and produces allelopathic metabolites suppressing the growth of other plants. In surveys carried out with the aim to find pathogens of this species, which could have potential as biological agents for its control, a fungus was isolated from naturally diseased leaves of this species and identified as Ascochyta agropyrina (Fairman) Trotter var. nana Punith. Due to {{the interest of the}} authors in studying species belonging to the genus Ascochyta as sources of biologically active metabolites, a previous study led to the isolation of a main phytotoxin from the solid culture of this fungus and to its identification as papyracillic acid. 3 On liquid medium A. agropyrina produces different toxins the main one of which, named agropyrenol, was characterized as a new disubstituted benzaldehyde {{on the basis of its}} chemical and spectroscopic properties. Other two new minor metabolites were isolated from the same culture and named agropyrenal and agropyrenone, respectively. They were characterized as a trisubstituted naphthalene carbaldehyde and a pentasubstituted 3 H-benzofuranone, respectively. When assayed on leaves of some weedy plants, i. e. Mercurialis annua, Chenopodium album and Setaria viridis, agropyrenol proved to be phytotoxic, causing the appearance of necrotic lesions, agropyrenal was less active, while agropyrenone was inactive. None of compounds showed antibiotic, fungicidal or zootoxic activity. In this communication the production, isolation, and chemical and biological characterization of the metabolites produced by A. agropyrina var. nana in liquid culture will be illustrated and their potential as safe herbicides will be discussed...|$|E
