40|$|Brazilian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> which {{currently}} account for 30 % {{of the national}} production of fine wines, have been traditionally produced in the southern region since the 1910 s. The objective {{of the present study}} was to establish <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> typicality via aroma characterization by comparing quantitative and descriptive techniques for the main <b>aromatic</b> compounds. <b>Sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> from the major producing regions of Brazil were tested by two sensory panels, followed by gas chromatography analysis that allowed elucidation of their aromatic basis. Solid-phase microextraction was used for the extraction of the compounds, followed by detection using gas chromatography (GC), olfactometry and mass spectrometry (MS). Olfactometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified 25 aromatic areas and 26 aromatic compounds, respectively. Fruity and floral aromas were highlighted by olfactometry. Most often, Brazilian and Italian sensory analysis panels cited pineapple and roasted or apple and fruit individual descriptors, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The foaming {{properties}} in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> are {{an indicator of}} quality {{as it is the}} first quality perception consumers have upon opening a bottle of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> Proteins, which are derived from both grapes and yeast during <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production, are known to impact the foaming {{properties in}} finished <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> The objectives of this project were to (1) understand the role and relationship that proteins have on the overall foaming properties and overall quality in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> (2) determine the role different yeast and grape clones from different varietals have on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality and (3) understand how bentonite affects <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality. The protein concentration in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> produced from Mariafeld Pinot noir appeared to impact the foaming properties. The longest elapsed time for foam dissipation was observed in the control treatment where bentonite was not used to strip protein and the shortest time was observed in the treatment where bentonite was used to remove grape and yeast proteins. In Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> the largest protein concentrations were observed in non-bentonite treated juices while the lowest were observed in the bentonite treatments. The prevalence of foam observed in both bentonite treatments, where grape proteins were completely removed, indicated that proteins derived over the course of secondary fermentation were foam forming in Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> It was also observed that different yeast, varietals, clones and soil compositions may impact the protein concentrations, chemical compositions and overall quality of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> The results of this research aim to better understand <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality to optimize production in the Niagara Peninsula...|$|R

25|$|<b>Sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> {{produced}} in the United States {{can be made in}} both the méthode champenoise and the charmat method. Lower cost <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> such as André, Cook's, and Tott's, often employ the latter method with more premium <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> utilizing the former. The history of producing quality <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> in California {{can be traced to the}} Russian River Valley of Sonoma County where, in 1892, the Korbel brothers (emigrated from Bohemia in 1852) began producing <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> according to the méthode champenoise. The first wines produced were made from Riesling, Muscatel, Traminer and Chasselas grapes. Partly aided by the foreign influence, the overall quality of Californian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> increased with the introduction of the more traditional <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> grapes of Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc into the production. US AVA requirements and wine laws do not regulate the sugar levels and sweetness of wine though most producers tend to follow European standards with Brut wine having less than 1.5% sugar up to Doux having more than 5%. As the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> industry in California grew, foreign investments from some of the Champagne region's most noted Champagne houses came to set up wineries in the area.

Brazil is a promising country for the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> market. From 1986 – 2015, there was an increase of 465. 6 % in the sales of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> in the Brazilian domestic market, especially the last ten, which accounted for an increase of 215. 7 %. In 1998, Brazilian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> accounted for 70. 5 % of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> sold in Brazil. Today, they represent 82. 1 %of national market, and proved to be one of the most prestigious products from Brazilian viticulture when compared, for example, to non-sparkling wines, which 79 % are imported wines. Of the imported <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> consumed in Brazil, six countries account for 98. 5 % of the market (France: 32. 7 %; Italy: 24. 8 % and Spain: 21. 9 %). The volume exportation of Brazilian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> has grown significantly in recent years (4, 210. 2 %), with Paraguay, China, Uruguay, the United States, France and the United Kingdom being the major buyers.
