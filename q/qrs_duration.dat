50|$|About {{one third}} of people with LVEF below 35% have {{markedly}} altered conduction to the ventricles, resulting in dyssynchronous depolarization of {{the right and left}} ventricles. This is especially problematic in people with left bundle branch block (blockage of one of the two primary conducting fiber bundles that originate {{at the base of the}} heart and carries depolarizing impulses to the left ventricle). Using a special pacing algorithm, biventricular cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can initiate a normal sequence of ventricular depolarization. In people with LVEF below 35% and prolonged <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> on ECG (LBBB or QRS of 150 ms or more) there is an improvement in symptoms and mortality when CRT is added to standard medical therapy.

50|$|Genetic {{variations}} in SCN5A, i.e. {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) have been described in both coding and non-coding regions of the gene. These variations are typically present at relatively high frequencies within the general population. Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have used this type of common genetic variation to identify genetic loci associated with variability in phenotypic traits. In the cardiovascular field this powerful technique {{has been used to}} detect loci involved in variation in electrocardiographic parameters (i.e. PR-, QRS- and QTc-interval duration) in the general population. The rationale behind this technique is that common genetic variation present in the general population can influence cardiac conduction in non-diseased individuals. these studies consistently identified the SCN5A-SCN10A genomic region on chromosome 3 to be associated with variation in QTc-interval, <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and PR-interval. These results indicate that genetic variation at the SCN5A locus is not only involved in disease genetics but also plays a role in the variation in cardiac function between individuals in the general population.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, {{the only}} other {{available}} device-based treatment was the left ventricular assist device (LVAD). LVAD therapy is indicated in patients with severe illness and is associated with several hours of surgery (involving a cardiopulmonary bypass). It is usually considered as a therapy providing a “bridge to transplant” for heart failure patients classified as NYHA class IV, and is intended to support heart function until a heart transplant is received.Current research {{results suggest that the}} therapeutic gap described above could now be closed by CCM therapy. Additionally, a long-term study on CCM showed that the therapy was able to stop the common and prognostically unfavorable long-term prolongation of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in heart failure patients. This result was interpreted as signaling the safety of the treatment and as an indicator that patients could benefit from CCM therapy in the long term. If the QRS-stabilizing effect were to be confirmed in further studies, CCM would become the first device-based treatment for heart failure with the potential to halt QRS prolongation, a factor associated with a poor prognosis.|$|E

40|$|Electrocardiogram (ECG) derived <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. However, little is known about risk factors associated with increased <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in rural populations. In a systematic review we demonstrate inconsistencies in identifying <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> cut-off’s to predict increased cardiac hypertrophy. The aims of this thesis are to investigate homocysteine, UCP 2 genetics and blood pressure associations with <b>QRS</b> <b>duration,</b> and secondly to explain <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> heterogeneity in Australian aging rural populations. Methodology: Epidemiological models are presented using a retrospective rural data base containing ECG, blood pressure, heart rate variability (HRV) data. Whole blood DNA was used for UCP 2 I/D genotyping. Statistical models reference a cross-sectional study design. Results and Discussion: In Chapter 2 increased homocysteine levels are associated with increased <b>QRS</b> <b>duration.</b> Specifically a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> > 120 msec is associated with an increased mean homocysteine level (p =  0. 016). In Chapter 3 we explored central aortic systolic pressure (CASP) and <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> interactions. An arbitrary CASP value > 140 mmHg raises suspicion of a prolonged <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (e. g. > 120 msec). QRS durations ≥ 100 msec are associated with higher CASP levels. Our results suggest in Australian rural populations CASP is likely to be elevated, possibly due to age related aortic stiffening. In Chapter 4 the interactions between HRV and SBP and <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> are explored. We demonstrate that <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> is not associated with HRV. On the other hand increases in <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> are associated with increasing SBP. In Chapter 5 associations between mitochondrial genetics and cardiac conduction are described. We note no studies have explored mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 gene (UCP 2) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms on cardiac conduction. We demonstrated an association between <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> > 140 msec and UCP 2 DD genotypes. The lack of association with ECG parameters QTd and UCP 2 DD suggests that gene-related <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> prolongation is independent of cardiac hypertrophy. In summary we have been able to understand complex interactions between cardiovascular risk factors and <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in this thesis. We also appreciate that increased <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> is associated with genetic risk factors in an Australian rural population...|$|E

40|$|Methods: The study {{population}} of healthy adult volunteers {{was divided into}} a sample for development of a prediction model (n = 63) and a testing sample (n = 30). Magnetic resonance imaging data {{were used to assess}} anatomical characteristics of the left ventricle: the angle between papillary muscles (PMA), the length of the left ventricle (LVL) and left ventricular mass (LVM). Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was used for measurement of the <b>QRS</b> <b>duration.</b> Multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop a prediction model to estimate the <b>QRS</b> <b>duration.</b> The accuracy of the prediction model was assessed by comparing predicted with measured <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in the test set. Results: The angle between PMA and the length of the LVL were statistically significant predictors of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration.</b> Correlation between <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and PMA and LVL was r = 0. 57, P = 0. 0001 and r = 0. 45, P = 0. 0002, respectively.

40|$|Background: Has been {{reported}} that patients exhibiting prolonged paced <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> {{tend to have more}} serious heart disease, and the paced <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> can be an effective indicator of impaired left ventricular function. However, the acute and chronic hemodynamic effects of paced <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and pacing sites during right ventricular (RV) pacing remain unknown. Methods: A total of 14 patients who underwent electrophysiologic study for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia were examined. RV pacing was performed at 10 different sites with cycle lengths of 600 ms and 500 ms utilizing a 6 - 7 F deflectable quadripolar electrode catheter. Systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressures during pacing were measured once the blood pressure was stabilized. Results: During RV pacing, blood pressures (systolic/diastolic/mean) decreased. The change of post-pacing <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and pre-pacing the systolic blood pressure (SBP) were greater in the group with paced <b>QRS</b> <b>duration.</b> The differences overall were greater than 140 ms.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze whether <b>QRS</b> <b>duration,</b> before and after {{pulmonary}} valve replacement (PVR), is related to long-term outcome in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). BackgroundKey factors that determine outcome after PVR in adult TOF patients are largely unknown. Recognition of such factors assists the identification of patients at increased risk of adverse events. MethodsAdults who previously underwent total correction for TOF (n = 90; age 31. 4 ± 10. 3 years) and required PVR for pulmonary regurgitation were included. The <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> was measured pre-operatively and 6 months after PVR. The post-operative changes in <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> were calculated. Adverse events (death, re-PVR, ventricular tachycardia, and symptomatic heart failure) were noted during follow-up. ResultsDuring 5. 5 ± 3. 5 years of follow-up, 13 adverse events occurred. The 5 -year event-free survival rate was 76 % for patients with a pre-operative <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> > 180 ms and 90 % in patients with a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> ≤ 180 ms (p = 0. 037). For patients with a post-operative <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> > 180 ms, 5 -year event-free survival was 71 %, whereas it was 91 % for patients with a post-operative <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> ≤ 180 ms (p = 0. 004). After multivariate correction, a post-operative <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> > 180 ms (hazard ratio: 3. 685, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 104 to 12. 304, p < 0. 05) and the absence of a reduction in <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> post-PVR (hazard ratio: 6. 767, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 704 to 26. 878, p < 0. 01), was significantly associated with adverse outcome.

BackgroundIncreased electrocardiographic <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (≥ 120 ms) is a marker of ventricular dyssynchrony. MethodsWe evaluated the relations of maximal electrocardiographic <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> to echocardiographic LV dimensions in 4, 534 Framingham Heart study participants (mean age 54 years, 57 % women) without prior HF or MI. <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> was analyzed as a continuous variable and as categories (< 100, 100 to 119, and ≥ 120 ms). ResultsIn linear regression models, LV mass, end-diastolic dimension, and septal and posterior wall thicknesses were positively related to log-QRS duration, whereas fractional shortening (FS) was inversely related (p < 0. 001). There was a significant trend for increasing LV mass and dimensions, and decreasing FS across categories of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Introduction: It {{has become}} clear that the onset of heart failure is closely linked to right apex pacing, which lengthens the <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and evokes discoordinate {{contraction}} of the left ventricle (LV). Currently, {{it is thought that}} the site inducing the shortest <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> is optimal for pacing. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain the pacing site inducing the shortest <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and to examine the configuration of the 12 -lead electrocardiogram and heart function while pacing at this site. Methods: Nine patients with normal heart function were enrolled.

Results: <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> became shorter with MS pacing and the pacing lead situated at the periphery of the coronary sinus and turned in a posterior direction. The configuration of the 12 -lead electrocardiogram showed an Rs or rS pattern with II, III, and aVF leads. Output and LV dp/dt showed a tendency to increase with MS pacing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> {{is known}} to be a {{predictor}} of mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic power of computer-measured <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in a general medical population. METHODS: Analyses were performed on the first electrocardiogram digitally recorded on 46, 933 consecutive patients at the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Medical Center between 1987 and 2000. Patients with electrocardiograms exhibiting Wolff-Parkinson-White were excluded (n � 44), and those with bundle branch block or electronic pacing were considered separately, leaving 44, 280 patients for analysis (mean age 56 � 15 years; 90 % were males). There were 3659 (8. 3 %) cardiovascular deaths (mean follow-up of 6. 0 � 3. 8 years). RESULTS: A survival plot showed significant separation according to a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> score. After adjustment in the Cox model for age, gender, and heart rate, the <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> score was a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. For every 10 -ms increase in <b>QRS</b> <b>duration,</b> there was an 18 % increase in cardiovascular risk. The results were similar in patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram, a bundle branch block, and a paced rhythm.

Conclusions Severe QRS prolongation, before or after PVR, and the absence of a reduction in <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> after PVR, are major determinants of adverse outcome during long-term follow-up of patients with TOF.

40|$|Background- Prolongation of {{ventricular}} depolarization time (<b>QRS</b> <b>duration),</b> {{particularly in}} left bundle branch block (LBBB), is {{commonly associated with}} many cardiac diseases. We posit that the <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and degree of left-axis deviation (LAD) identify significant left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with LBBB. Methods- In this prospective study, 150 patients with diagnosis of LBBB {{were divided into two}} groups (QRS≥ 160 and QRS 0. 05). The EF of patients with LAD (n= 64) and without LAD (n= 86) was 48. 64 ± 14. 63 % and 52. 10 ± 13. 98 %, respectively (p= 0. 143). The mean±SD EF (54. 5 ± 10. 54 %) of the patients with a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> of ≥ 160 milliseconds (n= 19) was significantly more than the mean ± SD EF (23. 89 ± 5. 46 %) of the patients with a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> of < 160 milliseconds (n= 131, p< 0. 001). The <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> also had a significant (p< 0. 001) inverse correlation with EF (R = 0. 926, adjusted R 2 = 0. 857, SE of estimate = 5. 42). However, the QRS axis was not significantly correlated with EF and did not have added predictive values. Conclusion- The <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> has a significant inverse relationship with EF. Furthermore, the prolongation of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (≥ 160 milliseconds) in the presence of LBBB is a marker of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The presence of LAD in LBBB does not signify a further decrease in EF (Iranian Heart Journal 2006; 7 (4) : 17 - 25) ...|$|E
40|$|Prolongation of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in V 2 of 110 msec or more {{seems to}} be a {{specific}} diagnostic parameter in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) with a sensitivity of 75 %. In orderto define a more common criterium with higher sensitivity <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> in a best available limb lead and in all precordial leads were analysed in 41 pts. with ARVD fulfilling major and minor diagnostic criteria and in 24 pts. with idiopathic right ventricular arrhythmia. Localised right precordial prolongation of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> could be achieved in 38 pts (93 %) with a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> ratio in V 2 /N 4 and a ratio of the sum of right (Vl- 3) and left precordial (V 4 - 6) <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> of > 1. 1; on the contrary, in all pts. with idiopathic right ventricular arrhythmia these ratios were V 3 in 18 pts (47 %) in ARVD and in V 4 –V 6 in 3 pts with idiopathic right ventricular arrhythmia. ConclusionsLocalised right precordial ORS prolongation is the ECG criterium of highest sensitivity (93 %) and outstanding specifity (1 00 %) in ARVD in a definition using <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> ratios of right and left precordial leads. With this criterium which cannot be found in idiopathic right ventricular arrhythmia conventional ECG contributes significantly in the clinical definition of ARVD...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThis {{prospective}} study tested whether Doppler echocardiographic variables add incremental value to <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> {{in determining the}} {{prognosis of patients with}} chronic heart failure (CHF) and systolic dysfunction. BackgroundDiastolic dysfunction frequently is observed in patients with CHF, but its prognostic impact relative to that of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> is unknown. MethodsA total of 193 patients with CHF and an ejection fraction 144 ms, the outcome was markedly poorer in the presence of RFPs as compared with their absence. Similarly, despite a <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> ≤ 144 ms, the outcome was worse {{in the presence of a}} RFP. A risk-stratification model based on the three strongest independent predictors separated groups into those with good prognosis and those with high, intermediate, and low event-free survival rates.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to validate the hypothesis that the product of QRS voltage and duration, as an approximation of the time-voltage area of the QRS complex, can improve the electrocardiographic (ECG) detection of echocardiographically determined left ventricular hypertrophy and to further assess the relative contribution of <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> to the ECG detection of hypertrophy. Background. The ECG identification of left ventricular hypertrophy has been limited by the poor sensitivity of standard voltage criteria alone. However, increases in left ventricular mass can be more accurately related to increases in the time-voltage area of the QRS complex than to changes in QRS voltage or duration alone. Methods. Standard 12 -lead ECGs and echocardiograms were obtained for 389 patients, including 116 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Simple voltage-duration products were calculated by multiplying Cornell voltage by <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (Cornell product) and the 12 -lead sum of voltage by <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> (12 -lead product). Results. In a stepwise logistic regression model that also induced Cornell voltage, Sokolow-Lyon voltage, age and gender, <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> remained a highly significant predictor of the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (chi-square 26. 9, p 4 (p < 0. 001) and the 33 % sensitivity of the best-fit logistic regression model in this cohort (p < 0. 05 vs. p < 0. 001). Conclusions. <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> is an independent ECG predictor of the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and the simple product of either Cornell voltage or 12 -lead voltage and <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> significantly improves identification of left ventricular hypertrophy relative to other ECG criteria that use <b>QRS</b> <b>duration</b> and voltages in linear combinations...|$|E
