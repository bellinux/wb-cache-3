5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E

25|$|Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi freed Anwar, {{which was}} seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation. At the 2004 election, the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory, {{virtually}} wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory {{was seen as}} the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia’s economy, which has lifted the living standards of most Malaysians to almost first world standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully developed country by 2020 as expressed in Wawasan 2020. It leaves unanswered, however, the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> and how Malaysia will acquire a first world political system (a multi-party democracy, a free press, an independent judiciary and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.|$|E
25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but {{she said that the}} decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the jury would soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E

Therefore, for a lunisolar calendar, every 2 to 3 years {{there is a difference}} of more than a full lunar month between the lunar and solar years, and an extra (embolismic) month needs to be inserted (intercalation). The Athenians initially seem not to have had a regular means of intercalating a 13th month; instead, the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> to add a month was decided by an official.

[...] As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb.|$|E

It would take such a ship about 43 years to reach Alpha Centauri, if it passed through the system. Slowing down to stop at Alpha Centauri could increase the trip to 100 years, whereas a journey without slowing down raises the issue of making sufficiently accurate and useful observations and measurements during a fly-by.|$|E

2500|$|... "The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> Cubism {{began and}} {{who led the}} way in its development", writes art {{historian}} Christopher Green, [...] "is inextricably tied up with the question of what distinguishes Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist". Picasso's landscapes painted at Horta de Hebro in 1909 (executed two years after Les Demoiselles and one year after the [...] "cubes" [...] of Braque's L'Estaque paintings) were considered the first Cubist painting by Gertrude Stein. It is generally recognized, however, that the first Cubist exhibition transpired in 1911. Jean Metzinger, judging from the Burgess interview, appears to have abandoned his Divisionist style in favor of the faceting of form associated with analytic Cubism around 1908 or early 1909. Metzinger frequented the Bateau Lavoir at this time and exhibited with Braque at the Berthe Weill gallery. By 1910, the robust form of early analytic Cubism of Picasso (Girl with a Mandolin, Fanny Tellier, 1910), Braque (Violin and Candlestick, 1910) and Metzinger (Nu à la cheminée (Nude), 1910) had become practically indistinguishable.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is general}} recognition, however, that the editing {{of the book}} {{continued}} well into the Hellenistic era. The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> {{the core of the}} book originated depends in the first place on the dates assigned to Ezra himself (assuming him to have been a historic person).

[...] Unfortunately there were three kings of this name and the text does not specify which one. The traditional date, and currently the most popular candidate, is 458BC, {{based on the assumption that}} the king is Artaxerxes I. A date of 398BC, based on the possibility that the king might be Artaxerxes II, was once popular but has been seriously challenged in recent scholarship.

However, Christians have struggled {{since the days of}} the Church fathers with the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>when</b> the use of force is justified.

Heitman and Hagan identify the Inquisitions, Crusades, wars of religion and antisemitism as being [...] "among the most notorious examples of Christian violence". To this list, J. Denny Weaver adds, [...] "warrior popes, support for capital punishment, corporal punishment under the guise of 'spare the rod and spoil the child', justifications of slavery, world-wide colonialism in the name of conversion to Christianity, the systemic violence of women subjected to men".

The {{answer to}} this question is often simply stated rather than carefully elaborated, even if the current nature and scope of the discipline is far from self-evident.
