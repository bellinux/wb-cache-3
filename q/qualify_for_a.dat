Under Mazzarri, Napoli climbed up the table, finishing in sixth place to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2010–11 UEFA Europa League spot.

5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of Stallings, Mike DuBose was hired as head coach. After failing to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowl game in 1997, DuBose led the Crimson Tide to the inaugural Music City Bowl and Alabama's first BCS bowl berth in the Orange Bowl. After again failing to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowl in 2000, DuBose was fired and Dennis Franchione was hired as head coach. In his first season, Franchione led Alabama to the Independence Bowl. In February 2002, the NCAA found Alabama violated multiple rules, {{and as part of}} its penalty a two-year bowl ban was imposed to include both the 2002 and 2003 seasons. Eligible again to compete in bowl games, Mike Shula led Alabama to the Music City Bowl and a victory in the Cotton Bowl. However, in 2009, Alabama was again found to have violated NCAA rules between 2005 and 2007 and as part of their penalty, the 2006 Cotton Bowl Classic victory was officially vacated. In the week following the 2006 loss to Auburn, Shula was fired and Joe Kines served as interim head coach for the Independence Bowl loss.|$|E

Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also a feeling that, given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E

He decided {{to pursue a career}} in the British Indian Army and applied to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His application was successful and he entered the college in 1910. However he did not graduate sufficiently high in his class to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> posting to the Indian Army and was instead commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army Service Corps in September 1911. His early service was at Woolwich and Aldershot.|$|E

5|$|The 1999–2000 season saw Wallwork make further {{progress}} at Manchester United {{as he made}} seven appearances for the first-team, mostly as a defensive midfielder. Then, in 2000–01, he amassed enough league appearances to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Premier League winner's medal. However, his spell in the United first-team was short-lived, as the signings of centre-back Laurent Blanc and central midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón made Wallwork surplus to requirements. He made his final appearance for United on 26 January 2002, playing 61 minutes of the FA Cup Fourth Round match against Middlesbrough before being replaced by Ryan Giggs. In his seven years at United, Wallwork played just 28 times, and {{in the summer of}} 2002 his contract was not renewed.|$|E

5|$|After Bryant retired, Ray Perkins {{extended}} Alabama's consecutive {{bowl game}} streak to 25 {{years with a}} victory in the 1983 Sun Bowl. However, the streak ended when the 1984 team finished the season with a record of five wins and six losses and failed to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> bowl {{for the first time in}} 26 years. The bowl absence lasted only one season as Perkins led the Crimson Tide to wins in both the Aloha and Sun Bowls before he resigned as head coach following the 1986 season. Bill Curry continued the bowl tradition and led the Crimson Tide to Hall of Fame, Sun and Sugar Bowl appearances in his three seasons as head coach. After Curry, Gene Stallings took Alabama to the Fiesta, Blockbuster, Gator, Citrus and Outback Bowls. Stallings also led the Crimson Tide to victory in the first Bowl Coalition national championship game with a 34–13 victory over Miami in the Sugar Bowl. In August 1995, as part of the penalty imposed by the NCAA for rules violations, Alabama was ruled ineligible to participate in the 1995 bowl season.|$|E

5|$|Dougan {{represented}} Northern Ireland at schoolboy, youth, amateur and 'B' {{level as}} a wing-half and centre-defender. He made his senior international debut under Peter Doherty in 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia during the 1958 FIFA World Cup on 8 June 1958. He had won nine caps before he joined Peterborough in 1962, when the drop to Third Division football left {{him out of}} international contention {{for the next three}} years. Bertie Peacock returned him to the team following his transfer to First Division Leicester City in 1965, and he missed just three of the next 37 internationals. He was named as captain when Terry Neill succeeded Billy Bingham as manager in 1971. He made his final appearance for Northern Ireland on 14 February 1973 in a 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Cyprus. He won a total of 43 senior caps and scored eight goals in a 15-year international career, but despite playing alongside George Best for nine of these years Northern Ireland did not <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major tournament after the 1958 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{defeated}} Spain 3–1, {{but then}} lost 1–0 {{at home to}} Wales. This left Scotland needing to secure at least a point from their final group match, against Wales in Cardiff, to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> play-off against Australia. Stein was not helped {{by the fact that}} a number of his senior players, including Graeme Souness (his captain), Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and Steve Archibald would all miss the game through injury or suspension. Stein was also taking diuretics to manage heart failure at the time but had, in the build-up to the game, decided to stop taking them to try and remained focused and negate any potential side-effects the medication might have. Despite his enthusiasm for the job and for football, the strain on Stein, combined with his poor health, had led to him indicating that he would step down after the World Cup Finals in Mexico. Scotland drew 1–1 thanks to a late penalty kick by Davie Cooper, but Stein suffered a fatal heart attack. Assistant manager Alex Ferguson took temporary charge of the team until the 1986 World Cup, from which Scotland were eliminated in the group stage.|$|E

On March 20, he repeated as Illinois Gatorade Player of the Year. Brunson led Stevenson to the IHSA final four for a {{third consecutive}} time, but he led the team to the first state championship by a Lake county school with an IHSA Class 4A title-game record 30 points in a 57-40 victory over Normal Community High School. Brunson was 9-for-15 {{from the field and}} 9-for-9 from the free throw line. 2015 was Lake county's ninth consecutive year with a team reaching the IHSA final four; Stevenson became the first school in the large school division and the third school overall to win IHSA football and basketball state championships in the same year. The win got him out of the shadow of IHSA final four losses to Parker- and Okafor-led teams. Following the season, he won Illinois Mr. Basketball with 552 points and 99 of the 132 first place votes ahead of fellow Jordan Brand All-American selection Charles Matthews who had 157 points. Brunson finished his senior season with averages of 23.3 points, 5.2 assists and 4.7 rebounds per game and with shooting percentages of 38% on three point shots and 83% on free throws. At the March 30 POWERADE Jam Fest associated with the McDonald's All-American game, Brunson won the skills competition over finalists Carlton Bragg and Isaiah Briscoe and was a finalist for the three-point shooting contest. Brunson was a first-team Parade All-American, as well as a third-team USA Today All-USA high school basketball team selection. In the April 11 Nike Hoops Summit, Brunson had 12 points and 7 assists in a 103101 loss. In the April 17 Jordan Brand Classic, Brunson had a game-high 3 steals. He finished his high school career ranked #16 in the ESPN 100 and as the #2 point guard (behind Isaiah Briscoe).|$|E
