50|$|Less precise measurements: SI {{units are}} {{designed}} to be used in precision measurements. For example, the second is defined by an atomic transition frequency in cesium atoms, because this transition frequency can be precisely reproduced with atomic clock technology. Natural unit systems are generally not based on quantities that can be precisely reproduced in a lab. Therefore, in order to retain the same degree of precision, the fundamental constants used still have to be measured in a laboratory in terms of physical objects that can be directly observed. If this is not possible, then a <b>quantity</b> expressed <b>in</b> natural <b>units</b> can be less precise than the same <b>quantity</b> expressed <b>in</b> SI <b>units.</b> For example, Planck units use the gravitational constant , which is measurable in a laboratory only to four significant digits.|$|R

Simultaneously, the size of the discharge window in the longitudinal direction (along the strike direction of the face) was controlled.|$|R
40|$|Azokh Cave is a Middle Pleistocene to Holocene site {{located in}} Nagorno Karabagh (Lesser Caucasus). The main entrance, Azokh 1, {{is a large}} cave that has two {{geological}} sequences (lower and upper) with nine geo-archaeological units of which only the upper ones (Units I to V) have a significant archaeological record.   The faunal remains and lithic artefacts <b>in</b> these <b>units</b> indicate aspects of human occupation, and exploitation of, and association with animals.      The lithic artefacts presented here were recovered from Units V, III and II during the 2002 – 2009 excavation seasons. The available chronological data indicates an age between 293 – 100 Ka for these units. The operational chain is incomplete and artefacts found in the cave are primarily end-products dominated by flake-tools. The assemblage of Unit V is composed primarily of simple, unretouched flakes with a minimal presence of retouched flakes and cores. The Unit II lithic assemblage includes a substantial Levallois component, although with fewer cores and retouched flakes. There are very few flake tools <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> III. While it is still difficult to assign the Unit V assemblage to a techno-typological group or complex (i. e. Acheulean, Mousterian or other local techno-complexes such as the Kudarian), the Unit II assemblage is clearly associated with Mode 3 or the Mousterian techno-complex. Different local and non-local raw materials were exploited <b>in</b> all <b>units</b> {{for the production of}} lithic artefacts, although the range of raw materials is more varied <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> II. Local chert, flint and basalt were used most commonly, probably due to their easy accessibility. Limestone, jasper and sandstone, from local and non-local sources, are present <b>in</b> small <b>quantities</b> <b>in</b> <b>Units</b> V and II. Obsidian is the only raw material that possibly originates from more distant sources. Flint and chert appear to have been preferentially exploited for flake tool production <b>in</b> all <b>units,</b> but the toolmakers show a preference for better quality raw material (flint, basalt, obsidian) for retouched pieces <b>in</b> <b>Units</b> V and II, and for Levallois production <b>in</b> <b>Unit</b> II. </p...|$|R

The time from the start of discharge until the gangue occurring in the discharge flow is the time of coal discharge in a round. When using two rounds of coal discharge, the time spent on one round of coal discharge should be half of the total coal discharge time, and 1 / 3 of the total coal discharge time for three rounds of coal discharge.|$|R
