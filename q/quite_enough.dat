25|$|The first Masters Series of the season, the 2012 BNP Paribas Open was disappointing. A {{retirement}} by Michaël Llodra and a {{win over}} Radek Štěpánek preceded a loss to David Nalbandian, after holding a match point. At the 2012 Sony Ericsson Open, four easy wins paved {{the way to a}} quarterfinal encounter with Rafael Nadal.

25|$|West Africa batted {{well against}} Bermuda {{to post a}} total of 249, with Elliott making 67 and Onyechi 53 despite Elvin James' 4-41. An {{unbroken}} partnership of 125 between Brown (78 not out) and Blades (82 not out) settled the matter, however, as the Bermudians won by seven wickets with more than 11 overs in hand. M Rajalingham took 5-39 for Singapore to restrict Fiji to 219,but it was not <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> as the Singaporeans were bowled out 14 runs short for 205. In the other match, a massive opening partnership of 257 between centurions Rene Schoonheim (117) and RE Lifmann (155 not out, the tournament's highest score) propelled the Netherlands to 301/3 and gave Malaysia no chance of victory, and the Asians were dismissed for 176 to give the Dutch a 125-run win.|$|E
25|$|During the Nixon years (and {{through the}} 1970s), the liberal {{consensus}} {{began to come}} apart {{with the election of}} Ronald Reagan marking the election of the first non-Keynsian administration and the first application of supply-side economics. The alliance with white Southern Democrats had been lost in the Civil Rights era. While the steady enfranchisement of African Americans expanded the electorate to include many new voters sympathetic to liberal views, it was not <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> {{to make up for the}} loss of some Southern Democrats. A tide of conservatism rose in response to perceived failures of liberal policies. Organized labor, long a bulwark of the liberal consensus, was past the peak of its power in the US and many unions had remained in favor of the Vietnam War even as liberal politicians increasingly turned against it.|$|E

25|$|When {{river flow}} wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> for two turbines, {{operation}} was cycled between running one and both turbines, {{based on a}} daily reservoir draw-down and refill cycle. The cycling was timed to meet peak electrical demands. That is, both turbines operated during hours of high electrical demand and the reservoir was drawn down. A single turbine operated during low electrical demand hours while the reservoir refilled. A similar cycle was used when inflow was less than enough for a single turbine. A weekly cycle was superimposed on the daily cycle that tended to draw down the reservoir during the week and allowed it refill during the weekend. In these cases, known as load factoring, the plant operated as a peaking plant. This mode of operation was greatly reduced through the 1980s and 1990s to appease lakefront cabin owners.|$|E
25|$|While UMass' {{rivalry with}} Penn State pales in {{comparison}} to the one with URI, it has nevertheless been a consistent presence throughout Minutemen program history as PSU, like UMass and URI, was {{a founding member of the}} ECWHL and has been in the league for all but two of its 14 seasons. The teams have met four times at the ECWHL playoffs (a scheduled fifth was nixed by a 2010 snowstorm), with UMass enjoying a 3–1–0 advantage in those games. None were better than the contest that took place on February 28, 2004 at Rhode Island's Brad Boss Arena. The wild affair saw Aleta Mills and Samantha Louras each score four times - yet it wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>enough,</b> as the Lady Icers' Katie King scored four of her own on the way to an 8–8 tie after regulation, where neither team ever led by more than two and with only three stretches of more than 5:00 without a goal being scored. In the second overtime, Mills' fifth tally sent the Minutemen to the first-ever league championship game.|$|E
25|$|In {{the gold}} medal game, both the USA and Spain entered the game undefeated. The USA started well, opening up an early 7–2 lead, but Spain came back strong. The lead changed hands in the first half, with the USA holding on to a five-point lead at halftime. The USA scored the first six points {{of the second half}} to push the lead to double-digits, but Spain cut the lead back to just two points {{at the end of the}} third period. Spain hit three {{pointers}} in the final period and took the lead; the game was tied at 71 points each late in the game. The USA team outscored Spain by just 6–4 over the remaining time to win the game and {{the gold medal}}. Spain's Ángela Salvadores scored 40 points for her team and was awarded the tournament MVP honors, but it wasn't <b>quite</b> <b>enough.</b> USA's Lauren Cox scored 20 points, while the team set a USA U17 record for blocked shots, with eight.

25|$|The 2016 season saw {{dramatic}} {{improvements in}} two of the three competitions. Chris Rogers was brought in to captain the Championship side on a one-year basis, and having been mid-table for most of the season, Somerset went on a late surge which put them right in contention for the title going into the last round of matches. Somerset defeated Nottinghamshire in their match, with Rogers scoring tons in both innings of the last game of his career, but needed Middlesex and Yorkshire to draw their match on the final day. With the game drifting, Yorkshire employed declaration bowling in order to allow Middlesex to set a target. However, as the close neared, it became clear that Yorkshire were not going to reach the target and Middlesex appeared not to have <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> time to bowl Yorkshire out. In heartbreaking fashion, Yorkshire's lower order collapsed to hand Middlesex the title and leave Somerset finishing runners-up. Somerset had four batsmen reach 1000 runs in the Championship, those being Trescothick, Hildreth, Rogers {{and for the first time}} in his career, Peter Trego. Spinner Jack Leach claimed 65 wickets, finishing second in the Division One wicket takers list. Somerset enjoyed a good run of success in the One-Day Cup too, reaching the semi-finals before losing to eventual champions Warwickshire. Captain Jim Allenby was the leading run-scorer, passing 50 in five of his ten innings in the competition. Lewis Gregory and Tim Groenewald both performed well enough to qualify for the South team for the inaugural North v South one-day series at the start of the next season. In stark contrast, Somerset's t20 Blast campaign was disastrous, the club finished bottom of the South Group and lost their last seven games in a row.|$|E

[...] Goliad native Carlos de la Garza led a guerrilla warfare campaign against the Texian troops.

Perhaps they don't create <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> deeply funny earthlings to go around, but a thoroughly mean-spirited big-budget movie is always a treasurable rarity." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum from the Chicago Reader praised the surreal humor and black comedy, which he found {{to be in the}} vein of Dr. Strangelove and Gremlins (1984).

500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. We {{do not want to see}} either Figaro or Othello; it is <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion from one side of the auditorium to another.

However, on the European and British legs of the tour the song was performed {{towards the end of}} the show. The live performance saw her wearing a silver bodysuit and then being carried by her crotch by one of her male dancers and lowered onto another male dancer, engaging in a threesome with them. During the performance at San Diego, California, Gaga incorporated the city's name in the song, later commenting [...] "I am so lucky that San Diego rhymes with 'Fernando' and 'Alejandro'." [...] Ted Shaw of Windsor Star commented that [...] "Songs like 'Alejandro', 'Teeth' and 'Monster' shoved the sex act in your face." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy from The Gazette said that [...] "the song followed in fast order, with not <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> to set [...] apart. It was one choreographed dance number after the next." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone commented that the performance was [...] " [...] of several moments [...] that gave parents in the audience consternation."

It was his first general classification victory since the 2015 Route du Sud; he dedicated the victory to his fans and to Oleg Tinkov, the owner of the Tinkoff team. Sergio Henao said that he had tried a different tactic in the time trial – holding back early on in order to give more effort later in the stage – and said that he was pleased both with his own performance and with how his team had ridden. He said that he was feeling strong ahead of his main objectives for the season, the Ardennes classics.

That's almost but not <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> {{to make up for the}} somewhat slack plotting and the generic nature of the main characters. Neither princess here is a patch on Tangleds babe-in-the-woods Rapunzel, while both Hans and Kristoff are cut from pretty standard-issue hero cloth until a reasonably surprising third-act twist somewhat ups the ante. Only Olaf is unimpeachable: Get this snowman a spinoff feature to call his own." [...] The Seattle Times gave the film two out of four stars, stating that [...] "While it is an often gorgeous film with computer-generated fjords and ice sculptures and castle interiors, the important thing that glues all this stuff together– story– is sadly lacking." [...] Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch also criticized the story as the film's weakest point. Writing on Roger Ebert's website, Christy Lemire gave a mixed review in which she awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four. Lemire praised the visuals and the performance of [...] "Let It Go," [...] as well as the positive messages Frozen sends. However, she referred to the film as [...] "cynical" [...] and criticized it as an [...] "attempt to shake things up without shaking them up too much." [...] She also noted the similarity between Elsa and another well-known fictional female who unleashes paranormal powers when agitated, Carrie White.|$|E
500|$|After he {{read the}} script, Connery {{realised}} {{the risk of the}} sequence with the sharks in Largo's pool and insisted that production designer Ken Adam build a Plexiglas partition inside the pool. The barrier was not a fixed structure, so when one of the sharks managed to pass through it, Connery fled the pool, seconds away from attack. Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian, [...] "We had to use special effects, but unlike special effects today, they were real. The jet pack we used in Thunderball was real - it was invented for the United States Army. Bloody dangerous, and it only lasted a couple of minutes. The ejector seat in the Aston Martin was real and Emilio Largo's boat, the Disco Volante, was real. You had power boats at that time, but there were no good-sized yachts that were able to travel at 40 to 50 knots, so it was quite a problem. But by combining a hydrofoil, which we bought in Puerto Rico for $10,000, and a catamaran, it at least looked like a big yacht. We combined the two hulls with a one-inch slip bolt and when they split it worked like a dream. We used lots of sharks for this movie. I'd rented a villa in the Bahamas with a saltwater pool which we filled with sharks and used for underwater filming. The smell was horrendous. This was where Sean Connery came close to being bitten. We had a plexiglass corridor to protect him, but I didn't have <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> plexiglass and one of the sharks got through. He never got out of a pool faster in his life - he was walking on water." [...] When special-effects coordinator John Stears provided a supposedly dead shark to be towed around the pool, the shark, which was still alive, revived at one point. Due to the dangers on the set, stuntman Bill Cummings demanded an extra fee of £250 to double for Largo's sidekick Quist as he was dropped into the pool of sharks.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans {{was posted}} to Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, where he {{qualified}} as a flying instructor. He served in this capacity {{for the next}} four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No.77 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No.38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General's Flight (later No.34 (Special Transport) Squadron} until 1956. As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Promoted to squadron leader, Evans' service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13June 1957. The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture. In November 1959, he took a refresher course at CFS, qualifying on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with No.1 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, graduating in May 1960. From then until 1962 he served as a flight commander in No.2 Squadron, operating Canberras out of RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the RAF College of Air Warfare. In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber. His final specification included a payload of , speed of Mach2, and range of [...] This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, DC, as Assistant Air Attaché, having [...] "had <b>quite</b> <b>enough</b> of writing Air Staff Requirements".|$|E
