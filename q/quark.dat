5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high baryon densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – <b>quark</b> matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored <b>quark</b> Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because <b>quark</b> Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of <b>quark</b> matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E

5000|$|All <b>quarks</b> carry a baryon number [...] They also all carry weak isospin, [...] The positive- <b>quarks</b> (up, charm, and top <b>quarks)</b> {{are called}} up-type <b>quarks</b> and negative- <b>quarks</b> (down, strange, and bottom <b>quarks)</b> are called down-type <b>quarks.</b> Each doublet of {{up and down}} type <b>quarks</b> {{constitutes}} one generation of <b>quarks.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to the Feynman diagrams, {{constituent}} <b>quarks</b> {{seem to be}} 'dressed' current <b>quarks,</b> i.e. current <b>quarks</b> {{surrounded by}} a cloud of virtual <b>quarks</b> and gluons. This cloud in the end explains the large constituent-quark masses.|$|R

5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, <b>Quark</b> {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help <b>Quark</b> defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and <b>Quark</b> alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that <b>Quark</b> is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E

500|$|Hadrons contain, {{along with}} the valence <b>quarks</b> (...) that {{contribute}} to their quantum numbers, virtual quark–antiquark (...) pairs known as sea <b>quarks</b> (...) [...] Sea <b>quarks</b> form when a gluon of the hadron's color field splits; this process also works in reverse in that the annihilation of two sea <b>quarks</b> produces a gluon. The result is a constant flux of gluon splits and creations colloquially known as [...] "the sea". Sea <b>quarks</b> are much less stable than their valence counterparts, and they typically annihilate each other within {{the interior of the}} hadron. Despite this, sea <b>quarks</b> can hadronize into baryonic or mesonic particles under certain circumstances.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quarks</b> are {{particles}} of spin-, implying {{that they are}} fermions. They carry an electric charge of − e (down-type <b>quarks)</b> or + e (up-type <b>quarks).</b> For comparison, an electron has a charge of −1 e. They also carry colour charge, which {{is the equivalent of}} the electric charge for the strong interaction. <b>Quarks</b> also undergo radioactive decay, meaning that they are subject to the weak interaction. <b>Quarks</b> are massive particles, and therefore are also subject to gravity.|$|R
50|$|Strange <b>quarks</b> also bind {{with the}} heavier charm and bottom <b>quarks</b> which {{also like to}} bind with each other. Thus in {{presence}} {{of a large number}} of these <b>quarks</b> quite unusually abundant exotic particles can be produced, some of these have never been observed before. This should be the case in the forthcoming exploration at the new Large Hadron Collider at CERN of the particles that have both charm and strange <b>quarks,</b> and even bottom <b>quarks</b> as components.|$|R
5|$|The <b>quark</b> {{model was}} {{independently}} proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced {{as parts of}} an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The top <b>quark</b> {{was the last to}} be discovered at Fermilab in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The quark–gluon plasma {{would be}} {{characterized}} by a great {{increase in the number}} of heavier <b>quark</b> pairs in relation to the number of up and down <b>quark</b> pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang (the <b>quark</b> epoch), the universe was filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.|$|E
5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current <b>quark</b> mass refers to the mass of a <b>quark</b> by itself, while constituent <b>quark</b> mass refers to the current <b>quark</b> mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the <b>quark.</b> These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E
50|$|The {{strong force}} acts between <b>quarks.</b> Unlike all other forces (electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational), the strong force does not {{diminish}} in strength with increasing distance between pairs of <b>quarks.</b> After a limiting distance (about {{the size of}} a hadron) has been reached, it remains at a strength of about 10,000 newtons (N), no matter how much farther the distance between the <b>quarks.</b> As the separation between the <b>quarks</b> grows, the energy added to the pair creates new pairs of matching <b>quarks</b> between the original two; hence it is impossible to create separate <b>quarks.</b> The explanation is that the amount of work done against a force of 10,000 newtons is enough to create particle-antiparticle pairs within a very short distance of that interaction. The very energy added to the system required to pull two <b>quarks</b> apart would create a pair of new <b>quarks</b> that will pair up with the original ones. In QCD, this phenomenon is called color confinement; as a result only hadrons, not individual free <b>quarks,</b> can be observed. The failure of all experiments that have searched for free <b>quarks</b> is considered to be evidence of this phenomenon.|$|R
5000|$|Fritzsch worked also on [...] "composite models" [...] of leptons and <b>quarks,</b> mass {{matrices}} of <b>quarks</b> and leptons, weak decays {{of heavy}} <b>quarks,</b> cosmology and the fundamental constants of physics. He retired in 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{important}} high-mass particles (both {{recently discovered}} and hypothetical) decay into bottom <b>quarks.</b> Top <b>quarks</b> very nearly always do so, and the Higgs boson {{is expected to}} decay into bottom <b>quarks</b> {{more than any other}} particle given its mass has been observed to be about 126 GeV. Identifying bottom <b>quarks</b> helps to identify the decays of these particles.|$|R
5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red <b>quark</b> emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green <b>quark</b> absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani {{presented}} the so-called GIM mechanism {{to explain the}} experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This theoretical model required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered charm <b>quark.</b> The number of supposed <b>quark</b> flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down <b>quark</b> (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up <b>quark</b> and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
50|$|The Standard Model groups matter {{particles}} {{into three}} generations, where each generation {{consists of two}} <b>quarks</b> and two leptons. The first generation is {{the up and down}} <b>quarks,</b> the electron and the electron neutrino; the second includes the charm and strange <b>quarks,</b> the muon and the muon neutrino; the third generation consists of the top and bottom <b>quarks</b> and the tau and tau neutrino. The most natural explanation for this would be that <b>quarks</b> and leptons of higher generations are excited states of the first generations. If this {{turns out to be the}} case, it would imply that <b>quarks</b> and leptons are composite particles, rather than elementary particles.|$|R
40|$|We use {{improved}} lattice {{actions for}} glue, light <b>quarks</b> and heavy <b>quarks</b> {{for which we}} use lattice NRQCD to compute hadron masses. Our results are in good agreement with experiment, except for charmed hadrons.

40|$|If <b>quarks</b> are {{composite}} particles then excited {{states are}} expected. We have searched in ppBAR collisions for excited <b>quarks</b> (q*) which decay to common <b>quarks</b> by emitting a W boson (q* [...] > qW) or a photon (q* [...] > qgamma). The simplest model of excited <b>quarks</b> has been excluded for mass M* < 540 GeV/c 2 at 95 % confidence level...|$|R
5|$|It is {{the only}} {{interaction}} capable of changing the flavour of quarks (i.e., of changing one type of <b>quark</b> into another).|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up <b>quark.</b> Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, <b>quark</b> properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
5|$|The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory deep inelastic {{scattering}} experiments {{of the late}} 1960s showed that nucleons (protons and neutrons) contained point-like particles that scattered electrons. It was natural to identify these with quarks, but Feynman's parton model attempted to interpret the experimental data {{in a way that}} did not introduce additional hypotheses. For example, the data showed that some 45% of the energy momentum was carried by electrically neutral particles in the nucleon. These electrically neutral particles are now seen to be the gluons that carry the forces between the quarks, and their three-valued color quantum number solves the Omega-minus problem. Feynman did not dispute the <b>quark</b> model; for example, when the fifth <b>quark</b> was discovered in 1977, Feynman immediately pointed out to his students that the discovery implied the existence of a sixth <b>quark,</b> which was discovered in the decade after his death.|$|E

25|$|In theory, heptaquarks (5 <b>quarks,</b> 2 antiquarks), nonaquarks (6 <b>quarks,</b> 3 antiquarks), etc. {{could also}} exist.|$|R
2500|$|Baryons, {{along with}} mesons, are hadrons, meaning they are {{particles}} composed of <b>quarks.</b> <b>Quarks</b> have baryon numbers of B= and antiquarks have baryon numbers of B=−. The term [...] "baryon" [...] usually refers to triquarks—baryons made of three <b>quarks</b> (B=++=1).|$|R
5|$|Zweig {{preferred}} the name ace for the particle he had theorized, but Gell-Mann's terminology came to prominence once the <b>quark</b> model had been commonly accepted.|$|E
25|$|The down <b>quark</b> is a first-generation <b>quark</b> with {{a charge}} of −. It is the second-lightest of all the six of quarks, the lightest being the up <b>quark.</b> Down quarks are most {{commonly}} found in nucleons.

25|$|The bottom <b>quark</b> is {{a third-generation}} <b>quark</b> with {{a charge of}} −1⁄3e. The bottom <b>quark</b> was {{discovered}} by the E288 experiment at Fermilab in 1977 when collisions produced bottomonium.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the chiral SU(n) ⊗ SU(n) flavor {{symmetry}} on the null-plane severely restricts the sea <b>quarks</b> in the baryon octet. It predicts large asymmetry for the light sea <b>quarks</b> (u,d,s), and universality and abundance for the heavy sea <b>quarks.</b> Further it is shown that existence of the heavy sea <b>quarks</b> constrained by the same symmetry reduces the theoretical value of the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule substantially. ...|$|R
40|$|Collisions between heavy nuclei at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider {{liberate}} {{from the}} nuclear wavefunction of order 10, 000 gluons, <b>quarks</b> and antiquarks.

50|$|It {{would take}} {{about a decade}} for the {{unexpected}} nature—and physical reality—of these <b>quarks</b> to be appreciated more fully (See <b>Quarks).</b> Counter-intuitively, they cannot ever be observed in isolation (color confinement), but instead always combine with other <b>quarks</b> to form full hadrons, which then furnish ample indirect information on the trapped <b>quarks</b> themselves.
