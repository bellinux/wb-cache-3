5|$|Fey's {{father had}} English, German, Northern Irish, Scottish, and Russian ancestry; {{one of her}} {{paternal}} ancestors was John Hewson (1744–1821), a textile manufacturer who immigrated to America {{with the support of}} Benjamin Franklin, enabling Hewson to quickly open a <b>quilting</b> factory in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. According to a genealogical DNA test arranged by the television series Finding Your Roots, Fey's ancestry is 94% European, 3% Middle Eastern, and 3% from the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} have {{developed their own}} style in clothing and jewellery, using local products, such as shells. Giving somebody a shell necklace and placing it around the recipients neck is a goodwill and love gesture. They make a type of sarong, called a pareu, which is typically brightly coloured. Like the other islands of Melanesia such as Fiji and Samoa, the Cook Islanders {{are known for their}} hand-painted and silk-screened dress fabrics. An important practice among women is tivaevae, a type of <b>quilting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Symmetries are {{prominent}} in textile arts including <b>quilting,</b> knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery and weaving, {{where they may}} be purely decorative or may be marks of status. Rotational symmetry is found in circular structures such as domes; these are sometimes elaborately decorated with symmetric patterns inside and out, as at the 1619 Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Isfahan. Items of embroidery and lace work such as tablecloths and table mats, made using bobbins or by tatting, can have {{a wide variety of}} reflectional and rotational symmetries which are being explored mathematically.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in <b>quilting.</b> Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|Franken {{was born}} on May 21, 1951, in New York City, the son of Joseph Franken, a {{printing}} salesman, and Phoebe Franken (born Kunst), a real estate agent. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Germany; his maternal grandfather came from Grodno, Belarus, and his maternal grandmother's parents were also from the Russian Empire. Both of his parents were Jewish, and Al {{was raised in a}} Reform Jewish home. The Franken family moved to Albert Lea, Minnesota, when Al was four years old. His father opened a <b>quilting</b> factory, but it failed after just two years. The family moved to St. Louis Park, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. Franken graduated from The Blake School in 1969, where {{he was a member of}} the wrestling team. He attended Harvard College where he majored in political science, graduating cum laude (in the top 25% of the class) with a Bachelor of Arts in 1973. His older brother Owen is a photojournalist, and his cousin Bob is a journalist for MSNBC.|$|E
25|$|Shadow or echo <b>quilting</b> – Hawaiian <b>quilting,</b> where <b>quilting</b> is done {{around an}} appliquéd {{piece on the}} quilt top, then the <b>quilting</b> is echoed again and again around the {{previous}} <b>quilting</b> line.|$|E
25|$|Trapunto <b>quilting</b> – stuffed <b>quilting,</b> often {{associated}} with Italy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} <b>quilting</b> exist today. The two {{most widely used}} are hand-quilting and machine <b>quilting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ralli <b>quilting</b> – Pakistani and Indian <b>quilting,</b> often {{associated}} with the Sindh (Pakistan) and Gujarat (India) regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole process}} of {{creating}} a quilt or quilted garment also involves other steps such as designing, piecing, appliqué, and binding. A person who works at <b>quilting</b> is termed a quilter. <b>Quilting</b> {{can be done by}} hand, via a sewing machine, or by a specialized longarm <b>quilting</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Watercolor <b>quilting</b> – A {{sophisticated}} form {{of scrap}} <b>quilting</b> whereby uniform sizes of various prints are arranged and sewn {{to create a}} picture or design. See also Colorwash.|$|E
25|$|Quilt stores often sell fabric, thread, {{patterns}} {{and other goods}} that are used for <b>quilting.</b> They often have group sewing and <b>quilting</b> classes where one {{can learn how to}} sew or quilt.|$|E

25|$|The top-most {{layer of}} a quilt is usually made from cotton <b>quilting</b> fabric. Selecting the fabric {{can be a}} {{challenging}} exercise, {{and the number of}} different fabrics required depends on the <b>quilting</b> pattern selected. Many quilters will also make use of fabrics from home, incorporating fabrics with a particular sentimental importance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quilting</b> is {{the process}} of sewing two or more layers of fabric {{together}} to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment. Typically, <b>quilting</b> is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quilting</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with embroidery, patchwork, applique, {{and other forms}} of needlework.|$|E
25|$|Before {{actually}} <b>quilting</b> fabrics, some quilters baste the quilt. Basting is {{the practice}} of making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface of}} the quilt to hold the layers of the quilt together and to prevent them from shifting during the <b>quilting</b> process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, Harriet Powers made quilts {{in rural}} Georgia, United States {{that are now}} {{considered}} among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern <b>quilting.</b> Later in the 20th century, the women of Gee's Bend developed a distinctive, bold, and sophisticated <b>quilting</b> style based on traditional African-American quilts with a geometric simplicity that developed separately but was like that of Amish quilts and modern art.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of African-American <b>quilting</b> beginning with quilts made by slaves, both for themselves and for their owners. The style of these quilts was determined largely by time period and region, rather than race, and the documented slave-made quilts generally resemble those made by white women in their region. After 1865 and the end of slavery in the United States, African-Americans began to develop their own distinctive style of <b>quilting.</b>|$|E

25|$|Machine <b>quilting</b> is {{the process}} of using a home sewing machine or a longarm machine to sew the layers {{together}}. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before <b>quilting.</b> This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety pins) or tacking the layers together. Longarm <b>quilting</b> involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for tacking or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.|$|E
25|$|Some Native Americans {{are thought}} to have learned <b>quilting</b> through {{observation}} of white settlers; others learned it from missionaries who taught <b>quilting</b> to Native American women along with other homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqué framing the star design. Pictorial quilts, created with appliqué, were also common.|$|E
25|$|Liberia has a long, {{rich history}} in textile arts and <b>quilting,</b> as the {{settlers}} {{brought with them}} their sewing and <b>quilting</b> skills. Liberia hosted National Fairs in 1857 and 1858 in which prizes were awarded for various needle arts. One of the most well-known Liberian quilters was Martha Ann Ricks, who presented a quilt featuring the famed Liberian coffee tree to Queen Victoria in 1892. When President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf moved into the Executive Mansion, she reportedly had a Liberian-made quilt installed in her presidential office.|$|E
25|$|Shadow trapunto – This {{involves}} <b>quilting</b> {{a design}} in fine lawn and filling {{some of the}} spaces in the pattern with small lengths of colored wool.|$|E
25|$|Harriet Powers, a slave-born African American woman, {{made two}} famous story quilts. She {{was just one}} of the many African-American quilters who contributed to the {{evolution}} of <b>quilting.</b> The first nationwide recognition of African-American quiltmaking came when the Gee's Bend <b>quilting</b> community was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and travelled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee's Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quiltmaking tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and others quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. The communal nature of the <b>quilting</b> process (and how it can bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps.|$|E
25|$|Dalí {{also helped}} Schiaparelli design the Skeleton Dress for the Circus Collection. It was a stark black crepe dress which used trapunto <b>quilting</b> to create padded ribs, spine, and leg bones.|$|E
25|$|Machine trapunto <b>quilting</b> – {{a process}} of using {{water-soluble}} thread and an extra layer of batting to achieve trapunto design and then sandwiching the quilt and re-sewing the design with regular cotton thread.|$|E
25|$|This annual Christmastime fair is {{sponsored}} by the Albemarle Craftsman's Guild and features artisans, many of whom wear period costumes, selling and demonstrating traditional crafts. Crafts include <b>quilting</b> and fiber arts, pottery, jewelry and woodwork.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of {{computerized}} machine embroidery, the main use of manual machine embroidery is in fiber art and <b>quilting</b> projects. Though some manufacturers still use manual embroidery to embellish garments, many prefer computerized embroidery's ease and reduced costs.|$|E
25|$|Another American {{group to}} develop a {{distinct}} style of <b>quilting</b> were the Amish. Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish {{are known for their}} Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish <b>quilting,</b> while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.|$|E
25|$|Once the fabrics {{have been}} cut, {{the pieces are}} sewn {{together}} in the chosen pattern. This {{can be done by}} hand or by machine. Accurate seam allowances are especially important when it comes to <b>quilting.</b> With dozens, sometimes hundreds, of different seams, if each seam is off by even 0.5cm it becomes difficult to make all of the components fit together evenly.|$|E
25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A <b>quilting</b> ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. <b>Quilting</b> rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E
25|$|Convicted {{of having}} {{knowledge}} of a royalist plot, Liliuokalani was fined $5000 and sentenced {{to five years in}} prison and hard labor. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment in an upstairs bedroom of Iolani Palace. During her imprisonment, the queen was denied any visitors other than one lady in waiting. She began each day with her daily devotions followed by reading, <b>quilting,</b> crochet-work, or music composition.|$|E
25|$|Pieced quilt: Pieced quilts {{are also}} known as patchworks. They consist of {{geometric}} shapes taken from different fabrics and are sewn together. After that process, it {{is referred to as}} a quilt top. The <b>quilting</b> patterns generally follow the design of the geometric patterns. The quilt ends up being a mixture of different fabrics and geometric designs and shapes that are organized in some fashion.|$|E
25|$|What a quilter uses to cut {{the fabric}} is a vital step in the <b>quilting</b> process. It is very {{important}} each piece is perfectly aligned {{in order to prevent}} an uneven or sloppy appearance and to prevent rework. Rotary cutters revolutionized quiltmaking when they appeared in late 1970s. A rotary cutter offers even the shakiest of hands the ability to produce perfect, even slices and minimizes the chance of error.|$|E
25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a <b>quilting</b> ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|E
