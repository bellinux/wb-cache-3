5|$|Certain <b>quantum</b> effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the <b>quantum</b> states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two <b>quantum</b> states. If the particles are separated and one particle's <b>quantum</b> state is observed, the other particle's <b>quantum</b> state is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which <b>quantum</b> state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the <b>quantum</b> aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

5|$|One of {{the deepest}} {{problems}} in modern physics {{is the problem of}} <b>quantum</b> gravity. The current understanding of gravity is based on Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which is formulated within the framework of classical physics.

A <b>quantum</b> theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of <b>quantum</b> mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of <b>quantum</b> theory to the force of gravity.|$|E

We describe the creation of contents using conversation <b>quanta.</b> To realize the concept of conversation <b>quanta,</b> we attempt to manually extract conversation <b>quanta</b> from the videos of some meetings and create the conversational contents.

5|$|<b>Quantum</b> {{gravity is}} {{the branch of}} physics that seeks to {{describe}} gravity using the principles of <b>quantum</b> mechanics. Currently, the most popular approach to <b>quantum</b> gravity is string theory, which models elementary particles not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional objects called strings. In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one typically considers theories of <b>quantum</b> gravity derived from string theory or its modern extension, M-theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of <b>quantum</b> mechanics to physical {{objects such as}} the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as <b>quantum</b> field theory.

5|$|Von Neumann was {{the first}} to {{establish}} a rigorous mathematical framework for <b>quantum</b> mechanics, known as the Dirac–von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of <b>Quantum</b> Mechanics. After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of <b>quantum</b> mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a <b>quantum</b> system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of <b>quantum</b> mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the <b>quantum</b> system.|$|E
25|$|After {{reviewing}} <b>Quanta,</b> Mallinckrodt, and the parties' arguments, this Court is {{persuaded that}} <b>Quanta</b> overruled Mallinckrodt sub silentio. The Supreme Court's broad {{statement of the}} law of patent exhaustion simply cannot be squared with the position that the <b>Quanta</b> holding is limited to its specific facts. Further, the Federal Circuit relied in part on Mallinckrodt in reaching its decision in LG Electronics, Inc. v. Bizcom Electronics, Inc., 453 F.3d 1364, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the decision the Supreme Court reversed in <b>Quanta.</b> It is also worth noting that the <b>Quanta</b> decision did not mention a single Federal Circuit case.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Quanta</b> Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Intel selling chips to <b>Quanta</b> {{exhausted}} LG's patent rights.

The defendants argued that the <b>Quanta</b> case eliminated the territoriality requirement, hence's Fujifilm's sales of LFFP outside the US exhausted its patent rights as well, allowing the defendants to refurbish and resell them in the US. However, because the <b>Quanta</b> case did not involve foreign sales, the Circuit Court rejected the defendants' argument.|$|R
