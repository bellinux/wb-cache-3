2500|$|In {{that same}} month, Sócrates' licenciatura degree in civil {{engineering}} by Universidade Independente was put under enormous public scrutiny. Journalists found that <b>qualifications</b> <b>awarded</b> {{did not follow}} procedure and that {{four of the five}} academic disciplines were given in the private university by the same professor, António José Moraes, a socialist government appointee. A fifth academic discipline, [...] "technical English" [...] was given by the Independente's rector. A strong case was built up related to possible false declarations by José Sócrates regarding his university degree, and the way he was awarded this degree in civil engineering. Among other issues, the Independente degree in civil engineering was not an accredited degree, a civil engineering department was not yet established at that university, one examination was sent by fax and Sócrates' diploma was issued on a Sunday, a day on which the university was always closed.|$|E

Sarma wrote that McCombs School of Business {{was not aware}} of a relationship with IIPM, and that IIPM may have a relationship with another University of Texas-Austin college. Judge Business School told Sarma that they were delivering a [...] "five-day non-degree executive education program" [...] to IIPM students at the University of Cambridge, and that [...] "there are no university <b>qualifications</b> <b>awarded</b> from Cambridge University or Judge Business School. The only certificate is a certificate of attendance which is what we provide to participants on all our programs." [...] Darden Business School told Sarma that [...] "along with Cambridge (Judge) and UC Berkeley (Haas)," [...] University of Virginia's Darden School of Business was providing a series of week-long Executive Education non-credit programs for IIPM. Darden also said it had no partnership agreement with IIPM. Haas Business School confirmed the existence of a contract with IIPM and said that IIPM [...] "may represent itself as a business school participating with the Haas School of Business," [...] and that Haas faculty will teach courses in the IIPM program.|$|E
