40|$|In {{this study}} we model how {{certification}} affects managers’ choice {{of the quality of}} the nonprofit organizations they run. We analyze a market with one representative charity, run by a manager with some preference for the provision of a charitable good, one donor, and a certification agency. We assume that the nature of the charitable good does not allow for partial provision, thus, the charity can be of two types only: a good charity that spends all its resources on the charitable good, and a bad one that diverts all its resources for the private consumption of its manager (for-profit in disguise). We show that for a wide parameter range, the presence of an honest certifier in the market increases the incentives for managers to choose good charities, leading to an improvement in the market as the share of good charities increases. <b>Quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> <b>certification,</b> moral hazard, experience goods. versus second–best strategic policy. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address an {{asymmetric}} information problem in the fundraising industry, the fundraising problem. The problem arises from donors’ lack {{of information about the}} quality of charities that solicit donations. We focus on one particular solution of this problem, certification, where an independent agency provides a costly signal, a certificate, to charities that can use it to signal their ‘high’ quality. Our model is a signaling game involving three types of player: donors, charities and a certifier. We compare the decisions and impact of two types of certifier: one profit maximizing and one nonprofit. The assumptions of our model are derived from stylized facts that we distilled from certification systems currently existing in the fundraising industries of some European countries. While the current manuscript is meant to inform the real-world design and implementation of such a system in the Czech Republic and other transition economies, our work complements the literature on certification and provides results that are different from those reported up to now.

For this purpose, the research employed an embedded single case study using heuristic inquiry to collect data. The researchers participated in three xMOOCs and took into consideration the characteristics of these MOOCs by rating them as low, medium or high in terms of Conole’s 12 dimensions. Inter-rater reliability was 92 percent. The study showed that the openness, massiveness, diversity, use of multimedia, communication among learners, learning pathway and amount of reflection dimensions were high. The communication with instructors, degree of collaboration and autonomy dimensions were medium, and the <b>quality</b> <b>assurance,</b> <b>certification,</b> and formal learning dimensions were low. After explaining characteristics of xMOOCs from the perspective of open learning, the study highlighted that xMOOCs dramatically differ with regard to the implementation of the freemium business model to education and course delivery methods.

40|$|Purpose - The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to find out why tour operators implement quality assurance, and what problems and challenges they face in doing so. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilized a multiple-case study approach, interviewing the senior managers of three accredited tour operators using formally structured questions. Findings - The purposes for which the tour operators attained ISO 9000 certification were image building, promotion and advertising; to rectify the varying standards amongst different departments; to build an understanding of the operations; to review the operation procedures and system, and the management of the tour operators; as well as to legitimize the senior management's action to make changes. A number of negative aspects to the ISO 9000 certification were found, including the high cost of implementation, lukewarm reception by staff, reduced effectiveness over time and that consistency of procedures did not equate to good or improving quality. Research limitations/implications - As the current research used a very small sample, only limited generalizations can be made. Practical implications - Tour operation is a service-based business in which it is difficult to standardize service quality but, where an attempt is made, {{there does seem to be}} a significant reduction in human error. Originality/value - A body of literature exists in which arguments for and against the use and practices of the ISO 9000 certification in different sectors are presented, but the tour operator industry is neglected.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) has {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} their construction projects (e. g., INDOT’s construction spending was $ 789 million in 2006 and increased to $ 1, 081. 4 million in 2010); while the level of its in-house inspection staff and resources has either remained the same or declined. There are different strategies {{to deal with the}} need for construction inspection resources and they may include strategies such as outsourcing the inspection of construction activities and using quality control and <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>certification</b> programs to reduce the need for in-process inspection. One strategy that could reduce the inspection workload is prioritizing construction activities for inspection. However, reducing the number of inspections also has risks, such as functional failures and reduced design life, if defects are not identified before the work is covered. Thus, available inspection resources should be allocated to the activities with significant risk consequences due to reduced inspection. The objective of this study was to: (1) evaluate the current inspection practices of INDOT and (2) develop a risk-based inspection protocol to facilitate efficient allocation of available inspection resources to minimize the risks associated with reduced inspection. First, the current inspection practices implemented by INDOT, other State Departments of Transportation, and consulting firms were identified and compared. The comparison between the inspection practices revealed that there is consistency between INDOT’s and consultants’ and other State Departments of Transportation’s inspection practices. To develop a risk-based inspection protocol, first, the risk consequences associated with reduced inspection were identified for different transportation construction activities, based on the data collected from 20 site visits to INDOT projects. These risk consequences include short and long-term functional failures, reduced design life, reduced safety, and increased maintenance cost. Based on data collected from 23 state Departments of Transportation, 58 engineers and inspectors from the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), and 20 inspection consultants in the Midwest, the subjective perceived probabilities associated with the occurrence of each risk consequence were encoded using fuzzy analysis. Using these subjective probabilities, the risk impacts due to reduced inspection were derived. The construction activities subsequently were prioritized based on the risk impacts associated with reduced inspection into five priority levels: high, medium-high, medium, medium-low, and low. The greater the risk impacts were due to reduced inspection, the higher the priority would be for inspection of that activity. The study also included identification of value added of inspection and the critical items to be watched for different activities related to transportation construction. Deliverables of this project include: (1) an inspection protocol, (2) an inspection staffing guide and (3) a list of pay items whose documentation requirements need to be modified to enhance the documentation process. The inspection protocol created in this study could assist INDOT in efficient allocation of inspection resources to construction activities...|$|E
40|$|Metadata lies at {{the heart}} of every digital {{repository}} project in the sense that it defines and drives the description of digital content stored in the repositories. Metadata allows content to be successfully stored, managed and retrieved but also preserved in the long-term. Despite the enormous importance of metadata in digital repositories, one that is widely recognized, studies indicate that what is defined as metadata quality, is relatively low in most cases of digital repositories. Metadata quality is loosely defined as "fitness for purpose" meaning that low quality of metadata means that metadata cannot fulfill its purpose which is to allow for the successful storage, management and retrieval of resources. In practice, low metadata quality leads to ineffective searches for content, ones that recall the wrong resources or even worse, no resources which makes them invisible to the intended user, that is the "client" of each digital repository. The present dissertation approaches this problem by proposing a comprehensive metadata quality assurance method, namely the Metadata <b>Quality</b> <b>Assurance</b> <b>Certification</b> Process (MQACP). The basic idea of this dissertation is to propose a set of methods that can be deployed throughout the lifecycle of a repository to ensure that metadata generated from content providers are of high quality. These methods have to be straightforward, simple to apply with measurable results. They also have to be adaptable with minimum effort so that they can be used in different contexts easily. This set of methods was described analytically, taking into account the actors needed to apply them, describing the tools needed and defining the anticipated outcomes. In order to test our proposal, we applied it on a Learning Federation of repositories, from day 1 of its existence until it reached its maturity and regular operation. We supported the metadata creation process throughout the different phases of the repositories involved by setting up specific experiments using the methods and tools of the MQACP. Throughout each phase, we measured the resulting metadata quality to certify that the anticipated improvement in metadata quality actually took place. Lastly, through these different phases, the cost of the MQACP application was measured to provide a comparison basis for future applications. Based on the success of this first application, we decided to validate the MQACP approach by applying it on another two cases of a Cultural and a Research Federation of repositories. This would allow us to prove the transferability of the approach to other cases the present some similarities with the initial one but mainly significant differences. The results showed that the MQACP was successfully adapted to the new contexts, with minimum adaptations needed, with similar results produced and also with comparable costs. In addition, looking closer at the common experiments carried out in each phase of each use case, we were able to identify interesting patterns in the behavior of content providers that can be further researched. The dissertation is completed with a set of future research directions that came out of the cases examined. These research directions can be explored in order to support the next version of the MQACP in terms of the methods deployed, the tools used to assess metadata quality as well as the cost analysis of the MQACP methods...|$|E
