5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. It only perches in trees in order to roost or mate. When alarmed, bleeding-hearts run <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> nearby undergrowth. It is very elusive in its forested habitat, and nothing else is known about its behavior.|$|E
5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> teardrop-shaped glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even {{take the form of}} long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Cuban {{brothers}} and musicians Cesar (Armand Assante) and Nestor Castillo (Antonio Banderas) flee from Havana, Cuba after {{getting into a}} violent dispute with the mobster owners of a club where they performed. Eventually ending up in New York City, the brothers work at menial jobs while attempting to revive their musical careers. At a nightclub where Cesar briefly crashes the act of mambo star Tito Puente, they make new friends and connections, as well as meeting cigarette girl Lanna Lake (Cathy Moriarty), who falls <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> {{a love affair with}} Cesar.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{strategy}} for a defence against German aggression faced political {{as well as}} military problems. In terms of military strategy, the Belgians were unwilling to stake everything on a linear defence of the Belgian–German border, in an extension of the Maginot Line. Such a move would leave the Belgians vulnerable to a German assault in their rear, through an attack on the Netherlands. Such a strategy would also rely on the French to move <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> Belgium and support the garrison there.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that falls on the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that falls on the southern area runs <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the creek or its tributaries. Rain that falls on the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|The western {{third of}} Sicily fell {{relatively}} <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> Muslim hands, but {{conquest of the}} eastern portion of the island was a protracted and haphazard affair. There is little evidence of large-scale campaigns or pitched battles, and warfare was dominated by repeated Arab attacks on Byzantine citadels, coupled with raids (sa'ifa) in the surrounding countryside, aimed at looting or the extraction of tribute and prisoners from the threatened localities. In this type of warfare, the south-eastern third of the island (Val di Noto) suffered comparatively more than the more mountainous and inaccessible north-eastern portion.|$|E
5|$|The genus Equus, which {{includes}} all extant equines, {{is believed to}} have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the Old World, with the similarly aged E. livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern equines (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 mya.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's {{formation}} training was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of the AIF's formation, prior to Gallipoli, {{training}} was rudimentary and performed mainly at unit-level. There were no formal schools and volunteers proceeded straight from recruiting stations to their assigned units, which were still in the process of being established. Upon arrival, in makeshift camps the recruits received basic training in drill and musketry from officers and non-commissioned officers, who were not trained instructors and had been appointed mainly because they had previous service in the part-time forces. Camps were established in every state including at Enoggera (Queensland), Liverpool (New South Wales), Broadmeadows (Victoria), Brighton (Tasmania), Morphettville (South Australia) and Blackboy Hill (Western Australia). In some units this training took place over a period of six to eight weeks, although others—such as the 5th Battalion—spent as little as one day on live firing before departing for overseas. Following the embarkation of the initial force to the Middle East, further training was undertaken in the desert. This was more organised than the training provided in Australia, but was still quite rushed. Individual training was consolidated but progressed <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> collective training at battalion and brigade-level. Training exercises, marches, drill and musketry practices followed but the standard of the exercises was limited and they lacked realism, meaning that commanders did not benefit from handling their troops under battlefield conditions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of war raised Kruger's international profile even further. In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him {{this was a}} fantasy. Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health—he turned 74 the week war broke out—but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured. His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly {{from his office in}} Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram. The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories {{and by the end of}} October were besieging Kimberley, Ladysmith and Mafeking. Soon thereafter, following a serious injury to Joubert, Kruger appointed Louis Botha to be Acting Commandant-General.|$|E

5|$|The {{rights to}} Steig's book were {{originally}} bought by Steven Spielberg in 1991, before {{the founding of}} DreamWorks, when he thought about making a traditionally animated film based on the book. However, John H. Williams convinced him to bring the film to DreamWorks in 1994, the time the studio was founded, and the film was put <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> active development by Jeffrey Katzenberg after the rights were bought by the studio in 1995. Chris Farley was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording about 80%–90% of his dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before he could finish, Mike Myers {{was brought in to}} work for the character, who, after his first recording, decided to record his voice in a Scottish accent. The film was also originally planned to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to recruit Pacific Data Images to help Shrek get its final computer-animated look.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at one minute and 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at one minute and 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove <b>quickly</b> <b>into</b> the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E
