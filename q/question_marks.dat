5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, {{eliminating}} the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E
5|$|Freshman Sam Richardson {{came into}} the game the starter at quarterback, a role he held since the Cyclones' 53–21 win against the Kansas Jayhawks, which made them bowl eligible. Iowa State's leading rusher coming into the game was junior running back James White, who amassed 505 rushing yards during the season. One yard behind White with 504 rushing yards was Shontrelle Johnson, another junior running back. In the {{receiving}} game, Iowa State was led by a trio of senior wide receivers, Aaron Horne, Chris Young, and Josh Lenz, who totaled 39, 38, and 31 receptions respectively. Iowa State's offensive line had a few <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> coming into the game, including at right tackle where sophomore Jacob Gannon had made his first career start in the previous game. In total, Iowa State ranked 80 out of 120 in total offense averaging 364.2 yards per game.|$|E
50|$|In Arabic, {{which is}} also written from right to left, the <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> ⟨⟩ is {{mirrored}} right-to-left from the English <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b> (Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> due to font or text directionality issues.) Hebrew is also written right-to-left, but uses a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> that appears on the page in the same orientation as the English ⟨?⟩.|$|R
50|$|The percontation point (⸮), a {{reversed}} <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> later {{referred to}} as a rhetorical <b>question</b> <b>mark,</b> was proposed by Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of a}} question that does not require an answer—a rhetorical question. Its use died out in the 17th century. This character can be represented using the reversed <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E; another character approximating it is the Arabic <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (؟), U+061F.|$|R
50|$|On January 10, 2007, a fire {{destroyed}} <b>Question</b> <b>Mark's</b> {{house in}} Michigan, destroying {{all of his}} memorabilia and killing the Yorkshire Terrier dogs that he bred as his business.

5|$|In {{the world}} of Chocobo Racing, Magic Stones are {{scattered}} throughout each course, and can {{be picked up by}} the player by driving through them. Magic Stones can also be stolen from opponent players by bumping into another player. The player can then activate the Magic Stone for some special effect. Activating a Haste Stone, for example, gives the character a short speed boost. In some Magic Stones, the power of the stone increases if more than one of the same stone is picked up by the player. Each stone is represented by a corresponding symbol on the racetrack, while stones marked with <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> represent random Magic Stones, which grant the player either a Haste Stone, Fire Stone, Ice Stone, Thunder Stone, Minimize Stone, Reflect Stone, Doom Stone, or Ultima Stone.|$|E
5|$|The mutiny refocused {{attention}} on the long term tension {{over the use of}} Indochinese soldiers, and on the ways in which it could be resolved. The tension could {{be traced back to the}} creation of French Indochina. Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, had been colonised in 1867 and the remaining parts of Vietnam, Tonkin and Annam, the northern and central regions were conquered in 1883. Nominally, only Cochinchina was a colony, while Tonkin, Annam, Cambodia and Laos were protectorates which together comprised French Indochina. The problem centred around the French reliance on native soldiers to maintain colonial control. This need was problematic because Indo-Chinese soldiers were both enforcers of colonial order and colonial subjects. This created constant French concerns about their loyalty. Despite several attempts to deal with the issue, the basic tension between the need for and suspicion of native troops could never be entirely resolved. The need for forces to pacify the countryside was too pressing to do without them. As a result, the tension resurfaced at regular intervals, either due to proposals to improve the position of Indochinese soldiers in the army, or after a mutiny had raised <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> about the loyalty of the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Question</b> <b>marks</b> (?) and {{exclamation marks}} (!) are {{used at the}} end of a clause, and may be {{internal}} to a sentence. Question words generally come at the beginning of a question, obviating the need for Spanish-style inverted <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Arabic and {{languages}} that use Arabic script such as Persian and Urdu, which are written {{from right to}} left, the <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> ؟ is mirrored right-to-left from the English <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b> [...] (Some browsers may display the character in the previous sentence as a forward <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> due to font or text directionality issues).|$|R
2500|$|The <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> [...] (also {{known as}} {{interrogation}} point, query, or eroteme in journalism) is a punctuation mark that indicates an interrogative clause or phrase in many languages.

50|$|As {{a trusted}} {{member of the}} 7th Bombardment Group, First Lieutenant Moon was {{selected}} {{to take part in}} the endurance demonstration flight of the <b>Question</b> <b>Mark,</b> a modified Atlantic-Fokker C-2A. During January 1-7, 1929, Moon piloted one of two aerial refueling aircraft, a Douglas C-1 based out of Van Nuys Airport, and helped refuel the <b>Question</b> <b>Mark</b> as it flew for six days back and forth between San Diego and Van Nuys, California. Moon and his crew refueled the <b>Question</b> <b>Mark</b> sixteen times—two conducted at night. The <b>Question</b> <b>Mark</b> set a world record for endurance.|$|R

25|$|The Angels {{entered the}} 2009 offseason with countless <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> most notably {{if they would}} retain {{pitching}} ace John Lackey and fan favorite Chone Figgins. The answer to both of these questions was no, as Lackey and Figgins signed with Boston and Seattle respectively.|$|E
25|$|The chairmen of both parent companies, John S.

5000|$|Typically, search terms cannot {{end with}} punctuation, {{although}} a separate full stop (a period) can be searched. Also, an ending <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (as in [...] "Why?") {{will cause a}} 2nd search for the <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> separately.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, <b>Question</b> <b>Mark</b> {{returned}} to New York to headline a two-night garage rock festival at the CBGB club. The band lineup featured <b>Question</b> <b>Mark,</b> Fury, Robert Martinez, Keith Hartel on bass and former Pat Benatar/David Johansen band and current E Street Band keyboardist Charlie Giordano.

50|$|The <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> {{function}} is a strictly increasing and continuous, but not absolutely continuous function. The derivative vanishes on the rational numbers. There are several constructions for a measure that, when integrated, yields the <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> function. One such construction is obtained {{by measuring the}} density of the Farey numbers on the real number line. The <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> measure is the prototypical example of what are sometimes referred to as multi-fractal measures.|$|R
25|$|Spanish orthography is the orthography {{used in the}} Spanish language. The {{alphabet}} {{uses the}} Latin script. The spelling is fairly phonemic, especially in comparison to more opaque orthographies like English and Irish, having a relatively consistent mapping of graphemes to phonemes; in other words, the pronunciation of a given Spanish-language word can largely be predicted from its spelling and to a slightly lesser extent vice-versa. Notable features of Spanish punctuation include the lack of the serial comma and the inverted <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> and exclamation points: ¿ ¡.|$|E
25|$|When John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} show's {{producer}} in Baker's last year, the Fourth Doctor {{was the first}} to sport an item of clothing adorned with <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> as a motif, in this case, above the points on his shirt collars. His overall costume was redesigned, changing the colour focus from brown to red. Designer June Hudson later revealed in an interview that Nathan-Turner had even given her permission to remove the scarf altogether if she wanted to. Hudson opted to keep the scarf, as it was such an iconic part of the character.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004 Flew and Gary Habermas, {{his friend}} and {{philosophical}} adversary, took part in and conducted a dialogue on the resurrection at California Polytechnic State University – San Luis Obispo. During a couple of telephone discussions shortly after that dialogue, Flew explained to Habermas that he was considering becoming a theist. While Flew did not change his position at that time, he concluded that certain philosophical and scientific considerations were causing him to do some serious rethinking. He characterized his position as that of atheism standing in tension with several huge <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
50|$|Depending on the context, {{a rhetorical}} {{question}} may be punctuated by a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (?), full stop (.), or exclamation mark (!), but some sources {{argue that it}} is required to use a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> for any <b>question,</b> rhetorical or not.|$|R
