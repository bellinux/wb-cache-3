40|$|Five novel {{cationic}} lipids, {{the polar}} head group {{of which was}} attached to the cholesterol backbone via a tertiary carbamate linker, were synthesized and their physicochemical properties were compared to their transfection efficiencies. Transfection activity of the primary amine analog was highest among the series, while the <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>iodide</b> salt was essentially transfection incompetent. Contrary to DC-Chol, methyl and ethyl carbamoyl derivatives of DC-Chol mediated high levels of transfection in the absence of DOPE. Ionization of the cationic assemblies in 40 mM Tris buffer pH 7. 2 exactly correlated with the competitive nature of the inductive and steric effects of the methyl groups on the aliphatic nitrogen of the lipids’ polar moiety. Interestingly, the pH interaction zone of all lipid dispersions at 25 °C was extended by ± 2 pH units from the pKa, while the pKa of the cationic lipids determined in mixed vesicles composed of 90 % DOPC and cholesterol was approximately 1. 3 to 1. 5 times higher than that of pure cationic assemblies.

40|$|The {{performance}} of dye sensitized nanocrystalline TiO 2 solar cells based on quasi-solid state PAN electrolytes containing {{a series of}} six <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>iodide</b> salts NH 4 I, Eth(4) NI, Prop(4) NI, But(4) NI, Pent(4) NI, Hex(4) NI with different cation sizes has been evaluated. Even though the total ionic conductivity decreases with increasing cation size from NH 4 I to Hex(4) NI, the iodide ion conductivity in the electrolytes increases with cation size. The open circuit photovoltage (V-oc) of the dye sensitized solar cells also increases with cation radius. The efficiency of the DSSCs varies with cation size and exhibits a maximum for Prop(4) NI salt. The short circuit photo current density (J(sc)) follows a similar variation with cation size, suggesting {{a strong correlation between}} the cation size dependence of efficiency and J(sc). The DSSC fabricated with tetrapropylammonium iodide exhibited the maximum efficiency of 4. 30 % with maximum J(sc) of 10. 78 mA cm(- 2) and a V-oc of 0. 746 V. The results have been interpreted on the basis of "the electrolyte effects" where J(sc) is determined essentially by the iodide ion conductivity and "the electrode effects" where the J(sc) and V-oc are determined by the cation adsorption in the dyed TiO 2 electrode and resulting electron dynamics at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface. For DSSCs with small cations, electrolyte effects appear to be dominating and rate determining while for DSSCs with larger cations, electrode effects appear to be dominating and rate determining.

Irradiation of naphthol <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> salt and binol-derivatives (X = OH, NHR, NMe(3) (+), OCOCH(3), and L-proline) at 310 and 360 nm resulted in the photogeneration of the 2, 6 -naphthoquinone- 6 -methide (NQM) and binol quinone methide analogues (BQMs) by a water-mediated excited-state proton transfer (ESPT). The hydration, the mono- and bis-alkylation reactions of morpholine and 2 -ethanethiol, as N and S prototype nucleophiles, by the transient NQM (λ(max) 310, 330 nm) and BQMs (λ(max) 360 nm) were investigated in water by product distribution analysis and laser flash photolysis (LFP). Both the photogeneration and the reactivity of NQM and BQMs exhibited striking differences. BQMs were at least 2 orders of magnitude more reactive than NQM, and they were generated much more efficiently from {{a greater variety of}} photoprecursors including the hydroxymethyl, <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> salt and several binol-amino acids.

Sequence analysis by gel electrophoresis, HPLC, and MS showed that the alkylation occurred at purines, with a preference for guanine. In particular, a BQM was able to alkylate N 7 of guanines resulting in depurination at the oligonucleotide level, and ribose loss at the nucleotide level.

Ever since human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inhibition-related cardiac arrest was proven to be fatal, numerous numbers of data on human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inhibition have been piled up. However, there has been no quantitative study on human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inhibition by <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> derivatives, well-known {{potassium channel}} blockers. Here, we present human ether-à-go-go related gene channel blockade by externally applied <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> derivatives using automated whole-cell patch-clamp recordings as well as ab initio quantum calculations. The inhibitory constants and the relative binding energies for human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inhibition were obtained from <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> with systematically varied head and tail groups, indicating that more hydrophobic <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> have higher affinity blockade while cation-π interactions or size effects are not a deterministic factor for human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inhibition by <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums.</b> Further studies on the effect of <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> on human ether-à-go-go related gene channel inactivation implied that hydrophobic <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammoniums</b> either with a longer tail group or with a bigger head group than tetraethylammonium permeate the cell membrane to easily access the high-affinity internal binding site in human ether-à-go-go related gene channel and exert stronger blockade.
