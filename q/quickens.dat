60|$|Hence {{also the}} New Testament {{is full of}} this, saying, 'If ye be dead with Christ' (Col 2:20). 'If ye be risen with Christ' (3:1). And again, 'He hath <b>quickened</b> us {{together}} with him' (2:13). 'We are <b>quickened</b> together with him.' 'Quickened,' and 'quickened together with him.' The apostle hath words that cannot easily be shifted or evaded. Christ then was <b>quickened</b> when he was raised from the dead. Nor is it proper {{to say that he}} was ever <b>quickened</b> either before or since. This text also concludes that we--to wit, the whole body of God's elect, were also <b>quickened</b> then, and made to live with him together. True, we also are <b>quickened</b> personally by grace the day in the which we are born unto God by the gospel; yet afore that, we are <b>quickened</b> in our Head; <b>quickened</b> when he was raised from the dead, <b>quickened</b> together with him.|$|R

The majority of oak flavoring is imparted in the first few months the wine is in contact with oak, while longer term exposure adds light barrel aeration, which helps precipitate phenolic compounds and <b>quickens</b> the aging process. New World Pinot noir may spend less than a year in oak. Premium Cabernet Sauvignon may spend two years. The very tannic Nebbiolo grape may spend four or more years in oak. High end Rioja producers will sometimes age their wines up to ten years in American oak to get a desired earthy cedar and herbal character.|$|E

50|$|This film's <b>Quickening</b> {{sequences}} have {{a common}} theme, starting with Kane receiving the Immortal sorcerer Nakano's <b>Quickening</b> after beheading him, down to the scene where Connor receives Kane's <b>Quickening.</b> The transfer of energy begins with the deceased Immortal's headless body levitating {{and the surrounding area}} filling with visible electromagnetic energy capable of causing structural damage to nearby objects. The final <b>Quickening</b> was powerful enough to levitate Connor while he was receiving it; reminiscent of the final <b>Quickening</b> in the first film.|$|R

500|$|The two saucers were {{formulated}} to {{be different}} from each other. A steadily decreasing timer that shortens intervals between saucer attacks was employed to keep the player from not shooting asteroids and saucers.

50|$|In 2004, <b>Quicken</b> Loans {{became a}} {{defendant}} in a class action lawsuit.

On March 17, 2011, a federal jury found in favor of <b>Quicken</b> Loans, ending the seven-year-old lawsuit. The decision means that <b>Quicken</b> Loans is not obligated to pay overtime payments to the plaintiffs.|$|R

The dancers dance around a jaitkhamb set up for the occasion, to songs eulogising their spiritual head. The songs reflect a view of nirvana, conveying the spirit of their guru's renunciation and the teachings of saint poets like Kabir, Ramdas and Dadu. Dancers with bent torsos and swinging arms dance, carried away by their devotion. As the rhythm <b>quickens,</b> they perform acrobatics and form human pyramids.|$|E
2500|$|The sketch/sitdown {{comedy series}} {{starring}} Irish comic Dave Allen featured several Who parodies throughout its long run. A prominent example originally aired {{in the early}} 1970s – an Irish country priest is tidying up his church, then quickly becomes aware that the baptismal font (which is roughly cylindrical, with a wide base and a domed top) is following him. As the cleric <b>quickens</b> his pace down the nave, the font charges after him screaming in metallic tones, [...] "Exterminate! Exterminate! Annihilate! Destroy!" [...] The priest ducks behind the pulpit, which then dematerializes (accompanied by the familiar TARDIS sound effects).|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Willson Disher in The Times Literary Supplement of 9 November 1940 was not {{impressed}} {{with either the}} novel or the genre when {{he said in the}} article titled Murder of a Dentist, [...] "Possibly the reader who wants to be puzzled may be the best judge of a detective story. If so Agatha Christie wins another prize, for her new novel should satisfy his demands. But another type of reader will find it dry and colourless." [...] He continued; [...] "The facts are stated in a joyless style of impartial investigation; it <b>quickens</b> into life only when a revolting corpse is discovered. This is characteristic of Christie's school. The 'full horrible details' that bring people to death are accounted of more importance than details which bring people to life." ...|$|E
