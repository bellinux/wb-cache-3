40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods to}} compensate and monitor the disturbance generated by electric <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> considering {{their position in}} different times, in a railway system. For this purpose, first of all, experimental data of Italy traction system is used and its components are modeled. Then, using proposed algorithm a suitable location for a passive filter is determined. Subsequently, considering Speed of <b>traction</b> <b>units,</b> the location of each <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> is predicted and with proposed THD index, created disturbance in each time is determined. Finally, {{in the span of}} 1 minute, proposed index is monitored. It is worth mentioning that the Matlab / Simulink software is used to simulate proposed model...|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the rolling}} stock used by CFM was {{manufactured}} in the USSR and other countries of the Soviet bloc. The most widespread type of <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> is Soviet-built triple section 3TE10M (sometimes only 1 or 2 sections are used). Their use in Moldova was motivated by steep gradients on some portions of the rail network (especially, in the regions with hilly terrains), where additional power was needed to pull heavy freight trains. Other popular types of locomotives are M62 ("Mashka") and 2TE10L. Sometimes, Czech-built shunters ChME3 are used as <b>traction</b> <b>units</b> for local passenger operations.|$|R
50|$|The {{trains are}} made up of 6 {{permanently}} coupled coaches, comprising two identical <b>traction</b> <b>units</b> at each end, with a total length of about 105 m. Each <b>Traction</b> <b>Unit</b> consists of two identical motor cars and a trailer with the driver's cab. All the coaches are intercommunicating. The traction voltage can be 750 V or 1500 V to comply with the different voltages and feeding systems in use on Milan Metro lines (fourth rail on M1, catenary on M2 and M3).Trains have a total of 24 doors per side and are equipped with surveillance cameras and LCD screens.|$|R
