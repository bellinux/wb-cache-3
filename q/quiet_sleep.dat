25|$|A {{withdrawal}} syndrome {{is seen in}} about 20% of pediatric intensive care unit children after infusions with benzodiazepines or opioids. The likelihood of having the syndrome correlates with total infusion duration and dose, although duration {{is thought to be}} more important. Treatment for withdrawal usually involves weaning over a 3- to 21-day period if the infusion lasted for more than a week. Symptoms include tremors, agitation, sleeplessness, inconsolable crying, diarrhea and sweating. In total, over fifty withdrawal symptoms are listed in this review article. Environmental measures aimed at easing the symptoms of neonates with severe abstinence syndrome had little impact, but providing a <b>quiet</b> <b>sleep</b> environment helped in mild cases.|$|E

Do not suppose, because I write figuratively, that I am not sorry for him. He understands nothing; he remembers nothing; he has my prayers.|$|R

The sleep cycle in babies of undernourished mothers showed disorganisation during active rapid eye movement (REM) <b>sleep</b> and <b>quiet</b> nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The sleep disorganisation was more pronounced during <b>quiet</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> when frequent phasic activity and ocular movements were registered, thereby leading to {{a significant increase in}} the content of intermediate sleep. Furthermore, the duration of total sleep cycle and its components, active REM and <b>quiet</b> NREM <b>sleep,</b> were significantly shortened...|$|R

5000|$|No warning: Typically, {{there is}} no {{physiological}} forewarning that indicates a sleepwalking episode is about to occur. There is no twitching, no increase in heart rate or breathing (directly preceding to the episode), and no significant variations in brain waves; there is just <b>quiet,</b> slow-wave <b>sleep</b> until abrupt central nervous system (CNS) arousal prompts the heart rate to accelerate and the sleepwalking begins.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Ah!' There was a faintness {{and oppression}} {{in the sound}} which made Lady Merrifield think the girl {{ought not to be}} left, and before long, {{sickness}} came on.

5000|$|As a singer, {{his biggest}} chart was his self-penned [...] "Saturday Morning Confusion", a top 25 country hit and No. 28 pop {{hit in the}} early fall of 1971.

60|$|Margaret {{heard his}} sigh and was <b>quiet.</b> Now <b>sleep</b> {{smoothed}} out {{the marks of}} strain and fatigue, Jimmy's look was boyishly calm. He moved her to pity, but he moved her to trust. Margaret was not a raw, romantic girl; she knew the Canadian cities and she had studied men. If Jimmy had, indeed, shot the agent, a strange blunder accounted for his doing so, but Margaret doubted. She had some grounds to think the shot another's. Then she got up quietly and carried off the plates.|$|R

60|$|To {{tell him}} she was Cousin Annaple, Billy's mamma, had no effect; {{he did not seem}} able to understand, and she could only retire--nurse being thus {{convinced}} that to let him see another stranger to-night would only do further harm.

6000|$|I did not {{see much}} of Moore that day. The fact is that I slept a good deal, and Moore was mysteriously engaged with Gumbo.

60|$|Tarzan {{had always}} {{found that it}} stood him in good stead to leave with natives the {{impression}} that he was to some extent possessed of more or less miraculous powers.
