Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a chance to try to deal with in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't {{try to figure out what}} the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} former as they sauntered along {{the bank of the}} river, [...] "the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I must settle at once is, are we two to work by ourselves, or are we to join with our late friends, and work in company?" ...|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to try and build up as much money as possible, while trying to avoid being in control when the time is up. The more <b>{{question}}s</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> answer in a row, the more money they're worth. The first question is worth £50, the second £100, the third £150, the fourth £200, and the fifth and every subsequent question after that is worth £300. After you get a question right, you get the choice of answering another question or pass it to another contestant by saying their name, but it can only be passed after Rory says that the answer is correct.|$|E

I want to thank you all for your support throughout the years. It has been an amazing journey. I will still continue to write all types of music including Heavy Fucking Metal. I still love Light From Above and Post Mortem. I am a musician and I put my heart into everything that I create. It doesn't end here for me and I hope most of you will come along with me for the ride. Right now i'm working on my solo Suspense ep where I write/produce/engineer and perform electronic dance music with a twist of my live drums.

5000|$|Connell was criticised in some {{quarters}} for being economical with the truth in {{his use of the}} concept of mental reservation to inadequately answer questions truthfully about his knowledge of the abusive activities of priests under his control. Connell explained the concept of mental reservation to the Commission in the following way: [...] "Well, the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie. On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be - permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So, mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying." ...|$|E

5000|$|Doctor Who {{explores the}} idea of the dream {{argument}} many times. In the ninth episode of series four [...] "Forest of the Dead", the Doctor's companion Donna is [...] "saved" [...] into the Library's hardrive and begins to live out an imaginary and fake reality; unaware that the reality she is living is an illusion until a disfigured woman who had been killed in the [...] "real" [...] world and respectively submitted into the hard drive convinces her that her life is not real. In the seventh episode of series five [...] "Amy's Choice" [...] the two companions of the Doctor, Amy and Rory Pond, have to decide between two realities; one where they are happily married and the other where they are still travelling with the Doctor, {{and the only way to}} escape is to kill yourself in the fake reality. Since they are not sure which one is fake and which is real, they are hesitant to choose. In the Christmas special of 2014 Last Christmas, this concept is once again used where an alien species latches onto your brain to devour it, but makes you dream so you are unaware while they digest. Similar to Inception, it explores the ideas of shared dreaming and the main characters question whether they're awake or still in a dream. The Doctor points out there are multiple ways to determine the answer, such as asking <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should know the answer to but don't, having different people read the same book and discover that the text is different, or even the appearance of fictional characters, such as Santa Claus.|$|E
