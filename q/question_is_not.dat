25|$|Although a {{polymorphism}} can {{be controlled}} by alleles at a single locus (e.g. human ABO blood groups), the more complex forms are controlled by supergenes consisting of several tightly linked genes on a single chromosome.

There is a long-standing debate as to how this situation could have arisen, and the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> yet resolved.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979–80, {{challenging}} each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.|$|E
25|$|The alcohol {{dependence}} syndrome {{was seen as}} a cluster of seven elements that concur. It was argued that not all elements may be present in every case, but the picture is sufficiently regular and coherent to permit clinical recognition. The syndrome was also considered to exist in degrees of severity rather than as a categorical absolute. Thus, the proper <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> ‘whether a person is dependent on alcohol’, but ‘how far along the path of dependence has a person progressed’.|$|E

OCILLA {{also includes a}} counternotification provision that offers OSPs a safe harbor from liability to their users when users claim that the material in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> in fact, infringing. OCILLA also facilitates issuing of subpoenas against OSPs to provide their users' identity.|$|E

25|$|Abhinavagupta {{remained}} unmarried all his life, we do however {{know him}} to be an adept of Kaula and as such, used his energy (ojas, or internally sublimated semen) as a vital force, {{a constant source of}} shakti to power the spiritual nervous system he outlined in his works. This system involves ritual union between Purusha as (Shiva) and shakti, yet this union is essentially non-physical and universal, and thus for a master such as Abhinavagupta, he was always in communion with Shiva-Shakti. We can only speculate about whether he was physically chaste, and either answer to this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very meaningful in the context of his life and teachings. Abhinavagupta parallels Shiva as both ascetic and enjoyer.|$|E
25|$|In a {{complete}} binary tree, a node's breadth-index (i − (2d − 1)) {{can be used}} as traversal instructions from the root. Reading bitwise from left to right, starting at bit d − 1, where d is the node's distance from the root (d = ⌊log2(i+1)⌋) and the node in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the root itself (d > 0). When the breadth-index is masked at bit d − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively. The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more. The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself. There is a time-space trade-off between iterating {{a complete}} binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s.|$|E

500|$|We cannot {{conceal the}} fact that the whole German {{question}} is a simple alternative between Prussia and Austria. In these states, German life has its positive and negative poles—in the former, all the interests [...] are national and reformative, in the latter, all that are dynastic and destructive. The German <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a constitutional question but a question of power; and the Prussian monarchy is now wholly German, while that of Austria cannot be.|$|E
500|$|We {{are also}} of opinion {{that as the}} right of the {{plaintiff}} to sue was given by, and is dependent upon, the statute, the statute of limitations is a bar to the action. By the act of 1845, the actions thereby authorized are to be brought and maintained ‘in the same time’ as if brought by citizens of the state. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether an Indian title can be barred by adverse possession, or by state statutes of limitation. The point is that the plaintiff cannot invoke the special remedy given by the statute, without being bound by the conditions upon which it is given.|$|E
500|$|Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic {{dialogue}} after Aspasia (though neither survives {{except in}} fragments). Our major sources for Aeschines Socraticus' Aspasia are Athenaeus, Plutarch, and Cicero. In the dialogue, Socrates recommends that Callias send his son Hipponicus to Aspasia for instructions. When Callias recoils {{at the notion}} of a female teacher, Socrates notes that Aspasia had favorably influenced Pericles and, after his death, Lysicles. In a section of the dialogue, preserved in Latin by Cicero, Aspasia figures as a [...] "female Socrates", counseling first Xenophon's wife and then Xenophon himself (the Xenophon in <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the famous historian) about acquiring virtue through self-knowledge. Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira. According to Kahn, every single episode in Aeschines' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, in a case involving a treaty concluded with the Cherokee Indians, the Supreme Court declared [...] "It need hardly be said that a treaty cannot change the Constitution or be held valid if it be in violation of that instrument. This results from the nature and fundamental principles of our government. The effect of treaties and acts of Congress, when in conflict, is not settled by the Constitution. But the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> involved in any doubt as to its proper solution.

500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E
500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber.
