500|$|Apart {{from the}} general {{question}} of the [...] "hard problem" [...] of consciousness, roughly speaking, {{the question of how}} mental experience arises from a physical basis, a more specialized <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> square the subjective notion that we are in control of our decisions (at least in some small measure) with the customary view of causality that subsequent events are caused by prior events. The topic of free will is the philosophical and scientific examination of this conundrum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first issue}} was {{published}} October 10, 1835, {{days after the}} Texas Revolution began. [...] By this time, the owners had changed the name to Telegraph and Texas Register. [...] In an editorial, the owners explained that the paper's original name had been chosen when [...] "the engrossing object was the accumulating of wealth and consequent aggrandizement of the country. [...] Since that time affairs have assumed an entirely different aspect, and the all-absorbing <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> protect ourselves, and what we already possess." [...] The newspaper was therefore renamed to reflect their new goal of serving as [...] "a faithful register of passing events".|$|E
2500|$|Despite these advances, {{there are}} certain skills to which humans will be better suited than {{machines}} {{for some time to}} come and the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the [...] "man-robot merger". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programmes and trying to promote a safe and flexible co-operation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic [...] "human-robot collaboration".|$|E
30|$|One {{of the key}} {{consequent}} <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{select and}} measure appropriate business key performance indicators (KPI) (e.g., the contribution of embedded software in the product sales and export).|$|R
60|$|The main <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{raise the}} {{necessary}} money {{with which to}} purchase the land, and this had not been answered when the party broke up at a late hour.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> {{whether there}} was an {{unlawful}} conspiracy, and the second <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> measure the damages for any loss, given the difficulty of knowing how many people might have attended different films.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{with the}} Bishop. The {{difficult}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> follow up our advantage. How {{are you to}} keep yourself in sight of him?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{that you}} have done your supper," [...] one of the {{officers}} said, [...] "I suppose the next thing you want is some clothes. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The vital <b>{{question}}</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> secure {{control for}} the Heartland. This question may seem pointless, since in 1904 the Russian Empire had ruled most of the area from the Volga to Eastern Siberia for centuries. But throughout the nineteenth century: ...|$|R
60|$|But the <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do this. Indeed, {{there was}} only one way, to hang over the bend and {{discover}} what lay below. We read each other's thought without the need of words, and I made a motion as though I would start.|$|R
50|$|The trust {{needed to}} {{dissolve}} {{in such a}} way that no manufacturer had a monopoly on any type of tobacco product. Investors, holding millions of dollars of securities, also needed to be considered. A large <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> distribute trademarks and brands between the resulting companies.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Augusta at length, [...] "it seems that's {{the only}} thing to be done; but the <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do it? I can only suggest, Mr. Meeson, that the will should be tattooed on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; yes, {{it must be}} so," [...] Matt insisted. [...] "But now the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> reach him, {{and make}} some {{beginning}} of the end with him. I suppose it's the suspense and the uncertainty that is breaking your sister down?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that {{is neither}} here nor there, Henshaw," [...] said his wife. [...] "The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> receive Mr. Staniford--that's his name--when he comes. How {{are we to}} regard him? He's coming here to see Lydia, and she thinks he's coming to propose." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{examining}} many prints, {{the frequency}} with which some peculiar pattern was found to characterise members of the same family convinced me of the reality of an hereditary tendency. The <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> submit the belief to numerical tests; particular kinships had to be selected, and methods of discussion devised.|$|R
60|$|The sight filled {{us with an}} unreasoning joy. If only {{we could}} get it, there was food in plenty. But the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> do so. The beasts were fully six hundred yards off, a very long shot, and one not to be {{depended}} on when our lives hung on the results.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure enough, doctor, {{the will}} {{is in the}} 'priest's chamber.' The only <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>are</b> we <b>to</b> find it, and <b>how</b> <b>are</b> we <b>to</b> get into it when we do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even so, sir," [...] {{added the}} tutor. [...] "Much is {{explained}} that I never before understood. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with him}} under this fresh light. I will, so please your honour, assemble the family this very night, and expound to them that such superstitions are contrary to the very word of Scripture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{stuck to}} that, and I expect {{it is all}} right; these {{cartridges}} are quite water-tight. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{get you out of}} their line of sight." [...] "The best plan will be for me to roll over and over," [...] Sankey said. [...] "I expect it will hurt a bit, but that is no odds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} quite out of the question, in {{daylight}} at any rate, Geoffrey. I do not suppose she ever goes beyond the terrace by the house.

The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get a letter into her hands." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{challenges}} {{have been brought}} to the fore in dealing with routing in emerging broadband multiservice networks. Although significant efforts have been made to develop mathematical models [10, 9, 4, 2] and heuristic algorithms [7, 11] to enable quality of service (QoS) guarantees to users, many open questions remain. Among these <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with, and make the most of, traffic and networ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that utilization of autonomous software agents in computational Grids may deliver the needed functionality to speed-up Grid adoption. I our recent work we have outlined an approach in which agent teams facilitate Grid resource brokering and management. One of the interesting <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> manage trust in such a system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} outline our proposed solution...|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes {{he thought}} {{that if he could}} only make a quarrel with her it might help him; but the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> quarrel with a young woman who had such treasures of concession. [...] "I suppose you think the effort is all on your side!" [...] he was reduced to exclaiming. [...] "Don't you believe that I have my own effort to make?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We {{could only}} be {{attacked}} on one side here,” he said. “And though we could not cut down the trees, we might make a defence with creepers twined in and out among the trunks that would be quite sufficient against a sudden attack; and with such a store of muskets as we have got we might keep a whole tribe at bay. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get the casks and things up here.” ...|$|E
60|$|I {{call it a}} {{campaign}} rather than a war. Though it lasted 200 years and more, {{it seems to me}} (it will, I think, seem to you) {{if you look at the}} maps, as but one campaign: I had almost said, one battle. There is but one problem to be solved; and therefore the operations of our race take a sort of unity. The <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take Rome, and keep it, by destroying the Roman Empire.|$|E
6000|$|... § I. We {{have seen}} in the last section how our means of {{vertical}} support may, for the sake of economy both of space and material, be gathered into piers or shafts, and directed to the sustaining of particular points. The next <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> connect these points or tops of shafts with each other, so as to be able to lay on them a continuous roof. This the reader, as before, is to favor me by finding out for himself, under these following conditions.|$|E
6000|$|After her day's work Mrs. Sandys was now so {{listless}} that, had not Tommy interfered, Elspeth {{would have}} been a backward child. Reddy had been able to walk from the first day, and so of course had he, but this little slow-coach's legs wobbled at the joints, like the blade of a knife without a spring. The <b>question</b> of <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> <b>How</b> <b>to</b> keep her on end? ...|$|R
40|$|Lens {{centering}} is a {{very traditional}} area. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make a soph isticated robot? It has to detect the centering errors and to adjust the lenses in accordance to a well defined axis. There are four ideas for lens centering: adjustment by joining, by circular milling, by fast and slow turning...|$|R
50|$|His {{daughter}} Judith {{later said}} that they were lucky to be reunited, but that her father spoke of nothing but the war, Palestine, and Zionism; for him, the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cope with <b>how</b> humanity had become so debased, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> continue to live meaningfully after mankind proved how deep it could sink: the problem was not so much guilt but rather the source of this evil.|$|R
6000|$|As to removal {{into the}} House of Lords, I think the reasons against [...] it of general {{application}} are conclusive. At least I cannot see my [...] way {{in regard to}} them. But at any rate {{it is obvious that}} such a [...] step is quite inapplicable to the circumstances created by the [...] present difficulty. It is really most kind of the Queen to testify [...] such an interest, and the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> answer her. You would [...] do this better and perhaps more easily than I.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thus far: to do {{as little}} harm as may be--to be of some use at home--and to make turnips grow in the upland at Inglewood, I have some vague fancy to see foreign parts, {{especially}} now they are all in such a row--it would be such fun--but I suppose you would not trust me there now. Here I am for you {{to do as}} you please with me--a gracious permission, considering that you did not want it. Only the first practical <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get this money from Jem to Clara. I should like to call on her, but I suppose that would hardly be according to the proprieties.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In truth, Sir Gervaise," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "this {{seems to}} be a right serious matter, and you have done wisely in informing me of what you have seen. Assuredly there is {{mischief}} of some sort in the wind. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{get to the bottom of}} it. Of course, the grand master might order the arrest of this Greek and of the prison officer, but you may be sure that neither would commit himself unless torture were applied; and I, for one, have no belief in what any man says under such circumstances. The most honest man may own himself a traitor when racked with torture, and may denounce innocent men. It is at best a clumsy device. What think you of the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The first <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{dispose of}} the body. The impulse of the moment was to bury her at once in the pit between the engine-house and waterfall; but {{it struck me that}} I should not have time.

60|$|Upon its further bank we took counsel, for now we {{had entered}} the {{territory}} of the Fung, and were {{face to face with the}} real dangers of our journey. Fifty miles or so away rose the fortress of Mur, but, as I explained to my companions, the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> pass those fifty miles in safety. Shadrach was called to our conference, and at my request set out the facts.|$|R
30|$|Although the self-organized {{methodology}} for PKI deployment {{has been extensively}} analyzed [21 – 23], there <b>are</b> still open <b>questions</b> that needs further research. One of this pending <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> encourage node's participation in the tasks related to certification issuance or certification exchange. Since many resources are limited in MANETs the cooperation issue is a major issue when dealing with many node tasks, and PKI management {{is one of the}} crucial ones.|$|R
