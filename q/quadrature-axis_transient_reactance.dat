40|$|Problem statement: This study {{presented}} an alternative procedure for the starting of large Inductions Motors (IM) in isolated generation systems. Approach: In isolated generation systems on stand-by or base load, the starting of the IM provoked sags frequently beyond {{the ability of}} the other consumers in the plant to stand. Manufacturers' solutions always recommend a supersized generator to decrease <b>transient</b> <b>reactance</b> and achieve smaller sags. These calculation procedures were based on the theory presented by Beeman (1955). Instead of supersizing the generator, a good but expensive solution, the present authors had undertaken research into how to improve the Synchronous Generators (SG's) capacity to stand the start of IM without exceeding the field and armature temperature limits and with small sags. Results: The method utilized consisted of decreasing the response time of excitation, thus increasing Ceiling Voltage (CV). The advantage of this method besides leading to a reduction in the investment involved permits retrofitting in electrical plants already installed. Tests on updated industrial equipment whose CV of a 250 kVA SG was increased from 2. 7 - 5. 4 were presented with their respective oscilographic records which show a reduction in sag from 40 - 34 %. With this solution was possible to start a 75 HP IM without supersize the SG. Conclusion: Computational simulations in MATLAB are also given and were compared with experimental results to validate the simulations. Models in the frequency and time domains are discussed...|$|R

Fast response exciters interfere in the first swing, making the classical model not adequate for modeling the generator;In the research conducted for this dissertation, an energy function is obtained to incorporate the effect of exciter in the first swing. The Unstable Equilibrium Points (UEPs) are obtained {{in the space of}} rotor angles, direct and quadrature axis internal voltages, and the field voltages;The philosophy of approach has been to model the first swing phenomenon, which is an inertial transient, as affected by the exciter, rather than trying to duplicate time solution. It is assumed that the machine flux does not change abruptly after removal of the disturbance and its variation can be approximated by a constant (average value between clearing time and UEP). Based on this assumption, an energy function has been derived which is simple and {{is similar to that of}} classical model. UEPs are obtained using a variation of Newton-Raphson technique. Several other approaches to deriving energy function are investigated and the difficulties associated with them are mentioned;This procedure has been simulated on several test power networks for a variety of test conditions.

40|$|Technical {{analyses}} of several recent power blackouts {{revealed that a}} group of generators going out-of-step {{with the rest of the}} power system is often a precursor of a complete system collapse. Out-of-step protection is designed to assess the stability of the evolving swing after a disturbance and take control action accordingly. However, the settings of out-of-step relays are found to be unsatisfactory due to the fact that the electromechanical swings that occurred during relay commissioning are different in practice. These concerns motivated the development of a novel approach to recalculate the out-of-step protection settings to suit the prevalent operating condition. With phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology, it is possible to adjust the setting of out-of-step relay in real-time. The setting of out-of-step relay is primarily determined by three dynamic parameters: direct axis <b>transient</b> <b>reactance,</b> quadrature axis speed voltage and generator inertia. In a complex power network, these parameters are the dynamic parameters of an equivalent model of a coherent group of generators. Hence, it is essential to identify the coherent group of generators and estimate the dynamic model parameters of each generator in the system first in order to form the dynamic model equivalent in the system. The work presented in this thesis develops a measurement-based technique to identify the coherent areas of power system network by analysing the measured data obtained from the system. The method is based on multivariate analysis of the signals, using independent component analysis (ICA). Also, a technique for estimating the dynamic model parameters of the generators in the system has been developed.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the stability of}} diode bridge rectifier-loaded synchronous generators characterized by large values of synchronous, <b>transient</b> and subtransient <b>reactances</b> in the d- and q-axis, {{with the possibility of}} connecting a battery-bank. The synchronous reactances are in the range 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu. The electrical system studied is installed in two tug-ships using two different types of generators, with different ranges of generator reactances and performance. One of the tugships studied uses generators with a capacity of 3333 kVA, has synchronous reactances is the lower layer of 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu and is characterized as stable during operation. The other ship uses generators with a capacity of 1940 kVA, has synchronous reactances is the upper layer of 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu and is characterized as unstable during operation. The observed oscillations in this ship have a frequency of approximately 2 Hz. The diesel-electric, variable speed propulsion DC-system used on the two ships is delivered by Siemens. The synchronous generators deliver power to a dc-bus through six-pulse diode bridge rectifiers. The main motors and thrusters are supplied by the dc-bus through inverters, and a battery can be attached to the dc-bus for redundancy. The object of this thesis is to find the reason why rectifier-loaded synchronous generators with high reactances become unstable. The same system was under study for a specialization project conducted at the Department of Electrical Power Engineering during the fall of 2014. The main findings in this project are included in the present thesis, where simulations indicate that the studied generators become unstable when the gain of the voltage regulator is increased, and no rectifier is included in the model. This happens faster for the 1940 kVA generator than for the 3333 kVA generator, and when reactive power is consumed. A literature study of articles and other work concerning the stability of similar systems is also conducted. It is in literature found that local mode problems often is associated with rotor angle oscillations, and usually has a frequency of 0. 7 - 2 Hz. Stability criteria is found concerning diode bridge rectifier-loaded synchronous The stability criteria found have requirements for the synchronous and <b>transient</b> <b>reactance,</b> but not for the subtransient reactance. It is claimed that small-frequency oscillations starts in the rectifier causing instability of rectifier-loaded synchronous generators. It is also found a criterion saying that stability is easier achieved by adding a short-circuited q-axis winding on the rotor. The work of the specialization project is continued, and a rectifier is added to the model established in DIgSILENT PowerFactory in the fall of 2014. The battery is modeled as a constant DC-voltage source, and the rectifier is modeled as a PWM rectifier with no modulation and a firing angle set to zero. The generator stability is studied when the gain of the voltage regulator is increased from 50 - 500. The simulation is made for both producing and consuming reactive power, both cases of which the generator produces active power. The gain directly affects the nature of the linearization constant K 5 making it negative resulting in a negative feedback when the external impedances is high. The hypothesis is that this also happens when the internal reactances in the generator is high. This is shown through simulations to be true. It was expected that the 1940 kVA generator reaches instability faster than the 3333 kVA generator, as was the result in the specialization project, but this was not the case. It is believed that the rectifier chosen does not imitate the real system well enough. By using the parameters of the 3333 kVA and 1940 kVA generators, as well as knowledge of the ship components, simplified models are established in the simulation tool MatLab/SimPowerSystems. The battery in MatLab/SimPowerSystems is modeled as an infinitely large capacitor and a series resistance, and the rectifier is a diode-bridge rectifier. A sensitivity analysis for parameter values is conducted, by varying parameter values of the main components such as the synchronous generator, battery, rectifier and voltage regulator, and the stability is studied. The impact of the presence of the main components on the stability is studied as well. Neither of the criteria found in Teil 1 and siemens has requirements for the subtransient reactance, and the impact of the subtransient reactance on the stability is studied through sensitivity analysis. Different load-situations are simulated and generator stability is examined. The main phenomena observed on the ship are successfully recreated through simulations, and the model established in the simulation tool is verified due to this. It is through simulations found that the presence of the diode-bridge rectifier is crucial to detect stability problems, and that the load-situation impacts the stability. When the 1940 kVA generator supplies a load of 1. 9 MVA, it becomes stable, but is unstable during no-load and for all other loads less than 1. 9 MVA. It is also found that the <b>transient</b> and subtransient <b>reactances</b> play an equally important role as the synchronous reactances when it comes to generator stability in this context. The sensitivity analysis conducted is used as a basis for the development of stability limits. The results found through simulations are compared with stability criterions and theories presented in articles found in the literature study concerning the same problems as addressed in this thesis. Stability criteria are found for the 1940 kVA generator with emphasis on the <b>transient</b> and subtransient <b>reactance.</b> By combining the stability criterion for the <b>transient</b> <b>reactances</b> obtained in this thesis with equations found in literature, it is found that stability can be achieved by adding a short-circuited q-axis winding to the generator rotor. Recommendations for further work is to replace the PWM rectifier with a diode-bridge rectifier in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory model and redo the varying of the gain in the voltage regulator to study the stability of the 3333 kVA and 1940 kVA generators. It is also suggested that the interaction between the synchronous generator and diode-bridge rectifier is further investigated. Last, but not least should simulation be conducted, where a short-circuited q-axis winding is added to the generator rotor, to verify the results found in this thesis from the stability criteria obtained...|$|R
40|$|Capítulos en librosThis paper {{analyzes}} the dynamic response of wind power generators {{in case of}} voltage dips. When a fault occurs in the network, a voltage dip {{is applied to the}} wind power generator common coupling point. Wind power generators are equipped with minimum voltage protections that can trip the unit in case of a long voltage dip to protect both the machine and the power system. If wind power generators are connected to the transmission network, a fault in it may result in voltage dip applied to many wind power generators. A large amount of wind power generation can be tripped if the dip is long enough, leading to system collapse. The capability of wind power generators to withstand voltage dips is a key feature of them since it is currently determining the maximum admissible wind power generation in systems with high wind penetration. The response of wind power generators to voltage dips depends on the technology of the electromechanical energy conversion device. Three technologies are mainly used and will be analyzed and compared in this paper: squirrel cage induction generators, doubly fed induction generators and multi-pole synchronous generators. The fundamental response of the generators will be obtained {{as the basis for the}} design of protection schemes. Despite their limitations, wind power generators based on squirrel cage induction machines are widely used. A voltage dip results in a reduction of the electromagnetic torque and in a subsequent rotor acceleration. Depending on the voltage dip duration the machine may either come back to the original operating point or lose stability. During the fault and the deceleration process the machines consumes reactive current that it is limited by the <b>transient</b> <b>reactance</b> and the equivalent external impedance. Doubly fed induction generators are the most widespread electromechanical energy conversion devices in wind power generation due their speed regulating capability that allows them to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. In addition, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of doubly fed induction generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link and the overcurrents in the rotor converter. In addition, the doubly fed induction machine only consumes reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages and rotor converter currents can be reduced with a crowbar system connected to the machine rotor. Wind power generators based on multi-pole synchronous generators have the advantage that do not require a gear box. Multi-pole synchronous generators equipped with voltage source power electronic converters have speed regulating capability to be able to operate in the optimal operating point of the wind turbine. As in doubly fed induction generator, the network side power electronic converter provides them continuous reactive power compensation capability. The response of multipolesynchronous generators in case of voltage dips is limited by the overvoltages in the dc link. In addition, multipole synchronous generators do not draw reactive power during the voltage dip. Dc link overvoltages can be reduced connecting a crowbar system in the dc link. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Modeling of {{wind farms}} to {{determine}} their short circuit contribution in response to faults is {{a crucial part of}} system impact studies performed by power utilities. Short circuit calculations are necessary to determine protective relay settings, equipment ratings and to provide data for protection coordination. The plethora of different factors that influence the response of wind farms to short circuits makes short circuit modeling of wind farms an interesting, complex, and challenging task. Low voltage ride through (LVRT) requirements make it necessary for the latest generation of wind generators to be capable of providing reactive power support without disconnecting from the grid during and after voltage sags. If the wind generator must stay connected to the grid, a facility has to be provided to by-pass the high rotor current that occurs during voltage sags and prevent damage of the rotor side power electronic circuits. This is done through crowbar circuits which are of two types, namely active and passive crowbars, based on the power electronic device used in the crowbar triggering circuit. Power electronics-based converters and controls have {{become an integral part of}} wind generator systems like the Type 3 doubly fed induction generator based wind generators. The proprietary nature of the design of these power electronics makes it difficult to obtain the necessary information from the manufacturer to model them accurately. Also, the use of power electronic controllers has led to phenomena such as sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI) in series compensated Type 3 wind farms which are characterized by non-fundamental frequency oscillations. SSCI affects fault current magnitude significantly and is a crucial factor that cannot be ignored while modeling series compensated Type 3 wind farms. These factors have led to disagreement and inconsistencies about which techniques are appropriate for short circuit modeling of wind farms. Fundamental frequency models like voltage behind <b>transient</b> <b>reactance</b> model are incapable of representing the majority of critical wind generator fault characteristics such as sub-synchronous interactions. The Detailed time domain models, though accurate, demand high levels of computation and modeling expertise. Voltage dependent current source modeling based on look up tables are not stand-alone models and provide only a black-box type of solution. The short circuit modeling methodology developed in this research work for representing a series compensated Type 3 wind farm is based on the generalized averaging theory, where the system variables are represented as time varying Fourier coefficients known as dynamic phasors. The modeling technique is also known as dynamic phasor modeling. The Type 3 wind generator has become the most popular type of wind generator, making it an ideal candidate for such a modeling method to be developed. The dynamic phasor model provides a generic model and achieves a middle ground between the conventional electromechanical models and the cumbersome electromagnetic time domain models. The essence of this scheme to model a periodically driven system, such as power converter circuits, is to retain only particular Fourier coefficients based on the behavior of interest of the system under study making it computationally efficient and inclusive of the required frequency components, even if non-fundamental in nature. The capability to model non-fundamental frequency components is critical for representing sub-synchronous interactions. A 450 MW Type 3 wind farm consisting of 150 generator units was modeled using the proposed approach. The method is shown to be highly accurate for representing faults at the point of interconnection of the wind farm to the grid for balanced and unbalanced faults as well as for non-fundamental frequency components present in fault currents during sub-synchronous interactions. Further, the model is shown to be accurate also for different degrees of transmission line compensation and different transformer configurations used in the test system...|$|R
30|$|EPFA holds a {{constant}} value during normal operating conditions, {{as the system}} frequency and rotating frame frequencies are equal. During fault conditions in a transmission line, this relation gets violated and EPFA undergoes variation, especially when measured at generator terminals. This can be justified as follows; during transmission line fault condition, the topology of the three-phase system gets altered and the total reactance seen by the generator changes. <b>Transient</b> and sub-transient <b>reactances</b> play their respective roles within the synchronous generator followed by the contingency. Line current waveform distortion resulting from fault generates the harmonic frequencies in the current. As the fault current has to flow from generator to fault location through the transmission line, harmonic voltages get developed due to line impedances. These voltage and current harmonics along with change in overall system reactances trigger variations in the power factor angle at generator terminals (ϕ) and hence in EPFA (Φeq). It can be observed from the case studies (as illustrated {{in the following section}} of this paper) that frequencies related to EPFA variation have hidden fault information. These variations are analysed in frequency domain and the coefficients acquired are utilized in this paper for real time fault monitoring.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} and economical constraints, {{it is difficult}} to build new power lines and to reinforce the existing ones. The continued growth in demand for electric power must therefore to a great extent be met by increased loading of available lines. A consequence of this is reduction of power system damping, leading to a risk of poorly damped power oscillations between generators. This thesis proposes the use of controlled active and reactive power to increase damping of such electro-mechanical oscillations. The focus of this thesis is a FACTS device known as the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). With its unique capability to control simultaneously real and reactive power flows on a transmission line as well as to regulate voltage at the bus where it is connected, this device creates a tremendous quality impact on power system stability. These features turn out to be even more significant because UPFC can allow loading of the transmission lines close to their thermal limits, forcing the power to flow through the desired paths. This providdes the power system operators much needed flexibility in order to satisfy the demands. A power system with UPFC is highly nonlinear. The most efficient control method for such a system is to use nonlinear control techniques to achieve system oscillation damping. The nonlinear control methods are independent of system operating conditions. Advanced nonlinear control techniques generally require a system being represented by purely differential equations whereas a power system is normally represented by a set of differential and algebraic equations. In this thesis, a new method to generate a dynamic modeling for power network is introduced such that the entire power system with UPFC can be represented by purely differential equation. This representation helps us to convert the nonlinear power system equations into standard parametric feedback form. Once the standard form is achieved, conventional and advanced nonlinear control techniques can be easily implemented. A comprehensive approach to the design of UPFC controllers (AC voltage control, DC voltage control and damping control) is presented. The damping controller is designed using nonlinear control technique by defining an appropriate Lyapunov function. The analytical expression of the nonlinear control law for the UPFC is obtained using back stepping method. Then, combining the nonlinear control strategy with the linear one for the other variables, a complete linear and nonlinear stabilizing controller is developed. Finally, an adaptive method for estimating the uncertain parameters is derived. This relaxes the need for approximating the uncertain parameters like damping coefficient, <b>transient</b> synchronous <b>reactance</b> etc., which are difficult to be measured precisely. The developed controller provides robust dynamic performance under wide variations in loading condition and system parameters, and provides a significant improvement in dynamic performance in terms of peak deviations. The proposed controller is tested on different multi-machine power systems and found to be more effective than existing ones...|$|R
