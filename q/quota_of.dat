5|$|In {{the initial}} {{call to arms}} issued in 1861, Indiana was {{assigned}} a <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> 7,500 men—a tenth of the amount called—to join the Union Army in putting down the rebellion. So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 {{lost their lives in}} the conflict and over 50,000 more were wounded.|$|E

Meat and other {{products}} from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within Greenland, but export is illegal. Iceland and Norway are not bound by the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling because both countries filed objections to it.|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{nutrient}} limitation of phytoplankton in eutrophic Pluβsee was studied by enrichment bioassays and by analysing the cellular stoichiometry of monospecific fractions obtained by size fractionation and density-gradient separation. In this lake silicate and nitrogen, but not phosphorus, at times limit the reproductive rates of phytoplankton. The dependence of nutrient-limited reproductive {{rates on the}} cellular content of the limiting nutrient (cell quota) could well be described by the Droop model. Biomass specific minimal cell <b>quotas</b> <b>of</b> nitrogen ranged from 0. 014 to 0. 061 mol N mol- 1 C, minimal cell <b>quotas</b> <b>of</b> silicon ranged from 0. 055 to 0. 127 mol Si mol- 1 C. The cell <b>quotas</b> <b>of</b> the non-limiting nutrients usually increased with the cell <b>quotas</b> <b>of</b> the limiting nutrient. In contrast to the Droop model, the Monod model which relies on ambient concentrations of limiting nutrients was a much poorer predictor of growth rates...|$|R

5|$|Although Scottish seamen {{received}} {{protection against}} arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs {{during the second}} half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{the armed}} forces forced the Radicals from power and {{improved}} economic conditions, but political turbulence intensified. In 1932, Argentina required immigrants to have a labour contract prior to arrival, or proof of financial means of support. The Roca-Runciman Treaty of 1933 gave Argentina a <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> the British market for exports of its primary products, but the discriminatory British imperial tariffs {{and the effects of}} deflation in Britain actually led to a small decline of Argentine exports to Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Robertson was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 7th Military District, which encompassed the Northern Territory. It was his first command since the First World War. He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel in August 1939, and this became substantive in November. The job involved cooperation with the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, and the administration of a company of regular soldiers known as the Darwin Mobile Force. After the Second World War began in September 1939, Robertson became responsible for supplying the 7th Military District's <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> volunteers for the Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF). A strike on the waterfront saw Robertson committing troops to help unload cargo.|$|E

5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme is {{a scheme}} {{operated}} by the British government {{in partnership with the}} United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and co-funded by the European Union (EU), offering a legal route for a <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> UNHCR-identified refugees to be resettled in the United Kingdom. Following a proposal by the British Home Secretary, David Blunkett, in October 2001, the legal basis was established by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the programme itself launched in March 2004. Since its inception, the programme has enjoyed broad support from the UK's main political parties.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} the war began on April 12, 1861, at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln {{offering}} 10,000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion. By the end of April, about 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up {{to fight for the}} Union, exceeding the state's initial <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> six regiments (4,683 men). In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24, 1861, Morton called for Indiana's politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union. He also received the state legislature's authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana's troops.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1940, Berger {{had filled}} the {{authorised}} <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older Allgemeine SS reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.|$|E
5|$|During the 2006–07 season, Poulton {{played in}} all 11 of New South Wales' WNCL matches, scoring 227 runs at 20.63. New South Wales {{struggled}} {{in the first}} four round-robin matches, losing three. In the fifth match, against Western Australia, Poulton scored 64 to set up a six-wicket victory. New South Wales won their last four matches to qualify in second place for the final, which was hosted by Victoria. Poulton scored 17 and 39 in the first two matches, both times being run out. New South Wales scraped home by one wicket in the first match, but the hosts levelled the series with an eight-wicket win the next day. In the third game, she made only nine, but New South Wales eventually reached the target of 206 with three wickets in hand to take the finals 2–1. Poulton took her first WNCL wicket in the season, bowling a full <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> ten overs against Western Australia, taking 1/23. Her maiden wicket was Avril Fahey, trapped leg before wicket. She ended the season with one wicket at 63.00 at an economy rate of 3.50.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the gumball conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. Gumball debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E

5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen {{to destroy}} a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal {{officers}} and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done all {{they could do to}} prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> troops after the winter.|$|E
5|$|Registrations {{of super}} clean cars {{increased}} five-fold in July 2014 {{driven by the}} end of the <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> 5,000 new cars eligible for the super clean car subsidy.

5|$|The Gateway Protection Programme {{initially}} had a <b>quota</b> <b>of</b> 500 refugees per year, {{which was}} later increased to 750, {{but the actual}} number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted. Liberian, Congolese, Sudanese, Burmese, Ethiopian, Mauritanian, Iraqi, Bhutanese, Eritrean, Palestinian and Somali refugees are amongst those who have been resettled under the programme. Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland. Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012, eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside. Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities, but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment.|$|E
5|$|The {{money raised}} for the Victory Loan {{campaign}} on If Day was $3.2million, {{which was the}} city's largest single-day total.
