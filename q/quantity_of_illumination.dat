50|$|Based on the {{positions}} and mounting heights of the fixtures, and their photometric characteristics, the proposed lighting layout can be checked for uniformity and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>illumination.</b> For larger projects {{or those with}} irregular floor plans, lighting design software can be used. Each fixture has its location entered, and the reflectance of walls, ceiling, and floors can be entered. The computer program will then produce a set of contour charts overlaid on the project floor plan, showing the light level to be expected at the working height. More advanced programs can include the effect of light from windows or skylights, allowing further optimization of the operating cost of the lighting installation. The amount of daylight received in an internal space can typically be analyzed by undertaking a daylight factor calculation.|$|E

This thesis presents a computer application of illumination prediction algorithms which predict the time of selected astonomical phenomena. This computer program is platform independent (given the proper libraries), event-driven, object-oriented, and utilizes a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Using this application, operators in the field will be able to determine the time of selected phenomena and the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>illumination,</b> measured in Lux, for a given time and date.

30|$|In this paper, a dual channel prior-based {{method for}} low {{illumination}} image enhancement {{with a single}} image is proposed, which builds upon two existing image priors: dark channel prior and bright channel prior, where we utilize the bright channel prior to get an initial transmission estimate and then use the dark channel as a complementary channel to correct potentially erroneous transmission estimates attained from the bright channel prior. We evaluated {{the performance of the}} proposed method in terms of qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis. Experiments on a large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> low <b>illumination</b> images revealed that the proposed method generated very high-quality enhancement images compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.|$|R

In order to maintain effective lighting in underground mines, measuring of illuminance and luminous energy is very much necessary. Because, humans receive the bulk of their information visual, the <b>quantity</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>illumination</b> is critical to the safe and efficient operation.

40|$|Natural {{light can}} add clarity to the {{organization}} of buildings by distinguishing areas of occupation with varying <b>quantities</b> and qualities <b>of</b> <b>illumination.</b> Libraries are good to study in this regard because of their varying requirements for light: reading areas must be brightly lit, while bookstacks should have little light for preservation. In responding to these needs, many libraries establish a pattern of light that relates to the buildings' use. Natural light is basic {{to the organization}} of four libraries studied: the Laurentian, Florence; Sainte Genevieve, Paris; the Seinajoke, Finland; and the Phillips Academy, Exeter. The buildings are analyzed through plans, sections, and perspective sketches. The understanding of light gained from these references is applied to my design of the Newton Public Library.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{evaluating}} the Baker-Barry Tunnel {{as a potential}} GATEWAY Demonstrations project for deployment of solid-state lighting (SSL) technology. The National Park Service views this project as a possible proving ground and template for implementation of light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires in other tunnels, thereby expanding the estimated 40 % energy savings from 132 MWh/yr to a much larger figure nationally. Most of the energy savings in this application is attributable to the instant-restrike capability of LED products and to their high tolerance for frequent on/off switching, used here to separately control {{either end of the}} tunnel during daytime hours. Some LED luminaires rival or outperform their high-intensity discharge (HID) counterparts in terms of efficacy, but options are limited, and smaller lumen packages preclude true one-for-one equivalence. However, LED products continue to improve in efficacy and affordability at a rate unmatched by other light source technologies; the estimated simple payback period of eight years (excluding installation costs and maintenance savings) can be expected to improve with time. The proposed revisions to the existing high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting system would require slightly increased controls complexity and significantly increased luminaire types and quantities. In exchange, substantial annual savings (from reduced maintenance and energy use) would be complemented by improved <b>quantity</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>illumination.</b> Although advanced lighting controls could offer additional savings, it is unclear whether such a system would prove cost-effective; this topic may be explored in future work...|$|R

40|$|Four task-ambient {{lighting}} schemes are categorized: luminaires in {{the ceiling}} only, indirect torcheres for task lighting alone, task lighting luminaires built into furniture, and task and ambient lighting both provided by indirect torcheres. A photometric appraisal {{of each of these}} categories was performed on installations in Canada and the U. S. A. Photometric measurements included horizontal illuminance, equivalent sphere illuminance, contrast rendering factor, luminance and reflectance. Data were also collected on the total power loading per unit area of work space as found in the offices containing the various systems. The results are evaluated in terms of current North American recommended practice with a detailed discussion of each system appraised. It was concluded that none of the systems measured met North American recommended IES lighting levels and the <b>quantity</b> and quality <b>of</b> <b>illumination</b> varied enormously amongst the sample of task- ambient systems investigated. Low ambient lighting levels can significantly affect the overall quality of light and may also require the surfaces of surrounding vertical walls and partitions to be separately illuminated. Nevertheless, it is the opinion of the authors that, if properly designed, task-ambient lighting systems offer significant potential for power savings in office lighting systems.

40|$|The {{spectral}} stability <b>of</b> <b>illumination</b> is {{an important}} aspect in color machine vision. The physical properties of lamps may change the spectrum <b>of</b> the <b>illumination</b> with time. In this work we examine the robustness of different color spaces against spectrally varying illumination in industrial wood defect inspection, when the inspection system is not adapted to the variations <b>of</b> <b>illumination.</b> The spectral changes are accomplished by digitally transforming the color temperature <b>of</b> <b>illumination</b> <b>of</b> wood images. We conclude that the original RGB color space is the best color space under varying illumination, the XYZ and CIELuv spaces being also very promising. An interesting observation is that features {{from some of the}} color spaces perform worse than features obtained from grey-level images.
