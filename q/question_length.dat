40|$|Patients {{want to use}} {{electronic}} communication to access health services more easily. Health authorities in several countries {{see this as a}} way to improve health care. Physicians appear to have conflicting opinions regarding the suitability of {{electronic communication}} in clinical settings. The aim of our study was to measure how long it actually takes physicians to answer questions from patients through an electronic communication channel, and whether some of the questions are especially time consuming. We monitored electronic patient–physician communication. A total of 1113 messages from 14 participating physicians from 7 medical offices were analyzed. The length of questions and answers, and the time physicians spent answering the questions were recorded and analyzed. Results: Physicians spent an average of 2. 3 minutes (median 2 minutes) answering questions from patients. The patients’ questions had an average length of 507. 1 characters (95 % CI 487. 4 – 526. 9, SD 336. 2), while physicians’ answers averaged 119. 9 characters (95 % CI 189. 8 – 210. 0, SD 172. 6). The results show that the influence of patient <b>question</b> <b>length</b> on time spent responding was negligible. For the shortest 25 % of the questions the answer time was 2. 1 minutes (95 % CI 1. 9 – 2. 3), while it was 2. 4 minutes (95 % CI 2. 2 – 2. 7) for the longest 25 %. Even extremely long questions had a minimal impact on the time spent answering them. A threefold increase in <b>question</b> <b>length</b> from patients resulted in only an 18 % increase in physician response time. The study shows the potential clinical usefulness of electronic communication between patients and health care services by demonstrating the potential for saving time...|$|E

By reviewing existing works, an improved model has been developed in this paper in order to assess the quality of statistical surveys. The model has been applied to over 103 national and international surveys and it is then used to generate synthetic data based on similar principles such as formulation, design and application quality etc. Various measures of the survey have been undertaken such as average <b>question</b> <b>length,</b> number of questions etc., and input into the database; which are analysed using statistical classification tools. This has allowed the identification of structural features of surveys which is associated with survey quality and this is reported precisely in the paper. Recommendations are made as to how a systematic approach can be taken to improve survey quality and effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Background: People with aphasia {{are often}} {{excluded}} from research {{because of their}} communication impairments, especially when {{an investigation into the}} communication impairment is not the primary goal. In our research concerning social participation of people with aphasia, we wanted to include people with mild, moderate as well as severe aphasia. Aim: To suggest strategies and techniques for research in people with aphasia based upon experiences in conducting research in this group of people. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study and a quantitative study in people with aphasia concerning their social participation. In these studies different strategies were developed based upon the literature, conversations with people with aphasia and speech and language therapists, to facilitate the inclusion of people with aphasia, even those with severe communication problems. Several strategies were evaluated. The strategies used and our experiences are outlined in this report. Main contribution: It is possible to conduct research in this group. Several strategies were helpful to make this mission possible: the use of pre-structured diaries, the use of in-depth interviews with attention to non-verbal communication, the use of existing measurements, adjusted for people with aphasia by: using pictograms, placing one question per page, bolding the key concepts in the question, using large font, visualizing the answering possibilities in words and in pictures, reducing the <b>question</b> <b>length,</b> and excluding negatives in the question. Conclusion: Research in people with aphasia is possible when using strategies adjusted to the communicative impairmen...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 62) A 5 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 8 mixed {{design was}} used to determine the effect of different arrangements of questions and answer spaces (form layout) on the rate of computer form data entry. Forty subjects, working at their own pace, used a computer keyboard to answer simple questions presented on a computer screen. A pre and posttest measure of each subject's typing rate was used as a covariate. The independent variables were layout, length of adjacent questions, length of answers, and distraction. The dependent variables were number of characters entered per second and mean response time. Subjects responded to eight different experimental questionnaires, answering 40 short answer items and 20 long answer items. ANOVA and ANCOVA analyses indicated that neither layout main effects nor interactions were significant. The results did suggest that items of similar length should be grouped if they are presented many items per screen, particularly if the answers are short. Rating information indicated that subjects preferred neither single nor multiple item presentations. Informally gathered ranking information suggested subjects preferred multiple item presentation and items that listed the question first with justified answer spaces {{to the right of the}} question. The layout that presented the answer space to the left of the question was ranked last. (The ranking information was subject to bias and requires confirmation using systematically controlled data collection procedures.) Although the results were not significant, the error analysis suggested that layout and <b>question</b> <b>length</b> may each affect error rates for data entry. Additional methodology analysis indicated self-paced performance did result in consistent typing rate and few errors...|$|E
30|$|Participants were {{informed}} {{of the purpose of}} the survey in an invitation email, with instructions provided on completing specific sections throughout the survey. The issue of response rate, critical in the use of surveys, was considered in planning the data collection process. In an environment such as a tertiary institution where students have broad access to, and familiarity with information technology, online surveys are widely used to provide a quick and easy form of data collection, particularly where large numbers of participants are available, or where such participants are located at a geographically broad distance. However, response rates are an important consideration in online survey research with factors such as <b>question</b> <b>length</b> and type, and the personality of the recipients needing consideration (Kaplowitz et al. 2004). The concern about low response rates from e-mail and web-based survey was also raised by Sills and Song (2002), who viewed the combination of web-based surveys and mailed surveys providing a good strategy through which to gain a high response rate. Accessibility is also a recognised issue with access to computers and technological competence (Mertler 2001) an important consideration. For this study, contact was made with staff in each institution to ensure engagement with students was achieved, also providing the capacity to provide reminders to students to enhance response rates. Reminder emails were also sent to encourage survey completion. To assist in the delivery process initial contact with academic coordinators in the target departments/faculties who had regular contact with the identified students was made early in the study seeking assistance in the surveying process. A snowballing technique was also used to further increase the response rate. The students were asked to assist in circulating the link to the survey in other communication channels such as Facebook and personal emails. No mandatory responses were included in the survey, further encouraging participants to complete the survey.|$|E
