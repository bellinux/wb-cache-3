40|$|The DL-Lite {{family of}} Description Logics has been {{designed}} with the specific goal of allowing for answering complex queries (in particular, conjunctive queries) over ontologies with very large instance sets (ABoxes). So far, in DL-Lite systems, this goal has been actually achieved only for relatively simple (short) conjunctive queries. In this paper we present Presto, a new query answering technique for DL-Lite ontologies, and an experimental comparison of Presto with the main previous approaches to query answering in DL-Lite. In practice, our experiments show that, in real ontologies, current techniques are only able to answer conjunctive <b>queries</b> <b>of</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 7 - 10 atoms (depending on {{the complexity of the}} TBox), while Presto is actually able to handle conjunctive queries of up to 30 atoms. Furthermore, in the cases that are already successfully handled by previous approaches, Presto is significantly more efficient.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new data-structure, the {{generalized}} randomized kd forest, or kgeraf, for approximate nearest neighbor searching in high dimensions. In particular, we introduce new randomization techniques to specify {{a set of}} independently constructed trees where search is performed simultaneously, hence increasing accuracy. We omit backtracking, and we optimize distance computations, thus accelerating queries. We release public domain software geraf and we compare it to existing implementations of state-of-the-art methods including BBD-trees, Locality Sensitive Hashing, randomized kd forests, and product quantization. Experimental results indicate that our method would be the method of choice in dimensions around 1, 000, and probably up to 10, 000, and pointsets of cardinality up to a few hundred thousands or even one million; this range of inputs is encountered in many critical applications today. For instance, we handle a real dataset of 10 ^ 6 images represented in 960 dimensions with a <b>query</b> time <b>of</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1 sec on average and 90 % responses being true nearest neighbors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{assesses the}} impact of three factors on the music {{retrieval}} accuracy of a query-by-melody (QBM) system. The investigated factors are the accuracy <b>of</b> the <b>query</b> provider (the singer), the <b>query</b> transcription accuracy <b>of</b> the acoustic front-end and the length <b>of</b> the <b>query.</b> The music retrieval accuracy is {{described in terms of}} a new concept, called the remaining information fraction (RIF). With this new concept it is possible to get more insight in the way the individual factors affect the music retrieval accuracy. The experimental results reported in this paper support the following conclusions: i) the music retrieval accuracy of a QBM system, as assessed on a large set <b>of</b> <b>queries,</b> is strongly correlated with the <b>query</b> transcription accuracy <b>of</b> its front-end, as assessed on a small set <b>of</b> manually transcribed <b>queries,</b> ii) there is still a significant gap between the accuracies obtained with manual and automatically generated query transcriptions, and iii) the music retrieval accuracy starts to drop quickly as soon as the <b>query</b> consists <b>of</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 20 notes.

40|$|Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) are scalable, self-organizing, and {{adaptive}} to underlying topology changes, thus being a promising infrastructure for hosting large-scale distributed applications. The ever-wider use of DHT infrastructures has found {{more and more}} applications that require support for range queries. Recently, a number <b>of</b> DHT-based range <b>query</b> schemes have been proposed. However, most of them suffer from high query delay or imbalanced load distribution. To address these problems, {{in this paper we}} first present an efficient indexing structure called Balanced Kautz (BK) tree that uniformly maps the m-dimensional data space onto DHT nodes, and then propose a BK tree-based range query scheme called ERQ that processes range queries in a parallel fashion and guarantees to return the results in a bounded delay. In a DHT with N nodes, ERQ can answer any range <b>of</b> <b>query</b> in <b>less</b> <b>than</b> log N(2 log log N + 1) hops in a load-balanced manner, irrespective <b>of</b> the <b>queried</b> range, the whole space size, or the number <b>of</b> <b>queried</b> attributes. The effectiveness of our proposals is demonstrated through experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Exploitability {{analysis}} {{is the process}} of attempting to determine if a vulnerability in a program is exploitable. Fuzzing is a popular method of finding such vulnerabilities, in which a program is subjected to millions of generated program inputs until it crashes. Each program crash indicates a potential vulnerability that needs to be prioritized according to its potential for exploitation. The highest priority vulnerabilities need to be investigated by a security analyst by re-executing the program with the input that caused the crash while recording a trace of all executed assembly instructions and then performing analysis on the resulting trace. Recreating the entire memory state of the program {{at the time of the}} crash, or at any other point in the trace, is very important for helping the analyst build an understanding of the conditions that led to the crash. Unfortunately, tracing even a small program can create multimillion line trace files from which reconstructing memory state is a computationally intensive process and virtually impossible to do manually. In this paper we present an analysis of the problem of memory state reconstruction from very large execution traces. We report on a novel approach for reconstructing the entire memory state of a program from an execution trace that allows near realtime queries on the state of memory at any point in a program’s execution trace. Finally we benchmark our approach showing storage and performance results in line with our theoretical calculations and demonstrate memory state <b>query</b> response times <b>of</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 200 ms for trace files up to 60 million lines.
