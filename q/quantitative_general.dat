40|$|A <b>quantitative</b> <b>general</b> {{equilibrium}} {{model is}} a useful tool primarily for two types of studies. One type is studies with a time horizon two or more decades into the future. In such studies, a model of this type can highlight various features of future economic conditions by delineating a number of resource allocations, each consistent with full equilibrium on product and factor markets. A second field of application is comparisons between actually observed resource allocations and hypothetical equilibrium allocations. In this report a <b>quantitative</b> <b>general</b> equilibrium model of an open economy is developed and applied on Swedish data. In addition to the foreign trade flows, the model emphasizes the energy flows in the economy. The model is solved in a two-step procedure which is reiterated until a full equilibrium is reached. In the first step, technological coefficients and output prices are determined {{on the basis of}} initial values on factor prices. Then the excess demands on factor markets at product market equilibrium are determined. After that the initial factor prices are adjusted and the process repeated. The report also contains some preliminary results, as well as a brief discussion of future directions of research in this field...|$|E

In sharp contrast with RBC models with indivisible labor, wage contracts magnify mainly the effect of monetary shocks on the volatility of hours worked. An attractive feature of the contracting model is that it avoids a trade-off that RBC models have to face in their predictive capacity when additional features are incorporated to them.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the consequences of}} demographic change for business cycle analysis. We find that changes in the age composition {{of the labor force}} account for a significant fraction of the variation in business cycle volatility observed in the U. S. and other G 7 economies. During the postwar period, these countries experienced dramatic demographic change, although details regarding extent and timing differ from place to place. Using panel-data methods, we exploit this variation to show that the age composition of the workforce has a large and statistically significant effect on cyclical volatility. We conclude by relating these findings to the recent decline in U. S. business cycle volatility. Using both simple accounting exercises and a <b>quantitative</b> <b>general</b> equilibrium model, we find that demographic change accounts for a significant part of this moderation.

The model features both ‘pure ’ and ‘impure ’ forms of altruism and investigates {{the role of}} borrowing constraints in accounting for the timing of intergenerational transfers between intervivos transfers and bequests. Under a perfect capital market, the timing of parental transfers is irrelevant. However, under borrowing constraints, parental transfer will be geared towards helping out borrowing-constrained children. The model is calibrated to match the US and Korean economy. Numerical experiments show that tightening borrowing constraints leads to more intervivos transfers geared towards younger children and lower level of bequest.
