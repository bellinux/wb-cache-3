5000|$|... "Person-by-treatment" [...] {{designs are}} {{the most common type of}} <b>quasi</b> <b>experiment</b> design. In this design, the {{experimenter}} measures at least one independent variable. Along with measuring one variable, the experimenter will also manipulate a different independent variable. Because there is manipulating and measuring of different independent variables, the research is mostly done in laboratories. An important factor in dealing with person-by-treatment designs are that random assignment will need to be used in order to make sure that the experimenter has complete control over the manipulations that are being done to the study.|$|E
5000|$|Starting in 2001, SD {{has been}} empirically {{evaluated}} at different education levels with students aged 15-24. The most extensive study so far was a three-year-long <b>quasi</b> <b>experiment</b> conducted at a Finnish high school, where the test group was taught the compulsory mathematics courses using SD {{and the control}} group studied according to the traditional approach. The {{results indicate that the}} students in the test group performed better in all courses and the matriculation examination, even when potentially influencing factors have been taken into account. Other studies have indicated that students learn to justify their solutions during one single course [...] and that students appreciate the new approach to writing mathematics.|$|E
50|$|Other {{advantages}} of <b>quasi</b> <b>experiments</b> include {{the idea of}} having any manipulations the experimenter so chooses. In natural experiments, the researchers have to let manipulations occur on their own and have no control over them whatsoever. Also, using self selected groups in <b>quasi</b> <b>experiments</b> also takes away to chance of ethical, conditional, etc. concerns while conducting the study.|$|R
5000|$|Quasi-experiments {{are also}} {{effective}} because {{they use the}} [...] "pre-post testing". This means that there are tests done before any data are collected {{to see if there}} are any person confounds or if any participants have certain tendencies. Then the actual experiment is done with post test results recorded. This data can be compared as part of the study or the pre-test data can be included in an explanation for the actual experimental data. <b>Quasi</b> <b>experiments</b> have independent variables that already exist such as age, gender, eye color. These variables can either be continuous (age) or they can be categorical (gender). In short, naturally occurring variables are measured within <b>quasi</b> <b>experiments.</b>|$|R

5000|$|... "Natural experiments" [...] are a {{different}} type of <b>quasi</b> <b>experiment</b> design used by researchers. It differs from person-by-treatment in a way {{that there is not a}} variable that is being manipulated by the experimenter. Instead of controlling at least one variable like the person-by-treatment design, experimenters do not use random assignment and leave the experimental control up to chance. This is where the name [...] "natural" [...] experiment comes from. The manipulations occur naturally, and although this may seem like an inaccurate technique, it has actually proven to be useful in many cases. These are the studies done to people who had something sudden happen to them. This could mean good or bad, traumatic or euphoric. An example of this could be studies done on those who have been in a car accident and those who have not. Car accidents occur naturally, so it would not be ethical to stage experiments to traumatize subjects in the study. These naturally occurring events have proven to be useful for studying posttraumatic stress disorder cases.|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages {{also include}} the study groups may provide weaker {{evidence}} {{because of the lack}} of randomness.

30|$|By {{deciding}} {{to participate in}} a future-oriented planning and shaping process in a concrete social field, the participatory (futures) researcher cannot bypass questions of power hierarchies. While in case of variable-manipulative research strategies (e.g. in case of <b>quasi</b> <b>experiments)</b> these issues have already been methodically resolved in order to facilitate a distanced research attitude even before the researcher comes into the picture, the participatory and variable-configuratively oriented researcher has to consciously expose themselves to the complicated interactive dynamics of defining role and position under “natural” conditions.
