25|$|While the {{big bang}} theory in the {{framework}} of relativistic cosmology seems to be at odds with eternal return, there are now many different speculative big bang scenarios in <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmology</b> which actually imply eternal return - although based on other assumptions than Nietzsche's. So there are competing models and hypotheses with a temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal eternal return of everything in all variations as Nietzsche has envisaged.|$|E
25|$|While {{there has}} been a recent {{proposal}} relating to observation of naked singularities, and doubly special relativity {{as a part of a}} program called loop <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmology,</b> there is no experimental observation for which loop quantum gravity makes a prediction not made by the Standard Model or general relativity (a problem that plagues all current theories of quantum gravity). Because of the above-mentioned lack of a semiclassical limit, LQG has not yet even reproduced the predictions made by general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Research {{into the}} {{physical}} {{consequences of the}} theory is also proceeding in several directions. Among these, the most well-developed is the application of LQG to cosmology, called loop <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmology</b> (LQC). LQC applies LQG ideas {{to the study of}} the early universe and the physics of the Big Bang. Its most spectacular consequence is that the evolution of the universe can be continued beyond the Big Bang. The Big Bang appears thus to be replaced by a sort of cosmic Big Bounce.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether conserved currents can be sensibly defined in supersymmetric minisuperspaces. Our analysis deals with k = + 1 FRW and Bianchi class–A models. Supermatter {{in the form}} of scalar supermultiplets is included in the former. Moreover, we restrict ourselves to the first-order differential equations derived from the Lorentz and supersymmetry constraints. The “square-root ” structure of N= 1 supergravity was our motivation to contemplate this interesting research. We show that conserved currents cannot be adequately established except for some very simple scenarios. Otherwise, equations of the type ∇aJ a = 0 may only be obtained from Wheeler-DeWitt–like equations, which are derived from the supersymmetric algebra of constraints. Two appendices are included. In appendix A we describe some interesting features of <b>quantum</b> FRW <b>cosmologies</b> with complex scalar fields when supersymmetry is present. In particular, we explain how the Hartle-Hawking state can now be satisfactorily identified. In appendix B we initiate a discussion about the retrieval of classical properties from supersymmetric <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmologies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of vector fields {{on the origin}} of a classical space in <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmologies</b> and on the possible compactification process in multidimensional gravity is investigated. It is shown that all general features of the transition between classical and quantum regimes of the evolution can be obtained within the simplest Bianchi-I model for arbitrary number of dimensions. It is shown that the classical space appears when the horizon size reaches the smallest of characteristic scales (the characteristic scale of inhomogeneity or the scale associated with vector fields). In multidimensional case the presence of vector fields completely removes the initial stage of the compactification process which takes place in the case of vacuum models...|$|R
40|$|From the {{principles}} of <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmologies</b> we can justify the reason for an inverse-square law for the cosmological constant with no conflict with observations. Although this general expression for Λ {{is well known in}} the literature, in this work we introduce some analytical solutions for the scale factor different from the literature.

The knowledge of the scale factor behavior might shed some light on these questions since the entire evolution of a homogeneous isotropic Universe is contained in the scale factor. Comment: 10 pages.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} a model quantum universe {{consisting of a}} very large box containing a screen with two slits and an observer (us) that can pass though the slits. We apply the modern quantum mechanics of closed systems to calculate the probabilities for alternative histories of how we move through the universe and what we see. After passing through the screen with the slits, the quantum state of the universe is a superposition of classically distinguishable histories. We are then living in a superposition. Some frequently asked questions about such situations are answered using this model. The model's relationship to more realistic <b>quantum</b> <b>cosmologies</b> is briefly discussed.
