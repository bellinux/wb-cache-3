2500|$|Abnormalities in {{conduction}} and repolarization of {{the heart}} that can result from anorexia nervosa include QT prolongation, increased <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion,</b> conduction delays, [...] and junctional escape rhythms. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity {{of the heart}}, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. Hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging (induced vomiting or laxative use). Hypotension (low blood pressure) is common, and symptoms include fatigue and weakness. Orthostatic hypotension, a marked decrease in blood pressure when standing from a supine position, may also occur. Symptoms include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment, and may result in fainting or near-fainting. Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization. [...] Hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. The weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. This leads to decreased ability to pump blood, {{a reduction in the}} ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue. Some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. Cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size normalizes over weeks to months, with recovery. Atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. Studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2–4 percent. It has been suggested that there is an association between mitral valve prolapse and sudden cardiac death, but it has not been proven to be causative, either in patients with anorexia nervosa or in the general population.|$|E
40|$|<b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> is {{an easily}} {{obtained}} measurement {{from the standard}} electrocardiogram, and is the maximum minus the minimum QT interval. <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> might represent dispersion of ventricular repolarisation, and be a marker of arrhythmic substrates. The main aim of the thesis was to explore a possible association of increased <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> with death after myocardial infarction. In a preliminary study of 20 patients with acute myocardial infarction, <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was increased on day 1, increased to a maximum on day 3, and was falling by hospital discharge. A case-control study was undertaken in which 163 patients who subsequently died were drawn from the placebo am of a large randomised trial in myocardial infarction and were matched with surviving controls. Comparison of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> measured on day 2 or 3 in patients who subsequently died and those who survived showed no association between <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> and mortality. However in the subset of patients for whom later electrocardiograms were available, a significant association between mortality and late <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was observed. However these patients may represent a selected population. The mechanism of increased <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> remains unclear. <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurements in patients undergoing angioplasty, or with dilated cardiomyopathy, indicated that neither acute ischaemia nor left ventricular size were satisfactory explanations for increased <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion.</b> It became apparent that there were methodological problems in <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> measurement. Estimates of the reproducibility of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> in the post-infarct situation were made, and problems with automated measurement of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> identified. "Lead adjustment" formulae were shown to be inappropriate. A simplified measurement protocol was proposed. In summary, dynamic changes in <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> following infarction have been confirmed, but early dispersion measurements fail to predict mortality. Failure of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> to return to normal is associated with increased mortality, but both the validity of this observation and its mechanism require further evaluation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{evaluate}} {{changes in}} <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> and {{components of the}} QT interval in patients admitted with unstable angina {{and acute myocardial infarction}} and to study the dynamics of these changes in patients with infarction. METHODS [...] Prospective study recording electrocardiograms at 50 mm/s in patients admitted with typical cardiac chest pain. Subsequent confirmation of acute myocardial infarction according to standard criteria. Single blind analysis for <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> and QT components using a digitiser and simple computer program. Results are expressed as native <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion,</b> QTc dispersion, and the <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> ratio defined as <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> divided by cycle length and expressed as a percentage. RESULTS [...] <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion,</b> QTc dispersion, and <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> ratio were all higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (mean (SD) 66 (18) ms, 75 (26) ms 1 / 2, and 8. 1 (2. 4) % compared with 38 (13) ms, 39 (13) ms 1 / 2, and 4. 5 (1. 7) % respectively). Dynamic changes in QTc dispersion were seen after acute infarction with significant differences in the QT components occurring between the different patient groups. Levels of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> (87 (15) ms), QTc dispersion (105 (17) ms 1 / 2), and <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> ratio (11. 7 (0. 8) %) in the four patients with ventricular fibrillation were significantly higher. Use of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> ratio gave a narrower confidence interval. CONCLUSION [...] <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> is increased after myocardial infarction and levels are higher in patients with ventricular fibrillation. The changes in <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> are dynamic and may reflect the changing pattern of underlying ventricular recovery of ventricular excitability, which is profoundly disturbed in the earliest phase of acute infarction. Expressing <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> as a percentage of cycle length (<b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> ratio) rather than using standard rate correction may be superior in identifying patients who develop ventricular fibrillation...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy {{the value}} of <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> for identifying the induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in the electrophysiological study or the risk of sudden cardiac death. METHODS: We assessed <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> in the 12 -lead electrocardiogram of 26 patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We analyzed its association with sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death, and in 16 controls similar in age and sex. RESULTS: (mean ± SD). QT interval dispersion: patients = 53. 8 ± 14. 1 ms; control group = 35. 0 ± 10. 6 ms, p= 0. 001. Patients with induction of ventricular tachycardia: 52. 5 ± 13. 8 ms; without induction of ventricular tachycardia: 57. 5 ± 12. 8 ms, p= 0. 420. In a mean follow-up period of 41 ± 11 months, five sudden cardiac deaths occurred. <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> in this group was 62. 0 ± 17. 8, and in the others it was 51. 9 ± 12. 8 ms, p= 0. 852.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> during atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm in the same patients at normal and prolonged ventricular repolarization. Methods and Results Sixty-one patients who had had chronic atrial fibrillation for 8 +/- 14 months received a 6 h infusion of the I-kr-bIocker almokalant, the first 90 min of which are used for this analysis. The following day, after conversion to sinus rhythm, by almokalant (n = 19) or direct current cardioversion (n = 42), an identical 90 min infusion was administered. Prior to infusion, there was no difference in precordial <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm (29 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 17 ms, P = ns).

40|$|Introduction: Prolongation of QT {{interval}} {{might result}} in dangerous cardiac arrhythmias, including Torsades de Pointes (TdP), consequently leading to syncope or death. A limited number of studies carried out in this respect to date have shown that QT interval might increase during pregnancy. On the other hand, {{it has been shown}} that each pregnancy {{might result in}} an increase in the risk of cardiac accidents in patients with long QT interval. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to compare QT intervals in pregnant and non-pregnant women. Methods: Pregnant women group consisted of 40 women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and the non-pregnant control group consisted of healthy women 18 - 35 years of age. All the patients underwent standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The QT interval was measured for each patient at lead II. The mean corrected QT interval (QTc) and <b>QT</b> <b>dispersions</b> (<b>QTd)</b> were compared between the two groups. Results: Mean heart rates in the pregnant and non-pregnant groups were 98. 55 ± 14. 09 and 72. 53 ± 13. 17 beats/minutes (P< 0. 001). QTd and QTc means were in the normal range in both groups; however, these variables were 49. 50 ± 12. 80 and 43. 03 ± 18. 47 milliseconds in the pregnant group and 39. 5 ± 9. 59 and 40. 38 ± 17. 20 milliseconds in the control group, respectively (P< 0. 001).

In the classic concept of the ischemic cascade, the earliest event is the QT interval prolongation, which was previously reported in patients with unstable angina and ST elevation myocardial infarction. There has been speculation that the normalization of this interval in patients undergoing angioplasty, is a marker of successful reperfusion, thus {{the objective of this}} research is to characterize the corrected <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> and its association with adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Method: The corrected <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> was analyzed in patients admitted to the Hospital "Comandante Manuel Fajardo Rivero" with an acute coronary syndrome from January to December 2009. The results were analyzed to provide inferential information {{on the basis of the}} statistical assessment of the SPSS processor, version 15. 0. Results: The ST-segment elevation syndrome was the clinical form that included the most patients, but prolonged dispersion prevailed in those with unclassifiable syndrome, an atypical clinical presen-tation and a wrong electrocardiogram, similar behavior to that of the patients with a non-ST segment elevation syndrome, but not in those with ST segment elevation. Mortality, cardiac reinfarction, and need for myocardial revascularization were significantly associated with prolonged dispersion of the corrected QT interval.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdTo {{evaluate}} the predictive role of increased correctedQT (QTc) andQT interval <b>dispersion</b> (<b>QTd)</b> on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in a large, unselected {{type 2 diabetic}} population. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdThe prospective study included 1, 357 type 2 diabetic patients from the Casale Monferrato Study. At baseline, QTc intervals. 0. 44 s and QTd intervals. 0. 08 s were considered abnormally prolonged. Both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed 15 years after the baseline examination. RESULTSdDuring the follow-up period, 862 subjects per 12, 450 person-years died. Multi-variate analysis showed that the hazard ratio (HR) of cardiovascular mortality was significantly increased in subjects with prolonged QTd (1. 26 [95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 55]) and was only slightly reduced after multiple adjustments. Conversely, prolonged QTc did not increase the HRs for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. CONCLUSIONSdIncreased QTd predicts cardiovascular mortality after a long-term follow-up period in a large, unselected population of type 2 diabetic subjects. Diabetes Care 35 : 581 – 583, 2012 D iabetes is a known cardiovascularrisk factor, and there is much in-terest {{in the identification of}} factors that may improve cardiovascular risk stratification in diabetic subjects, possibly by using noninvasive low-cost approaches. In the general population, prolonged cor-rected QT (QTc) and increased <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> (<b>QTd),</b> reflecting abnormali-ties of ventricular myocardial repolariza-tion, are independent predictors of mortality (1). However, in type 2 diabetic subjects, the predictive role of QTc and QTd on all-cause and cardiovascularmor-tality remains controversial because stud-ies addressing this issue were performed on small cohorts and/or had relatively short follow-up periods and/or focused on populations representative of specific ethnic groups (2 – 9). Therefore, we per-formed a prospective study to assess the predictive role of increased QTc and QTd on all-cause and cardiovascular mortal-ity in an unselected, large population of type 2 diabetic subjects after a long-term follow-up period...|$|R

The best cut-off value of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> on the baseline electrocardiogram for predicting myocardial viability was 65 ms (sensitivity and specificity of 68 %). Dobutamine infusion increased <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> only in patients with viable myocardium (61 +/- 18 to 83 +/- 19 ms, p = 0. 003) and/or ischemia (72 +/- 16 to 112 +/- 25 ms, p or = 20 ms from at rest to low-dose dobutamine infusion was associated with myocardial viability with a sensitivity of 78 % and a specificity of 79 %, whereas an increase in <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> of > or = 10 ms from low- to high-dose dobutamine infusion predicted ischemic myocardium with a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 82 %.

First group: 25 endurance-trained athletes (runners, football-players) and the 2 nd group: 26 strength-trained athletes (wrestlers, boxers). Control group: 20 teenagers in the same age group, without any sign of cardiac suffering. ECGs were assessed on all the patients, athletes and non-athletes and used to calculate QT interval in three successive cardiac ECG cycles, the <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> (QTD) (the difference between maximum and minimum value of QT interval) and the QTc interval dispersion (QTcD) (Bazzet's formula). Resultsthe average values of QTD and QTcD in the 1 st and 2 nd group were superior than the values in the control group but the difference is not statistic significant. 1 st group QTD: 43, 54 × 21, 03 msQTcD: 50. 81 × 19. 34 ms 2 nd group QTD: 48. 23 × 12. 56 msQTcD: 53. 59 × 17. 21 mscontrol group QTD: 35. 88 × 10. 22 msQTcD; 39. 23 × 14. 81 msThe highest values of QT interval were found in strength-trained sporting teenagers. The highest values of QTD and QTcD were found in sporting teenagers from the 2 nd group that {{it might be possible to}} have a higher ventricular arrhythmia risk. There wasn’t any case with QT interval value longer than the normal. ConclusionsAt side of other parameters ECG, it is useful research screening of the QT interval and QTc interval dispersion during periodic controls, like indicator of the risk of the ventricular arrhythmias at sporting teenager...|$|R
40|$|Background: The <b>QT</b> {{interval}} <b>dispersion</b> (<b>QTd)</b> {{has been}} described as the maximum minus minimum QT intervals in simultaneously 12 -lead electrocardiographic recording which reflect inhomogeneity in myocardial repolarization. Increased QTd has been illustrated in patients with a variety of cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction and was suggested as a risk factor for development of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. QTd may also be a prognostic factor in patients undergoing Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of CABG on QTd in patients with coronary artery disease. Method: In this retrospective study we evaluated the effect of CABG on QTd in 79 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease. Measurement of QTd was performed on ECGs taken before and 24 hours after opera-tion. Result: There was no significant QTd changes in post CABG patients compared with baseline QTd (0. 06 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 06 ± 0. 03, P= 0. 18). In subgroups analysis, decrease in QTd was observed following CABG only in those with two-vessel coronary involvement compared with baseline (0. 05 ± 0. 04 SD seconds versus 0. 07 ± 0. 02 SD seconds, P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The present study showed that CABG does not affect QTd except in few patients with two-vessel coronary involvement...|$|R
40|$|Background <b>QT</b> {{interval}} <b>dispersion,</b> {{measured as}} interlead variability of QT, is {{a marker of}} {{dispersion of ventricular repolarization}} and, hence, of cardiac electrical instability. We tested the hypothesis that dispersion of ventricular repolariza-tion may be differently affected by interventions destined to provide complete or incomplete protection against malignant arrhythmias in patients with long QT syndrome (LQTS). Twenty-eight patients affected by the Romano Ward form of LQTS entered the study and were divided into three groups: LQTS patients before institution of therapy, patients who did respond to P-blocker therapy, and patients who continued to have syncope and cardiac arrest despite X 3 -blockade and who underwent left cardiac sympathetic denervation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Normal electrocardiographic {{recordings}} were analysed {{to establish}} the influence of measurement of different numbers of electrocardiographic leads {{on the results of}} different formulas expressing <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> and the effects of adjustment of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> obtained from a subset of an electrocardiogram to approximate to the true <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> obtained from a complete electrocardiogram. SUBJECTS AND METHODS [...] Resting 12 lead electrocardiograms of 27 healthy people were investigated. In each lead, the QT interval was measured with a digitising board and <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was evaluated by three formulas: (A) the difference between the longest and the shortest QT interval among all leads; (B) the difference between the second longest and the second shortest QT interval; (C) SD of QT intervals in different leads. For each formula, the "true" dispersion was assessed from all measurable leads and then different combinations of leads were omitted. The mean relative differences between the <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> with a given number of omitted leads and the "true" <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> (mean relative errors) and the coefficients of variance of the results of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> obtained when omitting combinations of leads were compared for the different formulas. The procedure was repeated with an adjustment of each formula dividing its results by the square root of the number of measured leads. The same approach was used for the measurement of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> from the chest leads including a fourth formula (D) the SD of interlead differences weighted according to the distances between leads. For different formulas, the mean relative errors caused by omitting individual electrocardiographic leads were also assessed and the importance of individual leads for correct measurement of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was investigated. RESULTS [...] The study found important differences between different formulas for assessment of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> with respect to compensation for missing measurements of QT interval. The standard max-min formula (A) performed poorly (mean relative errors of 6. 1 % to 18. 5 % for missing one to four leads) but was appropriately adjusted with the factor of 1 /square root of n (n = number of measured leads). In a population of healthy people such an adjustment removed the systematic bias introduced by missing leads of the 12 lead electrocardiogram and significantly reduced the mean relative errors caused by the omission of several leads. The unadjusted SD was the optimum formula (C) for the analysis of 12 lead electrocardiograms, and the weighted standard deviation (D) was the optimum for the analysis of six lead chest electrocardiograms. The coefficients of variance of measurements of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> with different missing leads were very large (about 3 to 7 for one to four missing leads). Independently of the formula for measurement of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion,</b> omission of different leads produced substantially different relative errors. In 12 lead electrocardiograms the largest relative errors (> 10 %) were caused by omitting lead aVL or lead V 1. CONCLUSIONS [...] Because of the large coefficients of variance, the concept of adjusting the <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> for different numbers of electrocardiographic leads used in its assessment is difficult if not impossible to fulfil. Thus {{it is likely to be}} more appropriate to assess <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> from standardised constant sets of electrocardiographic leads...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{importance}} of minimizing the exaggerated sympatho-adrenergic responses and QT interval and <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> changes that may develop due to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation during anesthesia induction in the hypertensive patients is clear. Esmolol decreases the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation. However, {{the effect of}} esmolol in decreasing the prolonged QT interval and <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> as induced by laryngoscopy and intubation is controversial. We investigated the effect of esmolol on the hemodynamic, and corrected-QT interval and corrected-QT interval dispersion changes seen during anesthesia induction in hypertensive patients using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. METHODS: 60 ASA I-II patients, with essential hypertension using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors {{were included in the}} study. The esmolol group received esmolol at a bolus dose of 500 mcg/kg followed by a 100 mcg/kg/min infusion which continued until the 4 th min after intubation. The control group received 0. 9 % saline similar to the esmolol group. The mean blood pressure, heart rate values and the electrocardiogram records were obtained as baseline values before the anesthesia, 5 min after esmolol and saline administration, 3 min after the induction and 30 s, 2 min and 4 min after intubation. RESULTS: The corrected-QT interval was shorter in the esmolol group (p = 0. 012), the corrected-QT interval dispersion interval was longer in the control group (p = 0. 034) and the mean heart rate was higher in the control group (p = 0. 022) 30 s after intubation. The risk of arrhythmia frequency was higher in the control group in the 4 -min period following intubation (p = 0. 038). CONCLUSION: Endotracheal intubation was found to prolong corrected-QT interval and corrected-QT interval dispersion, and increase the heart rate during anesthesia induction with propofol in hypertensive patients using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.

In this case-control study, our object was to appoint if QT and QTC and Te dispersions were predictors of cardiac disorders in thalassemia major patients or not. 34 thalassemic patients who had no cardiac sign or symptom and 34 normal subjects between 16 - 18 years old of age were referred for evaluation of their QT, QTC, and Te dispersions in their ECGs. All standard 12 -lead ECGs were obtained from them and were digitized by a single observer blinded to the assigned groups. As references, QT and Te were measured and QTC was calculated by Bazett,s formula. Results showed highly significant differences in <b>QT</b> and QTC <b>dispersions</b> between thalassemic patients and control group (P-value = 0. 004 and 0. 001 respectively); but it was moderate for Te (P-value = 0. 086).

40|$|AbstractQT {{dispersion}} {{was originally}} proposed to measure spatial dispersion of ventricular recovery times. Later, {{it was shown}} that <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> does not directly reflect the dispersion of recovery times and that it results mainly from variations in the T loop morphology and the error of QT measurement. The reliability of both automatic and manual measurement of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> is low and significantly {{lower than that of}} the QT interval. The measurement error is of the order of the differences between different patient groups. The agreement between automatic and manual measurement is poor. There is little to choose between various <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> indices, as well as between different lead systems for their measurement. Reported values of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> vary widely, e. g., normal values from 10 to 71 ms. Although <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> is increased in cardiac patients compared with healthy subjects and prognostic value of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> has been reported, values are largely overlapping, both between healthy subjects and cardiac patients and between patients with and without adverse outcome. In reality, <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> is a crude and approximate measure of abnormality of the complete course of repolarization. Probably only grossly abnormal values (e. g. ≥ 100 ms), outside the range of measurement error may potentially have practical value by pointing to a grossly abnormal repolarization. Efforts should be directed toward established as well as new methods for assessment and quantification of repolarization abnormalities, such as principal component analysis of the T wave, T loop descriptors, and T wave morphology and wavefront direction descriptors...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{manual and}} {{computer}} automated techniques for measuring <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion.</b> DESIGN: Assessment {{of the ability}} of manual and automatic measurements of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> to discriminate between a normal group and two cardiac groups. SUBJECTS: 12 simultaneous electrocardiogram leads were recorded from 25 healthy volunteers, 25 subjects after myocardial infarction, and 25 with cardiac arrhythmias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each subject, <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was measured as {{the difference between the}} maximum and minimum QT from all 12 leads and separately for only those leads with T amplitudes of > 100 microV and for those > 250 microV. RESULTS: Manual <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> (T > 100 microV) was greater (P < 0. 02) in the arrhythmia patients (mean (SD), 45 (21) ms), but not the infarction patients (54 (36) ms), than in the normal subjects (39 (13) ms). There were no significant differences when all T waves were included. <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> was significantly reduced by an average of 30 % when T waves < 100 microV were excluded, and by 51 % when those < 250 microV were excluded. Automatic techniques gave different measurements for dispersion in comparison with manual measurements. Three of the four automatic techniques detected significant differences between normal and both patient groups when no leads were excluded (P < 0. 01) as well as when T waves < 100 microV were excluded (with increased significance, P < 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of <b>QT</b> <b>dispersion</b> from small T waves increases measurement variability and reduces the potential for detecting clinical differences.

40|$|Cardiac memory (CM) {{can alter}} the {{configuration}} of action potentials and the transmural repolarization gradient in ventricular tissue. This study evaluated the effects of CM on ventricular arrhythmogenicity. A total of 20 patients (12 females, 8 males; mean age, 46 ± 13 years) were enrolled. The following indicators were measured to evaluate ventricular arrhythmogenicity: (1) the action potential duration at 90 % repolarization (APD 90) recorded from the right ventricular apex (RVA); (2) the maximal slope of the action potential duration restitution curve (APDR) constructed by programmed extra stimuli from RVA; and (3) the maximal corrected QT interval (QTc) and <b>QT</b> interval <b>dispersion</b> (<b>QTd).</b> The short-term CM was induced by constant pacing from the RVA at a pacing cycle length (PCL) of 400 ms for 20 minutes. After induction of CM, the mean APD 90 were significantly shortened at both PCLs of 600 ms and 400 ms (252. 9 ± 6. 4 ms vs. 235. 6 ± 6. 4 ms and 231. 2 ± 6. 4 ms vs. 214. 4 ± 7. 3 ms, respectively; p = 0. 001). No significant change regarding the maximal slopes of APDR were found at both PCLs of 600 ms and 400 ms (1. 05 ± 0. 09 vs. 0. 96 ± 0. 11 and 0. 85 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 84 ± 0. 09, respectively). QTc (417. 3 ± 9. 1 ms vs. 454. 7 ± 8. 3 ms; p = 0. 001), but not QTd (63. 4 ± 5. 4 ms vs. 65. 7 ± 6. 1 ms), was significantly shortened. Short-term CM significantly decreased ventricular APD 90 and QTc, but did not significantly change the maximal slope of APDR or QTd.
