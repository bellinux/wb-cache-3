5|$|Einstein {{suggested}} to Erwin Schrödinger {{that he might}} be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. <b>Quantizing</b> these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.|$|E
5|$|The {{design process}} {{involves}} trading-off different factors, including colour, contrast and overall disruptive effect. A failure {{to consider all}} elements of pattern design tends to result in poor results. The US Army's Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), for example, adopted after limited testing in 2003–4, performed poorly because of low pattern contrast ("isoluminance"—beyond very close range, the design looks like a field of solid light grey, failing to disrupt an object's outlines) and arbitrary colour selection, neither {{of which could be}} saved by <b>quantizing</b> (digitizing) the pattern geometry. The design was replaced from 2015 with Operational Camouflage Pattern, a non-pixellated pattern.|$|E

(Information is lost both in <b>quantizing</b> and rounding of the floating-point numbers.)

30|$|As {{it can be}} {{seen from}} Tables  6 and 7, the {{compression}} percentage of the <b>quantized</b> norms is higher than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients. Since the variation of the <b>quantized</b> norms is less than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients, the conditional probability of the encoding symbol of the <b>quantized</b> norms is bigger than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients. Moreover, the correlation in the time domain of the <b>quantized</b> norms is higher than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients because of the less variation of norms. As a result, the scheme of the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding used for the <b>quantized</b> norms has a better performance than that used for the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients.|$|R

We develop for <b>quantized</b> metric spaces an operator space version of quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. We show that two <b>quantized</b> metric spaces are completely isometric {{if and only if}} their <b>quantized</b> Gromov-Hausdorff distance is zero. We establish a completeness theorem. As applications, we show that a <b>quantized</b> metric space with 1 -exact underlying matrix order unit space is a limit of matrix algebras with respect to <b>quantized</b> Gromov-Hausdorff distance, and that matrix algebras converge naturally to the sphere for <b>quantized</b> Gromov-Hausdorff distance. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{predict a}} giant <b>quantized</b> Goos-Hänchen (GH) {{effect on the}} surface of graphene in quantum Hall regime. The giant <b>quantized</b> GH effect manifests itself as an angular shift whose <b>quantized</b> step reaches the order of mrad for light beams impinging on a graphene-on-substrate system. The <b>quantized</b> GH effect can be attributed to <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity, which corresponds to the discrete Landau levels in quantum Hall regime. We find that the <b>quantized</b> step can be greatly enhanced for incident angles near the Brewster angle. Moreover, the Brewster angle is sensitive to the Hall conductivity, and therefore the <b>quantized</b> GH effect can be modulated by the Fermi energy and the external magnetic field. The giant <b>quantized</b> GH effect offers a convenient way to determine the <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity and the discrete Landau levels by a direct optical measurement.

25|$|At the Solvay conference, the {{question}} of <b>quantizing</b> other motions was raised, and Lorentz pointed out a problem. If you consider a quantum pendulum whose string is shortened very slowly, the quantum number of the pendulum cannot change because at no point is there a high enough frequency to cause a transition between the states. But {{the frequency of the}} pendulum changes when the string is shorter, so the quantum states change energy.|$|E
25|$|Another example where sub-Nyquist {{sampling}} is optimal arises {{under the}} additional constraint that the samples are quantized in an optimal manner, as in a combined system of sampling and optimal lossy compression. This setting is relevant {{in cases where}} the joint effect of sampling and quantization is to be considered, and can provide a lower bound for the minimal reconstruction error that can be attained in sampling and <b>quantizing</b> a random signal. For stationary Gaussian random signals, this lower bound is usually attained at a sub-Nyquist sampling rate, indicating that sub-Nyquist sampling is optimal for this signal model under optimal quantization.|$|E

500|$|Dirac {{took this}} one step further. He treated the {{interaction}} between a charge and an electromagnetic field as a small perturbation that induces transitions in the photon states, changing the numbers of photons in the modes, while conserving energy and momentum overall. Dirac was able to derive Einstein's [...] and [...] coefficients from first principles, and showed that the Bose–Einstein statistics of photons is a natural consequence of <b>quantizing</b> the electromagnetic field correctly (Bose's reasoning went in the opposite direction; he derived Planck's law of black-body radiation by assuming B–E statistics). In Dirac's time, {{it was not yet}} known that all bosons, including photons, must obey Bose–Einstein statistics.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a novel rate {{calculation}} algorithm called <b>quantized</b> rate selection (QRS) for <b>quantized</b> undithered dynamic supply voltage scaling (DSVS) systems. The algorithm monitors the total buffered workload, and where possible selects a rate value equal to a <b>quantized</b> rate value. At <b>quantized</b> rate values, energy dissipation of <b>quantized</b> DSVS systems approaches continuous voltage level DSVS systems. Our experimental work on FMIDCT computation using nine video sequences and a 4 -level <b>quantized</b> undithered system shows that additional energy savings of 1. 4 % to 18. 5 % can be achieved from QRS, compared to the existing averaging technique.

2500|$|The {{resulting}} Lagrangian is symmetric {{under the}} exchange of [...] with [...] [...] For [...] this Lagrangian will generate exactly the same equations of motion of [...] and [...] Therefore, {{from the point of}} view of an outside observer, everything is causal. [...] This formulation reflects particle-particle symmetry with the variational principle applied to the N-particle system as a whole, and thus Tetrode's Machian principle. [...] Only if we isolate the forces acting on a particular body do the advanced potentials make their appearance. This recasting of the problem comes at a price: the N-body Lagrangian depends on all the time derivatives of the curves traced by all particles, i.e. the Lagrangian is infinite-order. [...] However, much progress was made in examining the unresolved issue of <b>quantizing</b> the theory. Also, this formulation recovers the Darwin Lagrangian, from which the Breit equation was originally derived, but without the dissipative terms. This ensures agreement with theory and experiment, up to but not including the Lamb shift. Numerical solutions for the classical problem were also found. Furthermore, Moore showed that a model by Feynman and Hibbs is amenable to the methods of higher than first-order Lagrangians and revealed chaoticlike solutions. Moore and Scott showed that the radiation reaction can be alternatively derived using the notion that, on average, the net dipole moment is zero for a collection of charged particles, thereby avoiding the complications of the absorber theory. An important bonus from their approach is the formulation of a total preserved canonical generalized momentum, as presented in a comprehensive review article in the light of quantum nonlocality.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{photonic}} spin Hall effect (SHE) in a graphene-substrate {{system with the}} presence of external magnetic field. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate that the in-plane and transverse spin-dependent splittings in photonic SHE exhibit different <b>quantized</b> behaviors. The <b>quantized</b> SHE can be described as a consequence of a <b>quantized</b> geometric phase (Berry phase), which corresponds to the <b>quantized</b> spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, an experimental scheme based on quantum weak value amplification is proposed to detect the <b>quantized</b> SHE in terahertz frequency regime. By incorporating the quantum weak measurement techniques, the <b>quantized</b> photonic SHE holds great promise for detecting <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity and Berry phase. These results may bridge the gap between the electronic SHE and photonic SHE in graphene. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures. Some improvements have been mad...|$|R
