40|$|Coxiella burnetii, the {{etiologic}} agent for <b>Query</b> <b>fever</b> (Q fever) was first {{described in the}} 1930 s in Australia. The organism has since been identified in countries worldwide except for New Zealand. 6 Large amounts of the zoonotic bacteria are shed from infected animals in birthing products and also, {{to a lesser extent}} in feces, urine, milk, and vaginal mucus. 6 The bacteria are resistant to heat, drying, and light making them very environmentally stable. 8 This agent repli cates in a diverse range of animal hosts including cattle, sheep, and goats, which can act as reservoirs for human dis ease. 6 The disease in human beings and animals can be asymptomatic. 6 Chronic exposures can produce abortions, stillbirths, and infertility issues in animals, and endocarditis in human beings. Infectious material can travel on the wind up to 10 miles dispersing the bacteria far from the initia...|$|E
40|$|The {{inability}} to propagate obligate intracellular pathogens under axenic (host cell-free) culture conditions imposes severe experimental constraints that have negatively impacted progress in understanding pathogen virulence and disease mechanisms. Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of human Q (<b>Query)</b> <b>fever,</b> is an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen that replicates exclusively in an acidified, lysosome-like vacuole. To define conditions that support C. burnetii growth, we systematically evaluated the organism's metabolic requirements using expression microarrays, genomic reconstruction, and metabolite typing. This led to {{development of a}} complex nutrient medium that supported substantial growth (approximately 3 log 10) of C. burnetii in a 2. 5 % oxygen environment. Importantly, axenically grown C. burnetii were highly infectious for Vero cells and exhibited developmental forms characteristic of in vivo grown organisms. Axenic cultivation of C. burnetii will facilitate studies of the organism's pathogenesis and genetics and aid development of Q fever preventatives such as an effective subunit vaccine. Furthermore, the systematic approach used here may be broadly applicable to development of axenic media that support growth of other medically important obligate intracellular pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Over a 34 -mo period {{we studied}} 51 {{patients}} with Q fever and 102 control subjects (with various lower-respiratory-tract infections) who were matched for age, sex, {{and time of}} onset of infection. By univariate analysis (not adjusted for multiple comparisons), cases differed significantly from controls in the following activities: working on a farm; slaugh-tering or dressing animals; and contact with cats, cattle, and sheep. The strongest associa-tion was with exposure to stillborn kittens-ll of 51 cases vs, none of 102 controls (P <. 00 (00) - and with exposure to parturient cats (odds ratio, 10. 3; 95070 confidence inter-val, 3. 5 - 31. 8). Exposures to newborn animals (chiefly kittens) and stillborn kittens were significant risk factors by multivariate analysis, as were rural residence and slaughtering or dressing animals. In 13 Q fever incidents following exposure to parturient cats, 80 peo-ple became ill, 52 of whom had serological evidence of recent Coxiella burnetiiinfection (most of the others were not tested). Q (<b>query)</b> <b>fever</b> was first described in 1937 as a fe-brile illness affecting abbatoir workers in Queens-land, Australia [1], but has sincebeen reported world-wide [2].

40|$|Coxiella burnetii is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium {{that causes}} <b>Query</b> (Q) <b>fever,</b> a zoonotic disease. It requires a functional type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) which translocate bacterial effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm and thereby facilitates bacterial replication. To date, more than 130 effector proteins have been identified, but their functions remain largely unknown. Recently, we demonstrated {{that one of}} these proteins, CaeA (CBU 1524) localized to the host cell nucleus and inhibited intrinsic apoptosis of HEK 293 or CHO cells. In the present study we addressed the question whether CaeA also affects the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Ectopic expression of CaeA reduced extrinsic apoptosis and prevented the cleavage of the executioner caspase 7, but did not impair the activation of initiator caspase 9. CaeA expression resulted in an up-regulation of survivin (an inhibitor of activated caspases), which, however, was not causal for the anti-apoptotic effect of CaeA. Comparing the sequence of CaeA from 25 different C. burnetii isolates we identified an EK (glutamic acid/ lysine) repetition motif as a site of high genetic variability. The EK motif of CaeA was essential for the anti-apoptotic activity of CaeA. From these data, we conclude that the C. burnetii effector protein CaeA interferes with the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway. The process requires the EK repetition motif of CaeA, but is independent of the upregulated expression of survivin.

40|$|<b>Query</b> (Q) <b>fever</b> is a {{globally}} distributed {{zoonotic disease}} caused by Coxiella burnetii, a bacterial agent for which ruminants {{are the most}} prevalent natural reservoir. Data regarding Q fever infection in camels in Algeria are limited. Therefore, a survey to detect seroprevalence of C. burnetii antibodies was conducted among healthy camel populations in a vast area in southeastern Algeria to determine distribution of the Q fever causative organism and to identify risk factors associated with infection. Between January and March 2016, blood samples were collected from 184 camels and serum samples were subsequently analysed using a commercial Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) kit. At the time of blood collection, a questionnaire investigating 13 potential predisposing factors associated with C. burnetii seropositivity was completed for every dromedary camel and herd. Results were analysed by a chi-square (χ 2) test and multivariate logistic regression. The seroprevalence of C. burnetii at the animal level was 71. 2 % (95 % CI: 65. 2 – 78. 3) and 85. 3 % (95 % CI: 72. 8 – 97. 8) at the herd level. At the animal level, differences in seroprevalence were observed because of herd size, animal age, animal sex, presence of ticks and contact with other herds. A multivariable logistic regression model identified three main risk factors associated with individual seropositivity: (1) age class > 11 years (OR = 8. 81, 95 % CI: 2. 55 – 30. 41), (2) herd size > 50 head (OR = 4. 46, 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 19. 59) and (3) infestation with ticks (OR 2. 2; 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 4. 5). This study of seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection in camels in Algeria revealed a high seroprevalence of Q fever in camel populations in southeastern Algeria and provided strong evidence that Q fever represents an economic, public health and veterinary concern. Appropriate measures {{should be taken to}} prevent the spread of C. burnetii and to reduce the risk of Q fever in farm animals and humans in this agro-ecologically and strategically important region of North Africa. </span...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Over-the-counter-medication (OTC-medication) {{use during}} {{pregnancy}} can be potentially harmful for the fetus. To successfully counsel the patient {{it is important}} to know if the patient is at risk. In this study possible predictors for OTC-medication use were identified and a model was designed to predict OTC-medication use during pregnancy. METHODS: We performed a post-hoc analysis on data collected for a clustered clinical trial to study a screening strategy for <b>Query</b> <b>fever.</b> Pregnant women under supervision of a midwife were eligible for inclusion. These women filled out questionnaires during their pregnancy and post-partum. These questionnaires were used to determine the prevalence and to select possible predictors for OTC-medication use. These predictors were included in a prediction model using multivariate analysis. The discrimination and calibration of the model were assessed with Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis and the Hosmer and Lemeshow test. RESULTS: Of the 1348 women enrolling in the clustered clinical trial, we included 1246 women in this analysis. The prevalence of OTC-medication use was 12. 5 %. The predictors for OTC-medication use in our cohort were: nulliparity, use of prescription medication, the presence of a comorbidity, Body Mass Index between 26 and 30 kg/m 2 and General Practitioner visits. These predictors were used to design a prediction model for OTC-medication use. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic-curve of the prediction model was 0. 667 (95 % CI 0. 620 - 0. 714 P< 0. 001) and the predictive probabilities ranged from 6. 6 % to 57. 4 %. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test indicated good calibration of the model (P = 0. 640). CONCLUSION: It is possible to indicate women at risk for OTC-medication use during pregnancy, using five maternal characteristics that independently contribute to the prediction model. The predictors are easy to estimate and the model is easy to implement in daily practice...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. C. burnetii is a gram-negative bacterium placed in the family rickettsiaceae. It is the etiological agent of Q (<b>query)</b> <b>fever</b> in humans. C. burnetii is an obligate intracellular pathogen that is able to gain entry into and replicate within the host cell phagolysosome. How the bacterium is able to adapt to this harsh, acidic environment is not well understood, and is the focus of our laboratory. Many of the methods used for the elucidation of genetic information about organisms, including homologous recombination, transposon mutagenesis, and the use of reporter expression systems have not been feasible for intracellular bacteria {{because of the lack of}} genetic exchange techniques. Because of these limitations, researchers have used E. coli as a surrogate host for gene expression to characterize C. burnetii proteins. The generation of efficient and effective methods to introduce DNA into C. burnetii would enable definition and characterization of various genetic factors, such as key virulence mechanisms, gene expression and regulation, and promoter function. First, we attempted to construct a shuttle vector using the putative origin of replication for the endogenous plasmid, QpH 1. The second aspect of this work was to adapt the published methods of transformation and selection into our lab in order to test the applicability of this method. Third, to improve this transformation strategy, and to provide a more efficient shuttle vector, we tried to add a visual screenable marker to the plasmid, pSKO(+) 1000, to facilitate early detection and selection of transformed organisms. The fourth component was to develop a practical application of the transformation system. A means of manipulating the genome of C. burnetii would be of major importance in the identification and characterization of genes necessary for virulence and for phagolysosomal survival. The successful creation of this system proffers a potentially revolutionizing genetic tool for use with Coxiella burnetii, and perhaps, with other intracellular bacteria...|$|E
