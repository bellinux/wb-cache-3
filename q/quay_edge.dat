60|$|Five minutes afterwards, Philammon, dripping, bruised, and bleeding, was {{crawling}} up the water-steps {{at the lower}} end of the lane. A woman rushed from the postern door, and stood on the <b>quay</b> <b>edge,</b> gazing with clasped hands into the canal. The moon fell full on her face. It was Pelagia. She saw him, knew him, and recoiled.|$|E

"Why, Captain Will {{had just}} come to the Hard--that's to Portsmouth--to speak with mun, and the barge Royal lay again the Hard--so; and our boot alongside--so; and the king he standth {{as it might be}} there, above my head, on the <b>quay</b> <b>edge,</b> and she come in near abreast of us, looking most royal to behold, poor dear! and went to cast about. And Captain Will, saith he, 'Them lower ports is cruel near the water;' for she had not more than a sixteen inches to spare in the nether overloop, as I heard after. And saith he, 'That won't do for going to {{windward}} in a say, Martin.' And as the words came out of mun's mouth, your worship, {{there was a bit of}} a flaw from the westward, sharp like, and overboard goeth my cap, and hitth against the wall, and as I stooped to pick it up, I heard a cry, and it was all over!" ...|$|E

50|$|Rye {{also is an}} {{important}} yachting base, offering the only safe haven for many miles in either direction along this section of Channel coast. Yachts may currently moor either at Rye Harbour or at the Strand <b>Quay</b> at the <b>edge</b> of the town. There have been numerous plans proposed for a modern yacht marina to be built at Rye, but each has foundered on economic or planning grounds.|$|R
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The doors are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important {{in the construction of the}} capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew <b>Quay,</b> decorate the <b>edges</b> of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|R
2500|$|The TTC {{returned}} to building new streetcar routes in 1989. The first new line was route 604 Harbourfront, starting from Union Station, travelling underneath Bay Street and rising to a dedicated centre median on Queen's <b>Quay</b> (along the <b>edge</b> of Lake Ontario) {{to the foot}} of Spadina Avenue. This route was lengthened northward along Spadina Avenue in 1997, continuing to travel in a dedicated right-of-way in the centre of the street, and ending in an underground terminal at Spadina Station. [...] At this time, the route was renamed 510 Spadina to fit with the numbering scheme of the other streetcar routes. This new streetcar service replaced the former route 77 Spadina bus, and since 1997 has provided the main north-south transit service through Toronto's Chinatown and the western boundary of University of Toronto's main campus. The tracks along Queen's Quay were extended to Bathurst Street in 2000 to connect to the existing Bathurst route, providing for a new 509 Harbourfront route from Union Station to the refurbished Exhibition Loop at the Exhibition grounds, where the Canadian National Exhibition is held.|$|R
50|$|Born to Orlis and Hirmina Verginix, Quint was the {{youngest}} of six sons. His father Orlis was a successful sky-pirate captain better known as Wind Jackal who captained the sky-ship Galerider and he and his family lived in an opulent mansion in the Western <b>Quays</b> of the <b>Edge's</b> largest city, Undertown. When Quint was four years old Wind Jackal's quartermaster Turbot Smeal set a fire near their home in an ill-fated attempt to avenge Wind Jackal's refusal to go along with a scheme of his that involved slavery. The fire spread through much of the Western Quays, killing Quint's mother, five brothers and nanny as well as Smeal himself and many others. The smallest member of the family, Quint was able to escape through a skylight and climb across the rooftops, where he was rescued by Wind Jackal returning to Undertown to find his home ablaze. The event left both of them emotionally scarred and Quint with a deep-seated fear of fire, but brought them close together as the only surviving members of their family. Quint then spent the rest of his childhood on a sky-pirate ship, learning the trade from his father.|$|R
