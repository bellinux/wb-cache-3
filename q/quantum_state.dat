5|$|The proton, the electron, and {{the neutron}} are {{classified}} as fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions, such as multiple protons, from occupying the same <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> at the same time. Thus, every proton in the nucleus must occupy a <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> different from all other protons, and {{the same applies to}} all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud. However, a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same <b>quantum</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain quantum effects {{appear to}} be {{transmitted}} instantaneously and therefore faster than c, as in the EPR paradox. An example involves the quantum states of two particles that can be entangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in a superposition of two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> is observed, the other particle's <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> is determined instantaneously (i.e., faster than light could travel from one particle to the other). However, {{it is impossible to}} control which <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.|$|E

40|$|In the {{existing}} formalism of <b>quantum</b> <b>states,</b> probability amplitudes of <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> are com-plex numbers.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate various quantum polarization {{features of}} three-photon <b>quantum</b> <b>states,</b> including product and entangled states with varying purity. The three-photon <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> are categorized into six classes {{based on the}} rotation symmetry of mean, variance, and skewness of the polarization distribution. The representative three-photon <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> in each category is prepared from double-pair emission from pulsed spontaneous parametric down-conversion and quantum interferometry.

5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new <b>quantum</b> <b>state.</b> Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same <b>quantum</b> <b>state.</b> This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same <b>quantum</b> <b>state,</b> bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of each pair in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} {{properties}} of randomly chosen <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> has {{in recent years}} led to many insights into quantum entanglement. In this work, we study private <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> {{from this point of}} view. Private <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> are bipartite <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> characterised by the property that carrying out a simple local measurement yields a secret bit. This feature is shared by the maximally entangled pair of quantum bits, yet private <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> are more general and can in their most extreme form be almost bound entangled. In this work, we study the entanglement properties of random private <b>quantum</b> <b>states</b> and show that they are hardly distinguishable from separable states and thus have low repeatable key, despite containing one bit of key. The technical tools we develop are centred around the concept of locally restricted measurements and include a new operator ordering, bounds on norms under tensoring with entangled states and continuity bounds for relative entropy measures.

5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior is modeled by pairs of electrons entering a <b>quantum</b> <b>state</b> known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E

In {{the case of a}} classical computer, we sample from the probability distribution on the three-bit register to obtain one definite three-bit string, say 000.

This destroys the original <b>quantum</b> <b>state.</b> Many algorithms will only give the correct answer with a certain probability.
