5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.

In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{solar wind}} is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> a {{terrestrial}} wind, in that its origin is the sun, {{and it is}} composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere.

The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> what is commonly understood by violence.

Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

5|$|Structurally, Amir's {{early works}} are <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> his later ones. The works {{compiled}} in Buah Rindu generally followed the traditional pantun and syair style of quatrains with tail rhymes, including many with rhyming couplets; some works, however, combined the two, or had additional lines or more words than traditionally acceptable, {{resulting in a}} different rhythm. Though these early works were not as detailed as Amir's later works, Teeuw writes that they did reflect the poet's mastery of the language and his drive to write poems. Works in this anthology repeated terms of sadness such as menangis (cry), duka (grief), rindu (longing), and air mata (tears), as well as words such as cinta (love), asmara (passion), and merantau (wander).|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> <b>from</b> that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
