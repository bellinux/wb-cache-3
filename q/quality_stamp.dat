Dairy farmers have been less extensively studied. In Fin-land, the annual incidence of chronic bronchitis appears to be higher in farmers than in nonfarmer control subjects [7]. Cross-sectional studies with control groups have sug-gested that dairy farmers have a moderate, but significant, alteration of their expiratory flow rate [8 – 10]; however, such results have not been confirmed by other studies [11, 12] and, to our knowledge, no longitudinal study of respi-ratory function has been conducted in dairy farmers.

SLR validation, as carried out by SPEX (acronym for Speech Processing Expertise Centre), typically refers to the first type of action: the quality evaluation of a database against a checklist of relevant criteria. These criteria are typically the specifications of the databases, together with some tolerance margins in case deviations are found. The validation of language resources in general, and SLRs in particular, is a rather new type of activity in the area of language and speech technology.

Validation of SLRs is of particular interest to the European Language Resources Association and its distribution agency ELDA ([URL] ELRA offers a wide range of SLRs in its catalogue.

40|$|Solid state superionic {{stamping}} (S 4) is a non-photolithographic {{process for}} etching features into thin metal films which {{has shown the}} capability of reproducing features below 100 nm in recent years. The technique has significant potential because {{in addition to its}} high resolution capability it is both fast and inexpensive. Potential applications for this process include applied plasmonic and surface enhanced Raman scattering substrates, as well as a many other devices which this process would allow to be scaled-down economically. Previous generations of stamps for this process were developed primarily to test the fundamental limits of the technique. However, for S 4 to become practically applicable in an industrial setting requires a body of knowledge surrounding stamp fabrication that allows the stamps to be simpler to produce than an alternate method for fabricating S 4 processed substrates. Specifically, S 4 stamp generation has been hindered by the ability to generate extremely high quality surfaces. With that in mind, several methods for working with traditional Ag 2 S stamps were examined. One goal was to produce larger diameter stamps without resorting to extensive waste of Ag 2 S. The ductile nature of the material was exploited to change the geometry of the material to increase the portion of the stamp actively participating in etching metal. These larger diameter films were also exploited in an attempt to produce sputtering targets in the hope of generating a new method for fabricating high quality stamps. In contrast to work with the previously demonstrated Ag 2 S stamps, alternative materials for S 4 patterning were also examined based on applicability to the S 4 process. A class of silver conducting superionic materials was identified as potentially beneficial for S 4 based on their low melting points and glass transition temperatures. These compounds opened the possibility of a nano-imprint inspired stamp generation process that would scale to significantly larger areas while producing higher <b>quality</b> <b>stamp</b> surfaces. The silver iodide silver metaphosphate glass system was singled out as most promising for S 4 stamps. This material was synthesized, characterized, and developed into a rudimentary S 4 stamp, where it demonstrated a significant improvement over the previously reported superionic stamp materials. Silver features as small as 30 nm were reproduced from a silicon mold with nanoscale dots. Overall these scalable glass stamps possess similar resolution to previous stamps, while being facile to fabricate...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} concepts, processes, tools and {{challenges}} {{relating to the}} validation of alternative methods for toxicity and safety testing. In general terms, validation {{is the process of}} assessing the appropriateness and usefulness of a tool for its intended purpose. Validation is routinely used in various contexts in science, technology, the manufacturing and services sectors. It serves to assess the fitness- for-purpose of devices, systems, software up to entire methodologies. In the area of toxicity testing, validation plays an indispensable role: “alternative approaches” are increasingly replacing animal models as predictive tools {{and it needs to be}} demonstrated that these novel methods are fit for purpose. Alternative approaches include in vitro test methods, non-testing approaches such as predictive computer models up to entire testing and assessment strategies composed of method suites, data sources and decision-aiding tools. Data generated with alternative approaches are ultimately used for decision-making on public health and the protection of the environment. It is therefore essential that the underlying methods and methodologies are thoroughly characterised, assessed and transparently documented through validation studies involving impartial actors. Importantly, validation serves as a filter to ensure that only test methods able to produce data that help to address legislative requirements (e. g. EU’s REACH legislation) are accepted as official testing tools and, owing to the globalisation of markets, recognised on international level (e. g. through inclusion in OECD test guidelines). Since validation creates a credible and transparent evidence base on test methods, it provides a <b>quality</b> <b>stamp,</b> supporting companies developing and marketing alternative methods and creating considerable business opportunities. Validation of alternative methods is conducted through scientific studies assessing two key hypotheses, reliability and relevance of the test method for a given purpose. Relevance encapsulates the scientific basis of the test method, its capacity to predict adverse effects in the “target system” (i. e. human health or the environment) as well as its applicability for the intended purpose. In this chapter we focus on the validation of non-animal in vitro alternative testing methods and review the concepts, challenges, processes and tools fundamental to the validation of in vitro methods intended for hazard testing of chemicals. We explore major challenges and peculiarities of validation in this area. Based on the notion that validation per se is a scientific endeavour that needs to adhere to key scientific principles, namely objectivity and appropriate choice of methodology, we examine basic aspects of study design and management, and provide illustrations of statistical approaches to describe predictive performance of validated test methods as well as their reliability.

Då föräldrarna påverkar ungdomarnas gymnasieval var det viktigt att materialet även skulle rikta sig till dem. Arbetet skedde i samarbete med Teknikcollege Mälardalen, en kvalitetstämpel på utbildning inom teknik och industri. För att kunna genomföra arbetet intervjuade jag studievägledare på två högstadieskolor i Eskilstuna. Jag genomförde också två utprovningar på målgruppen; högstadieelever mellan åldrarna 13 - 16 år. Utprovningarna ägde rum i elevernas vanliga klassrum och skedde gruppvis, det vill säga hela klassen på en gång. Resultatet av arbetet visade att ungdomar uppskattar rak och tydlig information. Det visade sig också att ungdomar, trots den ökade läsningen på mobiltelefoner och datorer, föredrar ett fysiskt material att få hem i brevlådan, speciellt när det kommer till gymnasievalet. Jag försökte skapa korta, informativa texter med fokus på rubrikerna. Det var också rubrikerna som var i fokus under mina utprovningar.

The experimental work has been carried out to study the factors affecting the Springback with different thickness of sheet metal and at different die angles. Spring back is generally referred to as the undesirable change of part shape that occurs upon removal of constraints after forming. It can be considered a dimensional change which occurs during unloading and primarily elastic recovery of the part. In other words, spring back describes the change in shape of formed sheet upon removal from tooling. Spring back {{is one of the key}} factors which influence the <b>quality</b> of <b>stamped</b> sheet metal parts. Experimental study shows the variation in the actual bend angle and the final angle after the removal of the bending force. In this paper mild steel is considered and experimented with 1. 2 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm thickness and is bent at 600, 900 and 1200. Von Misses stresses and Maximum plastic strain at different operating conditions are plotted...|$|R
