40|$|Case summary A 6 -month-old cat was {{successfully}} treated for bilateral <b>quadriceps</b> <b>contracture.</b> Conventional treatments including surgery, dynamic flexion apparatus and physical therapy along with analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs resulted in temporary clinical improvement that was relapsing. The initiation of supplementary corticosteroid treatment with prednisolone coincided with {{an immediate and}} sustained clinical improvement and long-term resolution. Relevance and novel information Successful treatment of bilateral <b>quadriceps</b> <b>contracture</b> has not previously been reported in a cat. <b>Quadriceps</b> <b>contracture</b> remains a challenging condition to treat with some cases unresponsive to therapy. Systemic prednisolone treatment appeared to be of benefit {{in the management of}} this case and may have a role in some cats where muscle contracture appears relapsing in nature. Further prospective investigations in cats with muscle contracture, including muscle biopsies of affected cats, are warranted...|$|E
30|$|In our hospital, from October 1984 to December 2004, we {{recognized}} 278 cases of <b>quadriceps</b> <b>contracture,</b> 34 cases of triceps contracture, 12 cases of gluteal muscle contracture, 182 cases of fibrous deltoid muscle [30], 38 cases of fibrous long {{head of the}} triceps [31], and 161 cases of fibrous rectus femoris muscle [32].|$|E
40|$|The {{congenital}} muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are a {{group of}} genetically and clinically heterogeneous hereditary myopathies, characterized by hypotonia and early onset of progressive muscle weakness associated with dystrophic pattern on muscle biopsy. The clinical course is variable and brain and eyes can be involved. We report the main clinical and diagnostic data concerning the CMD related to laminin alpha 2 deficiency observed in two Great Dane dogs. Two one-month-old Great Dane puppies, a male and a female, were referred because of <b>quadriceps</b> femoris <b>contracture,</b> which resulted in hyperextension of the pelvic limbs. In the male dog the contracture was bilateral associated with ocular malformation and neurological deficit signs, whereas, in the female only the left hindlimb was affected. Serological examination and PCR on blood and cerebral liquor samples were negative for Neospora canis and Toxoplasma gondii. EMG showed a reduced motor nerve conduction velocity and brain TC showed severe hydrocephalus in the male dog. Muscle biopsies of the quadriceps femoris showed, in both animals, dystrophic changes including variability of fiber size, marked endomysial fibrosis and perimysial lipid accumulation. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed absence, in the male, and decrease, in the female, of laminin alpha 2 chain and normal expression of dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated glycoproteins complex. The pathological features described are similar to primary merosin (laminin alpha 2) deficiency in humans. This report is the first description of primary deficit of merosin in dog...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPost-traumatic knee {{stiffness}} {{and loss of}} range of motion is a common complication of injuries to the knee area. The causes of post-traumatic knee stiffness {{can be divided into}} flexion contractures, extension contractures, and combined contractures. Post-traumatic stiffness can be due to the presence of dense intra-articular adhesions and/or fibrotic transformation of peri-articular structures. Various open and arthroscopic surgical treatments are possible. A precise diagnosis and understanding of the pathology is mandatory prior to any surgical treatment. Failure is imminent if all pathologies are not addressed correctly. From a general point of view, a flexion contracture is due to posterior adhesions and/or anterior impingement. On the other hand, extension contractures are due to anterior adhesions and/or posterior impingement. This overview will describe the different modern surgical techniques for treating post-traumatic knee stiffness. Any bony impingements must be treated before soft tissue release is performed. Intra-articular stiff knees with a loss of flexion can be treated by an anterior arthroscopic arthrolysis. Extra-articular pathology causing a flexion contracture can be treated by open or endoscopic <b>quadriceps</b> release. Extension <b>contractures</b> can be treated by arthroscopic or open posterior arthrolysis. Postoperative care (analgesia, rehabilitation) is essential to maintaining the range of motion obtained intra-operatively...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Prolonged {{need for}} {{intensive}} care {{is associated with}} neuromuscular weakness, termed Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness. Those affected suffer from severe functional impairment that can persist for years. First studies suggest a positive effect of physiotherapy and early mobilisation. However, the ideal intervention for a preferential functional outcome is not known. So far no randomised controlled trial has been conducted to specifically evaluate an early endurance and resistance training in the mechanically ventilated, critically ill patient. METHODS/DESIGN A randomised controlled trial with blinded assessors and 6 -month follow-up will be conducted in a tertiary, interdisciplinary intensive care unit in Switzerland. Participants (n[*]=[*] 115; expected dropouts: n[*]=[*] 15) will be randomised to a control group receiving standard physiotherapy and to an experimental group that undergoes early mobilisation combined with endurance and resistance training. The inclusion criteria are being aged 18  years or older, expected mechanical ventilation for more than 72  h and qualitative independence before the illness. Primary endpoints are functional capacity (6 -Minute Walk Test) {{and the ability to}} perform activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure) measured at hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints include muscle strength (Medical Research Council sum score, handgrip strength and handheld dynamometry for <b>quadriceps</b> muscle), joint <b>contractures</b> (range of motion), exercise capacity (Timed 'Up & Go' Test) and health-related quality of life (Short Form 36). Safety will be monitored during interventions by indirect calorimetry and continuous intensive care standard monitoring. All previously defined adverse events will be noted. The statistical analysis will be by intention-to-treat with the level of significance set at p[*]<[*] 0. 05. DISCUSSION This prospective, single-centre, allocation-concealed and assessor-blinded randomised controlled trial will evaluate participant's function after an early endurance and resistance training compared to standard care. Limitations of this study are the heterogeneity of the critically ill and the discontinuity of the protocol after relocation to the ward. The strengths lie in the pragmatic design and the clinical significance of the chosen outcome measures.

30|$|This second etiology, patellar {{dislocation}} {{secondary to}} intramuscular injections, {{was the subject}} of our study. In 1961, Hnĕvkovský [4] first stimulated an interest in this etiology by his report of progressive fibrosis of the vastus intermedius in young children who had received intramuscular antibiotic injections. Gunn [5] demonstrated a causal relationship between intramuscular injections and <b>quadriceps</b> <b>contracture,</b> which, in turn, led to the habitual dislocation of the patella. Although all the conditions we now associate with this contracture are well known, the importance of the underlying muscle condition in each case has not been stressed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo release {{extension}} contracture of the knee, {{the authors}} used a minimally invasive technique: percutaneous quadriceps tendon pie-crusting release. Percutaneous pie-crusting release was performed using an 18 -gauge needle to puncture the stiff fibrous {{band of the}} distal and lateral quadriceps tendon under maximum knee flexion. <b>Quadriceps</b> <b>contracture</b> was gradually released by multiple needle punctures. A knee brace was prescribed for one week and knee flexion exercises were performed on the first postoperative day. This technique was performed in seven post-traumatic stiff knees and five stiff total knee arthroplasties. Mean maximum flexion increased from 37 o preoperatively to 50 o after arthrolysis and 107 o after pie-crusting. At a mean follow-up of eight months, mean maximum flexion was 103 o. There were no major complications. The technique of quadriceps tendon pie-crusting release is a simple, minimally invasive and effective treatment for knee extension contracture...|$|E
