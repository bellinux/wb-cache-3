50|$|The Vocational Qualification Transfer System (VQTS) {{model is}} a {{proposal}} for a structured description of work-related competences. The core elements are the Competence Matrix and the Competence Profiles. A Competence Matrix displays competences structurally in a table according to core work tasks in a specific occupational field (“competence area”) and the progress of competence development (“step of competence development”). Competence Profiles are formed from individual parts of this Competence Matrix. In the context of ECVET the VQTS project sought to support the transnational mobility of learners. A Competence Matrix can be used for the development of <b>qualifications,</b> <b>training</b> programmes, and job profiles, as well as for human resource planning, the allocation of qualifications to the Qualifications Framework, and for developing higher permeability between vocational education and higher education.|$|E

50|$|Still {{not fully}} benefitting from the {{benefits}} of global markets, in Malta {{it is almost impossible}} for disabled people to ‘try before they buy’ when ordering specialised ICT equipment. That is why, in 2009, FITA identified sponsorship from local enterprises {{in order to create a}} pool of ICT equipment which people could try out and also borrow, prior to any decision on their part to purchase the equipment. Also in 2009, a number of persons with disability spurred by FITA, helped compile and publish a Career Path document, which helped trace and match the different ICT <b>qualifications,</b> <b>training</b> institutions and ICT jobs applicable to the local industry. This information has now been superseded by the EU-funded European e-Competence Framework 3.0.

5000|$|All State Constables are {{certified}} as qualified {{for public service}} as a law enforcement officer by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Training Council and this varies from Class 1, 2 or 3 Certification to Advanced or Basic State Constable Certification in order to comply with SC ST 23-23-40 titled Certification Requirement.

[...] In 1989 all State Constables were required to be certified {{if they were to}} maintain a Commission since they serve as law enforcement officers and have authority to enforce the laws.

5000|$|Many {{types of}} law {{enforcement}} officers have been created with titles throughout history. One {{of the most common}} types is 'Constable' and multiple references in South Carolina State Law describe various law enforcement officers having powers of constable with this authority originating from Common Law. Continual referencing by officials as to their authority and intent come from State Supreme Court rulings referenced throughout history in South Carolina with the following language, [...] "...State Constables possess the authority of regularly commissioned peace officers, including powers of arrest." [...] (State v. Luster, 1935), [...] "Our Supreme Court has stated that constables perform all the duties {{of law enforcement}} officers and in particular 'a constable stands on the same footing as a sheriff.'" [...] (State v. Franklin, 1908). However, with this language explaining their authority, State Law also specifies that SLED has regulatory authority of State Constables for specifying <b>qualifications,</b> <b>training</b> and general oversight of the State Constable Program including limits on use of their law enforcement authority. Constableship in South Carolina consists {{of a wide range of}} laws and regulations with the intent to help provide an effective and efficient resource of law enforcement personnel for the citizens and agencies of South Carolina.|$|E
