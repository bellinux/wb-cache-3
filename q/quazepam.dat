25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> has potent sleep {{inducing}} {{and sleep}} maintaining properties. Studies in both {{animals and humans}} have demonstrated that EEG changes induced by <b>quazepam</b> resemble normal sleep patterns whereas other benzodiazepines disrupt normal sleep. <b>Quazepam</b> promotes slow wave sleep. This positive effect of <b>quazepam</b> on sleep architecture {{may be due to}} its high selectivity for type1 benzodiazepine receptors as demonstrated in animal and human studies. This makes <b>quazepam</b> unique in the benzodiazepine family of drugs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> has an {{absorption}} half-life of 0.4 {{hours with}} a peak in plasma levels after 1.75 hours. It is eliminated both renally and through feces. The active metabolites of <b>quazepam</b> are 2-oxoquazepam and N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam. The N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite has only limited pharmacological activity {{compared to the}} parent compound <b>quazepam</b> and the active metabolite 2-oxoquazepam. <b>Quazepam</b> and its major active metabolite 2-oxoquazepam both show high selectivity for the type1 GABAA receptors. The elimination half-life range of <b>quazepam</b> is between 27 and 41 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} rate {{is likely to}} be significantly reduced if <b>quazepam</b> is taken in the fasted state reducing the hypnotic effect of <b>quazepam.</b> If 3 or more hours have passed since eating food then some food should be eaten before taking <b>quazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{may occur}} to <b>quazepam</b> but {{more slowly than}} seen with other benzodiazepines such as triazolam. However, <b>quazepam</b> causes {{significantly}} less drug tolerance and less withdrawal symptoms including less rebound insomnia upon discontinuation compared to other benzodiazepines. <b>Quazepam</b> may cause less rebound effects than other type1 benzodiazepine receptor selective nonbenzodiazepine drugs due to its longer half-life. Short-acting hypnotics often cause next day rebound anxiety. <b>Quazepam</b> due to its pharmacological profile does not cause next day rebound withdrawal effects during treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> (marketed under {{brand names}} Doral, Dormalin) is a {{relatively}} long-acting benzodiazepine derivative drug developed by the Schering Corporation in the 1970s. <b>Quazepam</b> is indicated {{for the treatment of}} insomnia including sleep induction and sleep maintenance. <b>Quazepam</b> induces impairment of motor function and has relatively (and uniquely) selective hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties with considerably less overdose potential than other benzodiazepines (due to its novel receptor-subtype selectively). <b>Quazepam</b> is an effective hypnotic which induces and maintains sleep without disruption of the sleep architecture. <b>Quazepam</b> is a trifluoroalkyl type of benzodiazepine, like fletazepam, halazepam, triflubazam and triflunordazepam. <b>Quazepam</b> is unique amongst benzodiazepines in that it selectively targets the GABAA α1 subunit receptors which are responsible for inducing sleep. Its mechanism of action is very similar to zolpidem and zaleplon in its pharmacology and can successfully substitute for zolpidem and zaleplon in animal studies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> {{has fewer}} side effects than other benzodiazepines and less {{potential}} to induce tolerance and rebound effects. There is significantly less potential for <b>quazepam</b> to induce respiratory depression or to adversely affect motor coordination than other benzodiazepines. The different side effect profile of <b>quazepam</b> {{may be due}} to its more selective binding profile to type 1 benzodiazepine receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> is more {{tolerable}} {{for elderly}} patients compared to flurazepam {{due to its}} reduced next day impairments. However, another study showed marked next day impairments after repeated administration due to accumulation of <b>quazepam</b> and its long-acting metabolites. Thus the medical literature shows conflicts on quazepam's side effect profile. A further study showed significant balance impairments combined with an unstable posture after administration of <b>quazepam</b> in test subjects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as zaleplon and zolpidem. As a result, <b>quazepam</b> {{has little or no}} muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus <b>quazepam</b> may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, it has a very long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. <b>Quazepam</b> may also cause less drug tolerance than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and triazolam perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of <b>quazepam</b> may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of <b>quazepam,</b> the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of <b>quazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> modulates {{specific}} GABAA receptors via the benzodiazepine {{site on the}} GABAA receptor. This modulation {{enhances the}} actions of GABA, causing an increase in opening frequency of the chloride ion channel which results in an increased influx of chloride ions into the GABAA receptors. <b>Quazepam,</b> unique amongst benzodiazepine drugs selectively targets type1 benzodiazepine receptors which results reduced sleep latency in promotion of sleep. <b>Quazepam</b> also has some anticonvulsant properties.|$|E
25|$|No firm {{conclusions}} can be drawn, however, whether {{long-term use}} of <b>quazepam</b> does not produce tolerance as few, if any, long-term clinical trials extending beyond 4 weeks of chronic use have been conducted. <b>Quazepam</b> should be withdrawn gradually if used beyond 4 weeks of use to avoid {{the risk of a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome developing. Very high dosage administration over prolonged periods of time, up to 52 weeks, of <b>quazepam</b> in animal studies provoked severe withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation, including excitability, hyperactivity, convulsions and the death of two of the monkeys due to withdrawal-related convulsions. More monkeys died however, in the diazepam-treated monkeys. In addition it has now been documented in the medical literature that one of the major metabolites of <b>quazepam,</b> N-desalkyl-2-oxoquazepam (N-desalkylflurazepam), which is long-acting and prone to accumulation, binds unselectively to benzodiazepine receptors, thus <b>quazepam</b> may not differ all that much pharmacologically from other benzodiazepines.|$|E

25|$|Accumulation {{of one of}} {{the active}} {{metabolites}} of <b>quazepam,</b> N-desalkylflurazepam, may occur in the elderly. A lower dose may be required in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> {{is a drug}} {{with the}} {{potential}} for misuse. Two types of drug misuse can occur either recreational misuse is where the drug is taken to achieve a high or when the drug is continued long term against medical advice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quazepam</b> is {{used for}} {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia related to sleep induction or sleep maintenance problems and has demonstrated superiority over other benzodiazepines such as temazepam. It had a fewer incidence of side effects than temazepam, including less sedation, amnesia, and less motor-impairment. Usual dosage is 7.5 to 15mg orally at bedtime.|$|E
25|$|Triazolam {{is usually}} used for {{short-term}} treatment of acute insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag. It {{is an ideal}} benzodiazepine for this use because its fast onset of action and short half-life. It puts a person to sleep for not more than 1.5 hours (approximately 1–2 hours), allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. Triazolam is also sometimes used as an adjuvant in medical procedures requiring anesthesia or to reduce anxiety during brief events like MRI scans and non-surgical dental procedures. Triazolam is ineffective in maintaining sleep however, due to its short half-life with <b>quazepam</b> showing superiority.|$|E
25|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that there is considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of non-drug treatments for insomnia in adults {{of all ages and}} that these interventions are underutilized. Compared with the benzodiazepines including <b>quazepam,</b> the nonbenzodiazepine sedative/hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. It was found that newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative/hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. It was concluded that {{more research is needed to}} evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.|$|E
