5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the <b>quilted</b> petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, <b>quilted</b> skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton fabric for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Maya warriors entered {{battle against}} the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. Members of the Maya {{aristocracy}} wore <b>quilted</b> cotton armour, and some warriors of lesser rank wore twisted rolls of cotton wrapped around their bodies. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the <b>Quilted</b> Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E
5|$|Metal armour was {{of limited}} {{use in the}} hot, wet {{tropical}} climate. It was heavy {{and had to be}} constantly cleaned to prevent rusting; in direct sunlight, metal armour became unbearably hot. Conquistadores often went without metal armour, or only donned it immediately prior to battle. They were quick to adopt <b>quilted</b> cotton armour based upon that used by their native opponents, and commonly combined this {{with the use of a}} simple metal war hat. Shields were considered essential by both infantry and cavalry; generally this was a circular target shield, convex in form and fashioned from iron or wood. Rings secured it to the arm and hand.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquistadores {{were largely}} volunteers, {{receiving}} {{the spoils of}} victory instead of a salary; many were experienced soldiers who had already campaigned in Europe. The Spanish expeditions to Central America were launched from three different Spanish jurisdictions, resulting in rival conquests by mutually hostile Spanish captains. Spanish weaponry included swords, firearms, crossbows and light artillery. Metal armour was impractical in the hot, humid climate of Central America and the Spanish were quick to adopt the <b>quilted</b> cotton armour of the natives. The conquistadors were supported by {{a large number of}} Indian auxiliaries drawn from previously encountered Mesoamerican groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossbows}} {{and early}} firearms were unwieldy and deteriorated {{rapidly in the}} field, often becoming unusable {{after a few weeks}} of campaigning due to the effects of the climate. The Maya lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the <b>quilted</b> cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E
5|$|Manco Inca had {{gathered}} more than 30,000troops at Ollantaytambo, among them, {{a large number}} of recruits from tribes of the Amazon Rainforest. Manco Inca's forces were a militia army made up mostly of conscripted farmers with only rudimentary weapons training. This was the regular fare in the Inca Empire, where military service was a duty for all married men between 25 and 50 years old. In combat, these soldiers were organized according to their ethnic group and led into battle by their native leaders, called kurakas. They used melee weapons such as maces, clubs and spears as well as ranged weapons such as arrows, javelins, and slings; protective gear included helmets, shields, and <b>quilted</b> cloth armor. Against the conquistadors, wooden clubs and maces with stone or bronze heads were rarely able to penetrate Spanish armor; slings and other missile throwing weapons were somewhat more effective due to their accuracy and the large size of their projectiles. Even so, Inca soldiers were no match for the Spanish cavalry in open terrain so they resorted to fighting on rough terrain and digging pits in open fields to hinder the mobility of horses.|$|E
5|$|Maya warfare {{was not so}} much {{aimed at}} {{destruction}} of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of <b>quilted</b> cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass and weeds, a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was <b>quilted</b> with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{weaponry}} {{and tactics}} differed greatly {{from that of}} the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. This included the Spanish use of crossbows, firearms (including muskets and cannon), war dogs and war horses. Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority, while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory. The inhabitants of Guatemala, for all their sophistication, lacked key elements of Old World technology, {{such as the use of}} iron and steel and functional wheels. The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish, although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the <b>quilted</b> cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents, allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage.|$|E
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.

5|$|On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war {{strategy}} rarely involved massive invasions; {{more often}} it employed small scale {{methods such as}} attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire {{was among the first}} in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by {{the use of the term}} Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing <b>quilted</b> tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quilted</b> fabric : Sleepers are {{occasionally}} {{made from}} a <b>quilted</b> fabric, incorporating {{a thin layer of}} polyester fiberfill batting for increased warmth. <b>Quilted</b> sleepers using polyester foam as insulation were also made in the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|To trap air {{within the}} <b>quilted</b> sections, making the quilt {{as a whole}} much warmer than its parts.|$|E
25|$|Woolen {{waistcoats}} {{were worn}} over the corset {{and under the}} gown for warmth, as were petticoats <b>quilted</b> with wool batting.|$|E
25|$|The Strategikon {{states the}} Huns {{typically}} used maille, swords, bows, and lances, {{and that most}} Hunnic warriors were armed with both the bow and lance and used them interchangeably as needed. It also states the Huns used <b>quilted</b> linen, wool, or sometimes iron barding for their horses and also wore <b>quilted</b> coifs and kaftans. This assessment is largely corroborated by archaeological finds of Hun military equipment, such as the Volnikovka and Brut Burials.|$|E
25|$|Panniers or side-hoops {{remained}} an essential of court fashion but disappeared everywhere else {{in favor of}} a few petticoats. Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through pocket slits in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. Woolen or <b>quilted</b> waistcoats were worn over the stays or corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats <b>quilted</b> with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of Northern Europe and America.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} {{parthenogenetic}} gastropods have been studied, especially {{with respect to}} their status as invasive species. Such species include the New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), the red-rimmed melania (Melanoides tuberculata), and the <b>Quilted</b> melania (Tarebia granifera).|$|E
25|$|At {{least one}} company, Thermaltake, makes a laptop {{computer}} chill mat (iXoft Notebook Cooler) using sodium sulfate decahydrate inside a <b>quilted</b> plastic pad. The material slowly turns to liquid and recirculates, equalizing laptop temperature and acting as an insulation.|$|E
25|$|Part of the Discovery weight {{optimizations}} {{included the}} {{greater use of}} <b>quilted</b> AFRSI blankets rather than the white LRSI tiles on the fuselage, {{and the use of}} graphite epoxy instead of aluminum for the payload bay doors and some of the wing spars and beams.|$|E
25|$|Rimmer's Space Corps uniform changes {{several times}} {{during the course of the}} show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes <b>quilted</b> and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special Back to Earth, Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the {{addition}} of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a <b>quilted</b> collar.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1980s, popular trends {{included}} wool sport coats, Levi 501s, Hawaiian shirts, shell suits, hand-knit sweaters, sports shirts, hoodies, flannel shirts, reversible flannel vests, jackets {{with the}} insides <b>quilted,</b> nylon jackets, gold rings, spandex cycling shorts, cowboy boots, and khaki pants with jagged seams.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{weapons and}} armor. Among the Fulani-Hausa armies of Sokoto, both horse and rider were shielded. The horse was {{generally}} covered by <b>quilted</b> cotton, stuffed with kapok fiber, and its rider generally rode into battle with finely wrought chain mail, or heavy <b>quilted</b> armor. The chain mail armor showed similarities to Mameluke design, but the quilting combined local invention with religious inspiration. Local armorers sew tightly rolled wads of paper inscribed with Quranic verses into {{the layers of}} cotton, and kapok. Whatever their spiritual powers, they could often blunt sword cuts, but were less effective against arrows. Body armor was supplemented by reinforced leather helmets, and tough shields of elephant or hippo hide. Horse stirrups often made effective weapons in a close fought melee, disemboweling enemy mounts and wounding enemy infantry.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole process}} of {{creating}} a quilt or <b>quilted</b> garment also involves other steps such as designing, piecing, appliqué, and binding. A person who works at quilting is termed a quilter. Quilting {{can be done by}} hand, via a sewing machine, or by a specialized longarm quilting system.|$|E
25|$|Tarebia granifera, {{common name}} (in the {{aquarium}} industry) the <b>quilted</b> melania, is {{a species of}} freshwater snail with an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Thiaridae. This snail is native to south-eastern Asia, but it has become established as an invasive species in numerous other areas.|$|E
25|$|Quilting is {{the process}} of sewing two or more layers of fabric {{together}} to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or <b>quilted</b> garment. Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.|$|E
25|$|Helmets were cone {{shaped and}} {{composed}} of iron or steel plates {{of different sizes}} and included iron-plated neck guards. The Mongol cap was conical in shape and made of <b>quilted</b> material with a large turned-up brim, reversible in winter, and earmuffs. Whether a soldier's helmet was leather or metal depended on his rank and wealth.|$|E
25|$|Bonnets {{could be}} made {{of a variety of}} materials. Bonnets formed from buckram and wire and covered with fashion fabric were very popular. During the warmer seasons, bonnets made of straw, woven horsehair, or {{gathered}} net were also seen. Heavier materials like velvet were favored for winter bonnets, though <b>quilted</b> winter hoods were much more practical and warm.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the layers}} have been <b>quilted,</b> the edges must be {{finished}} and bound. There {{are many different}} ways to bind a quilt. One of the simplest involves sewing {{one side of a}} strip of fabric to the front side of the quilt, through all of the layers of fabric, then folding the strip over to {{the back side of the}} fabric and hand stitching the binding closed.|$|E
25|$|Feathers {{are both}} soft and {{excellent}} at trapping heat; thus, {{they are sometimes}} used in high-class bedding, especially pillows, blankets, and mattresses. They are also used as filling for winter clothing and outdoor bedding, such as <b>quilted</b> coats and sleeping bags. Goose and eider down have great loft, the ability to expand from a compressed, stored state to trap large amounts of compartmentalized, insulating air.|$|E
25|$|A garment often shown {{worn with}} the klivanion was the kremasmata. This was a skirt, perhaps <b>quilted</b> or of pleated fabric, usually {{reinforced}} with metal splints {{similar to those}} found in the arm defences. Although the splinted construction is that most often shown in pictorial sources, there are indications that the kremasmata could also be constructed of mail, scale or inverted lamellar over a textile base. This garment protected the hips and thighs of the wearer.|$|E
25|$|A {{concept car}} {{designed}} by Jennifer Seely of Ford, based on 2013 Ford Mustang GT. The design {{was inspired by}} international products in categories such as jewelry, couture clothing, and architecture. The vehicle included rose-gold chrome accents throughout the exterior and interior; satin-black body; <b>quilted</b> suede seats with leather-wrapped interior upholstery. Modifications will also {{be made to the}} engine, undercarriage, drivetrain, and sound system. The vehicle was unveiled in 2012 SEMA show, during the first SEMA Mustang Build Powered by Women event.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantines {{made great}} use of ‘soft armour’ of <b>quilted,</b> padded textile {{construction}} {{identical to the}} “jack” or aketon found later in the Latin West. Such a garment, called the kavadion, usually reaching to just above the knees with elbow or full-length sleeves, was often the sole body protection for lighter troops, both infantry and cavalry. Alternatively the kavadion could provide the base garment (like an arming doublet) worn under metallic armour by more heavily protected troops. Another form of padded armour, the epilōrikion, could be worn over a metal cuirass.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, dollies, or pallet lifters may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, <b>quilted</b> furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used as an added layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, safety glasses, dust masks, or respirators.|$|E
25|$|Most Byzantine helmets {{are shown}} being worn with armour for the neck. Somewhat less {{frequently}} the defences also cover {{the throat and}} {{there are indications that}} full facial protection was occasionally afforded. The most often illustrated example of such armour is a sectioned skirt depending from the back and sides of the helmet; this may have been of <b>quilted</b> construction, leather strips or of metal splint reinforced fabric. Other depictions of helmets, especially the ‘Caucasian’ type, are shown with a mail aventail or camail attached to the brow-band (which is confirmed by actual examples from the Balkans, Romania, Russia and elsewhere).|$|E
25|$|Whilst Zaitsev regards fashion {{designers}} Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, Gianfranco Ferré and Hubert de Givenchy as idols, his own creations are {{strongly influenced by}} traditional Russian and Slavic styles, and his collections include a variety of theme-based shows reflecting his take on the industry at the time. Past collections include the Millennium of the Christianisation of Russia in 1988; Russian Seasons in Paris in 1988; Agony of Perestroika in 1991; and Recollections of the Future in 19961997. In his creations, Zaitsev includes elements such as traditional Pavlovsky Posad shawls and embroidered <b>quilted</b> jackets, which have been featured in collections such as Expectation of Changes.|$|E
