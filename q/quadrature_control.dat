The improved micro-gyroscope structure decreases the moment arm of the drive decoupled torque, which benefits the suppression of the non-ideal decoupled error. Quadrature correction electrodes are added to eliminate the residual quadrature error. The structure principle and the quadrature error suppression means of the DDMG are described in detail. ANSYS software is used to simulate the micro-gyroscope structure to verify the mechanical coupling error suppression effect. Compared with the former structure, simulation results demonstrate that the rotational displacements of the sense frame in the improved structure are substantially suppressed in the drive mode. The improved DDMG structure chip is fabricated by the deep dry silicon on glass (DDSOG) process. The feedback control circuits with <b>quadrature</b> <b>control</b> loops are designed to suppress the residual mechanical coupling error. Finally, the system performance of the DDMG prototype is tested. Compared with the former DDMG, the quadrature error in the improved dual-mass micro-gyroscope is decreased 9. 66 -fold, and the offset error is decreased 6. 36 -fold.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} work on superconducting transmon qubits in 3 D cavities show that their coherence times are increased by {{an order of}} magnitude compared to their 2 D cavity counterparts. However to take advantage of these coherence times while scaling up the number of qubits it is advantageous to address individual qubits which are all coupled to the same 3 D cavity fields. The challenge in controlling this system comes from spectral crowding, where leakage transition of qubits are close to computational transitions in other. Here it is shown that fast pulses are possible which address single qubits using two <b>quadrature</b> <b>control</b> of the pulse envelope while the DRAG method alone only gives marginal improvements over the conventional Gaussian pulse shape. On the other hand, a first order result using the Magnus expansion gives a fast analytical pulse shape which gives a high fidelity gate for a specific gate time, up to a phase factor on the second qubit. Further numerical analysis corroborates these results and yields to even faster gates, showing that leakage state anharmonicity does not provide a fundamental quantum speed limit...|$|E

40|$|MEMS {{gyroscopes}} are electromechanical {{devices that}} measure rate or angle of rotation. They {{are one of}} the fastest growing segments of the microsensor market. Advances in microfabrication technologies have enabled the implementation of chip scale monolithic gyroscopes (MEMS gyroscopes) with very small form factor that are lightweight and consume little power. Over the past decade, significant amount of research have been directed towards the development of high performance and very small size MEMS gyroscopes for applications in consumer electronics such as smart phones. In this dissertation, high aspect-ratio hemispherical shell structure with continuously curved surface is utilized as the high Q resonator. Being an axial symmetric structure, the 3 D hemispherical shell is able to achieve low frequency (3 ~ 5 kHz) within 2 mm X 2 mm die area. Detailed analysis on energy dissipation also shows its potential to achieve ultra-high quality factor with the selection of high Q material and proper design of support structure. This dissertation presents, for the first time, the analysis, design, fabrication and characterization of a micro-hemispherical resonating gyroscope (μHRG) that has the potential to be used as a whole angle micro-gyroscope. A three-dimensional high aspect-ratio poly- and single crystalline silicon (3 D HARPSS) process is developed to fabricate free-standing, stem-supported hemispherical shell with self-aligned deep electrodes for driving, sensing and <b>quadrature</b> <b>control</b> of the gyroscope. This monolithic process consists of seven lithography steps and combines 3 D micro-structure with curved surfaces with the HARPSS process to create capacitive electrodes with arbitrary gaps around the micro-hemispherical shell resonator (μHSR). Polysilicon is utilized as the structural material due to its isotropic mechanical properties and the potential of achieving high quality factor. The fabrication is demonstrated successfully by prototypes of polysilicon μHRG with diameter of 1. 2 mm and thickness of 700 nm. Frequency response and gyro operation are electronically measured using the integrated electrodes. Quality factor of 8, 500 is measured with frequency mismatch of 105 Hz. Electronic mode matching and alignment are successfully performed by applying tuning voltages and quadrature nulling voltages. An open loop rate sensitivity scale factor of 4. 42 mV/°/s was measured. Design and process optimization of the support structure improved the quality factor to 40, 000. Further improvement of quality factor will enable the demonstration of high performance RIG using polysilicon μHRG. Ph. D...|$|E
