40|$|Standard {{penetrator}} sampling {{systems were}} designed {{in order to}} allow for sampling via penetrators to produce a full set of sample acquisitions including volatile liquids, fine powders, and solid fragments. A gravity harpoon sampler has been designed with a removable tip and a <b>quick</b> <b>coupling.</b> The separation allows for sample handling and eliminates sample cross-contamination. Also, this design allows for multiple use of the penetrator body, which is the largest and heaviest part of the penetrator, while allowing for multiple changes of the light-mass, penetrator tip to avoid sample cross-contamination. The penetrator tip design has been improved by adding a spring trap to retain the sample, as well as a means for connecting to a <b>quick</b> <b>coupling.</b> Quick connect tips have been demonstrated in a sample handling carousel. The penetrator was released and rewound and the tips were released into a circular platter for rotation into instrument stations. The pyro-harpoon sampler was fabricated and tested with a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI) pyrotechnic charge. Initial tests collected cryogenic ice, but removal of the small pyro-harpoon from the ice was difficult. A brass metal sheath was then fitted over the harpoon tip, and removal from the ice was greatly alleviated by leaving the sheath in the ice. Quartz windows in the tips allow direct optical and spectral imaging and gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS) pyrolysis, and were found to survive impact. All systems were successfully tested by dropping into sand and into cryogenic ice...|$|E

40|$|Cyclooxygenase isoform- 2 (COX- 2) and microsomal {{prostaglandin}} E 2 synthase- 1 (mPGES- 1) are inducible {{enzymes that}} become up-regulated in inflammation and some cancers. It {{has been demonstrated}} that their coupling reaction of converting arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandin (PG) E 2 (PGE 2) is responsible for inflammation and cancers. Understanding their coupling reactions at the molecular and cellular levels is a key step toward uncovering the pathological processes in inflammation. In this paper, we describe a structure-based enzyme engineering which produced a novel hybrid enzyme that mimics the coupling reactions of the inducible COX- 2 and mPGES- 1 in the native ER membrane. Based on the hypothesized membrane topologies and structures, the C-terminus of COX- 2 {{was linked to the}} N-terminus of mPGES- 1 through a transmembrane linker to form a hybrid enzyme, COX- 2 - 10 aa-mPGES- 1. The engineered hybrid enzyme expressed in HEK 293 cells exhibited strong triple-catalytic functions in the continuous conversion of AA into PGG 2 (catalytic-step 1), PGH 2 (catalytic-step 2) and PGE 2 (catalytic-step 3), a pro-inflammatory mediator. In addition, the hybrid enzyme was also able to directly convert dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) into PGG 1, PGH 1 and then PGE 1 (an anti-inflammatory mediator). The hybrid enzyme retained similar Kd and Vmax values to that of the parent enzymes, suggesting that the configuration between COX- 2 and mPGES- 1 (through the transmembrane domain) could mimic the native conformation and membrane topologies of COX- 2 and mPGES- 1 in the cells. The results indicated that the <b>quick</b> <b>coupling</b> reaction between the native COX- 2 and mPGES- 1 (in converting AA into PGE 2) occurred in a way so that both enzymes are localized near each other in a face-to-face orientation, where the COX- 2 C-terminus faces the mPGES- 1 N-terminus in the ER membrane. The COX- 2 - 10 aa-mPGES- 1 hybrid enzyme engineering may be a novel approach in creating inflammation cell and animal models, which are particularly valuable targets {{for the next generation of}} NSAID screening...|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style <b>quick</b> release <b>couple,</b> fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R

40|$|Background and aim: Organizations {{must be able}} {{to manage}} change in order to survive in today’s {{competitive}} society. To continue to develop and reach better results is fundamental. Case Company Parker Hannifin Corporation, <b>Quick</b> <b>Coupling</b> Division Europe, Tema Ingenjörsfirman AB, Skövde has an ambition to have an organization that manage changes and continuously improve its performance. That is the reason why this examination work arises. The aim on the examination work is to present a proposal on how the organization more systematic and effective can work with improvements. This has been done by identifying the key success factors for the improvement work in the literature, the company and through the benchmarking-company.   Method: The examination work is done as a qualitative case study with an abducted approach. The data collection has been done through a variety of methods, which are past experience, literature studies, observations and interviews.   The literature indicates several success factors to consider in order to achieving a successful change work. To have core values that the work can rely on and from that create an organization that continually improves. Within the organization can the continuously improvement work be divided in four different levels: individual- local-, cross functional- and global business improvement. The improvement work should in main be driven in a project form with defining roles and reach goals. By comparing the literature and the benchmarking-company are essentially the same success factors identified.   Result and conclusions: The experience inside the case company is that the improvement work is unstructured and slow. The work is mostly in ad-hoc nature and a common destructive method that is uses to solve problem is “fire-extinguishing”. This examination work indicates that the organization is working unsystematic and are missing a structure with defines roles and distinct goals in order to work with changes.   To create a more systematic improvement work the author has given a proposal on how the company can organize. By resting on core values and supporting infrastructure based on improvement teams that work at different levels with defined roles and clear goals is it good assumes to have a successful improvement work.   Suggestions for future research: By using this examination works result, I hope that organizations can be able to achieve a successful improvement work and therefore continuously improving. This examination work delimits itself to only give proposals for actions, and does not scope how the proposals has been implemented in the organization. Therefore, I propose further studies of the implementing process of the improvement work in the organization...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the coupling of a finite element thermal conduction solver with a steady, finite volume fluid flow solver. Two methods were considered for passing boundary conditions {{between the two}} codes - transfer of metal temperatures and either convective heat fluxes or heat transfer coefficients and air temperatures.

The <b>coupled</b> method gave agreement with the analytic solution and a conjugate solution of the simple free disc problem.

40|$|We study quantum {{particles}} at zero {{temperature in}} an optical lattice coupled to a resonant cavity mode. The cavity field substantially modifies the particle dynamics in the lattice, and for strong particle-field coupling {{leads to a}} quantum phase with only every second site occupied. We study the growth of this new order out of a homogeneous initial distribution for few particles as the microscopic physics underlying a quantum phase transition. Simulations reveal that the growth dynamics crucially depends on the initial quantum many-body state of the particles and can be monitored via the cavity fluorescence. Studying the relaxation time of the ordering reveals inhibited tunnelling, which indicates that the effective mass of the particles is increased by the interaction with the cavity field. However, the relaxation becomes very <b>quick</b> for large <b>coupling.</b> Comment: 14 pages 6 figure...|$|R
