25|$|Even {{a return}} to RFK Stadium {{was not enough to}} cure {{whatever}} had been ailing United over the last 2 or 3 months of league play. United fell behind 2–0 against Columbus, but an attempt at a late rally came up short. A penalty kick by Rolfe put United on the scoreboard. Later, Saborio appeared to have tied the score in the 84th minute, off a through pass by Pontius, but the Costa Rican was controversially ruled offside. The result vaulted the Crew {{to the top of the}} standings in the Eastern Conference, while United slipped to 4th place. With dreams of MLS hardware slipping away, D.C. United still had top position in CONCACAF Champions League group play, which the team locked down in their final group match of 2015, a 3–3 draw in Jamaica, against Montego Bay United. The Jamaican side jumped out to an early lead when a <b>quick</b> <b>restart</b> caught out a really makeshift D.C. defense, that included Aguilar making his first start as a fullback, and Jalen Robinson making his first start as a center back. That goal was Montego Bay's first ever tally in CCL play. The home side extended the lead 3 minutes later and took what appeared to be a commanding 3-0 lead early in the second half on a penalty kick, after a phantom foul call against midfielder Jared Jeffrey. D.C. however rallied, with goals by Arrieta and Opare, and earned a draw and a point, when Michael Farfan collected a loose ball deep into stoppage time and aimed his shot into the top corner of the goal. The draw was the first CCL group match that D.C. United didn't win over the last two entries into CONCACAF play, but it did extend their CCL group play unbeaten streak to 8 games and left the team with 10 points, waiting to learn their seeding and knockout round opponent when Champions League play resumes in 2016.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A pool of {{distributed}} volunteer PCs {{presents an}} extremely hostile environment for execution of communicating parallel codes due to system and network heterogeneity, varying availability, and frequent failures. Well known methods for fault tolerance, specifically replication and checkpointing, are challenging to deploy and not sufficient individually to provide continuous forward application progress. As {{the failure of}} a single logical process leads to application failure, the degree of redundancy needed for long running applications is too large to be practical. Checkpointing and rollback does not provide protection against slow and variable speed nodes and is impractical when system wide MTBF is in minutes or less, common for a moderate size volunteer computing pool. The approach taken in this research is to exploit both, but that presents formidable challenges; efficient checkpointing of distributed replicated processes, dynamic management of redundancy, <b>quick</b> <b>restart</b> in a distributed environment, and others. Proposed solution also leverages node selection based on availability prediction. The integrated runtime system is shown to effectively execute moderate size, coarsegrain, communicating codes on a worldwide distributed volunteer environment, a new milestone in volunteer computing. The results provide new insight into how multiple techniques interact and contribute to robustness. The programming model is based on one-sided Put/Get calls to an abstract global shared space that works seamlessly with replicated processes. A Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics code is employed to drive evaluation. The execution environment includes hosts on a University campus as well as hosts distributed around the world.

Recent work in Artificial Intelligence points out that the unpredictability in the running time of heuristic search procedures can often be explained by the phenomenon of heavy-tailed cost distributions. Because of the non-standard nature of these heavy-tailed cost distributions the controled introduction of randomization into the search procedures and <b>quick</b> <b>restarts</b> of the randomized procedure can eliminate heavy-tailed behavior and can take advantage of short runs.

500|$|McMillen {{worked on}} level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested {{primarily}} by the pair and their families. McMillen and Refenes lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, and met only a few times in person while working on the game. They developed the control scheme by iterating through several designs, trying to find one that felt fluid and logical. Rather than use a pre-built game engine, Refenes programmed an original one. The game was initially set to include around 100 levels, and to have co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. During development, however, the multiplayer option was dropped and the number of levels was greatly increased. The pair designed the game to be deliberately [...] "retro", imitating the aesthetics of traditional platform games, but with a modern sensibility regarding difficulty. They wanted the game to be rewarding and challenging, rather than frustrating; to this end they included infinite lives, <b>quick</b> <b>restarts</b> of levels, obvious goals, and short levels.

50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the crankshaft bearing half shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and <b>quicker</b> engine <b>restart</b> within 0.35 seconds.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Recent {{data suggest}} how adverse events occur more {{frequently}} after Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) replacement {{than during the}} deep electrode positioning in patients treated with Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). For instance, erroneous extension adjustment to change in laterality and inaccurate lead connection represent problems, which strongly affect patients outcome. We analyzed our data after 13 years of IPG replacement. Materials and Methods: We treated 107 patients (83 PD and 24 Dystonia) with DBS in 13 years. The Dual Channel IPGs replaced during this period were 91. 25 patients needed more than one replacement, especially among the dystonic population. During surgery, we temporarily marked in all the cases the right extension lead before the disconnection from the exhausted IPG. Good impedances were intraoperatively checked in all the cases. Results: Our surgical technique allowed us to avoid any erroneous change in laterality or abnormal impedances due to a suboptimal connection to the IPG. The mean duration of the operation was 25 min and a <b>quick</b> postoperative <b>restart</b> of DBS was possible in all the cases. Stability of symptoms after IPG replacement was achieved in all the patients, with an accurate clinical management within the first 48 - 72 postoperative hours. Conclusion: Our surgical and postoperative management demonstrates how to avoid some important adverse events with some easy steps, without any discomfort for the patients in terms of duration of surgery or longer hospitalization. Thus, stability of symptoms after the IPG replacement may be easily guaranteed during the first postoperative period...|$|R

40|$|The climate {{during the}} last glacial-interglacial cycle {{exhibits}} distinct climate states and variability in various time scales with different spatial characteristics. These changes occur for natural reasons, but their mechanisms are not well understood. Compared to the research on present-day climate, which involves influences of human activity, {{the investigation of the}} climate {{during the last}} glacial-interglacial cycle can attribute to discover the underlying process of natural climate change, and assistant us to have a better prediction of future climate. Additionally, in comparison to studies on proxies, climate models provide a simplified numerical representation of dynamical and thermodynamical processes governing different components of the Earth’s climate system, which is not able to be recorded in proxy data. In this dissertation work, our first scientific focus is to clarify the mechanistic effects of a higher Northern Hemisphere ice sheet on large-scale North Atlantic Ocean surface circulation and Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) during glacial climate periods. We use the Community Earth System Models (COSMOS) to simulate five representative climate states during the last glacial-interglacial cycle: the Eemian interglacial, Mid Holocene, Pre-industrial (PI), stadial Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3), presented by 32 kilo years before present (ka B. P.), and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). We have examined mean climatological states and variability of major large-scale North Atlantic Ocean surface circulation elements, including the Subtropical Gyre (STG), Subpolar Gyre (SPG), and Gulf Stream. Our results show that the existing Laurentide Ice Sheet and the elevated Greenland Ice Sheet induce increased surface winds over the North Atlantic Ocean during the LGM and MIS 3, which subsequently enhance the North Atlantic gyres and the Gulf Stream. In addition, statistical analysis suggests that the correlation between AMOC and surface winds is increased during glacial climate states. The second part of our work is targeted at the explanation of the difference of abrupt decadal climate changes during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. As documented in Greenland ice cores, abrupt decadal climate changes are less pronounced during maximum glacial conditions and strongly suppressed during the Holocene. We conduct hosing experiments for three different climate states during the last glacial-interglacial cycle (PI, 32 ka B. P. and the LGM). Our results show that the freshening of the surface North Atlantic Ocean leads to a similar reduction of the AMOC due to the freshwater perturbation, independent of the background climate. However, the subsequent recovery stages show distinct tempo-spatial characteristics, with respect to the initial AMOC resumption and the strength of a superposed AMOC overshoot. During the initial AMOC resumption, a stronger temperature inversion between the surface and intermediate layer (200 - 800 m) in the South Labrador Sea induces a <b>quicker</b> <b>restart</b> of convective processes (32 ka B. P. > LGM > PI). A few decades later, an AMOC overshoot is caused by the advection of warmer and saltier tropical Atlantic Ocean water into the South Labrador Sea. In case of a glacial climate background, this provides a strong positive feedback on the initial resumption. In comparison to the 32 ka B. P. experiment, this feedback is noticeably weaker during the LGM, and completely absent during the PI. Furthermore, the temporal isolation of South Labrador Sea and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Sea contributions to the AMOC overshoot highlights the combined role of the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the South Labrador Sea response to the overshoot dynamics. The dependence of the AMOC overshoot and the associated climatic response on the climate state provides a coherent concept in agreement with pronounced rapid climate changes during glacial times, as recorded by proxy data. In addition to use fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model for the studies of different mechanistic processes in the Earth’s climate system, we employ a regional high-resolution ocean model (the North Atlantic/Arctic Ocean-Sea Ice Model) for further understanding of the hydrographic process of the surface Nordic Seas during the LGM, which has been reconstructed to be in different conditions by proxies in the CLIMAP (the Climate Long-Range Investigation, Mapping and Prediction) and GLAMAP (the Glacial Atlantic Ocean Mapping) projects. Using the atmospheric forcing corresponding to the CLIMAP and GLAMAP indicated surface ocean, our experiments successfully rediscovered the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice cover, in agreement with the proxy reconstructions. Furthermore, the internal dynamics in our LGM experiments provide an intermediate cooling conditions in the Nordic Seas, colder than the GLAMAP reconstruction, but warmer than the CLIMAP reconstruction during the LGM. Furthermore, both the GLAMAP and CLIMAP atmospheric forcing lead to similar directions and magnitudes of surface ocean circulation in the Nordic Seas during the LGM, in spite of distinct features of the SSTs and sea ice cover. ...|$|R
25|$|Caution {{number seven}} waved around lap 220, after David Gilliland turned Alex Bowman into the wall. Earnhardt, Allmendinger, and Kurt Busch stayed out, but {{everyone}} else pitted, with Logano coming off of pit road first. After another <b>quick</b> caution and <b>restart</b> for debris, Kurt Busch {{took the lead}} from Earnhardt on lap 243, and Johnson took over from Busch two laps later. The ninth caution waved at lap 250 after Ryan Truex go turned into the wall, {{and all of the}} leaders made pit stops. Kenseth, however, stayed out and reassumed the lead, with Tony Stewart taking second. Johnson and Earnhardt would come out of pit road first to restart third and fourth, respectively. Earnhardt took the lead on lap 260, Johnson took over once again on lap 265, and then Clint Bowyer charged to the front and took the lead on lap 284 but gave it back to Johnson four laps later and faded back a bit. Meanwhile, Kenseth and Stewart, who both stayed out during the previous caution, would fall back quickly, with Kenseth being lapped on lap 304 and Stewart losing a lap ten laps later. Other drivers had problems as well, with Alex Bowman cutting a tire and Denny Hamlin getting a windshield tear-off stuck over the opening to his left-front brake duct. Lap 316 saw the tenth caution as Joe Nemechek slammed the wall, and all of the leaders pitted and retained their positions. The eleventh caution flew on lap 341 as 20th-place Kyle Larson spun out of turn two, and the leaders pitted once again, with Johnson and Bowyer keeping their first and second-place positions. Bowyer nosed ahead on the restart and led a lap, but Johnson retook the lead the next lap as another caution waved for debris. Edwards would nose ahead on the next restart but fail to lead a lap before Johnson pulled away. The 13th caution flew on lap 411 as Brad Keselowski spun Martin Truex, Jr. in turn two, and on the ensuing pit stops, an exiting Edwards hit an entering Matt Kenseth, spinning Kenseth around backwards into his pit stall. Johnson retained the lead on the restart, ahead of Bowyer and Edwards. Kurt Busch would then move up second and challenge Johnson but fell back and was passed by Bowyer. Bowyer then chased Johnson down, and, after a slip by Johnson, took the lead on lap 449. On lap 459, Carl Edwards spun to bring out the 14th caution, and Bowyer fell back to tenth during pit stops, allowing Johnson to retake the lead ahead of Joey Logano. Johnson barely retained the lead on the lap 465 restart, but began to pull away as Kurt Busch slipped into second. Busch would then run down and pass Johnson in about five laps, but Johnson would once again retake the lead on lap 482, with that pass setting a new track record with 32 lead changes. Busch retook the lead on lap 488 (the 33rd lead change) and held off Johnson to break a winless drought dating back to the 2011 AAA 400, ironically another race that Johnson led the most laps in but was beaten late by Busch. Earnhardt finished third, Joey Logano fourth, Marcos Ambrose fifth, and Matt Kenseth sixth.|$|R
