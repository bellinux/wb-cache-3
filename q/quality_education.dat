Soon afterwards, Blackwell and her mother left the plantation to live with him. Blackwell's family traveled frequently in search of work.

Blackwell spent a majority of her early years chopping cotton in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee and peeling tomatoes in Florida.

40|$|Today a need {{to improve}} the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> is in the centre of public attention. A basic problem in the discussions on the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> emerges {{from the fact that}} the term 'quality' is widely interpreted. The text points to {{multiple}} meanings of the term <b>quality</b> of <b>education,</b> and to its different interpretations. The nature and the essence of different theories of education have been recognized, and different interpretations of the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> in them were analyzed. The analysis shows that different approaches to the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> reflect different views on the fact what one would like to accomplish with the education. It means that a definition of the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> has been essentially determined with the education aims. The issue of the <b>quality</b> of <b>education</b> cannot be separated from much broader ethical discussion on values which have been found in its base. Therefore, the text emphasizes {{a need to}} understand numerous philosophies of education, and concludes that promoting only one opinion trend in the theoretical foundation of the quality, while ignoring the others, can have negative consequences on understanding of this complex phenomenon and thus on attempts for its improvement...|$|R
