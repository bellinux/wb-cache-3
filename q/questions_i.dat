500|$|During 1998, several Hispanic {{organizations}} {{organized a}} petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers {{to try to}} convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote. D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of <b>questions,</b> <b>I</b> think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [...] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today." ...|$|E
500|$|Assata Shakur {{was born}} Joanne Deborah Byron, in Flushing, Queens, New York City, on July 16, 1947. She lived {{for three years}} with her mother, school teacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill. In 1950, Shakur's parents {{divorced}} and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. Shakur moved back to Queens {{with her mother and}} stepfather after elementary school, attending Parsons Junior High School. However, she still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. The family struggled financially, and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother's sister Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker, who lived in Manhattan. She has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was [...] "very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i [...] was forever asking all kinds of <b>questions.</b> <b>I</b> wanted to know everything." [...] Williams often took her to museums, theaters, and art galleries, and the conflicts that did rise between the two were typically due to Shakur's habit of lying.|$|E

Hacker is also noted as having challenged Humphrey while {{he was a member of}} the Opposition by asking difficult questions when Sir Humphrey was testifying to a Parliamentary committee: Sir Humphrey stated that Hacker had asked [...] "...all the <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> hoped nobody would ask," [...] showing his new Minister to be at least a reasonably capable politician.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} {{were one of}} the chief inspirations for producing the Living Bible. Our family devotions were tough going because of the difficulty we had understanding the King James Version, which we were then using, or the Revised Standard Version, which we used later. All too often I would ask questions to be sure the children understood, and they would shrug their shoulders—they didn't know what the passage was talking about. So I would explain it. I would paraphrase it for them and give them the thought. It suddenly occurred to me one afternoon that I should write out the reading for that evening thought by thought, rather than doing it on the spot during our devotional time. So I did, and read the chapter to the family that evening with exciting results—they knew the answers to all the <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> asked! ...|$|E

[...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter.
