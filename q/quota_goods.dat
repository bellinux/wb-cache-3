Shelley's poem, the longer of the two, was completed by the early autumn, while Keats's occupied him until the winter which opened 1818. On 8th October, 1817, Keats wrote to a friend, 'I refused to visit Shelley, that I might have my own unfettered scope; meaning presumably that he wished to finish Endymion according to his own canons of taste and execution, without being hampered by any advice from Shelley. There is also a letter from Keats to his two brothers, 22nd December, 1817, saying: 'Shelley's poem Laon and Cythna is out, and there are words about its being objected to as much as Queen Mab was. Poor Shelley, I think he has his <b>quota</b> of <b>good</b> qualities.' As late as February 1818 He wrote, 'I have not yet read Shelley's poem.' On 23rd January of the same year he had written: 'The fact is, he [Hunt] and Shelley are hurt, and perhaps justly, at my not having showed them the affair [Endymion in MS.] officiously; and, from several hints I have had, they appear much disposed to dissect and anatomize any trip or slip I may have made.'

We tested water samples from 16 sites in 3 reservoirs on 2 sampling occasions during a bloom of C. raciborskii in the austral summer and autumn of 2007. Using a range of parameters including quantitative real-time PCR, microscope cell counts and HPLC-MS/MS we correlated the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene with total cyanobacteria, the rpoC 1 gene with C. raciborskii cell concentrations, and the cyrC gene with cylindrospermopsin concentrations to assess spatial and temporal variability within and between reservoirs. While the correlation between cyrC and cylindrospermopsin cell <b>quotas</b> was <b>good</b> (mean r 2 = 0. 61 for February samples and 0. 75 for March samples), the correlation between total cyanobacteria and the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene, and between C. raciborskii and the rpoC 1 gene were poor indicating that further work is needed to develop these novel molecular methods. Spatial and temporal analysis {{of the distribution of}} rpoC 1, cylindrospermopsin cell quotas, and a range of physical and chemical water quality parameters showed the greatest variation occurred between reservoirs, and within the largest and most spatially diverse reservoir. This suggests that populations of C. raciborskii strains with inherently different cylindrospermopsin cell quotas may be an important driver of toxicity in these reservoirs. An outcome of this study was the observation that deoxycylindrospermopsin always exceeded the cylindrospermopsin cell quota by up to 5 -fold, and that a peak cell quota of 60 fg (cylindrospermopsin + deoxycylindrospermopsin) cell- 1 was measured.

40|$|Sustentación de TesisSouth American {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus australis) {{continue}} {{to survive in}} Peru in spite of commercial harvesting, periodic disappearance of prey (i. e., El Niño), and competition with the Peruvian anchoveta fishery. I investigated {{the ability of the}} Peruvian population of fur seals to recover from catastrophic declines at two temporal and spatial scales. The first analysis determined intrinsic rate of growth (r) and the potential carrying capacity (K*—the number of fur seals that could be supported in Peru in the absence of sealing and El Niño) from 1880 – 2010, and the second used pup counts from 1984 – 2010 to determine the relationship between prey abundance and the timing of pupping at an important fur seal breeding site in southern Peru. Model results indicated that South American fur seals in Peru have an intrinsic growth rate r of 0. 20 and a potential carrying capacity K* of 115, 000 seals. Recent counts (2007) show that current population is at 33 % of the estimated mean numbers of fur seals alive from 1880 - 1925. Analysis of 25 years of counts of pups and adult females at the breeding site showed a correlation between anchoveta biomass and mean birth dates (r 2 = 0. 59, P< 0. 01) and with the ratio of pups to females (r 2 = 0. 66, P< 0. 01) in the upcoming breeding seasons. It also revealed a 2 -week shift in the mean birth date that may reflect a change in the age structure of the population. Numbers of pups born tended to be lower in years with low anchoveta biomass, as did recruitment of young females. Monitoring daily numbers of pups born and adult females appears to be a useful means to assess the feeding conditions encountered by South American fur seals in Peru. My study also suggests that South American fur seals are adapted to survive in extremely disturbed environments and have the potential to rapidly recover following population declines. Whether or not they ever again achieve their potential carrying capacity will depend upon protection of breeding rookeries, a continued harvest ban, reduced bycatch, incidental captures and illegal poaching, regulation of anchoveta fishing <b>quotas</b> and <b>good</b> environmental conditions.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. The South African {{clothing}} and textile industry has historically benefited from import substitution industrialisation which protected the industry through tariff and non-tariff barriers from foreign competition. Factors {{such as the}} impact of globalisation, our accession to the World Trade Organisation and the associated effects on trade liberalisation changed South Africa‟s trade policy to move towards export lead growth {{at the threshold of}} South Africa‟s democracy, which paved the way for increased imports from foreign countries. The opening up of the South African economy to foreign competition negatively impacted on the competitiveness of these industries. The {{clothing and}} textile industry has been plagued by various challenges, amongst others, cheap imports especially from China (often illegal), South Africa‟s accelerated tariff reduction programme and currency fluctuations (especially the appreciation of the Rand), which culminated in factory closures and huge job losses. South Africa has since 1994 developed unstructured and uncoordinated sectoral responses to these challenges {{in the absence of a}} comprehensive industrial policy. The government‟s response to deal with the challenges facing the clothing and textile industry was to re-impose protectionist measures via import quotas on certain categories of products from China. These measures were intended to protect the industry and provide it with breathing space to reposition itself and regain its competitiveness, retain existing jobs and create additional jobs. The quest to regain global competitiveness should be founded on a combination of measures (e. g. the legislative and institutional environment, infrastructure, skilled workforce, innovation and networking) designed to satisfy consumer tastes and preferences that aims to improve the potential for growth in the medium to long-term. The objective of this research report was to assess whether the introduction of import <b>quotas</b> on Chinese <b>goods</b> positively contributed to the South African clothing and textile industry in regaining a measure of competitiveness and growth. The basis of the study is informed by a series of personal interviews with the key industry stakeholders which focused on examining the state of the industry, especially the impact of import quotas of certain categories of Chinese goods. The results revealed that the impact of import <b>quotas</b> on Chinese <b>goods</b> failed to provide any significant benefits to the clothing and textile industry since: (i) although there was a reduction in imports from China into South Africa in the quota categories, importers merely sourced their products from other low cost countries (e. g. Pakistan, Vietnam, Mauritius); (ii) there was no significant increase in local output and purchases; and (iii) there was no significant reduction in the number of jobs lost and none created during this period. These results although supported by business and other academic literature are contested by both labour and government. One conclusion was that a comprehensive approach should be pursued to arrest the challenges faced by the clothing and textile industry to reposition itself within the global environment to regain its competitiveness. This requires the active participation of all industry stakeholders and the implementation of appropriate strategies and tactics which is sequenced and coordinated to enhance their collective outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Today equal {{representation}} {{between the}} genders in parliament {{is something to}} be desired. One way to reach the goal of equal representation is by using quotas. The purpose of the study is to research the lack of equality in elected institutions by using a perspective on qoutas.   The study also seeks to find answers to if using <b>quotas</b> is a <b>good</b> method according to gender studies. A text analysis is being used to find reasonable solutions to the study´s presented complivations.   By analyzing different texts about quotas some of the more common arguments in the discussion about using quotas in parliaments were highlighted. Some of the more frequent arguments to implement quotas are that it would be more just but also that women and men may have different interests, experiences and therefore equal representation would be a question of resources. Another argument is that a parliament can only be seen as legitimate if it is equaled represented.   Opponents to political quotas often argue that it would be unfair to use quotas since the terms would be different for women and men.   Other frequently used arguments revolve around quotas being undemocratical. These arguments furthermore deem the competence of people to be of no importance and that no one wants to get the position through allocation by quotas. The study shows that according to gender studies, quotas are something to advocate. The reason is that today women have more barriers to representation in parliaments than men. When women and men are in different spheres the gender order can consist and therefore the structure of power will be the same. By using quotas to achieve equal representation the separation between the genders will also decrease and the structure can change. ...|$|R

This study formed part of the pan-European Science and Technology Research In a Knowledge-based Economy (STRIKE) project. The UK research focused {{on the impact of}} changes in the extent of competition on innovation, technology transfer and productivity, and how these are affected by other institutional factors such as the extent of labour market flexibility and interaction in technology markets. The data collection for this project involved the matching of a number of microeconomic datasets and two datasets are available from the UK Data Archive as part of this study. The first dataset, the European Industry Level Patents Database, was created by matching microdata from the European Patent Office (EPO) PATSTAT database to Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS company accounts database. This allowed the researchers to assign an area of industry activity to the patenting information. The second dataset, the European Import Quotas Database, was created by using product-level microdata from the European Commission's Systeme Integre de Gestion de Licenses (SIGL) quota licensing website and aggregating this information to industry level. Further information is available on the Product Market Competition, Technology and Productivity ESRC Award web page. Main Topics : European Industry Level Patents Database The data are defined at industry level following the US SIC (1987). Information has been aggregated from a firm-level panel constructed through the matching of the EPO PATSTAT database and company accounts records from Bureau van Dijk's ORBIS company accounts database.

40|$|The author investigates {{market power}} and the {{distribution}} of rents in the market for Mexico's exports of apparel tothe United States under the Multi - Fibre Arrangement (MFA). Conventional wisdom holds that voluntary restraints, such as those under the MFA, are superior to other kinds of trade barriers because they allow developing countries to receive the scarcity rents from quantity restriction. Recently {{a number of studies have}} questioned this orthodoxy. Erzan, Krishna, and Tan (1991), in particular, have pointed out that if market power exists only on the side of the importers, they can acquire some of the fixed rents resulting from quotas, in a form of"rent-sharing". In Mexico's case, rents resulting from MFA restrictions are probably small, since few of the quotas imposed are binding. And other institutional arrangements - such as production sharing under HTS 9802 and a liberal <b>quota</b> regime for <b>goods</b> made with U. S. inputs - further mitigate the MFA's restrictiveness. Mexican exporters probably receive only a fraction of available rents, says the author. The welfare implications of MFA restrictions, and of market imperfections that might lead to rent-sharing, are thus not as significant in Mexico as they might be in countries for which conditions are more restrictive. But even for the few rents generated in Mexico's case, some rent-sharing is taking place. The author tests the existence of perfect markets and rent-sharing for six groups of Mexican apparel exports to the United States between 1981 and 1990; sweaters, trousers, men's coats, women's coats, woven shirts, and underwear. There are consistent differences between the unit value of U. S. production and the Mexico export f. o. b. price of apparel in the U. S. market adjusted for tariffs and transport costs. The adjusted price of Mexican exports is consistently below the price for U. S. production, which suggests that rent-sharing may be taking place. Using modifications of the methods of Erzan, Krishna, and Tan (1991), the author tests alternative explanations for the price difference - differences in composition of Mexican exports and U. S. production, and differences in the quality of Mexican exports and U. S. products. The existence of differences in composition between Mexican exports and U. S. production is rejected for three of the six groups. The author also controls for the existence of significant quality differences. The results indicate that rent- sharing may exist for woven shirts and underwear (two of the three groups in the sample that are consistently quota bound). U. S. importers may receive up to 49 percent of available rents.
