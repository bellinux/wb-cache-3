25|$|The CAGE <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} in 1968 at North Carolina Memorial Hospital {{to combat the}} paucity of screening measures to detect problem drinking behaviors. The original study, conducted in a general hospital population where 130 patients were randomly selected to partake in an in-depth interview, successfully isolated four questions {{that make up the}} questionnaire today due to their ability to detect the sixteen alcoholics {{from the rest of the}} patients.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 only 38 {{people were}} {{reported}} to have been prosecuted for refusing to complete a questionnaire. In 2011 those who refused to complete the census questionnaire or included false information could face a fine of up to £1,000. A team of compliance staff were recruited to follow up by visiting those householders who refused to complete a questionnaire or where their <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> not returned or completed correctly.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} of the study was {{designed}} mainly by Christopher Gillberg and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers in all areas of Gothenburg were asked to answer a questionnaire with a series of yes and no questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (The <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.|$|E
30|$|During the study, 3, 736 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> distributed; of these, 3, 416 <b>were</b> returned. After <b>questionnaire</b> screening, 2, 865 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} effective, {{thus the}} return rate of effective <b>questionnaires</b> <b>was</b> 76.7 %.|$|R
30|$|Method: <b>Questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> {{given to}} 100 women {{attending}} the Clinic. Fifty-five completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> returned, including 16 pre-menopausal women (29 %) and 39 postmenopausal women (71 %). <b>Questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> anonymous and returned either {{before leaving the}} department or by post.|$|R
30|$|In group 1, 168 out of 176 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> {{available}} for analysis (95.9 %). Eight <b>questionnaires</b> had to <b>be</b> excluded due to missing information. In group 2, 161 of 202 (79.7 %) <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> analyzed.|$|R
25|$|The main {{interest}} of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> {{to see if a}} participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|The census for England and Wales was trialled in 135,000 {{households}} in Lancaster, the London Borough of Newham and Anglesey on 11 October 2009. A test was also {{carried out in}} Birmingham at the same time. The questions for the 2011 Census {{are the same as}} those trialled in the 2009 Census Rehearsal. The Order for the 2011 Census (including the proposed question topics, census date and who should complete the <b>questionnaire)</b> <b>was</b> laid before Parliament in October 2009 and was approved by Parliament and became law in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 a {{committee}} formed {{with the aim}} of creating an action plan to implement progress for the village. In 2006 a comprehensive <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> produced and given to the villagers to ascertain what actions should be taken. 55% of the questionnaires were returned and general population data recorded by this questionnaire echoed the findings of the 2001 census. The questionnaire resulted in a document called the Ashurst Wood – Village Action Plan which was published in April 2007. The document contained time scales for targets and actions that would be taken.|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{questionnaires}} with a {{wide variety}} of characteristics have been developed for the assessment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Four well-defined dimensions are noticeable in these GERD <b>questionnaires,</b> which <b>are</b> symptoms, response to treatment, diagnosis, and burden on the quality of life of GERD patients. The aim of this review is to develop a complete overview of all available questionnaires, categorized per dimension of the assessment of GERD. A systematic search of the literature up to January 2013 using the Pubmed database and the Embase database, and search of references and conference abstract books were conducted. A total number of 65 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> extracted and evaluated. Thirty-nine <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> found applicable for the assessment of GERD symptoms, three of which <b>are</b> generic gastrointestinal <b>questionnaires.</b> For the assessment of response to treatment, 14 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> considered applicable. Seven questionnaires with diagnostic purposes were found. In the assessment of quality of life in GERD patients, 18 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> found and evaluated. Twenty <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> found to be used for more than one assessment dimension, and eight <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> found for GERD assessment in infants and/or children. A wide variety of GERD <b>questionnaires</b> <b>is</b> available, of which the majority is used for assessment of GERD symptoms. Questionnaires differ in aspects such as design, validation and translations. Also, numerous multidimensional <b>questionnaires</b> <b>are</b> available, of which the Reflux Disease <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>is</b> widely applicable. We provided an overview of GERD questionnaires to aid investigators and clinicians in their search for the most appropriate questionnaire for their specific purpose...|$|R

30|$|Two hundred self-administered <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> {{used for}} {{gathering}} {{data from the}} respondents. A multiple {{method of data collection}} was employed, whereby some Fig.  1 research model <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> mailed to the respondents, some were e-mailed, and some were personally administered. The process of distribution and collection of <b>questionnaires</b> <b>was</b> carried out over a period of 3  months. A total of 2000 <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> received and used for this analysis.

25|$|Having {{established}} the facts, Gordon {{turned to the}} law. He applied the test from Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle, a 1977 Supreme Court decision overturning the firing of a teacher for, among other things, sharing a proposed dress code with the media. First, Myers would {{have to prove that}} her distribution of the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> constitutionally protected speech, and that her firing was a result. If she could establish that, the burden would then be on Connick to show that she would have been fired whether she had distributed the questionnaire or not.|$|E
25|$|British {{researchers}} {{with the third}} wave of the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL) addressed this matter {{in one of their}} studies. Interviewers collected data on sexual behavior from a sample of over 15,000 subjects at their home. However, a portion of respondents agreed to complete an online questionnaire asking many of the same questions asked live before. The <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> to be taken one to two months after the original interview. The data below were extracted from the same group of 202 men and 325 women who gave out information about same-sex experiences live and then successfully completed the online questionnaire later. Numbers show how answers varied between survey modes and the information is given on whether the difference between methods was significant or not.|$|E
500|$|The 2000 Mexican census {{reported}} about 70,000 members nationwide, and the 2010 census reported 188,326 members. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose numbers {{also differ}} significantly {{from those of the}} census1,234,545 compared to the census figure of 314,932said ambiguity in the census <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> the source of the disparity. The World Christian Encyclopedia reports 430,000 adherents in Mexico in 2000 and 488,000 in Mexico in 2010. Anthropologist Hugo G. Nutini estimated that the Church had around 1,125,000 members in 2000 in Mexico. In 2008, Fortuny and Williams estimated the membership at 7,000,000. Anthropologist Ávila Meléndez says that the membership numbers reported by La Luz del Mundo are plausible given the great interest it has generated among [...] "religious authorities" [...] and the following it receives in Mexico.|$|E
30|$|Information was {{gathered}} from the students through questionnaires by cluster sampling, and the collection rate was 100 %. Invalid <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> rejected, and 658 valid <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> examined; the effective rate was 94 %.|$|R

A total of 1626 completed <b>questionnaires</b> <b>were</b> used for the analysis. The fieldwork and data collection process spanned through the 2016 batch ‘A’ NYSC in the six orientation camps within the Southwest of Nigeria. Completed questionnaires coded into the SPSS software application. Multiple regression (path analysis) {{was used to test}} for mediation in the hypothesis using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) four step approach in which several regression analyses are conducted and significance of the coefficients are examined at each step.|$|R
500|$|A 1981 {{case study}} {{reported}} that stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall made the area grow by fifty percent and that self-reported levels of arousal/orgasm were [...] "deeper" [...] when the G-spot was stimulated. Another study, in 1983, examined eleven women by palpating the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall {{in four of the}} women, concluding that the area is the G-spot. In a 1990 study, an anonymous <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> distributed to 2,350 professional women in the United States and Canada with a subsequent 55% return rate. Of these respondents, 40% reported having a fluid release (ejaculation) at the moment of orgasm, and 82% of the women who reported the sensitive area (Gräfenberg spot) also reported ejaculation with their orgasms. Several variables were associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation.|$|E
500|$|The {{design phase}} {{for the new}} twinjet was {{different}} from Boeing's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – All Nippon Airways, American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Japan Airlines, Qantas, and United Airlines – {{had a role in}} the development. This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input. The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the [...] "Working Together" [...] group. At the first group meeting in January 1990, a 23-page <b>questionnaire</b> <b>was</b> distributed to the airlines, asking what each wanted in the design. By March 1990, Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747's, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a glass cockpit, fly-by-wire controls, and 10percent better seat-mile costs than the A330 and MD-11. Boeing selected its Everett factory in Washington, home of 747 production, as the 777's final assembly site.|$|E
