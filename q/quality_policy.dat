40|$|Environmental {{cost-benefit}} analysis is increasingly {{used to support}} the formulation of European air <b>quality</b> <b>policies.</b> In these analyses, typically around three-quarters of the societal benefits of cleaner air are related to monetised increases in statistical life expectancy. However, the literature presents widely diverging estimates {{for the value of}} a statistical life year (a 'VOLY'). This paper presents a review of studies aimed at establishing a VOLY as used in European air <b>quality</b> <b>policies</b> and it examines the factors that cause the variations in VOLY estimates. We discuss the implications of our findings for European air <b>quality</b> <b>policies</b> and also present a novel approach to analyse the VOLY.

40|$|Internationalization {{and quality}} {{assurance}} {{have become the}} central considerations of higher education development currently. The aim {{of this research is}} to explore and compare the impacts of internationalization on <b>quality</b> assurance <b>policy</b> in Finland and Taiwan. To achieve this aim, the general impacts of internationalization on <b>quality</b> assurance <b>policy</b> have been discussed first. Next, the empirical research of Finland and Taiwan are conducted by qualitative interviews of higher education policy actors and the institutional implementers of the higher education institutions. The impacts of internationalization on <b>quality</b> assurance <b>policy</b> are analyzed and proposed through the six dimensions of policy problem, policy objectives, policy instruments, policy linkage, policy performance, and policy challenges. In addition, facing the impacts of internationalization, the similarities and differences between Finnish and Taiwanese higher education policy are discussed by means of a comparative study. In this research, the link between internationalization and <b>quality</b> assurance <b>policy</b> of Finland and Taiwan has identified. Besides, the national <b>quality</b> assurance <b>policies</b> of Finland and Taiwan have reflected the synergy of national context, regional impact and international impact. Based on the findings, quality assurance plays an important role for the further development of internationalized higher education.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to demonstrate that coastal <b>quality</b> <b>policies</b> can provide efficient support to the implementation of ICZM, and therefore, to the strengthening of the adaptive capacity of coastal territories to change. It is based on the lessons learnt from a case study conducted on the Atlantic coast of France. As they are holistic and systemic, coastal <b>quality</b> <b>policies</b> enable the integration of all challenges and stakeholders in territorial projects, and therefore are favourable to the identification and reduction of conflicts and inequalities, which in turn strengthen the societal cohesion required to cope with change. Thus, this article deals with two key issues: the barriers to management and adaptation, and the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders; showing that we don't necessarily have to renew our approaches, tools and practices, to adapt to change, and more particularly to global change...|$|R

Thus, the aim of the paper is to determine the impact of the chosen <b>quality</b> and demand <b>policy</b> on the availability of the goods. In a simulation setup, different demand and <b>quality</b> <b>policies</b> have been analysed by using a Design of Experiments approach. In a first step minimum stock levels have been varied to verify the significance of the simulation. In a second step error rate has been increased to identify the impact on the availability of the goods.
