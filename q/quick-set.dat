25|$|A typical {{connector}} {{is installed}} by preparing the fiber end and inserting {{it into the}} rear of the connector body. <b>Quick-set</b> adhesive is usually used to hold the fiber securely, and a strain relief is secured to the rear. Once the adhesive sets, the fiber's end is polished to a mirror finish. Various polish profiles are used, {{depending on the type of}} fiber and the application. For single-mode fiber, fiber ends are typically polished with a slight curvature that makes the mated connectors touch only at their cores. This is called a physical contact (PC) polish. The curved surface may be polished at an angle, to make an angled physical contact (APC) connection. Such connections have higher loss than PC connections, but greatly reduced back reflection, because light that reflects from the angled surface leaks out of the fiber core. The resulting signal strength loss is called gap loss. APC fiber ends have low back reflection even when disconnected.|$|E

40|$|America’s finest news source The Onion {{has a new}} owner! Since last week, {{readers have}} been bombarded with the good tiding, from the {{modified}} masthead, logo, and tagline, to news headlines, editorials, audio and video clips, and ads, lots of ads. The new owner goes by the appetizing name of Yu Wan Mei 鱼完美 Amalgamated Salvage Fisheries and Polymer Injection Group, supposedly a Chinese conglomerate from the inland province of Sichuan. The corporation specializes in fish by-products salvaged from the “ocean’s bounty. ” Some of its finer samples are “Broiled Shark Gums,” “Multi-Flavor Variety Pack Of Pickled Fish Cloaca,” “Lightning Power Monkfish Cerebral Fluid Energy Drink,” “Mr. Steve’s Safe And Natural Rhinoceros-Cure For The Inferior Male,” and “Yu Wan Mei Miscellaneous Flavor Paste. ” But, as the YWM homepage proclaims in bold letters, the corporation is “diversifying into myriad subsidiaries” such as “Szu-Maul Lethal Injection Truck And Van Manufacturing,” “Speedee Slab <b>Quick-Setting</b> Concrete Consolidated,” “Jhonson 2 ̆ 6 Jhonson Baby’s Shampow,” “Yu Wanmei EZ Home Foreclosure Program,” and “Amalgamated Chinatowns of America, Inc. ” The new owner is pushy, to say the least. Every news and non-news item in the paper comes {{with at least one}} YWM product placement reference. Ads containing shibboleths in simulated non-grammatical English (“Glorious Fish By-Product Make for Long Life, Good Fortune”) rudely bisect or multiply interrupt any and all reports. At a more subliminal level, the end of every text is marked with the Chinese character for fish. The video clips go overboard with animated YWM icons and messages flashing across the screen and with the anchors blending YWM commercials effortlessly into their tabloid-style interviews. The Onion has positively turned fishy. No savvyOnion reader should be fooled by this non-too-subtle effort at mocking the sorry state of the publishing industry and the corporate takeover of the media in contemporary America. No one, really, should even be surprised that a fictive Chinese corporation is the villain of this imaginary apocalypse. After all, wasn’t GM’s Hummer just sold to an obscure Chinese company called Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd. ? Bizarre as it may have sounded, that piece of news shouldn’t have surprised too many either. For better or for worse, China has been on Americans’ mind for quite some time—at least those Americans who have been paying attention to the intricate linkage between the Chinese compulsion to save and the subprime mortgage crisis that has brought the American economy to its knees, to the chattering class ratcheting up the specter of “China rising,” to the media coverage of the Beijing Olympics and the ethnic riots, to news stories about poisonous toothpaste, carcinogenic toys, and tainted milk powder...|$|R

There hath, indeed, been some little improvement in the manufactures of linen and woollen, although very short of perfection: But our trade was never in so low a condition: And as to agriculture, of which all wise nations have been so tender, the desolation made in the country by engrossing graziers, and the great yearly importation of corn from England, are lamentable instances under what discouragement it lies.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare healing of pulpal and periapical tissues after exposure to NeoMTA Plus and <b>Quick-Set</b> 2 following pulpotomy, root canal and root-end surgery procedures. One hundred eight teeth (36 for each procedure) in 6 Beagle dogs were isolated, accessed and treated with pulpotomy, root canal or root-end surgery. The materials for pulpotomy and root-end surgery were mixed to a putty-like consistency and the materials for root canals were mixed to a sealer consistency. The dogs were sacrificed at 90 days and the teeth and surrounding tissues were prepared for histological evaluation. Eighty-five teeth were evaluated and scored histologically. Specific for each procedure, specimens were scored for inflammation, quality and thickness of dentin bridging, pulp tissue response, cementum and PDL formation and apical bone healing. Both materials displayed favorable healing at 90 days. The only significant difference was higher quality of dentin bridge formation in pulpotomies exposed to NeoMTA Plus. <b>Quick-Set</b> 2 and NeoMTA Plus had similar effects on inflammation, dentin bridge formation, pulp response, PDL and cementum formation and apical tissue healing in dogs...|$|E

40|$|Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are {{comprehensively}} {{recognized as}} a structural stability monitoring device {{for all kinds of}} geo-materials by either embedding into or bonding onto the structural entities. The physical model in geotechnical engineering, which could accurately simulate the construction processes and the effects on the stability of underground caverns on the basis of satisfying the similarity principles, is an actual physical entity. Using a physical model test of underground caverns in Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station, FBG sensors were used to determine how to model the small displacements of some key monitoring points in the large-scale physical model during excavation. In the process of building the test specimen, it is most successful to embed FBG sensors in the physical model through making an opening and adding some <b>quick-set</b> silicon. The experimental results show that the FBG sensor has higher measuring accuracy than other conventional sensors like electrical resistance strain gages and extensometers. The experimental results are also in good agreement with the numerical simulation results. In conclusion, FBG sensors could effectively measure small displacements of monitoring points in the whole process of the physical model test. The experimental results reveal the deformation and failure characteristics of the surrounding rock mass and make some guidance for the in situ engineering construction...|$|E
40|$|Insulin pump therapy [continuous {{subcutaneous}} insulin infusion (CSII) ] requires regular {{change of}} infusion sets every 2 - 3 days {{in order to}} minimize the risk of skin irritations or other adverse events. This has been discussed to be a potential burden to the environment. The purpose of this analysis was to perform an environmental assessment of insulin pump infusion sets based on loss of resources occurring during incineration of the discarded products and by means of a lifecycle concept used to weight a material in relation to its rareness on earth and its consumption. In addition to five infusion sets (Inset 30, InsetII, Comfort, <b>Quick-set,</b> and Cleo), a patch pump (Omnipod) was also included in this analysis. The annual loss in waste of the so called “person reserve” of 3 days of catheter use was compared with daily consumption of {{a cup of coffee in}} a disposable paper cup and to a soft drink in an aluminum can. The weight-based loss in resources through waste for the infusion sets (except for Cleo) corresponded to 70 - 200 % of the loss of resources for a coffee cup (Cleo, 320 %; Omnipod, 1, 821, 600 %) and to 1 - 3 % of the loss from an aluminum soft drink can (Cleo, 5 %; Omnipod, 31, 200 %). The loss or resources by use of infusion sets used in insulin pump therapy appears to be low and is similar to the burden induced by the uptake of one cup of coffee per day. The loss or resources with regular CSII is considerably lower than the loss or resources induced by patch pumps...|$|E
