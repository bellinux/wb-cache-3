5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the <b>quiescent</b> periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a <b>quiescent</b> period of the last millennium.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These <b>quiescent</b> intervals were separated by a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains <b>quiescent</b> {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London to deal with them? Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely <b>quiescent</b> in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported {{as far away as}} Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became <b>quiescent</b> {{at the end of the}} 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|When Archduke Charles {{withdrew from}} the Rhine valley, he left about 30,000 troops in garrisons along the river. There were 15,000 foot and 1,200 horse in Mainz, 3,000 {{infantry}} in Ehrenbreitstein, 8,800 infantry and 300 cavalry in Mannheim and 2,500 foot soldiers in Philippsburg. To contain the first two, Jourdan left 28,545 troops under François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers while Moreau only detailed 2,800 infantry and 240 cavalry to watch the last two places. For the most part, the Austrian garrisons remained <b>quiescent.</b> But the Austrians in Mannheim caused mischief by attacking Kehl on 18 September. More might have been accomplished in that assault, but the Austrian soldiers paused to pillage the French camp and were driven off by their enemies. Even so, Charles not only lost the services of the 30,000 men in the fortresses {{but also of the}} Swabians, Saxons and other German allies when he retreated from the Rhine. These auxiliary forces began to negotiate with the French when their territories were occupied.|$|E
25|$|Variations in the <b>quiescent</b> current with temperature, {{or between}} parts {{with the same}} type number, are common, so {{crossover}} distortion and <b>quiescent</b> current {{may be subject to}} significant variation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quiescent</b> current {{specification}} of an op-amp is valid {{only when the}} feedback is active. Some op-amps show an increased <b>quiescent</b> current when the inputs are not equal.|$|E
25|$|Curcumin (turmeric) therapy, in {{conjunction}} with taking the medications mesalamine or sulfasalazine, may be effective and safe for maintaining remission in people with <b>quiescent</b> ulcerative colitis. The effect of curcumin therapy alone on <b>quiescent</b> ulcerative colitis is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Transistor Q7 drives Q5 and Q6 into {{conduction}} {{until their}} (equal) collector currents match that of Q1/Q3 and Q2/Q4. The <b>quiescent</b> current in Q7 is VBE / 50k, about 35μA, {{as is the}} <b>quiescent</b> current in Q15, with its matching operating point.|$|E

25|$|The {{latent phase}} of labour is {{also called the}} <b>quiescent</b> phase, prodromal labour, or pre-labour. It is a subclassification of the first stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{supply current}} {{for a typical}} 741 of about 2mA agrees {{with the notion that}} these two bias {{currents}} dominate the <b>quiescent</b> supply current.|$|E
25|$|Low-impedance outputs {{typically}} require high <b>quiescent</b> (i.e., idle) {{current in}} the output stage and will dissipate more power, so low-power designs may purposely sacrifice low output impedance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quiescent</b> {{currents}} in Q16 and Q19 are {{set by the}} current mirror Q12/Q13, which is running at ≈ 1mA. Through some mechanism, the collector current in Q19 tracks that standing current.|$|E
25|$|In the SMC, {{more extreme}} {{variation}} is seen with no 2175 Å and very strong far-UV extinction {{in the star}} forming Bar and fairly normal ultraviolet extinction seen in the more <b>quiescent</b> Wing.|$|E
25|$|The summed <b>quiescent</b> {{currents}} of Q1/Q3 plus Q2/Q4 is mirrored from Q8 into Q9, {{where it is}} summed with the collector current in Q10, the result being applied to the bases of Q3/Q4.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quiescent</b> {{current in}} a {{regulator}} circuit {{is the current}} drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{studies using}} {{curcumin}} conducted by Bharat Aggarwal, formerly {{a researcher at}} the MD Anderson Cancer Center, were deemed fraudulent and subsequently retracted by the publisher. There is insufficient evidence to know whether curcumin is effective for maintenance of remission in <b>quiescent</b> Ulcerative colitis when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnitude}} and sign of both those parameters {{are controlled by}} the base current : since both base-collector and base-emitter junctions are inversely biased in the <b>quiescent</b> state, the equivalent circuit of the base input is simply a current generator shunted by base-emitter and base-collector junction capacitances and is therefore not analyzed in what follows.|$|E
25|$|This {{feedback}} circuit tends {{to draw the}} common base node of Q3/Q4 to a voltage Vcom − 2 * VBE, where Vcom is the input common-mode voltage. At the same time, {{the magnitude of the}} <b>quiescent</b> current is relatively insensitive to the characteristics of the components Q1–Q4, such as hfe, that would otherwise cause temperature dependence or part-to-part variations.|$|E
25|$|Lavas {{may also}} pick up rock fragments, {{especially}} if flowing over unconsolidated rubble on the flanks of a volcano, and these form volcanic breccias, also called pillow breccias. Within the volcanic conduits of explosive volcanoes the volcanic breccia environment merges into the intrusive breccia environment. There the upwelling lava tends to solidify during <b>quiescent</b> intervals {{only to be}} shattered by ensuing eruptions.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{treatment}} of sewage by <b>quiescent</b> settling allows separation of floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains {{less than half of}} the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds. Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.|$|E
25|$|The human {{organism}} physically restores itself during sleep, healing {{itself and}} removing waste which builds up {{during periods of}} activity. This restoration takes place mostly during slow-wave sleep, during which body temperature, heart rate, and brain oxygen consumption decrease. The brain, especially, requires sleep for restoration, whereas {{in the rest of}} the body these processes can take place during <b>quiescent</b> waking. In both cases, the reduced rate of metabolism enables countervailing restorative processes.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, high {{resolution}} (<0.2″) soft X-ray imaging with the High Resolution Coronal Imager aboard a sounding rocket revealed tightly wound braids in the corona. It is {{hypothesized that the}} reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active solar corona to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvins. The main heat source in the <b>quiescent</b> corona (about 1.5 million kelvins) is assumed to originate from MHD waves.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the time}} of {{formation}} of c5 craters and very smooth plains material has, for the most part, been tectonically <b>quiescent.</b> During this period, {{with the exception of}} a scattering of extremely fresh craters and some minor mass wasting (Malin and Dzurisin, 1977), almost no geologic activity has occurred near the mercurian south pole. The youngest smooth plains and the very smooth plains materials that occur within c5 craters may be impact melts.|$|E
25|$|Recently whole genome {{microarray}} {{research of}} neurons {{infected with the}} Japanese Encephalitis virus has shown that neurons {{play an important role}} in their own defense against Japanese Encephalitis infection. Although this challenges the long-held belief that neurons are immunologically <b>quiescent,</b> an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immune-mediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during Japanese Encephalitis infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease.|$|E
25|$|For {{the loss}} of 200 killed and wounded, all in the cavalry, Milhaud's force inflicted 500 killed and wounded on the Spanish. In addition, the French {{captured}} 1,000 soldiers and six guns. Blake returned to Murcia where he remained <b>quiescent</b> {{for the rest of}} the year. The next action in the area was the Battle of Barrosa on 5 March 1811 where British Lieutenant General Thomas Graham inflicted a defeat on Victor's corps.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} turning, the Buddha taught the Mahāyāna {{teaching}}s to the bodhisattvas, teaching that all phenomena have no-essence, no arising, no passing away, are originally <b>quiescent,</b> and essentially in cessation. This turning is also described as marvelous and wonderful, but requiring interpretation and occasioning controversy. Doctrine {{of the second}} turning is established in the Prajñāpāramitā teachings, first put into writing around 100 BCE. In Indian philosophical schools, it is exemplified by the Mādhyamaka school of Nāgārjuna.|$|E
25|$|With the {{widening}} of the Atlantic, Indian and Southern oceans, Southern Africa became tectonically <b>quiescent.</b> Earthquakes rarely occur, {{and there has}} been no volcanic or orogenic activity for about 50million years. An almost uninterrupted period of erosion has continued to the present, resulting in layers several kilometers thick having been lost {{from the surface of the}} plateau. A thick layer of marine sediment was consequently deposited onto the continental shelf (the lower steps of the original rift valley walls) which surrounds the subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|In Drosophila, proneural {{genes are}} first {{expressed}} in <b>quiescent</b> ectodermal cells that have both epidermal and neuronal potential. Proneural activity {{results in the}} selection of progenitors that are committed to a neural fate but remain multipotent, with sense organ progenitors giving rise to neurons, glia and other non-neuronal cell types. Additionally, some neuroblasts of the central nervous system also generate both neurons and glia. Progenitors of the peripheral and central nervous system only begin to divide after proneural gene expression has subsided.|$|E
25|$|Reptiles have <b>quiescent</b> periods {{similar to}} {{mammalian}} sleep, and {{a decrease in}} electrical activity in the brain has been registered when the animals have been asleep. However, the EEG pattern in reptilian sleep differs from what is seen in mammals and other animals. In reptiles, sleep time increases following sleep deprivation, and stronger stimuli are needed to awaken the animals when they have been deprived of sleep as compared to when they have slept normally. This suggests that the sleep which follows deprivation is compensatorily deeper.|$|E
25|$|Upon victory, {{the gods}} {{retreated to the}} city of Yu-Shan to oversee from on high, and granted the Exalted the Creation-Ruling Mandate as a boon for their service to the new order. The {{surrendered}} Primordials were banished to/became the Hell known as Malfeas, the Demon City. Now they are half-remembered only as the Yozis: ill-understood and impersonal cosmic deities whose continued worship is reckoned among the highest of heresies. The slain Primordials are known as the Neverborn, <b>quiescent</b> monsters whose impossible ending resulted {{in the formation of the}} Underworld.|$|E
25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{also explains}} why quasars were {{more common in}} the early universe, as this energy production ends when the supermassive black hole consumes all of the gas and dust near it. This means that it is possible that most galaxies, including the Milky Way, have gone through an active stage, appearing as a quasar or some other class of active galaxy that depended on the black hole mass and the accretion rate, and are now <b>quiescent</b> because they lack a supply of matter to feed into their central black holes to generate radiation.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in proto-oncogenes, {{which are}} the {{normally}} <b>quiescent</b> counterparts of oncogenes, can modify their expression and function, increasing the amount or activity of the product protein. When this happens, the proto-oncogenes become oncogenes, and this transition upsets the normal balance of cell cycle regulation in the cell, making uncontrolled growth possible. The chance of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, even if this were possible, as they are critical for growth, repair and homeostasis of the organism. It is only when they become mutated that the signals for growth become excessive.|$|E
