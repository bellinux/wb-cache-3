5000|$|Leslie D. Gottlieb in his 2003 {{summary of}} the subject in plants stated [...] we can define <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> as the budding off {{of a new and}} very {{different}} daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both. [...] Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was [...] "unnecessarily restrictive" [...] in identifying cases of sympatric speciation. In this 2003 paper Gottlieb summarized instances of quantum evolution in the plant species Clarkia, Layia, and Stephanomeria.|$|E
5000|$|In his 2003 review, Gottlieb [...] summarized: The general {{lesson from}} the review of these studies is that <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> remains an {{important}} and useful concept {{that can be applied}} to a greater variety of situations than initially envisaged. The genetic and chromosomal changes need not be as radical as once supposed, and a new species may originate and persist even without novel adaptations.|$|E
5000|$|Gottlieb was {{occupied}} with new species formation via [...] "quantum speciation" [...] throughout his career. As defined by Verne Grant, and cited by Gottlieb in his 2003 {{summary of the}} subject in plants [...] "we can define <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> as the budding off {{of a new and}} very different daughter species from a semi-isolated peripheral population of the ancestral species in a cross-fertilizing organism...as compared with geographical speciation, which is a gradual and conservative process, <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> is rapid and radical in its phenotypic or genotypic effects or both." [...] Grant thought that it would be accompanied by inbreeding in the founder population. Therefore, [...] "quantum speciation" [...] would be related to, if not identical with, in Gottlieb's use of the term, sympatric speciation. In fact Gottlieb's first publication on [...] "sympatric speciation" [...] in Stephanomeria', published in 1971, was summarised by him in the above 2003 paper on [...] "quantum speciation." [...] Gottlieb did not believe that sympatric speciation required disruptive selection to form a reproductive isolating barrier, as defined by Grant, and in fact Gottlieb stated that requiring disruptive selection was [...] "unnecessarily restrictive" [...] in identifying cases of sympatric speciation.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} genome {{evolution}} is proposed. Based on three assumptions the evolutionary theory of a genome is formulated. The general {{law on the}} direction of genome evolution is given. Both the deterministic classical equation and the stochastic quantum equation are proposed. It is proved that the classical equation can {{be put in a}} form of the least action principle and the latter can be used for obtaining the quantum generalization of the evolutionary law. The wave equation and uncertainty relation for the quantum evolution are deduced logically. It is shown that the classical trajectory is a limiting case of the general quantum evolution depicted in the coarse-grained time. The observed smooth/sudden evolution is interpreted by the alternating occurrence of the classical and <b>quantum</b> phases. The <b>speciation</b> event is explained by the quantum transition in quantum phase. Fundamental constants of time dimension, the quantization constant and the evolutionary inertia, are introduced for characterizing the genome evolution. The size of minimum genome is deduced from the quantum uncertainty lower bound. The present work shows the quantum law may be more general than thought, since it plays key roles not only in atomic physics, but also in genome evolution. Comment: 13 page...|$|R
50|$|Gottlieb {{researched}} a {{broad array}} of subjects including plant systematics, plant speciation (<b>Quantum</b> <b>Speciation),</b> polyploidy, gene duplication, biochemical evolution of isozymes and molecular genetics, and published more than 120 research papers and received a number of awards including a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (1975), and Fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1985). In 1993 he was named Alumni Association Fellow of Oregon State University.In 1965 he earned his master's degree and wrote a thesis on hybridization between species of manzanita in southwestern Oregon.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{work was}} done with species pairs in the genus Layia. Here, the {{widespread}} progenitor was the diploid L. glandulosa, while the more restricted was the diploid L. discoidea. Both are obligate outcrossers, though the former has ray flowers while the latter only has disc flowers. Further, both are completely interfertile, while L. discoidea is restricted to serpentine habitats. As with the former species pairs, Gottlieb applied the electrophoretic test to these species and found {{that they had a}} very high genetic identity for the isozymes studied. Therefore, the Gottlieb and Ford concluded that these two species were related as progenitor and derivative. Gottlieb proposed that L. discoidea arose relatively recently from adaptation to serpentine soils, also as an example of <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gottlieb's first {{published}} scientific paper in 1968 {{was based on}} his M.S. Thesis, and concerned itself with the taxonomy of Arctostaphylos viscida and A. canescens. In this he was concerned with hybrids between the two and the taxonomic status of their hybrids, concluding that such hybrids were not eligible for taxonomic status as a previous investigator reported. His next publication in 1971 was based on his Ph.D. thesis, and was concerned with phylogenetic relationships in Stephanomeria. This followed in 1972 with a taxonomy of Stephanomeria. During these early years he developed an interest in isozymes, and he published a 1971 paper discussing their use in evolutionary studies. Using this new technique he applied isozymes to a taxonomic problem in Stephanomeria, {{and was able to}} demonstrate the origin of Stephanomeria malheurensis by <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> (see above). He continued to apply isozymes to other taxa, and clarified species relationships in other genera such as Clarkia, Layia, Gaura, and Tragopogon, largely relying on gene duplication and silencing results (discussed above).|$|E
5000|$|The next progenitor-derived pair {{of species}} Gottlieb {{examined}} were diploid Clarkia biloba and diploid Clarkia lingulata. C. biloba is geographically widespread, while C. lingulata is known from only two populations {{on the southern}} periphery of C. biloba; both are highly outcrossing, {{and there is no}} evidence that C. lingulata is better adapted to its habitat than C. biloba. They differ from each other by chromosomal structural differences, and hybrids between them are sterile. Lewis and Roberts proposed in 1956 that C. lingulata arose from C. biloba rapidly and in close proximity; in 1962 Lewis coined the term [...] "catastrophic selection" [...] to define its mode of orign. Gottlieb using starch gel electrophoresis, determined that indeed C. lingulata had a high degree of genetic similarity to C. biloba, with fewer alleles and reduced heterozygosity. Subsequent studies confirmed a sister species relationship using chloroplast DNA as well as nucleotide sequences of the gene phosphoglucose isomerase. Gottlieb stated that this species pair, too, arose from <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Data are {{presented}} on <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> in the Sitopsis {{section of the}} genus Aegilops (Poaceae, Monocotyledones). Two small, peripheral, isolated, wild populations of annual cross-pollinated Ae. speltoides and annual self-pollinated Ae. sharonensis are located 30 m apart on different soil types. Despite the close proximity of the two species and their close relatedness, no mixed groups are known. Comparative molecular cytogenetic analysis based on the intrapopulation variability of rRNA-encoding DNA (rDNA) chromosomal patterns of individual Ae. speltoides geno-types revealed an ongoing dynamic process of permanent chromosomal rearrangements. Chromosomal mutations can arise de novo and can be eliminated. Analysis of the progeny of the investigated genotypes testifies that inheritance of de novo rDNA sites happens frequently. Heterologous recombination and/or transposable elements-mediated rDNA transfer {{seem to be the}} mechanisms for observed chromosomal repatterning. Consequently, several modified genomic forms, intermediate between Ae. speltoides and Ae. sharonensis, permanently arise in the studied wild population of Ae. speltoides, which make it possible to recognize Ae. sharonensis as a derivative species of Ae. speltoides, as well as to propose rapidness and canalization of <b>quantum</b> <b>speciation</b> in Sitopsis species...|$|E
