2500|$|Moreover, Herseni {{explored}} {{the challenges of}} sociological epistemology and the methodology of participant observation. He believed that objectivity could only be attained with self-imposed limitations and a laborious, preferably collective and interdisciplinary, research program. Largely [...] "empirical", Herseni and Stahl's sociology took distance from the [...] "transcendentalist" [...] approach of social scientists such as Mircea Vulcănescu, with whom they first clashed in Fundu Moldovei. By 1938, their highly localized <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach</b> was conceding ground to a quantitative [...] "zonal" [...] tactic, which was favored by Gusti and Anton Golopenția.|$|E
2500|$|Inorganic {{chemistry}} {{has greatly}} benefited from qualitative theories. [...] Such theories {{are easier to}} learn as they require little background in quantum theory. [...] Within main group compounds, VSEPR theory powerfully predicts, or at least rationalizes, the structures of main group compounds, such as an explanation for why NH3 is pyramidal whereas ClF3 is T-shaped. [...] For the transition metals, crystal field theory allows one to understand the magnetism of many simple complexes, such as why 3− has only one unpaired electron, whereas 3+ has five. [...] A particularly [...] powerful <b>qualitative</b> <b>approach</b> to assessing the structure and reactivity begins with classifying molecules according to electron counting, focusing on the numbers of valence electrons, usually at the central atom in a molecule.|$|E

Classic <b>qualitative</b> <b>approaches,</b> representing accepted innovations, include ethnography, naturalistic inquiry, generic pragmatic (sociological) qualitative inquiry, and connoisseur$hip/criticism.

40|$|The rapid uptake of <b>qualitative</b> <b>approaches</b> in {{translational}} research can be best {{understood in the}} context of recent innovations in health services research, as well as an overarching concern with improving the quality of health care. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>approaches</b> highlight the human dimension in health care by foregrounding the perceptions, experiences, and behaviors of both consumers and providers of care. As such, these methods are particularly useful for addressing the complex issues related to improving health care quality and implementing system change. This overview traces a brief history of the factors contributing to the recent and rapid growth of qualitative methods in health research in general and {{translational research}} in particular; describes the varieties of <b>qualitative</b> <b>approaches</b> employed in this research; and illustrates the utility of these approaches for variable identification, instrument development, description/explanation of patient/provider perceptions and behaviors, individual/organizational change, and theory refinement...|$|R
