40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{reform is}} an {{important}} part of policy strategies to accelerate economic growth in many countries. The authors identify two distinct but complementary approaches to <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform : the private sector development approach and the corporatization approach. The private sector development approach involves privatizing <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> and encouraging private sector development to improve economic efficiency and shrink the relative size of the public sector. The corporatization approach involves improving managerial incentives and clarifying budget constraints on <b>public</b> <b>enterprises,</b> so their performance improves without the government relinquishing ownership. The authors study the relationship between the financial system and <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform. The conceptual framework describes the role of three financial services [...] mobilizing resources, evaluating firms and monitoring managers [...] in promoting both the private sector development and corporatization approaches to reform. Using nine country case studies (of Chile, Egypt, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Senegal, and Turkey), they study the links between <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform and both financial sector reform and the initial state of the financial system. They reach three broad, tentative conclusions: <b>Public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform is more successful in countries whose financial systems are relatively well developed and less successful in countries with relatively underdeveloped financial systems; countries will be more successful in implementing large-scale <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform if they also implement substantial, well-designed financial sector reform; and successful reform of the financial sector generally involves implementing three components in the following order [...] building financial infrastructure, liberalizing the sector, and expanding the number of private financial intermediaries (removing impediments to the expansion of private intermediaries, downsizing public banks, and privatizing some publicbanks). Failure to implement any of these components severely jeopardizes the chance that financial reform will support <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> reform.

The current literature focuses on the total value of goods produced by <b>public</b> <b>enterprises.</b> This article focuses on the types of goods they produce.

In nearly all high-productivity countries, the government stays out of the manufacturing sector altogether.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the impact of systemic corruption in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the Harare metropolitan area in Zimbabwe. This research study used a case and explanatory research designs as its major research approaches. The study was largely prompted by {{the high level of}} corruption in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> as reported to the Anti - Corruption Commission and the media. In this study, fourteen (14) directors and twenty six (26) <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> officials were used as research subjects. Questionnaires, interviews and documentary reviews were used as research instruments to collect information on the impact of systemic corruption in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> in the Harare metropolitan area. The study showed that low remuneration levels for both low and high level <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> officials, patronage appointment to higher level of management and the lack of political will to empower <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> officials on the evil of corruption were the causes of systemic corruption. Greed, the disintegration of work morality and ethics {{in the manner in which}} public affairs across <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> were being handled, were key causes of systemic corruption (see chapter 4 for details). The high level of secrecy in the management of public affairs, the lack of transparency, discipline, fairness, responsibility, equity and weak legal system on corruption were also noted to be corruption drivers. With regard the manifestation of corruption in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises,</b> it was established that systemic corruption occurred in the following forms: abuse of power, fraud, favouritism, embezzlement, weak control, extortion and ghosting. The study also showed that systemic corruption created problems such as administrative inefficiency and parasitism, a social atmosphere of tension and dishonesty within <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> (see chapter 4 for details). Corruption reallocated resources to the rich and powerful public officials who were aligned to the ruling party or those in authority. The study also noted that <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> officials were using technical complexity in procedures and regulations to conceal under-dealings. It was iv the findings of this study that rewarding for reasons not related to performance, dishonesty, over claiming expenses, falsification of reports/records and favouritism in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> were high. The study also revealed that bid-rigging, shifting from core business, ghosting, and giving gratitude/gift to influence decision were some of the prevalent unethical activities in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Against this backdrop, it is recommended that the level of remuneration in <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> for <b>public</b> officials is improved so that the minimum grounds for corruption motives are reduced. When salaries are too low, officers are obviously forced to indulge in unethical activities which in turn affect the general public directly or indirectly. It is critical that all <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> officials undergo training in the dimension of corruption and corporate governance as a means of empowerment. Corrupt individuals and business organisations in the Harare metropolitan area should not be employed or engaged in public related work and that public affairs must be managed in a transparent and open manner although confidentiality must be observed. The study also recommends that the appointment of <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> officials must be based on competence, relevant educational qualifications and experience. Another recommendation is that all cases of corruption must be treated as high level criminal cases which attract longer and deterrent court judgments (see chapter four for details).

With these institutions in place, accountability becomes a yardstick to achieve greater results. This article therefore set out to explore the impact that decentralisation has on <b>Public</b> <b>Enterprises.</b> Decentralisation being an instrument of good governance, the article want to investigate if it applicability on state own enterprises could stimulate economic development. A policy of decentralisation could be considered as an important tool for economic development if the process is adequately implemented. <b>Public</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{were put in place}} in many countries to contribute to social development.

The study refers to Estonia as an example. Estonia has developed <b>public</b> <b>enterprises</b> of the central state and of the municipalities since the reestablishment of the Estonian Republic. As <b>public</b> <b>enterprise</b> use private forms of law, some management problems occur because public firms are legally obliged to practice the management by objectives.
