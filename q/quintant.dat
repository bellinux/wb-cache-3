50|$|Several makers offered {{instruments}} with sizes {{other than}} one-eighth or one-sixth of a circle. One {{of the most}} common was the <b>quintant</b> or fifth of a circle (72° arc reading to 144°). Other sizes were also available, but the odd sizes never became common. Many instruments are found with scales reading to, for example, 135°, but they are simply referred to as sextants. Similarly, there are 100° octants, but these are not separated as unique types of instruments.|$|E

5000|$|The {{frame of}} a sextant {{is in the}} shape of a sector which is {{approximately}} [...] of a circle (60°), hence its name (sextāns, -antis is the Latin word for [...] "one sixth"). Both smaller and larger instruments are (or were) in use: the octant, <b>quintant</b> (or pentant) and the (doubly reflecting) quadrant span sectors of approximately [...] of a circle (45°), [...] of a circle (72°) and [...] of a circle (90°), respectively. All of these instruments may be termed [...] "sextants".|$|E
50|$|Phaneesh Murthy (Kannada: ಫಣೀಶ್ ಮೂರ್ತಿ) is an Indian {{technology}} businessman. He {{was made}} director of Infosys Ltd in 2000, before {{being fired from}} the company in 2002. Subsequently, he became the Chief Executive Officer of iGATE Corporation in 2003, after the company acquired his start-up <b>Quintant.</b> Murthy later President in 2006 and was re-elected in 2010. The board of iGate sacked its President and CEO Murthy in May 2013, following an investigation into a relationship that he had with a subordinate employee and a claim of sexual harassment.|$|E
50|$|Murthy joined iGATE Global Solutions Limited in August 2003 {{after the}} company {{acquired}} <b>Quintant</b> in late 2003. After joining iGATE, he {{played a key role}} in restructuring iGATE. He has been instrumental in positioning the services companies under the iGATE Global umbrella, thereby resulting in synergies between the various service offerings of iGATE Global Solutions Ltd. He has been the Chief Executive Officer and President of iGATE since April 1, 2008, and serves as the Managing Director of iGate Global Solutions Ltd. and iGATE Corporation.

5000|$|Attached to {{the frame}} are the [...] "horizon mirror", an index arm which moves the index mirror, a {{sighting}} telescope, sun shades, a graduated scale and a micrometer drum gauge for accurate measurements. The scale must be graduated so that the marked degree divisions register twice the angle through which the index arm turns. The scales of the octant, sextant, <b>quintant</b> and quadrant are graduated from below zero to 90°, 120°, 140° and 180° respectively. For example, the sextant shown alongside has a scale graduated from −10° to 142°, so that is basically a quintant: the frame is a {{sector of a circle}} subtending an angle of 76° (not 72°) at the pivot of the index arm.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} items in the {{collection}} of the United States Geological Survey Museum is a <b>quintant</b> sextant or lattice sextant (pictured) that was manufactured by Spencer, Browning & Rust. The sextant dates from the 1820s to 1850s. The Rosenfeld Collection at Mystic Seaport, The Museum of America and the Sea, Mystic, Connecticut, United States of America gives the details of numerous octants made by Spencer, Browning & Rust, and predecessors or successors of the company. The Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia has an ebony octant manufactured by Spencer, Browning & Rust. It features an ivory scale and a double silvered horizon mirror and is on display in the Boulton and Watt Exhibition.|$|E
50|$|When Ebenezer Rust {{joined the}} {{partnership}} of Spencer and Browning in 1784, {{the firm of}} Spencer, Browning & Rust was established. The company was in operation in London from 1784 to 1840, initially doing business from 327 Wapping High Street. Later, the firm operated out of 66 Wapping High Street. Spencer, Browning & Rust was a successful company, given {{the large number of}} surviving nautical instruments. The firm manufactured a variety of navigational instruments, including octants, sextants, telescopes, and compasses, for both domestic and international markets. Nautical instruments marked with the SBR logo are found in the museums of a number of countries. One of the oldest items {{in the collection of the}} United States Geological Survey Museum is a <b>quintant</b> sextant or lattice sextant (pictured) that was manufactured by Spencer, Browning & Rust. The last surviving original partner, Samuel Browning, died in about 1819. The firm continued as Smith, Browning & Rust, operated by relatives of the original partners, until 1840. After the 1838 death of Ebenezer Rust's son Ebenezer Rust, Junior, the firm was renamed Spencer, Browning & Co.|$|E
