5000|$|Weather, {{climate and}} the water cycle shape {{almost every aspect of}} our lives. They can be benevolent and bring {{abundance}} and well-being, but they can also be dangerous and cause great damage: weather-, climate and water-related hazards account for nearly 90% of [...] "natural" [...] disasters. These powerful natural forces do not recognize national borders, thus global and regional cooperation is essential. Global data are needed to understand the behaviour of the Earth’s atmosphere and its interaction with the land and oceans - whether it be to predict next week’s weather or next year’s climate, forecasters must have timely, <b>quality-assured,</b> standardized information coming from all corners of the world. Even the accuracy of a two-day weather forecast relies on observations from far beyond national borders. The World Meteorological Organization provides the framework for this essential international cooperation among the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services of its 191 Member States and Territories.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the United States Institute of Medicine {{called for}} a global {{co-payment}} toward purchases of ACTs by first-line buyers directly from drug manufacturers. This call stemmed from {{the recommendations of the}} IOM committee chaired by Nobel Laureate economist Professor Kenneth Arrow, which were published in Saving Lives, Buying Time: Economics of Malaria Drugs in an Age of Resistance. The IOM committee advocated for [...] "a sustained global subsidy of artemisinin co-formulated with other antimalarial drugs in order to reduce malaria mortality ("saving lives") and delay resistance ("buying time")" [...] until new categories of antimalarials could be developed. The proposed buyer co-payment for <b>quality-assured</b> ACTs would be available to both the public and private sectors. Arrow explained, [...] "When I discovered that 70% of chloroquine was distributed commercially, I immediately {{came to the conclusion that}} ACTs would have to be distributed through the private sector if we wanted nearly universal coverage." [...] Subsequent analyses published in peer-reviewed journals reconfirmed the potential impact of the IOM committee proposal.|$|E
50|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for malaria are ACTs which combine artemisinin with another antimalarial medication. ACTs are {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization (WHO) as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria and, in 2004, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the largest global funding source for malaria control, began reprogramming all approved grants to procure ACTs in areas {{with high levels of}} drug resistance. However, ACTs account for only one in five antimalarial treatments taken and, until the advent of the Affordable Medicines Facility-malaria (AMFm), were provided almost entirely by the public sector. Over 60 percent of patients in malaria endemic areas access anti-malarial treatment through the private sector but, before the AMFm, the private sector only accounted for about 5 percent of all ACTs provided. ACTs are more expensive than the less-effective first-line malaria treatments, such as chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) and amodiaquine (AQ), which usually cost less than US$1. Therefore, unsubsidized, <b>quality-assured</b> ACTs are not affordable by {{many of the people who}} need them in malaria-endemic countries. This leads to avoidable complications or death, since people either do not receive treatment or use cheaper, less effective antimalarials. Further, if patients use artemisinin monotherapies, this increases the risk of widespread resistance to artemisinin.|$|E

40|$|Although hyperspectral imagery (HSI), {{which has}} been applied {{in a wide range}} of applications, suffers from very large volumes of data, its {{uncompressed}} representation is still preferred to avoid compression loss for accurate data analysis. In this paper, we focus on <b>quality-assured</b> lossy compression of HSI, where the accuracy of analysis from decoded data is taken as a key criterion to assess the efficacy of coding. An improved 3 D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based approach is proposed, where a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to optimally determine the weighting of inter-band correlation within the quantisation matrix. In addition to the conventional quantitative metrics Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) for performance assessment, the classification accuracy on decoded data from the SVM is adopted for <b>quality-assured</b> evaluation, where the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) method with 3 D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for benchmarking. Results on four publically available HSI datasets have indicated that our approach outperforms SPIHT in both subjective (qualitative) and objective (quantitative) assessments for land cover analysis in remote sensing applications. Moreover, our approach is more efficient and generates much reduced degradation for subsequent data classification hence provides a more efficient and <b>quality-assured</b> solution in effective compression of HSI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) is the first-line malaria treatment {{throughout most of}} the malaria-endemic world. Data on ACT availability, price and market share are needed to provide a firm evidence base from which to assess the current situation concerning <b>quality-assured</b> ACT supply. This paper presents supply side data from ACTwatch outlet surveys in Benin, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia. Methods Between March 2009 and June 2010, nationally representative surveys of outlets providing anti-malarials to consumers were conducted. A census of all outlets with the potential to provide anti-malarials was conducted in clusters sampled randomly. Results 28, 263 outlets were censused, 51, 158 anti-malarials were audited, and 9, 118 providers interviewed. The proportion of public health facilities with at least one first-line <b>quality-assured</b> ACT in stock ranged between 43 % and 85 %. Among private sector outlets stocking at least one anti-malarial, non-artemisinin therapies, such as chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, were widely available (> 95 % of outlets) as compared to first-line <b>quality-assured</b> ACT (Conclusions These standardized, nationally representative results demonstrate the typically low availability, low market share and high prices of ACT, in the private sector where most anti-malarials are accessed, with some exceptions. The results confirm that there is substantial room to improve availability and affordability of ACT treatment in the surveyed countries. The data will also be useful for monitoring the impact of interventions such as the Affordable Medicines Facility for malaria. </p...|$|E

40|$|We use {{the full}} {{duration}} of collocated pixel-level MODIS-Terra and MISR aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals and level 2 cloud-screened <b>quality-assured</b> AERONET measurements {{to evaluate the}} likely individual MODIS and MISR retrieval accuracies globally over oceans and land. We show {{that the use of}} <b>quality-assured</b> MODIS AOTs as opposed to the use of all MODIS AOTs has little effect on the resulting accuracy. The MODIS and MISR relative standard deviations (RSTDs) with respect to AERONET are remarkably stable over the entire measurement record and reveal nearly identical overall AOT performances of MODIS and MISR over the entire suite of AERONET sites. This result is used to evaluate the likely pixel-level MODIS and MISR performances on the global basis with respect to the (unknown) actual AOTs. For this purpose, we use only fully compatible MISR and MODIS aerosol pixels. We conclude that the likely RSTDs for this subset of MODIS and MISR AOTs are 73 % over land and 30 % over oceans. The average RSTDs for the combined [AOT(MODIS) +AOT(MISR) ]/ 2 pixel-level product are close to 66 % and 27 %, respectively, which allows us to recommend this simple blend as a better alternative to the original MODIS and MISR data. These accuracy estimates still do not represent the totality of MISR and <b>quality-assured</b> MODIS pixel-level AOTs since an unaccounted for and potentially significant source of errors is imperfect cloud screening. Furthermore, many collocated pixels for which one of the datasets reports a retrieval, whereas the other one does not may also be problematic...|$|E

40|$|Tourist {{services}} {{can only be}} used on-site, and location therefore becomes a servicespecific characteristic for consumers and a factor influencing their cost and quality for providers. These services are a fine illustration of territorial rent differential. This territorial rent differential can be tested empirically in a French context by applying the hedonic pricing method to the <b>quality-assured</b> holiday cottage market. It is also possible to explore the role of environmental and territorial variables as service differentiation tools for tourism managers. The results of econometric analysis on market prices for <b>quality-assured</b> holiday cottages show that not only the inherent attributes of the holiday cottages but also environmental variables act as service differentiation tools. However, the actors do not use immediate natural environment variables in their differentiation strategy, which operates more on territorial variables. Two baseline territories were selected: one currently enjoying renewed consumer interest (the Aubrac territory, set deep in the Massif Central), and another more longstanding favourite with tourists (the Baronnies territory in the Drôme). Comparative analysis showed a catch-up trend for up-and-coming territories that are increasingly valued by the market. environmental valuation, market structure, hedonic prices method, territorial development...|$|E
