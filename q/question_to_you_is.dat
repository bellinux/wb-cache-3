40|$|One day I {{received}} {{electronic mail}} from our director of campus security [Gilbraith 1993]: 2 ̆ 2 I have a puzzle {{for you that}} has practical applications for me. I {{need to know how}} many different combinations there are for our combination locks. A lock has 5 buttons. In setting the combination you can use only 1 button or as many as 5. Buttons may be pressed simultaneously and / or successively, but the same button cannot be used more than once in the same combination. I had a student (obviously not a math major) email me that there are only 120 possibilities, but even I know this is only if you press all five buttons one at a time. It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t take into account 1 - 23 - 4 - 5, for instance. My <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> how many combinations exist, and is it enough to keep our buildings adequately protected? 2 ̆ 2 To clarify, combinations like 1 - 25 - 4 (which is the same as 1 - 52 - 4 but different from 4 - 25 - 1) and 1 - 2 - 5 - 43 are legal, whereas 13 - 35 is illegal because the number 3 is used twice. I gave this problem to the students in my discrete mathematics class as a bonus exercise. Most arrived at the (correct) answer of 1081 or 1082 by breaking the problem into oodles of cases, but this would not have been a convenient method if the locks contained 10 buttons instead of 5. I use this problem as an excuse to demonstrate the power of generating functions by solving the n-button problem. Most students are amazed that the problem is essentially solved by the function ex /(2 - ex), which leads to a surprisingly accurate approximation of n!/(ln 2) n+ 1...|$|E

5000|$|Slams are {{friendship}} {{books that}} include a theme of questions, either [...] "Sign if you did/like the following", [...] "What is your favorite" [...] or other similar questions.

And above all, we have to come out to the culture with the view that we are the ones who really stand for freedom of thought. You see, we don't have to fear freedom of thought because good thinking done in the right way will eventually lead back to the Church, to the truth-the truth that sets people free, even if it goes through a couple of detours on the way. And so we're the ones that stand for good science, objective reasoning, assumptions on the table, a high level of education, and freedom of conscience to think as we are capable of thinking.
