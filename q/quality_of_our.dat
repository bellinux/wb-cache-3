When we feel kindness and love and with this attitude do good things, which are beneficial to both ourselves and others, this is positive action. When we commit harmful deeds out of equally harmful intentions, this is negative action. Finally, when our motivation is indifferent and our deeds are neither harmful or beneficial, this is neutral action. The results we experience will accord with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> actions.|$|E

On 9 April 1948, a Hindu article said: [...] "The Indian Screen has, indeed, in this Province {{or any other}} given us little that can bear comparison with Gemini's Chandraleka for the sheer magnificence of its backgrounds. What is more, it is excellent entertainment." [...] On 10 April, an Indian Express article said: [...] "The film is essentially for the young {{of all ages and}} even the harassed house-wife will share the pleasure of children treated unexpectedly to a pride of lions, tigers, ponies and elephants showing their paces along with clowns and acrobats." [...] A Dinamani article that day said, [...] "People who were depressed with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Tamil pictures so far can now raise their heads and hail proudly that a great picture can be produced in our land also." [...] Kumudam gave the film a lukewarm review: [...] "Though the story is ordinary, the shocking events inserted into the narrative are something new to the Tamil cinema." [...] The magazine criticised the film's songs and length, saying that its time period was inconsistent: [...] "In a scene, there is a wall clock in the King's office, whereas he is writing with a feather-pen." [...] In its January 1949 issue Gundoosi magazine praised Chandralekha Hindi version as an improvement on the Tamil version, saying that it had better dialogue and pacing.|$|E

They focus on the mundane world. But no subject is fuller of implications than the mundane world!" [...] Mark Holborn, in his introduction to Ancient and Modern writes about the dark undercurrent of these mundane scenes as viewed through Eggleston's lens: [...] " [...] subjects are, on the surface, the ordinary inhabitants and environs of suburban Memphis and Mississippi—friends, family, barbecues, back yards, a tricycle and the clutter of the mundane. The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images there is a sense of lurking danger." [...] American artist Edward Ruscha said of Eggleston's work, [...] "When you see a picture he’s taken, you’re stepping into some kind of jagged world that seems like Eggleston World.” ...|$|E

[...] "As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation." [...] Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil.

2500|$|His {{first and}} best known book, Being and Time (1927), though unfinished, {{is one of}} the central {{philosophical}} works of the 20th century. In the first division of the work, Heidegger attempted to turn away from [...] "ontic" [...] questions about beings to ontological questions about Being, and recover the most fundamental philosophical question: the question of Being, of what it means for something to be. Heidegger approached the question through an inquiry into the being that has an understanding of Being, and asks the question about it, namely, Human being, which he called Dasein ("being-there"). Heidegger argued that Dasein is defined by Care, its practically engaged and concernful mode of Being-in-the-world, in opposition to Rationalist thinkers like René Descartes who located the essence of man in our thinking abilities. For Heidegger thinking is thinking about things originally discovered in our everyday practical engagements. The consequence of this is that our capacity to think cannot be the most central <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being because thinking is a reflecting upon this more original way of discovering the world. In the second division, Heidegger argues that human being is even more fundamentally structured by its Temporality, or its concern with, and relationship to time, existing as a structurally open [...] "possibility-for-being." [...] He emphasized the importance of Authenticity in human existence, involving a truthful relationship to our thrownness into a world which we are [...] "always already" [...] concerned with, and to our Being-towards-death, the Finitude of the time and being we are given, and the closing down of our various possibilities for being through time.|$|E
