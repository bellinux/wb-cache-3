Resident birds included tanagers (Tangara and Tachyphonus genera), woodcreepers (Xiphorhynchus genus), resplendent <b>quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno),</b> 15 species of curassows (Crax, Nothocrax, Mitu and Pauxi genera), and tinamous (Crypturellus and Tinamus genera).Endangered birds include wattled curassow (Crax globulosa), green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster) and red-necked aracari (Pteroglossus bitorquatus).|$|R
50|$|The resplendent <b>quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno)</b> moves {{seasonally}} {{from high}} elevation nesting sites to lower elevations {{on both sides}} of the Continental Divide. The beginning of the migration of the three-wattled bellbird (Procnias tricarunculata) is similar to that of the quetzal, with reproduction occurring close to the Continental Divide, from March to June, and followed by a post-reproductive move downhill on the Pacific slope during the months of August and September.|$|R
5000|$|The word quetzal {{comes from}} the Nahuatl (or Aztec) word quetzalli (from the root quetz meaning [...] "stand"), which {{translates}} to [...] "long green plume" [...] or [...] "tail feather of the quetzal". Quetzal is usually specifically {{used to refer to}} the resplendent <b>quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno)</b> first described by Pablo de la Llave in 1832 but in reality it applies to all members of the genera Pharomachrus and Euptilotis.|$|R
40|$|The Chimalapas region, {{in eastern}} Oaxaca, Mexico, holds lowland rainforests, {{tropical}} dry forests, and cloud forests {{typical of the}} Neotropics, as well as montane pine and pineoak forests more typical of the Nearctic. Totaling more than 600, 000 ha, much of the region is forested, and in a good state of preservation. The Chimalapas avifauna {{is by far the}} most diverse for any region of comparable size in the country, totalling at least 464 species in the region as a whole (with more than 300 species in the lowland rainforest) representing 44 % of the bird species known freom Mexico. Within the region, the humid Atlantic lowlands hold 317 species, the montane regions 113 species, and the southern dry forested lowlands 216 species. Important species present in the region include Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja and several other large eagles, Black Penelopina nigra and probably Horned Oreophasis derbianus Guans, Scarlet Macaw Ara macao, Cinnamontailed Sparrow Aimophila sumichrasti, Rosebellied Bunting Passerina rositae, and Resplendent <b>Quetzal</b> <b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno.</b> The area holds immense lowland rainforests and cloud forests that rank among the largest and best preserved in all of Mesoamerica, including a complete lowlandtohighland continuum, with entire watersheds preserved more or less intact...|$|R
5000|$|The name {{translates}} literally as [...] "Quetzal Serpent" [...] {{although it}} is often rendered less accurately as [...] "Feathered Serpent". The name derives from the K'iche' word q'uq, referring to the Resplendent <b>quetzal</b> <b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno,</b> a brightly coloured bird of the cloud forests of southern Mesoamerica. This is combined with the word kumatz [...] "snake". The male Resplendent quetzal boasts iridescent blue-green tail feathers measuring up to 1 m long that were prized by the Maya elite. The blue-green feathers symbolised vegetation and the sky, both symbols {{of life for the}} ancient Maya, while the bright red feathers of the bird's chest symbolised fire. Together, this combination gave a profound religious symbolism to the bird. The snake was a Maya symbol of rebirth due to its habit of shedding its skin to reveal a fresher one underneath. Q'uq'umatz thus combined the celestial characteristics of the Quetzal with the serpentine underworld powers of the snake, giving him power over all levels of the Maya universe. These characteristics also indicated a sexual duality between his masculine feathered serpent aspect and his feminine association with water and wind. This duality enabled the god to serve as a mediator between the masculine sun god Tohil and the feminine moon goddess Awilix, a role that was symbolised with the Mesoamerican ballgame.|$|R

The species' {{distribution}} {{models are}} normally feed by occurrences, geo referenced data points where a specie has been seen, and climatic {{information such as}} precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, among others. The species geographic distribution not only depends on those variables, {{there are other factors}} such as the relationship between the species or the geographic barriers, as ridges and lakes. The present research try {{to improve the quality of}} the species' distribution models by including the relationship between the species. In order to achieve that three bird species and the relationship with the plants which serve them as food were defined. The selected species are the lapa verde (Ara ambiguus) and its relationship with the almendro amarillo (Dipteryx panamensis), the pájaro campana (Procnias tricarunculatus) and its relationship with the Lauracea family and finally the <b>quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno)</b> and its relationship with the Lauracea family as well. In order to include the relationship between species into the species' distribution models a methodology in order to build a layer of "range of influence" were defined; with this new layer a set of experiments were defined, and those experiments verifies that by including the relationships between the species into the species' distribution models improve their precision.

40|$|The Resplendent <b>Quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> <b>mocinno)</b> is an altitudinal migrant that nests in high {{elevation}} cloud {{forests and}} migrates toward lower areas {{during the summer}} rainy season. It {{has been suggested that}} its migratory movements are related to the abundance of ripe Lauraceae fruits. We studied the quetzal diet during two consecutive years, as well as changes in fruit abundance of the plant species on which the bird feeds at El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Mexico. The quetzal was observed Feeding on 32 plant species of these, 24 are new records in its diet. We chose 20 of these 32 species and studied their fruit phenology for two years in order to describe the relationship between fruit and quetzal abundance. Our results showed that quetzal abundance in the breeding area was correlated with the total number of fruiting species, whereas the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruiting Lauraceae species was only marginal. Additionally, a correlation test showed that quetzal abundance was marginally correlated with total fruit availability (total no. of fruits per month) however, the correlation between quetzal abundance and the number of fruits in the Lauraceae was not significant. Our results suggest that the dynamics of food resources may be playing {{a major role in the}} quetzal's migratory behavior. Knowing the bird's diet may aid in characterizing the type of habitat adequate for its conservation. Our observations in this respect suggest that conservation efforts to preserve this bird species should concentrate on the protection of its habitat, including both breeding and nonbreeding (migration) locations...|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{requirement for}} the successful protection of endangered species is detailed understanding of how these species obtain their nourishment. For avian frugivorous like the Three-Wattled Bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus), the Emerald Toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus) and the Resplendent <b>Quetzal</b> (<b>Pharomachrus</b> moccino), the fruits of Neotropical tree species belonging to the Lauraceae family (in particular those within the genera Ocotea, Cinnamomum, and Beilschmiedia) are {{an essential part of}} their diet. After consuming these fruits, these birds will after some time regurgitate the seeds without the pericarp a species-specific distance away from the parent tree, thus functioning as primary seed dispersers (Wenny 2 ̆ 6 Levey 1998). Studies on seed dispersal for these species have focused on the pattern of seed distribution and seedling survival {{as a function of the}} species responsible for the dispersal (Wenny 2 ̆ 6 Levey 1998, Wenny 2000). I focused on the postdispersal fate of O. floribunda seeds by measuring giving up densities (GUD) between regurgitated seeds and regular seeds placed out in the open and under the canopy, and by using seed tagging to track seed fate for the regurgitated seeds. The regurgitated seeds in both areas on average appeared to be removed more than the regular seeds, but this difference was found to not be statistically significant. Out of 40 seeds tagged, six were buried and only one was consumed. While preliminary, these results suggest that a secondary stage of seed dispersal is present for O. floribunda, and warrant further investigation...|$|R
