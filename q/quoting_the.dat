5|$|Ethan Allen {{was born}} in Litchfield, Connecticut, the first-born child of Joseph and Mary Baker Allen, both of English and Puritan descent. The family moved {{to the town of}} Cornwall shortly after his birth. The move to Cornwall grew out of Allen's father's quest for freedom of {{religion}} during a time of turmoil: the Great Awakening, when Puritans were separating into churches with differing dogmas, in particular about the proper form of conversion: by works or by grace. His lifelong interest in philosophy and ideas emerged against the backdrop of his father's involvement in these Puritan debates and his father's refusal to convert to the covenant by grace. As a boy Allen already excelled at <b>quoting</b> <b>the</b> Bible and was known for disputing the meaning of passages.|$|E
5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom of thought, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by <b>quoting</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). <b>Quoting</b> <b>the</b> New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E

The away team rush to warn Wesley, only to discover he has accidentally broken a greenhouse while playing catch with the Edo youths. An Edo policeman attempts to give Wesley a lethal injection for this infraction of the law, but Yar and Worf draw their phasers. On the ship, the sphere leaves Data's body and departs. Picard, upon hearing of the situation with Wesley, transports to the surface. He meets {{with representatives of the}} Edo in a council chamber and explains that Earth no longer practices capital punishment. Some Edo interpret this stance as an attempt by the Federation to push their superiority and suggest that Picard should mount a rescue effort for the boy. He says he cannot, <b>quoting</b> <b>the</b> Prime Directive.|$|E
5|$|The book starts by <b>quoting</b> <b>the</b> First Amendment, {{which prohibits}} the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes {{the impact of this}} clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, <b>quoting</b> <b>the</b> Finding in the Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, he told his family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E

50|$|When first introduced, the Directives {{were used}} by Kryten to coerce Rimmer into acting altruistically or to {{highlight}} the less than exemplary behaviour {{of the rest of}} the crew.

Later on, Rimmer attempts to fight back by <b>quoting</b> from <b>the</b> same regulations, but his imperfect recall of the Directives means that he normally <b>quotes</b> <b>the</b> wrong paragraph number and instead references obscure and bizarre Directives that have little or no relevance to the situation at hand.|$|R
