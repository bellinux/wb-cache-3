Due {{to the need to}} process two views, the complexity of 3 D video applications is significantly higher than traditional 2 D counterparts. In order to enable real-time 3 D video services in mobile devices, this paper proposes a novel algorithm which reduces the complexity of stereo video encoding with improvement of coding efficiency. A novel search window center prediction method is proposed that exploits the correlation between two views. Experimental results show that the average encoding time of the second view can be decreased by 80 % with an increase in coding efficiency of up to 2 %. The state-of-art fast motion estimation methods for stereoscopic 3 D video encoding show coding efficiency decrease, whereas proposed method achieves the speed-up with increase in coding efficiency, making it suitable for high <b>qality</b> 3 D video applications.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is simple, yet complex: to provide a {{systematic}} analysis of Balzac's references to the visual arts, {{not only in the}} Comédie Humanine but in the apprentice novels and miscellaneous writings. In the words of this year's Année Balzacienne, it sets out to be a "bilan d'influences et d'allusions picturales", and as such is the first recent project in this field. It is a simple project in that it largely confines itself to the presence, in Balzac's work, of identifiable visual refences. It is complex in that there are many thousands of such refences, sometimes moulding and inspiring the creation of character or setting, sometimes merely serving as objects in the novels (a painting, a porcelain vase or a buhl sideboard), sometimes - but less often present in a didactic manner; moreover, the Comédie Humaine itself {{is in a state of}} constant evolution, as when (for instance) a Joseph Bridau is substituted for a Delacroix, or a Watteau fan for a pearwood crucifix carved by Giradon; and to add still further to the complexity, the territory of this exploration includes not only the visual indebtedness but equally Balzac's personal involvement with painting, sculpture, architecture, furnishing and engraving - together with a brief analysis of his fictional artists. Much has been written already about the theoretical aspects of Balzac's concern with painting, sculpture and engraving. This detailed account of the visual sources will, it is hoped, assist later theoretical discussions. Yet such is the range of the novelist's interest that even this account must be selective. In the chronological outline of Balzac's interest in the visual arts, it is stressed that even as a youth he had ample opportunity to study many of what were then considered the finest masterpieces in European painting. Until 1816 pictures confiscated from Italy, Spain and the Netherlands were held at the Louvre — in addition to that gallery's "indigenous" collection. There were also his visits to foreign collections: Vienna, Munich, Venice, Florence, Milan, St Petersburg, Berlin, Dresden, The Hague, Amsterdam, Rome. Almost equally important were his actual contacts with painters such as Delacroix and Boulanger, the failed painter Gautier, and the sculptor Théophile Bra. Despite Bazlac's indebtedness to Girodet's "Endymion", Delacroix's colourful treatment of the Faust theme, and his special debts to Sigalon and Delorme, much the greater debt to contemporary French art is to caricature, which influenced him in the choice of certain types of subject-matter. Many of his early serial publications - L'Usurier for example — are transpositions into words of visual image popularised by Gavarni and Monnier. The same interest in caricature accounts for the part played in the Comédie Humaine only in the novels - by dandies, lorettes, grisettes and the stock figure of the crass bourgeois. In traditional French painting Balzac appreciated the Rococo style at a time when it had only recently begun to be fashionable again. Amongst Dutch, Flemish and German painters, he disparaged Rubens for his "montagnes de viandes flamandes, saupoudrées de vermillon"; he almost equated Rembrandt with the genre painters in his admiration for "les vieillards que le pinceau de Van Ostade, de Rembrandt, de Miéris, de Gérard Dow a tant caressés"; from Flemish painting he derived both Porbus and a mythical artist, Frenhofer, to whom yet another Flemish artist, Mabuse, supposedly transmitted the ultimate secrtes of his art. In Italian painting Raphael was the outstanding personality, both to Balzac and most of his contemporaries; in the Comédie Humaine he is usually associated with angelie and etherial virtue; its radiantly pure virgins are modelled upon Raphael's Madonnas, but so too are some of its loveliest courtesans. Balzac almost certainly saw the "Apollo Belvedere", the "Antinott", the "Venus de' Medici" and other masterpieces of Classical sculpture during their confiscation in France; such statues inspire many fictional portraits. The portrait of Camille Maupin reflects a topical interest in Egyptology. Of the sculptors of his own time Balzac found Canova and Thorwaldsen the most congenial, neo-Classicism being more suited to sculpture than to painting. In architecture he undoubtedly failed to respond to much that is great and imaginative. Like Stendahl, he was indifferent to the Baroque style, even the Baroque architecture of Paris. What most elated him in erchitecturw was the vastness of such buildings as Bourges Cathedral. In Balzac's treatment of furnishings and settings, modern furniture is made into a symbol of parvanu vulgarity. Furnishings and settings of many historical epochs are presented in the novels, from the early fourteenth century to the First Empire. Of all these Balzac infinitely preferred the Louis XV style: again, he was a forerunner in the revival of interest in the eighteenth century. Engravings are not an aspect of the visual arts in which Balzac appreciated the best. The only great engravers to have exerted any marked influence upon the Comédie Humnaine are Callot and Delacroix: Callot in his inspiration of La Frélore, and Delcroix in that he helped to popularise the Faust theme. Painters, sculptors, writers — even natural scientists — are all artists, In Balzac's definition of the term; and the primary loyalty of all is to their own art. Balzac does not share the Romantic notion of the artist's role as Philosopher King. As in the cases of Claës and Poussin, art can give rise to heartrending conflicts of loyalty, but all true artists resolve such conflicts to the advantage of their art. Other <b>qalities</b> of the true artist are spontaneity and ingenousness, qualities that would debar him from the political mission of a Lamartine or Hugo. Sarrasine, La maison du Chat-qui- Pelote and Le Chef-d'oeuvre all emphasize that the artist's dedication and naiveté lead to a discordance with reality - an idea essentially derived from Hoffmann. In the main, Balzac's artists fail to achive worldly success. Grassou, who does achieve it, is a second-rate ddauber. But he pleases the wealthy middle class, whereas Joseph Bridau, the true artist, disgruntles them. Joseph is totally worsted in his conflict with Flore Brazier and Max Gilet; though eventually he becomes wealthy, it is only through an irony of fate. Artistic success in the Comédie Humaine isn dearly and bitterly won, but money is a stimulus to creative effort — as is an understanding woman. As Steinbeck's career reveals, the greatest danger threatening any artist is failure through sheer lack of application. But hardly less serious a danger is to theorize, rather than experiment brush in hand. Indeed, an artist's indolence often arises from the much greater difficulty of executing works of art than conceiving them. Excessive theorizing leads Frenhofer to the opposite pitfall, a constant process of retouching, an obsessive desire for an impossible perfection. Yet despite his tragic slowness in production Frenhofer may have been the pioneer of abtstract art — whose still greater tragedy lay in his own destruction of his work. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background Delivering {{high quality}} health care {{requires}} an ongoing effort {{at all levels of}} the health system to adopt new knowledge in routine practice, to identify and resolve persistent quality problems, and to meet the evolving needs of populations. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is among the most promising approaches for tackling these challenges in primary care. CQI brings teams of health professionals together to develop and test changes to the systems and processes used to deliver care. The result is expected to be substantial and sustained improvement in healthcare quality. Yet limited research on how (and indeed if) CQI works creates uncertainty over its true value and weakens our ability to predict the circumstance in which CQI will be effective. Aims The overarching aim of this thesis is to examine what we know about the effectiveness of CQI in primary care and develop a framework to strengthen future research. More specifically, the aims are to: (1) synthesise existing research on the effects, and factors that modify the effects, of CQI in primary care, (2) support the design of CQI research by developing a framework intended to help evaluators identify and measure factors salient to our understanding of CQI in primary care, and (3) guide selection of the best available instruments for measuring factors in the framework. Methods Three types of research synthesis methods were used in this thesis. Systematic review methods and metaanalysis of randomised trials were used to evaluate the effectiveness of CQI. Qualitative synthesis of prevailing concepts of CQI and factors thought to influence its effectiveness was used to develop a theorybased framework for evaluating CQI. Systematic review methods were used to identify and evaluate the measurement properties of quantitative self-report instruments suitable for measuring factors in the developed framework. Framework-based synthesis methods were used to categorise instrument content in a taxonomy designed to enable direct comparison of instruments and illustrate coverage of the framework. Results Based on existing evidence from randomised trials, the effects of CQI on health professional performance and patient outcomes in primary care are uncertain. AnalysiS of more than 170 papers contributed to development of the lnforming <b>Q!!ality</b> Improvement Research (InQuiRe) framework. InQuiRe covers four domains (CQI process, implementation approaches, enabling context, outcomes) and includes (1) a -taxonomy of factors thought relevant to understanding and predicting the process and outcomes of CQI, (2) definition of these factors, and (3) description of the mechanism by which CQI process and context are thought to interact to yield improvements in health care. Content analysis of 319 instruments identified 160 instruments measuring factors in the InQuiRe framework, 78 of which are suitable for primary care. Conclusions Despite an expansive literature, existing evidence is yet to address important policy and practice questions about how best to implement and ensure the success of CQI in different contexts. Addressing these questions will require evaluations that examine the interplay between CQI process, context, and outcomes. The InQuiRe framework provides a tool and suite of instruments to support the design of such evaluations...|$|E
40|$|POVZETEK IN KLJUČNE BESEDE Diplomska naloga govori o stresu in stiskah staršev in otrok ob prehodu od doma v vrtec. Za to temo sem se odločila, saj se pri svojem delu že več let srečujem s starši in otroki, ki vstopajo v vrtec. Ob tem pa vsako leto tudi s stisko, ki jo občutijo starši in otroci. Stisko starši preživljajo oziroma občutijo različno. Stisko staršev pripisujemo v večini nezaupanju in nezadostni pripravljenosti staršev. Ta stiska staršev se nezavedno prenaša tudi na otroke. Zato je pomembna tudi priprava staršev na vstop otroka v vrtec. Pripravljeni morajo biti, da se ločijo od otroka in zaupajo vzgojiteljici, da bo dobro poskrbela za njihovega otroka. Pomembna je tudi komunikacija, saj slaba komunikacija med starši in vzgojitelji je negativen zgled za otroka, katere posledica je težje prilagajanje na vrtec. Vse kar starši delajo, občutijo, [...] se nezavedno prenaša tudi na otroka. Priprava staršev vključuje roditeljski sestanek v mesecu juniju, individualni pogovori z vzgojiteljico, ter obisk vrtca in skupine. Pri pripravi so pomembni tudi uvajalni dnevi. Uvajalni dnevi so namenjeni otrokom in staršem, neizbežno je sodelovanje družine in vrtca, kajti le tako se lahko dovolj dobro spoznamo, si zaupamo in uskladimo vzgojne postopke. Za izhodišče svojega dela, sem si postavila štiri hipoteze, ki sem jih s pomočjo rezultatov ankete izvedene med starši, ki so letošnje šolsko leto uvajali otroke v vrtec Hoče, ob koncu tudi ovrednotila. Vzgojitelji se trudimo, da bi bil prehod med domom in vrtcem tako za otroka kot za starše in ne nazadnje tudi za nas čim lažja in čim manj stresna. Z medsebojno pomočjo nam v tem procesu lahko uspe vzpostaviti kvalitetne odnose, ki so temelj dobrega počutja vseh v procesu in dobra nadaljnja podlaga za delo in sodelovanje. ABSTRACT AND KEY WORDS	 In {{my thesis}} I deal with stress and {{distress}} {{parents and their}} children feel when they go to nursery school for the first time. I have decidet to deal with this topic because i have been encountering parents and their cchildren entering nursery school for the first time. This is a part of my work for some years now. At the same time I observe the distress both parents and children experience. However, they experience the distress in different ways. This is due to their distrust and a lack of readiness. Parents 2 ̆ 7 distress subconsciously influences their children. Thus the preparatory phase should be very important for {{parents and their children}} before entering nursery school. Parents should be ready to be separated from their child and to trust the nursery school teacher being able to take good care of their child. Good communication between parents and the nursery school teachers is also very important, because otherwise children get a negative example, and the consequences are even harder adyustment for the child. Everything parents do or feel, it subconsciously affects their children. The first step in order to prepare parents is an organized meeting in June and individual talks to nursery school teachers. Also a visit to nursery school and meeting the group is a part of it. Preparation also includes introductory days. They are ment for parents and their children, thus the cooperation between the family and the nursery school is inevitable. This is the only way for parents and nursery school teachers {{to get to know each}} other, to trust each other, and to adjust either ways of raising up the child. The starting-point of my thesis were four hypothesis which were at the end assessed through the results gained by the survey. The survey was given to the parents whode children were introduced to the nursery school Hoče in the current cshool year. The nursery school teachers are striving to make the transition from home to nursery school less difficult and less stressful for children, parents and themselves as well. In this process there is a possibility to restore <b>qality</b> relationships with mutual help. They are the foundation for well-being of all involved in this process, as well as a good basis for future work and cooperation...|$|E
