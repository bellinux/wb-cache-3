40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} some of the salient differences in punctuation between Arabic and English. Although both languages share many of the basic punctuation marks such as the period, the comma, and the <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks,</b> Arabic has its own method of punctuation which is not strictly governed by the same rules as in English. Even punctuation marks that were transferred from European languages through translation have been adapted to the writing conventions of Arabic. The comma, quotation marks and parentheses have been utilized with multiple and sometimes overlapping functions, but other marks like the apostrophe and the semicolon have rarely if ever been used in original Arabic texts. In some cases, English punctuational marks are either deleted or substituted by Arabic lexical insertions. Our study examines how meaning is realigned and structure reordered while translating between English and Arabic in order to retain the function of missing punctuation marks in the TT...|$|E
40|$|On the microblogging site Twitter, {{users can}} forward any message they receive {{to all of}} their followers. This is termed a retweet and is usually done when users find a message {{particularly}} interesting and worth sharing with others. Thus, retweets reflect what the Twitter community considers interesting on a global scale, {{and can be used}} to generate a model to describe the content-based characteristics of retweets. In this paper, we use this model to deduce what makes a message on Twitter interesting. The question of what causes a message to be retweeted has frequently been addressed, but mainly in a scenario of retweet prediction for a given user and with a focus on the structure of the social network [3, 4, 5]. In this case a typical observation is that a well connected user with active followers is more likely to get retweeted. As the content of a tweet in such a setting is neglected or reduced to a few very simple features, a network-based analysis of retweets may give hints on who tends to write interesting messages, but cannot give insights into what the community is interested in. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the content of a tweet. We train a prediction model to forecast for a given tweet its likelihood of being retweeted solely based on its contents. From the parameters the model has learned we then deduce what are the influential content features that contribute to the likelihood of a retweet – and thereby are characteristics of an interesting message in the context of Twitter. For this purpose, we analyze a set of high- and low-level content-based features on a large collection of twitter messages. The low-level features comprise the words contained in a tweet, the tweet being a direct message, the presence of URLs, hashtags, usernames, emoticons, and of <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> as well as terms with a strong positive or negative connotation. These features are directly extracted from the text of a message and do not require further pro-cessing. The high-level features are formed by associating tweets to topics and by determining the sentiments of a tweet. The topics were obtained by applying latent Dirichlet allocation [1] t...|$|E
50|$|Sentence {{boundary}} disambiguation (SBD), {{also known}} as sentence breaking or sentence boundary detection, is the problem in natural language processing of deciding where sentences begin and end. Often natural language processing tools require their input to be divided into sentences {{for a number of}} reasons. However sentence boundary identification is challenging because punctuation marks are often ambiguous. For example, a period may denote an abbreviation, decimal point, an ellipsis, or an email addressnot the end of a sentence. About 47% of the periods in the Wall Street Journal corpus denote abbreviations. As well, <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> may appear in embedded quotations, emoticons, computer code, and slang.|$|R
50|$|In {{non-functional}} linguistics, {{a sentence}} is a textual unit consisting {{of one or}} more words that are grammatically linked. In functional linguistics, a sentence is a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods, <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks.</b> This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time. This entry is mainly about sentence in its non-functional sense, though much work in functional linguistics is indirectly cited or considered such as the categories of Speech Act Theory.|$|R

50|$|Inverted <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> (¿) <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> (Commonwealth English) or exclamation points (American English) (¡) are {{punctuation}} marks used to begin interrogative and exclamatory sentences (or clauses), respectively, in written Spanish and sometimes also in languages which have cultural ties with Spanish, {{such as in}} older standards of Galician (now it is optional and not recommended) and the Waray language. They can also be combined in several ways to express {{the combination of a}} <b>question</b> <b>and</b> surprise or disbelief. The initial marks are normally mirrored {{at the end of the}} sentence or clause by the common marks (?, !) used in most other languages. Unlike the ending marks, which are printed along the baseline of a sentence, the inverted marks (¿ and ¡) descend below the line.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{innovative}} Chinese register study based on regression analysis for sentence length distribution and text clustering. Although end of sentence is not conventionally marked in Chinese, we resolve this issue by assuming that segments between periods, <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> are sentences, {{which can be}} further divided into simple sentences and compound sentences. We also assume that segments between punctuation marks that express pauses in utterances form sentences (i. e., clauses). Using regression analysis, {{we find that the}} frequency distribution of sentence and clause lengths in Chinese can be fitted by the formula F = aLbcL, where L is sentence/clause length. Texts from different registers give rise to different fitted values of the parameters, and hence can serve to differentiate these registers. Finally, we use these parameters to represent and cluster texts from different registers. The successful text clustering results further prove that the parameters of the fitted results are reliable linguistic characteristics for different registers. In terms of linguistic theories, our study shows that it is just as effective to model sentence length in Chinese using sociological words (i. e., characters) as it is using linguistic words.

In the third semester’s student Academic Year 2013 / 2014, the students learn about ‘essay’. Essay itself is a group of paragraph about a specific subject. Usually, it contains of five paragraphs. However, in writing essay, the students have some problems to be faced, and one of them is about ‘punctuation marks’. Sometimes, punctuation mark has seen as a little thing, but actually it has a big effect which influences a written work quality, they are grammatically and semantically effect. Actually, many errors were made by the students in using punctuation marks in writing essay. It would determine the quality of the students’ writing work. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) What are the errors made by the third semester students at IAIN Tulungagung in using punctuation marks in writing essay? 2) What are the dominant errors made by the third semester students at IAIN Tulungagung in using punctuation marks in writing essay?

50|$|The {{period of}} the mature {{literary}} language from the 16th {{to the beginning of}} the 17th century. The orthography in written texts is not still unified, digraphs are used predominantly in various forms. After the invention of book-printing, the so-called Brethren orthography stabilized in printed documents. The Bible of Kralice (1579 - 1593), the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages by the Unity of the Brethren, became the pattern of the literal Czech language. The orthography was predominantly diacritic; the dot in soft consonants was replaced by the caron which was used in č, ď, ň, ř, ť, ž. The letter š was mostly written in the final positions in words only, the digraph ʃʃ was written in the middle. The grapheme ě became used in the contemporary way. Vowel length was denoted by the acute accent, except for ů developed from original uo. The long í was doubled ii for technical reasons; later it was denoted as ij, and finally as j. Pronounced j was recorded as g or y, pronounced g was sometimes recorded by the grapheme ǧ. The double w was preserved, the simple v denoted the word-initial u. The diphthong ou was denoted as au. The hard y was always written after c, s, z (cyzý, strange). The complicated syntax, influenced by Latin texts, required some improvement of the punctuation. However, the comma was used according to pauses in pronunciation, not the syntax. The full stop, the colon, the <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> <b>and</b> the <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark</b> are used. The first grammars are published for typographers' purposes.|$|R
