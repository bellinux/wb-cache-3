An aggregate welfare index must take into account, at least, the evolution of the first two moments of the distribution of income, and so does the adjustment for inequality make important differences in the evolution of average per capita income?

We sought to identify and develop practical answers to key clinical <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>HAND</b> management. Sixty-six specialists from 30 countries provided input into the program, which was overseen by a steering committee. Fourteen questions were rated as being of greatest clinical importance. Answers were drafted by an expert group based on a comprehensive literature review. Sixty-three experts convened to determine consensus and level of evidence for the answers. Consensus was reached on all answers. For instance, good practice suggests that all HIV patients should be screened for HAND early in disease using standardized tools. Follow-up frequency depends on whether HAND is already present or whether clinical data suggest risk for developing HAND. Worsening neurocognitive impairment may trigger consideration of antiretroviral modification when other causes have been excluded.

Rather than a historical ethnography of commemorative rites, commemoration is studied as a genuine component of laboratory life. The case study {{focuses on the}} Heymans Institute of Ghent University, Belgium, from 1902 to 1970. Using the categories celebrations, publications and iconography it will become clear that the Heymans lab and by extension many other laboratories performed a multitude of commemorative practices all with their specific function {{both inside and outside}} the lab. Not only public celebrations for the successful laboratory director, but also, for example, birthday parties are taken into account. How did these practices evolve throughout time?

Complementary statistical approaches that can show the relative effects of different factors are needed in biodiversity analyses in addition to classical multivariate models. Better understanding of the key factors underlying the variation in diversity requires the analyses of multiple taxonomic groups from different perspectives, such as richness, occurrence, threat status and population trends. The geographical coincidence of species richness of different taxonomic groups can be rather limited. This implies that multiple geographical regions should be taken into account in order to preserve various groups of species. Boreal agricultural biodiversity and in particular, distribution and richness of threatened species is strongly associated with various grasslands. Further, heterogeneous agricultural landscapes characterized by moderate field size, forest patches and non-crop agricultural habitats enhance the biodiversity of rural environments. From the landscape ecological perspective, the major threats to Finnish agricultural biodiversity are the decline of connected grassland habitat networks, and general homogenization of landscape structure resulting from both intensification and marginalization of agriculture. The maintenance of key habitats, such as meadows and pastures is an essential task in conservation of agricultural biodiversity. Furthermore, a larger landscape context should be incorporated in conservation planning and decision making processes in order to respond to the needs of different species and to maintain heterogeneous rural landscapes and viable agricultural diversity in the future...|$|E

The same technique is useful (though rarely used) in a Bayesian settings, as it eliminates the need to put priors on nuisance parameters.

The set of lattice points contained in the conditional distribution is difficult to manage, computa-tionally or analytically. 2.

Firstly by answering the question “Is the coefficient of rolling resistance reduced if the material of the surface is more compact and smooth”. Secondly by answering “Is the coefficient of rolling resistance reduced if the tire pressure increases?” This is then further elaborated by combining the two, “What are the best conditions of surface and tire pressure to obtain the optimum rolling resistance coefficient?” For the experiment a car was speeded up to exactly 60 km/h every time and the gear was slipped into neutral at a certain point. Then the time and distance for the car to stop was measured {{with the help of a}} chronometer and check points set next to the experimentation road. The conclusion leads to the inevitable fact that there are very important correlations between the surfaces compactness and the tires pressure to the coefficient of rolling resistance. It is inferred from the drawn conclusion that the coefficient of rolling resistance is inversely proportional to the compactness of the material on the surface and the pressure of the tires. However there is an optimum level for the coefficient of rolling resistance as the wheels are impossible to displace the car without it...|$|R

Aim: To provide a detailed presentation of the epistemological and practical value of the DT, through a series of four consecutive papers which expand on the following: i) the classical methodological approach and its main modifications, ii) the methodological reflections iii) analysis and presentation of results, and iv) the use and usefulness of the method in application to nursing research.

Nevertheless, due to many variations of the basic philosophy of the method and the many differentiations in its application, it is quite difficult to classify each study that used Delphi, with precision. The main methodological differences that can challenge the researcher are discussed and finally, examples that show the advantages and the usefulness of the individual Delphi techniques are given.

40|$|Abstract Background Identifying {{cellular}} subsystems {{that are}} involved in the expression of a target phenotype has been a very active research area for the past several years. In this paper, cellular subsystem refers to a group of genes (or proteins) that interact and carry out a common function in the cell. Most studies identify genes associated with a phenotype on the basis of some statistical bias, others have extended these statistical methods to analyze functional modules and biological pathways for phenotype-relatedness. However, a biologist might often have a specific <b>question</b> <b>in</b> mind while performing such analysis and most of the resulting subsystems obtained by the existing methods might be largely irrelevant to the <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> Arguably, it would be valuable to incorporate biologist's knowledge about the phenotype into the algorithm. This way, it is anticipated that the resulting subsytems would not only be related to the target phenotype but also contain information that the biologist is likely to be interested in. Results In this paper we introduce a fast and theoretically guranteed method called DENSE (Dense and ENriched Subgraph Enumeration) that can take in as input a biologist's prior knowledge as a set of query proteins and identify all the dense functional modules in a biological network that contain some part of the query vertices. The density (in {{terms of the number of}} network egdes) and the enrichment (the number of query proteins in the resulting functional module) can be manipulated via two parameters γ and μ, respectively. Conclusion This algorithm has been applied to the protein functional association network of Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824, a hydrogen producing, acid-tolerant organism. The algorithm was able to verify relationships known to exist in literature and also some previously unknown relationships including those with regulatory and signaling functions. Additionally, we were also able to hypothesize that some uncharacterized proteins are likely associated with the target phenotype. The DENSE code can be downloaded from [URL] </p...|$|R

Mr. Vaughan assents, and says (we cannot see why) {{that there is no}} mysticism in such a belief. Be that as it may, what that influence is, and how exercised, is all through the de quo agitur of Mysticism.

40|$|Model {{uncertainty}} is rarely {{considered in the}} field of biogeochemical modeling. The standard biogeochemical modeling approach is to proceed based on one selected model with the “right” complexity level based on data availability. However, other plausible models can result in dissimilar answer to the scientific <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand</b> using the same set of data. Relying on a single model can lead to underestimation of uncertainty associated with the results and therefore lead to unreliable conclusions. Multi-model ensemble strategy is a means to exploit the diversity of skillful predictions from different models with multiple levels of complexity. The aim of this paper is two fold, first to explore the impact of a model’s complexity level on the accuracy of the end results and second to introduce a probabilistic multi-model strategy {{in the context of a}} process-based biogeochemical model. We developed three different versions of a biogeochemical model, TOUGHREACT-N, with various complexity levels. Each one of these models was calibrated against the observed data from a tomato field in Western Sacramento County, California, and considered two different weighting sets on the objective function. This way we created a set of six ensemble members. The Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach was then used to combine these ensemble members by the likelihood that an individual model is correct given the observations. Our results demonstrated that none of the models regardless of their complexity level under both weighting schemes were capable of representing all the different processes within our study field. Later we found that it is also valuable to explore BMA to assess the structural inadequacy inherent in each model. The performance of BMA expected prediction is generally superior to the individual models included in the ensemble especially when it comes to predicting gas emissions. The BMA assessed 95 % uncertainty bounds bracket 90 – 100 % of the observations. The results clearly indicate the need to consider a multi-model ensemble strategy over a single model selection in biogeochemical modeling study...|$|R

But, as a matter of fact, we make a travesty of the simplest process of thought when we put it into words for the words are all coloured and forsworn, apply inaccurately, and bring with them, from former uses ideas of praise and blame {{that have nothing to do}} with the <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>hand.</b> So we must always see to it nearly, that we judge by the realities of life and not by the partial terms that represent them in man's speech; and at times of choice, we must leave words upon one side, and act upon those brute convictions, unexpressed and perhaps inexpressible, which cannot be flourished in an argument, but which are truly the sum and fruit of our experience. Words are for communication, not for judgment. This is what every thoughtful man knows for himself, for only fools and silly schoolmasters push definitions over far into the domain of conduct; and the majority of women, not learned in these scholastic refinements, live all-of-a-piece and unconsciously, as a tree grows, without caring to put a name upon their acts or motives. Hence, a new difficulty for Whitman's scrupulous and argumentative poet; he must do more than waken up the sleepers to his words; he must persuade them to look over the book and at life with their own eyes.|$|R
