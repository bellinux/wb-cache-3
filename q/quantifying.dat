Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of <b>quantifying</b> bird migration.|$|E

For example, the decibel is a unit <b>quantifying</b> signal power log-ratios and amplitude log-ratios (of which {{sound pressure}} {{is a common}} example). In chemistry, pH is a logarithmic measure for the acidity of an aqueous solution. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific formulae, and in measurements {{of the complexity of}} algorithms and of geometric objects called fractals. They describe musical intervals, appear in formulas counting prime numbers, inform some models in psychophysics, and can aid in forensic accounting.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises range across {{tropical}} and subtropical {{regions and}} {{are found in}} primary and secondary rainforests, as well as bamboo groves and mangrove forests. They prefer forests with high, dense canopies, although some species have also been found in disturbed habitats, such as cacao plantations and mixed-crop home gardens. Due largely to their nocturnal behavior and the subsequent difficulties in accurately <b>quantifying</b> abundance, data about the population size or distribution patterns of slow lorises is limited. In general, encounter rates are low; a combined analysis of several field studies involving transect surveys conducted in South and Southeast Asia determined encounter rates ranging from as high as 0.74lorises per kilometer for N.coucang to as low as 0.05lorises per kilometer for N.pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, <b>quantifying</b> the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{extend the}} {{traditional}} formalization of a Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problems (DisCSP) to a <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP. A <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP includes several universally <b>quantified</b> variables, {{while all of}} the variables in a traditional DisCSP are existen-tially <b>quantified.</b> A universally <b>quantified</b> variable represents a choice of the nature or an adversary. A <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP formalizes a situation where a team of agents {{is trying to make}} a robust plan against the na-ture or an adversary. In this paper, we present the formalization of such a <b>Quantified</b> DisCSP and develop an algorithm for solving it. This algo-rithm generalizes the asynchronous backtracking algorithm used for solv-ing a DisCSP. In this algorithm, agents communicate a value assignment called a good in addition to the nogood used in asynchronous backtrack-ing. Interestingly, the procedures executed by an adversarial/cooperative agent for good/nogood are totally symmetrical. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Reflective Logic and Default Logic {{are both}} {{generalized}} {{so as to}} allow universally <b>quantified</b> variables to cross modal scopes whereby the Barcan formula and its converse hold. This is done by representing both the fixed-point equation for Reflective Logic and the fixed-point equation for Default both as necessary equivalences in the Modal Quantificational Logic Z. and then inserting universal quantifiers before the defaults. The two resulting systems, called <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic and <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic, are then compared by deriving metatheorems of Z that express their relationships. The main result {{is to show that}} every solution to the equivalence for <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic is a strongly grounded solution to the equivalence for <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic. It is further shown that <b>Quantified</b> Reflective Logic and <b>Quantified</b> Default Logic have exactly the same solutions when no default has an entailment condition...|$|R
