5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per unit of mass) {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> isotope's half-life.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior {{representatives of}} his Government {{for a final}} time at the Kasteel van Wijnendale in West Flanders. The meeting is {{frequently}} cited as {{the start of the}} Royal <b>Question</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> moment of the decisive break between King and Government. Four ministers of the Government were present: Hubert Pierlot, Paul-Henri Spaak, Henri Denis and Arthur Vanderpoorten. By the time of the meeting, {{against the backdrop of the}} bloody Battle of the Lys, the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France. They urged the King to join them, following the examples of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans. The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France.|$|E

5|$|Ramanujan {{spent nearly}} five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and {{published}} part of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of mathematics had come into <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> need for mathematically rigorous proofs recognized. Hardy was an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. While in England, Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his inspiration - a conflict that neither found easy.|$|E

The treaties were signed between the League and some of the newly established nations: Poland, Yugoslavia (also known then as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), Czechoslovakia. Similar treaties were also imposed on Greece and Entente-allied Romania in exchange for their territorial enlargement, and on some of the nations defeated in the First World War (Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey).
