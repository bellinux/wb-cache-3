40|$|Feature {{extraction}} is {{an important}} component of a pattern recognition system. A well-defined feature extraction algorithm makes the identification process more effective and efficient. <b>Quality</b> <b>checking</b> {{is one of the most}} prominent steps in many applications using Feature extraction. Several techniques exist for the <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials. However, image based <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials still remains a challenging task. Although trivial <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> methods are available, they do not give useful results in most situations. This paper addresses the issue of <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> of wooden materials using feature extraction techniques with high accuracy and reliability.

We focus on supply chain collaboration between a hotel, and its {{food and beverage}} suppliers. The transaction costs found consist of the search cost and cost of <b>quality</b> <b>checking.</b> Search cost exists due to bounded rationality of the firm. This is influenced by asymmetric information. The cost of <b>quality</b> <b>checking</b> incurs because the firm perceives that its suppliers may behave opportunistically.
