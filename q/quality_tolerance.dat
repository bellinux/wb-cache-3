40|$|Abstract: This paper reviews {{some recent}} {{applications}} of queueing theory and convex analysis in determining customer admission, inventory, and quality control policies jointly in manufacturing systems that produce a single product to meet random demand. These {{problems have been}} addressed separately in the past. We consider admission and production control policies of the threshold type whereby the system produces until stock reaches a certain level and accepts orders until its backlog reaches another critical level. The problem {{is to find the}} optimal <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the critical stock and backlog levels which maximize the mean profit rate of the system. We also examine a supply chain comprising two factories in series with external subcontractors, and we compare the benefit of determining the optimal base stocks for the two systems jointly rather than individually. From theoretical and numerical results, it appears that managing inventory levels, sales, and <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> jointly achieves higher profit than independently determined control policies...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} information relevant to the use and development of rootstocks from temperate fruit trees (particularly apple, pear and cherry) as an effective means of enhancing harvest index (e. g. weight of useable fruit yield relative to total plant weight). The intention is to provide information to facilitate exploration and discussion of which scientific approach(es) might best suit the future development of cocoa growing. The grafting of clonal scions onto rootstocks is an ancient practice initiated to obviate problems associated with not being able to obtain trueness-to-type from seedlings and limitations in the ability to root scions directly for vegetative propagation. Subsequently, it became apparent that many features of the scion could be beneficially influenced. In particular, these included increases in harvest index, precocity (reducing the period of the juvenile phase), yield (productivity), fruit size and <b>quality,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to climatic stress, pest and disease resistance, as well as the ability to control tree size (dwarfing). Direct rootstock advantages, such as increased anchorage and improved uptake of water and nutrients may also improve the harvest index.

40|$|Traffic {{smoothing}} {{for delivery}} of online VBR media streams {{is one of}} the most important problems in designing multimedia systems. Given available client buffer and a window-sliding size, conventional approaches try to reduce bandwidth allocated in each window. However, they can not lead to the minimization of bandwidth allocated for transmitting entire stream. Although a window-sliding approach was introduced to further reduce the bandwidth allocated recently [21], it was computational costly. In this paper, an effective and efficient online traffic-smoothing scheme is proposed. Different from the conventional static window-sliding approaches, our approach dynamically decides the suitable window-sliding size to online smooth the bursty traffic. Then, an aggressive workahead scheme is applied in transmitting entire stream. By examining different media streams, our approach has small bandwidth, high bandwidth utilization and small computation cost. Considering the online transmission of a Star War movie, our approach result is 13 % less for the bandwidth and 4 % less for the network idle rate than SLWIN(1). Comparing the number of window sliding, our approach is 75 % less than SLWIN(1). The relations between the characteristic of input traffic and the behavior of obtained scheduling results are discussed.

We describe the development of the first single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays for amaranth. In addition, we report the characterization of the first complete genetic linkage map in the genus. The SNP assays are based on KASPar genotyping chemistry and were detected using the Fluidigm dynamic array platform. A diversity screen of 41 accessions of the cultivated amaranth species and their putative ancestor species (L.) showed that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of these markers ranged from 0. 05 to 0. 5 with an average MAF of 0. 27 per SNP locus. One hundred and forty-one of the SNP loci were considered highly polymorphic (MAF ≥ 0. 3). Linkage mapping placed all 411 markers into 16 linkage groups, presumably corresponding to each of the 16 amaranth haploid chromosomes. The map spans 1288 cM with an average marker density of 3. 1 cM per marker.

We report the development of a novel genomic reduction protocol based on restriction-site conservation and multiplex identifiers (MID) barcodes to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a pooled amaranth library of four mapping parents. The incorporation of MID barcodes allowed for DNA sample pooling, sequence deconvolution, and the identification of SNPs for specific mapping populations without additional genotyping. Approximately 1. 3 million sequence-reads with an average read length of 440 bp were collected from a single 454 -pyrosequencing run. Contigs specific to each of the four mapping populations were assembled. The assembled contigs had an average read-length of 464 bp, and an average read-depth of 16 X. A total of 27, 658 SNPs were observed across all populations. The average base coverage at all SNPs was 20 X. Thirty-four of 35 (97 %) predicted SNPs were verified via resequencing and the random genomic distribution of the SNPs generated using this approach was shown in.

In this paper, the rate of disfigurement is discussed to be used to measure the accuracy of attribute data based on the sampling inspection, which is a new method during the researching of accuracy of attribute data in GIS. However, the selection of the sampling schemes can decide the reliability of the rate of disfigurement.

According to modern taxonomy, A. sativum and its closest wild relative A. longicuspis form a species complex. The collection {{of a large number}} of accessions of these taxa is the only means available for expansion of the genetic variability with regard to yield, <b>quality,</b> <b>tolerance</b> to biotic and abiotic traits, as well as flowering and possibly fertility restoration. A large number of garlic accessions was recently collected in Central Asia, the main center of garlic diversity. Plants were documented according to IPGRI rules, and thereafter evaluated and maintained in the field collections of vegetatively propagated alliums in Israel. The studied accessions were subdivided into two distinct sub-populations: semi-bolters and bolters. Most of flower-producing accessions produced both fertile pollen and receptive stigmas, and true garlic seeds were obtained from 5 accessions, collected in Kazakhstan in 1996 - 1998. The garlic inflorescence is an umbel-like structure with flower clusters (branches) arising from a common meristem. The flower morphology is typical of the genus Allium. Differentiation of topsets begins in the periphery of the apical surface only after floral differentiation has occurred, and the size, number and rapidity of topset development varies significantly between genotypes. Further studies of flowering physiology and fertility restoration, should focus on bolting genotypes which produce inflorescences with a high ratio of normal flowers to topsets...|$|E

MethodsOver a 16 -month period, 50 venographies were performed on end-stage renal insufficiency patients, using Gd-DOTA as a contrast agent on a high-resolution digital subtraction angiography system. Three sequences were performed on forearm, arm, and chest at 3 mL/sec for a total of 35 mL of Gd-DOTA. Examinations were reviewed by two radiologists for diagnostic and opacification <b>quality.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> was evaluated on the evolution of serum creatinine levels and occurrence of pain during injection. ResultsGood interobserver correlation was obtained in evaluating the feasibility of AVF creation by vein segment (0. 64 < κ < 0. 88) and in relationship to opacification quality (0. 62 to 0. 87). No deterioration in renal function (creatinine level before and after) or pain was observed. Twenty-six patients underwent surgical creation of brachiobasilic (N = 8), brachiocephalic (N = 8), radiocephalic (N = 8), and cubitocephalic (N = 1) fistulas or insertion of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft (N = 1). Seventeen were awaiting AVF or were on peritoneal dialysis. Two died before surgery for reasons unconnected with the venography.

The optical design of the camera together with its performance, {{expressed in terms of}} optical <b>quality,</b> <b>tolerance</b> and stray-light analysis, are fully described. The main scientific camera objective is the tridimensional global mapping of the entire surface of Mercury with a scale factor of 50 m per pixel at periherm. Five different spectral bands are foreseen, a panchromatic and four intermediate bands, in the range between 410 and 930 nm. The Stereo Channel consists of two sub-channels looking at ± 20 ° from nadir direction, which share the detector and most of the optical components. The field of view of each channel is 4. 8 ° × 5. 3 ° with a scale factor of 22 "/pixel. The chosen modified Schmidt configuration guarantees an optimal aberration balancing over all the field of view and all the wavelength range; in addition the technical solution chosen for the filter manufacturing, i. e. single substrate with stripe-butted filters, allows to further optimize chromatic aberration. For stray-light suppression, an efficient baffling system, able to well separate the two optical paths over the common optical elements, has been designed and an appropriate ‘filter masking’ has been foreseen to cope with ghosts and cross talk between adjacent filter stripes. The tolerance analysis shows that manufacturing, alignment and stability tolerances are rather relaxed. Thus concluding, the analysis of the global optical performance of the camera assures that the scientific requirements are optimally fulfilled...|$|E

Two measures of niche-breadth were calculated for 44 riverine macrophyte species, from 20 families commonly occurring in Zambia, using an approach based on PCA ordination with 16 bio-physico-chemical input variables. These included altitude, stream order, stream flow, pH, conductivity and soluble reactive phosphate concentration (SRP). In the absence of additional chemical water quality data for Zambian rivers, invertebrate-based measures of general water quality were also used. These were benthic macroinvertebrate Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), and individual abundance of nine macroinvertebrate families with differing water <b>quality</b> <b>tolerance,</b> indicated by their Sensitivity Weightings within the Zambian Invertebrate Scoring System (ZISS). Macrophyte large-scale latitudinal range was derived from world geopositional records held by online databases, and additional records held by the authors. The two niche-breadth metrics divided the species into narrow-niche and intermediate/broad-niche categories, showing significant variation (from {{one or both of}} correlation and ANOVA test outcomes) in altitude, stream flow, conductivity, SRP, pH and ASPT, but not stream order. Macrophyte alpha-diversity (as a measure of number of individual niches co-existing per habitat) showed no significant relationship with individual species niche-breadth. Narrow-niche species included a higher proportion of Afrotropical endemics than did species with broader niche size. There were significant predictive relationships between macrophyte niche-breadth and latitudinal range of the target species at global and Afrotropical scales, but not for the Neotropics...|$|E
40|$|Monte Carlo sampling-based {{methods are}} {{frequently}} used in stochastic programming when exact solution is not possible. In this dissertation, we develop {{two sets of}} Monte Carlo sampling-based algorithms to solve classes of two-stage stochastic programs. These algorithms follow a sequential framework such that a candidate solution is generated and evaluated at each step. If the solution is of desired quality, then the algorithm stops and outputs the candidate solution along with an approximate (1 - α) confidence interval on its optimality gap. The first set of algorithms proposed, which we {{refer to as the}} fixed-width sequential sampling methods, generate a candidate solution by solving a sampling approximation of the original problem. Using an independent sample, a confidence interval is built on the optimality gap of the candidate solution. The procedures stop when the confidence interval width plus an inflation factor falls below a pre-specified tolerance epsilon. We present two variants. The fully sequential procedures use deterministic, non-decreasing sample size schedules, whereas in another variant, the sample size at the next iteration is determined using current statistical estimates. We establish desired asymptotic properties and present computational results. In another set of sequential algorithms, we combine deterministically valid and sampling-based bounds. These algorithms, labeled sampling-based sequential approximation methods, take advantage of certain characteristics of the models such as convexity to generate candidate solutions and deterministic lower bounds through Jensen's inequality. A point estimate on the optimality gap is calculated by generating an upper bound through sampling. The procedure stops when the point estimate on the optimality gap falls below a fraction of its sample standard deviation. We show asymptotically that this algorithm finds a solution with a desired <b>quality</b> <b>tolerance.</b> We present variance reduction techniques and show their effectiveness through an empirical study...|$|E

We recorded herbivore dung and habitat type on 24 line transects varying between 4 and 11 km with a total length of 190 km to determine habitat selection and landscape distribution of six grazer species, three ruminants and three non-ruminants. Larger ruminant grazers were more evenly distributed than smaller ruminants, had a more diverse use of habitats and used more low quality habitat. In contrast, non-ruminant grazers were more evenly distributed than similar-sized ruminants and body mass did not clearly influence diversity of habitat use and use of low quality habitat. We confirm that body mass influences diversity of habitat use of large herbivores but digestive strategy potentially modifies this relationship. Hence, habitat heterogeneity might facilitate herbivore diversity in savanna ecosystems and high heterogeneity might counterbalance the effects of fragmentation and declining reserve size.

40|$|In this work, a {{characterization}} and optimization of the grating-based {{x-ray imaging}} technique is presented. The investigations are introduced by analytical considerations, are underpinned with numerical simulations and validated using exemplary experiments. A detailed {{examination of the}} image formation in a grating interferometer is given, highlighting the dependence of the measured signal on {{the profile of the}} gratings. Subsequently, it is shown analytically and in experiments that grating-based imaging can be performed using three basic grating arrangements, which differ in their requirements on grating fabrication and experimental implementation. By a characterization of the measurement signal for each arrangement, a dependence of the signal strength on the sample position within the interferometer is identified. The consecutive evaluation of the impact of this position dependence on radiographic and tomographic data leads to the derivation of optimized reconstruction algorithms and to a correction of resulting image artifacts. Additionally, it is shown that the simultaneous measurement of attenuation and phase images allows the determination of the atomic number of the sample, opening new possibilities for material discrimination. Apart from these investigations on the contrast formation, various imperfections of the technique are investigated: The properties of the image noise are examined in a detailed statistical analysis, yielding a fundamental understanding of the signal-to-noise behavior of the three available contrast channels. Additionally, beam-hardening artifacts at polychromatic x-ray sources are investigated and their correction by a linearization approach is resented. By a subsequent analysis of the influence of various different grating imperfections on the image <b>quality,</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits for grating fabrication are specified. Furthermore, analytical considerations show that gratings with a duty cycle of 1 / 3 are advantageous with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to common gratings with a duty cycle of 1 / 2. In conclusion, the results, concepts and methods developed in this work broaden the understanding of grating-based x-ray imaging and constitute a step forward towards the practical implementations of the technique in imaging applications...|$|E
