40|$|A {{parametric}} {{loudspeaker system}} comprises a pre-compensator (305) for generating a pre-compensated envelope signal by applying a pre-compensation to the input audio signal where the pre-compensation compensates for distortion of in-air demodulation of the modulated ultrasound signal. A pre-modulator (307) generates a complex base band signal generating a phase {{signal from the}} pre-compensated envelope signal using a predetermined function for determining a phase signal from an amplitude signal such that the corresponding complex signal has either suppressed negative or positive frequencies. The complex base band signal is then generated to have an amplitude corresponding to the pre-compensated envelope signal and a phase corresponding to the phase signal.; A modulator (309) quadrature modulates the complex base band signal on an ultrasonic <b>quadrature</b> <b>carrier</b> and an output circuit (311) drives the ultrasound transducer (301) from the modulated signal.

However, they have the considerable advantage that they may be easily transmitted as two pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals on <b>quadrature</b> <b>carriers,</b> and can be easily demodulated. The non-square constellations, dealt with below, achieve marginally better bit-error rate (BER) but are harder to modulate and demodulate.|$|R
50|$|By {{representing}} a transmitted symbol {{as a complex}} number and modulating a cosine and sine carrier signal with the real and imaginary parts (respectively), the symbol can be sent with two carriers on the same frequency. They are {{often referred to as}} <b>quadrature</b> <b>carriers.</b> A coherent detector is able to independently demodulate these carriers. This principle of using two independently modulated carriers is the foundation of quadrature modulation. In pure phase modulation, the phase of the modulating symbol is the phase of the carrier itself and this is the best representation of the modulated signal.|$|R
50|$|Carrierless {{amplitude}} {{phase modulation}} (CAP) is {{a variant of}} quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Instead of modulating the amplitude of two carrier waves, CAP generates a QAM signal by combining two PAM signals filtered through two filters designed so that their impulse responses form a Hilbert pair. If the impulse responses of the two filters are chosen as sine and a cosine, the only mathematical difference between QAM and CAP waveforms is that the phase of the carrier is reset {{at the beginning of}} each symbol. If the carrier frequency and symbol rates are similar, the main advantage of CAP over QAM is simpler implementation. The modulation of the baseband signal with the <b>quadrature</b> <b>carriers</b> is not necessary with CAP, because it is part of the transmit pulse.|$|R
40|$|Several {{state-of-the-art}} {{wireless receiver}} architectures are presented including the traditional superheterodyne, the image-reject heterodyne, the direct-conversion, and the very-low intermediate frequency (VLIF). The case studies {{are followed by}} a detailed view of receiver building blocks: lownoise amplifiers (LNA), mixers, and voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO). Two popular topologies currently exist for LNAs: the common-gate configuration, which offers low power consumption with superior stability, robustness and linearity performance, and its common-source counterpart, which provides comparatively higher gain and lower noise figure. Aside from the traditional passive and active Gilbert mixers, the even-harmonic and masking-quadrature mixers are developed to combat second-order non-linearity and improve image-rejection, respectively. For <b>quadrature</b> <b>carrier</b> generation, the degeneration-injected QVCO is superior to the cascode-injected QVCO {{both in terms of}} phase noise and tuning range.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose for the real and two {{independent}} <b>quadrature</b> <b>carrier</b> case, a closed-form approximated expression for the achievable residual Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) {{that depends on the}} step-size parameter, equalizer’s tap length, equalized output gain, input signal statistics, channel power and SNR. This expression is valid for blind adaptive equalizers, where the error that is fed into the adaptive mechanism which updates the equalizer‘s taps can be expressed as a polynomial function of order three of the equalized output and where the gain between the input and equalized output signal is {{less than or equal to}} one, as is in the case of Godard (gain = 1) and WNEW (gain < 1) algorithm. Since the channel power is measurable or can be calculated if the channel coefficients are given, there is no need to carry out simulation with various step-size parameters in order to reach the required residual ISI. In addition, we show two new equalization methods (gain dependent), which have shown to have improved equalization performance compared to Godard and WNEW...|$|E

40|$|An RF system model, {{based on}} MATLAB/SIMULINK, has been {{developed}} for analyzing the basic characteristics of the low level RF (LLRF) control system being designed for the CEBAF 12 GeV Energy Upgrade. In our model, a typical passband cavity representation is simplified to in-phase and quadrature (I&Q) components. Lorentz Force and microphonic detuning are incorporated as a new <b>quadrature</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency (frequency modulation). Beam is also represented as in-phase and quadrature components and superpositioned with the cavity field vector. Signals pass through two low pass filters, where the cutoff frequency is equal to half of the cavity bandwidth, then they are demodulated using the same detuning frequency. Because only baseband I&Q signals are calculated, the simulation process is very fast {{when compared to other}} controller-cavity models. During the design process we successfully analyzed gain requirements vs. field stability for different superconducting cavity microphonic backgrounds and Lorentz Force coefficients.

40|$|An online, {{adaptive}} method of time delay and magnitude estimation for sinusoidal signals is presented. The method {{is based on}} an adaptive gradient descent algorithm that directly determines the time delay and magnitudes of two noisy sinusoidal signals. The new estimator uses a novel <b>quadrature</b> <b>carrier</b> generator to produce the carriers for an adaptive quadrature phase detector, which in turn uses an arc tan function to compute the time delay. The proposed method is quite robust and can adapt to significant variation in input signal characteristics like magnitude and frequency imposing no requirement on the magnitudes of the two signals. It even works effectively when the signals have time-varying magnitudes. The convergence analysis of the proposed technique shows that estimate converges exponentially fast to their nominal values. In addition, if the technique is implemented in the continuous time domain, the delay estimation accuracy will not be constrained by the sampling frequency as observed in some of the classical techniques. Extensive simulations show that the proposed method provides very accurate estimates of the time delay comparable to that of the popular methods like Sinc-based estimator, Lagrange estimator, and the Quadrature estimator, as well the magnitude estimate of the input signals at lower signal to noise ratio at appreciably reduced computational cost.

40|$|Part 2 {{presents}} a new method {{to resolve the}} phase-ambiguity for Offset QPSK modulation systems. When an Offset Quaternary Phase-Shift-Keyed (OQPSK) communications link is utilized, the phase ambiguity of the reference carrier must be resolved. At the transmitter, two different unique words are separately modulated onto the <b>quadrature</b> <b>carriers.</b> At the receiver, the recovered carrier may have one of four possible phases, 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees, referenced to the nominally correct phase. The IF portion of the channel may cause a phase-sense reversal, i. e., a reversal {{in the direction of}} phase rotation for a specified bit pattern. Hence, eight possible phase relationships (the so-called eight ambiguous phase conditions) between input and output of the demodulator must be resolved. Using the In-phase (I) /Quadrature (Q) channel reversal correcting property of an OQPSK Costas loop with integrated symbol synchronization, four ambiguous phase conditions are eliminated. Thus, only four possible ambiguous phase conditions remain. The errors caused by the remaining ambiguous phase conditions can be corrected by monitoring and detecting the polarity of the two unique words. The correction of the unique word polarities results in the complete phase-ambiguity resolution for the OQPSK system...|$|R

50|$|Quadrature {{amplitude}} modulation (QAM) {{is both an}} analog and a digital modulation scheme. It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or {{amplitude modulation}} (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the same frequency, usually sinusoids, are out of phase with each other by 90° and are thus called <b>quadrature</b> <b>carriers</b> or <b>quadrature</b> components — hence {{the name of the}} scheme. The modulated waves are summed, and the final waveform is a combination of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and amplitude-shift keying (ASK), or, in the analog case, of phase modulation (PM) and amplitude modulation. In the digital QAM case, a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used. PSK modulators are often designed using the QAM principle, but are not considered as QAM since the amplitude of the modulated carrier signal is constant. QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems. Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel.|$|R

This paper addresses a technique for achieving carrier synchronization for all four of these PSK schemes in a single modem.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a carrier recovery loop for the coherent demodulation of a digital satellite modem for mobile systems. The loop is data aided, employing decision feedback. The modem transmits a band-limited differentially encoded quaternary phase-shift-keyed (DEQPSK) signal over a satellite link. Several different earth stations {{are assumed to}} have simultaneous access to a given transponder, in an arrangement of frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). Thus the DEQPSK signals that occupy the immediately adjacent frequency bands can introduce adjacent-channel interference (ACI) into the transmitted DEQPSK signal. The high-power amplifier (HPA) at the earth station transmitter introduces AM-AM and AM-PM conversion effects into the DEQPSK signal, but the satellite transponder is linear. A baseband predistorter operates on the baseband signals at the input to the modulator and assumes a prior knowledge of the HPA characteristics. A carrier-recovery loop is used at the receiver to generate the in-phase and <b>quadrature</b> reference <b>carriers</b> employed by the coherent demodulator. The performance {{of the system is}} studied by computer simulation, over a range of different conditions and with different arrangements of the modem, and the results are used to determine the preferred modem design. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A new pilot-aided {{multiuser}} detection scheme, single code {{cyclic shift}} (SCCS) detector, is proposed {{in this paper}} for synchronous CDMA multiuser signal reception. The unique feature of the proposed detector is that a receiver can decode multiuser signals even without explicit knowledge of all signature codes active in the system. The transmitting signal from a base station to a mobile contains two separated channels: the pilot and data channels; the former consists of periodically repeated pilot symbols encoded by the same signature codes as the one spreading the latter. Both pilot and data signals for a specific mobile are sent by a base-station using <b>quadrature</b> and in-phase <b>carriers</b> at the same frequency with QPSK modulation. A matched filter bank, consisting of M correlators that match to distinct cyclic-shifted versions of a "single" signature code, is employed for "channel cyclic shift correlation function" estimation, followed by the multiuser detection algorithm based on the channel information obtained earlier. The performance of the proposed SCCS detector is evaluated and compared to decorrelating detector by computer simulations considering various multipath channels with different profiles. The results demonstrate that a synchronous CDMA joint detection can be implemented successfully without necessarily knowing all signature codes of the system...|$|R
