40|$|Background: The Nordic {{countries}} are generally {{seen as the}} leaders in CSR accounting. However, one cannot assume that all the Nordic countries disclose information in the same way. At the same time, {{few studies have been}} made that concerns employee disclosures separated from other CSR aspects. Purpose: To analyze and discuss the similarities between the Nordic countries regarding employee disclosures and how this has developed since 2009. Delimitations: The thesis only includes information available in the companies’ annual reports and on their websites. Furthermore, only the GRI information that the companies claim to include in their report is taken into consideration when analyzing GRI disclosures. Method: The study is based on secondary analysis of qualitative data, where the annual and sustainability reports of three largest companies in each Nordic country according to number of employees are examined. The process of content analysis is conducted in two steps. The scoring manual, General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> and the GRI scoring table are created in order to precede the research. Empirical findings: This chapter includes the tables that show the results from the gathered data with explanations to the content of each table. The tables presented in this chapter are the General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> from 2009 and 2014, the GRI scoring table for each country and the indicators included table for each country. Analysis: In this chapter, the empirical findings in both, the General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> and the GRI scoring table are being analyzed with help of the frame of reference in order to investigate how the results connects with previous research and models. Finally, the connections between both of the tables are also interpreted. Conclusions: The thesis shows that most similar way of disclosing the employee disclosures is by using the GRI guidelines. The development from 2009 indicates that the usage of the GRI guidelines has grown while the percentage of the sustainability reports regarding the employee perspective have decreased in all of the Nordic countries except Denmark...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Type 2 {{diabetes}} disproportionately affects Latino populations. Interventions {{in which}} community health workers (CHWs) or promotoras {{are a part}} have demonstrated some success among Hispanic populations with cardiovascular disease and hypertension. However, to date there are no reviews that describe the clinical or behavioral outcomes of diabetes self-management interventions supported by promotoras. ^ RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the behavioral and clinical effects of interventions supported by promotoras to treat type 2 diabetes in Latino adults (3 ̆e 18 years old) ?^ METHODS: A search of electronic databases—Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, CINAHL—was conducted using specified search terms. Reference lists of articles were hand searched to identify any additional articles. Data were extracted from articles by one reviewer using the ADA Evidence Abstract Worksheet (see Appendix A). This form was used to identify the study purpose, study type, setting, population, and outcomes, and to describe the main features of the intervention. Each study was assessed using the ADA Quality Criteria Checklist: Primary Research (see Appendix B). Each study was assessed on four measures of relevance and ten measures of validity and received a grade of positive, negative, or neutral. Results were compiled in an <b>overview</b> <b>table,</b> patterned after the ADA <b>Overview</b> <b>Table</b> Template (see Appendix C). ^ RESULTS: Six of the eight studies found statistically significant reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) in interventions supported by or led by promotoras. Four of the five studies investigating diabetes knowledge, found statistically significant improvements in diabetes knowledge. ^ DISCUSSION: The results of this systematic review suggest several positive diabetes outcomes from promotoras-led or supported interventions. Furthermore, the results suggest the effectiveness and appeal of CHW supported interventions to improve HbA 1 c and diabetes knowledge among Hispanic, female populations. Further {{research is needed to}} investigate the link between interventions involving promotoras and improvement in behavioral and clinical outcomes of Latino populations with type 2 diabetes. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{widespread}} adoption of BPM, there exist many business processes not adequately supported by existing BPM technol-ogy. In previous work we {{reported on the}} properties of these processes. As a major insight we learned that, in accordance to the data model com-prising object types and object relations, the modeling and execution of processes can be based on two levels of granularity: object behavior and object interactions. This paper focuses on micro processes capturing object behavior and constituting a fundamental pillar of our framework for object-aware process management. Our approach applies the well es-tablished concept of modeling object behavior in terms of states and state transitions. Opposed to existing work, we establish a mapping be-tween attribute values and objects states to ensure compliance between them. Finally, we provide a well-defined operational semantics enabling the automatic and dynamic generation of most end-user components at run-time (e. g., <b>overview</b> <b>tables</b> and user forms) ...|$|R

The problems to be solved arise in the current information technology devices, more specifically in data back-up, usuitable hardware and lan connection as well as missing software. Finally, the paper discusses the idea of puchasing devices to be used outside the GML. The multimedia laboratory is concerned with issues relating to graphics creation and video adjustment. The solution put forward in this paper proposes using specific hardware designed for editing and graphics applications. While an effort is made to seek a multiple solution, the proposed adjustments require purchasing new hardware and software which are innovative if rather costly.

40|$|A {{sampling}} of otoliths in the Lower Aptian sediments of the Maestrazgo provided otoliths of 18 teleost taxa of which 11 {{could be described}} as new species: Elops bultyncki, «genus Elopidarum» casanovae. «genus Albulidarum» atavus, Pterothrissus todolellanus, «genus Euteleosteorum» geometricus, «genus Protacanthopterygiorum» scalpellum, «genus Argentinidarum» bergantinus, «genus Aulopiformorum» pseudocentrolophus, «genus Synodontoideorum» pseudosphyraena, «genus Chlorophthalmidarum» manei, «genus Neoscopelidarum» maestrazgonis and «genus? Acanthomorphorum» forcallensis. This is the oldest fauna for which comparative studies of Recent and fossil otoliths still provide results which are worthy of interest. The more one goes back in time, the more morphological resemblance with Recent otoliths becomes obscure. For Aptian material, only identifications at family level or at an even higher taxonomic level are possible, except for some rare cases such as the genera Elops and Pterothrissus, which can be considered as «living fossils». For this reason, the interest of palaeoecological interpretations based on comparisons with the habitat of Recent fishes becomes very restricted if applied to Aptian faunas. The possible palaeoecological interest of analogous morphologies which are probably conditioned by function are mentioned. Finally an <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> is presented, summarising the fossil record of all Lower Cretaceous teleost families, based on data obtained from both otoliths and osteological material...|$|R

Knowledge of these processes {{is the key to}} understanding the functioning of the whole forest ecosystem which can be modelled and predicted based on the physiological process information.

The available exposure techniques and approaches are described. An <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> with all relevant literature data over the period 1989 - 93 summarizes the percent changes in biomass, root/shoot ratio, photosynthesis, leaf area and water use efficiency under elevated CO 2.

The stimulation or reduction found in the respiratory processes of woody plants are reviewed, as well as the effect of elevated CO 2 on stomatal density, conductance and water use efficiency. Changes in plant quality and their consequences are examined. Changes in underground processes under elevated CO 2 are especially emphasized and related to the functioning of the ecosystem.
