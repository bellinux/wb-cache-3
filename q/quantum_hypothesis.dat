40|$|ABSTRACT Discrete {{potential}} waves can {{be recorded}} from {{cells in the}} eye of Limulus both in darkness and in dim illumination. With constant illumination the frequency of these waves is linearly related to light intensity and the distribution of intervals between waves follows an exponential function. The latency of waves evoked by short flashes of light is usually long and variable and the number of waves evoked by a flash varies randomly, obeying approximately a Poisson distribution. The resuks of experiments with flashes of light have been compared with the predictions derived from the hypotheses that one, two, or three quanta of light are required for production of one wave. The agreement of the data with the theory can be considered acceptable for the "one quantum" hypothesis, is less satisfactory for the "two <b>quanta</b> " <b>hypothesis,</b> and is very poor for the "three <b>quanta</b> " <b>hypothesis.</b> Activity of visual cells of Limulus has been studied for a long time by recording impulse discharges from the axons of eccentric cells.

50|$|Some {{view the}} birth of quantum {{chemistry}} as starting {{with the discovery of}} the Schrödinger equation and its application to the hydrogen atom in 1926. However, the 1927 article of Walter Heitler and Fritz London is often recognized as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This is the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond. In the following years much progress was accomplished by Edward Teller, Robert S. Mulliken, Max Born, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Linus Pauling, Erich Hückel, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Aleksandrovich Fock, to cite a few. The history of quantum chemistry also goes through the 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday, the 1859 statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete, and the 1900 <b>quantum</b> <b>hypothesis</b> by Max Planck that any energy radiating atomic system can theoretically be divided into a number of discrete energy elements ε such that each of these energy elements is proportional to the frequency ν with which they each individually radiate energy and a numerical value called Planck’s Constant. Then, in 1905, to explain the photoelectric effect (1839), i.e., that shining light on certain materials can function to eject electrons from the material, Albert Einstein postulated, based on Planck’s <b>quantum</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> that light itself consists of individual quantum particles, which later came to be called photons (1926). In the years to follow, this theoretical basis slowly began to be applied to chemical structure, reactivity, and bonding.

The geometry of relativistic spacetime is explained in detail.
