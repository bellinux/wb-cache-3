For the regional leagues played during the Second World War, Albion were forced to switch to all-blue shirts, as rationing meant that striped material was considered a luxury.|$|E

5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter <b>quarters</b> <b>in</b> April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, a move that threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E

Himmler instructed that the German nation should view all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their German blood.

5|$|Goodrich {{remained}} the favourite home of Richard Talbot's descendants for many years. During the early years, {{the security situation}} in Wales remained of concern.

Gilbert Talbot was responsible for fighting back the Welsh advance and securing the castle. As time went on, however, the threat began to diminish. During the 15th century the Talbots considerably expanded {{the size of the}} lord's <b>quarters</b> <b>in</b> the castle and provided additional accommodation for servants and retainers.|$|E

The company had lost $58 million in 1998 and was predicted to lose over $90 million in 1999.

5|$|In the 1890s John Rollins deconstructed {{several of}} the slave cabins to build a boat house and dock.
