With {{the assistance of a}} <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint,</b> an ordinary EOD robot becomes a multipurpose robot with an end effector which can be switched during the task. This exchangeable end effector permits the robot to perform more complex duties. Making the joint completely mechanical increases its capacity and decreases its complexity of control and risk of failure. In this paper, the design, manufacturing, and testing stages are explained for four <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joints</b> each possessing different physical working principles. The test results reveal the best design for a multipurpose EOD robot and give ideas for other uses of <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joints.</b> Employing the <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joints</b> in other mobile robot applications can increase a robot's capacity and efficiency.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2006 Includes bibliographical References (leaves: 47) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxi, 50 leavesThe EOD robot is {{a mobile}} robot used in replace {{of a human}} in {{explosive}} ordnance disposal operations of searching, detecting and handling of explosive materials. Nowadays the EOD robot. s tool capabilities and overall performances are at lower levels because they are only able to use one kind of tool (gripper) for the whole bomb disposing process. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a completely mechanical <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint</b> which will be used in the EOD robot to automatically change the tools. By changing the grippers automatically, the robot firstly does not require to be called back for tool change and secondly can achieve different operations on the explosive material. In the locking mechanism of <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint,</b> hydraulic and pneumatic systems are not preferred because of their weight and volume on a mobile robot. Electromagnetic locking systems are also not considered because of possible electromagnetic interaction between the arm and explosive ordnance. The reason of designing a completely mechanical joint is to eliminate the use of another actuator for controlling the locking mechanism. An EOD robot with a <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint</b> will be able to use different tools and accomplish complex tasks by using these different tools. Usage of this <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint</b> in different robotic applications such as tool holding in CNC machines, lifting and pulling applications will also make an increment in the robot. s processing capacity and efficiency. This project consists of designing a completely mechanical <b>quick</b> changeable <b>joint.</b> In order to understand the best design, four different joints are designed, the critical parts are analyzed for strength and prototypes of the joints are manufactured. To test the life cycles of the joints a pneumatic test machine is designed and manufactured. After the tests, the joints are evaluated for design parameters are the best design for different purposes are determined...|$|R

A person who {{has gone through a}} major upper extremity amputation has lost fine, coordinated movements of the hand, tactile sensation, and proprioceptive feedback. While a prosthesis offers some return to a person's previous level of independence or function, training is necessary for a user to develop proficiency. Previous research has shown potential benefit to prosthesis users imitating a limb similar to their own. These users are able to engage in normal planning mechanisms with limb matching observation training, but engage in atypical planning when imitating an intact person. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate motor behavior differences with intact subjects fitted with a Fictive Amputee Model System (FAMS) device, which simulates a trans radial body powered prosthesis. Subjects are placed in one of two different protocols to investigate differences between interventions: limb matched or limb mismatched action observation training. We hypothesize that if limb matching elicits the typical motor planning and limb mismatching creates atypical motor planning, then users in the limb matching group will have decreased time in performing a task, <b>quicker</b> <b>joint</b> coordination adaptation, and greater task performance accuracy. Seventeen right-handed, healthy, intact adults were tested for changes in motor behavior over a five day period. Data collections were conducted on day one and day five of the study, while training sessions occurred on days two through four. Each data collection session utilized an electronic stylus pen to measure task performance and electrogoniometers measuring joint kinematics of the wrist, forearm, elbow, and shoulder. Analysis of time duration between groups showed that subjects in the matched limb group performed the task slower than the mismatched limb group. The groups also displayed differences in joint coordination. There are no significant differences observed in task performance accuracy, yet there are observable differences in patterns of error across groups. The results from this study propose that matched limb observation training may be beneficial in promoting faster kinematic patterns in users of prostheses, thus <b>quicker</b> <b>joint</b> coordination adaptation. This may be reflected in greater care in performing motor tasks, as matched limb training prompted slower movement. Further studies will investigate metrics on task performance to show if there were benefits in matched limb observation training. The results from the study provide insight into how limb matched action observation based training may be beneficial to upper extremity prosthesis users. Mentor: Lewis Wheato...|$|R

5000|$|The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke {{states that}} {{physical}} therapy can improve motor control and overall body strength in individuals with hypotonia. This {{is crucial to}} maintaining both static and dynamic postural stability, which is important since postural instability is a common problem in people with hypotonia. [...] A physiotherapist can develop patient specific training programs to optimize postural control, {{in order to increase}} balance and safety. [...] To protect against postural asymmetries the use of supportive and protective devices may be necessary. [...] Physical therapists might use neuromuscular/sensory stimulation techniques such as <b>quick</b> stretch, resistance, <b>joint</b> approximation, and tapping to increase tone by facilitating or enhancing muscle contraction in patients with hypotonia. [...] For patients who demonstrate muscle weakness in addition to hypotonia strengthening exercises that do not overload the muscles are indicated. [...] Electrical Muscle Stimulation, also known as Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) {{can also be used to}} “activate hypotonic muscles, improve strength, and generate movement in paralyzed limbs while preventing disuse atrophy (p.498).” [...] When using NMES it is important to have the patient focus on attempting to contract the muscle(s) being stimulated. Without such concentration on movement attempts, carryover to volitional movement is not feasible. [...] NMES should ideally be combined with functional training activities to improve outcomes.|$|R
