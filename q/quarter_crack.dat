5|$|Mucho Macho Man overcame several {{health issues}} in 2011 and 2013. He had surgery {{to address a}} {{breathing}} problem in 2011, and suffered from a respiratory virus and hoof problems, including a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack,</b> in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Mucho Macho Man {{began his}} 2013 season by running {{again in the}} Sunshine Millions Classic, but the track was sloppy, and on this {{occasion}} he was pulled up in the homestretch and placed last in the race. [...] As the horse was not visibly lame, jockey Smith told Ritvo, [...] "It's gotta be something inside." [...] Though speculation was that he simply {{did not like the}} wet track, shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with a respiratory virus. He also developed a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> in his hoof and {{spent the rest of the}} spring recuperating at Fair Hill Training Center in Maryland.|$|E
50|$|Trained by Jimmy Jerkens, Quality Road raced in Florida {{in early}} 2009, where his wins in the Fountain of Youth Stakes and Grade 1 Florida Derby {{made him a}} {{favorite}} for the Kentucky Derby. However, he suffered two injuries. The first was a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> on his right hind foot the day he won the Florida Derby. In April, he suffered a second <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> on his right front foot. As a result, he missed all three legs of the U.S. Triple Crown series.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterwards, <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> were {{discovered}} in both of Big Brown's front feet, sidelining the colt for several months.|$|R
5000|$|Rapid {{thrust of}} the rear limbs causes the feet to stab into the ground, leading to bruises and <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{outside of}} the hocks, fetlocks, & hooves receive {{excessive}} stress & pressure. This leads to DJD, ligament strain, hoof bruising, & <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|R

50|$|I Want Revenge was {{scratched}} on {{the morning}} of the race because of lameness issues in the colt's left front ankle. In addition, Quality Road, who had been an early favorite, was withdrawn from the race on April 27 because of a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> in his right front hoof.|$|E
50|$|After his two-year-old {{season and}} spring, {{he was placed}} {{at the top of}} the Experimental Free Handicap with 126 pounds. Buckpasser {{developed}} a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> that kept him out of the 1966 Kentucky Derby, as well as the Preakness and Belmont Stakes. It took almost three months for the crack to heal.|$|E
5000|$|The {{twisting}} {{motion of}} the hocks causes a screwing motion on the hoof as it hits the ground, leading to bruises, corns, <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks,</b> and ringbone.|$|R
50|$|Hoof cracks are separations or {{breaks in}} {{the wall of a}} hoof. The most common type of hoof <b>cracks</b> are <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks,</b> which occur at the quarter, the {{thinnest}} and most delicate part of the hoof wall. Injury to the site {{may be the result of}} common things such as hard racetracks and uneven surfaces. <b>Quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> originate from the coronet and run down the hoof wall, rather than a sand crack that begins at the ground surface and runs up the hoof wall. Hoof cracks force 2% of racehorses to retire.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{integrity}} {{for expansion}} and flexion of hoof, {{making it more}} brittle and prone to sand & <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks.</b> Narrow white line {{makes it hard to}} hold shoes on.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, {{the colt}} was shipped to Aqueduct {{to prepare for}} the Remsen Stakes. He entered the Sir Gaylord Purse, ridden by Manuel Ycaza, and won by eight lengths. However, the <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a bar shoe on his left front hoof to {{stabilize}} the foot. On November 27, he won the Remsen by two lengths in wire-to-wire fashion.|$|E
5000|$|On the Friday {{following}} the Preakness, a three-inch <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> was discovered on the horse's left front hoof, the same injury that he experienced {{in both of}} his front hooves the previous fall. With Dutrow referring to the injury as [...] "just a little hiccup" [...] and with the crack stitched together with steel wire, Big Brown resumed jogging at Belmont the following Tuesday.|$|E
50|$|Going {{into the}} 1964 racing season, Hurry to Market was rated at 125 {{pounds on the}} Experimental Free Handicap, ahead of Northern Dancer who was {{assigned}} 123 pounds. With Raise a Native retired due to injury, Hurry to Market was the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby. However, in January 1964 the colt sustained a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> in his right hind hoof that would end his racing career.|$|E
5000|$|More {{weight is}} carried on medial part of hoof, so {{it is more likely}} to cause bruising, <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks,</b> and corns. The lower legs twist beneath the hocks, causing interfering.|$|R
5000|$|Rear leg {{moves with}} greater swing before the hoof {{contacts}} the ground, which wastes energy, reduces stride efficiency, and increases osculation and vibrations felt in joints, tendons, ligaments, and hoof. May cause <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> and arthritis.|$|R
25|$|<b>Quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> are {{vertical}} splits in a hoof wall, {{most commonly}} {{seen on the}} inside of the front hooves or the outside of the hind hooves. They can result from poor shoeing and management practices, natural hoof conformation, or injuries to the leg and hoof.|$|R
50|$|Mark-Ye-Well {{was sent}} to race in California in 1953, where he won the Santa Anita Maturity, the San Fernando Stakes, and the state's richest and most {{important}} race, the Santa Anita Handicap. His win in the Santa Anita Handicap was the first for Calumet Farm after three previous tries. He then {{was sent to}} compete in the Eastern United States but developed a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> that hampered his performance.|$|E
50|$|Scheduled {{to go to}} Hong Kong's Sha Tin Racecourse {{to run in the}} Hong Kong Mile, Val Royal {{developed}} a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> that saw him sidelined him until March 2, 2002, when he returned to Santa Anita and finished fourth in the Frank E. Kilroe Mile Handicap. Sent to Nad Al Sheba Racecourse in Dubai for the 2002 Dubai Duty Free Stakes, he finished fifth in a sixteen-horse field in his final race.|$|E
5000|$|In late April, Girvin's {{training}} for the Kentucky Derby was disrupted when he developed a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> on his right front hoof. Rather than jogging on the racetrack, Sharp maintained the horse's fitness by using a hyperbaric chamber and equine swimming facilities and remained hopeful that the colt {{would be able to}} run. [...] "As long as he's able to breeze and come out of it well, he'll run in the Derby." [...] Girvin entered the race and on a sloppy track, finished 13th.|$|E
50|$|From $120 {{million in}} sales in 1961, the company {{embarked}} on 24 consecutive years of record revenues including benchmark years in 1971 (first billion-dollar year), 1976 (first two-billion dollar year), 1978 (first three-billion dollar year) and 1979 (first billion-dollar <b>quarter).</b> <b>Cracking</b> Fortune magazine's list of the Top 50 merchandising firms in the United States at number 49 in 1965, the company moved up to 45th place in just one year...and leaped to 18th in 1975. By 1985, total annual revenues exceeded $12.7 billion.|$|R
5000|$|Gilchrist, his trainer, {{had thought}} that his horse's recent poor {{performances}} - winning only one of three starts this year - might {{have been due to}} <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks.</b> [...] "It turns out he's been running with this thing inside him this year," [...] he said. [...] "It shows you what kind of warrior this horse is." [...] He also said that owner Harry Aleo was extremely concerned about his star. [...] "We will do anything we can for the horse. It's almost a Barbaro-type situation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Halwes {{began the}} 1966/67 {{season with a}} series of wins in his native Tasmania and on 31 December 1966 he won the Tasmanian Pacing Championship from a 48 yard {{handicap}} over Victorian horse Future Intangible. Returning to Victoria he was first past the post in the New Year FFA at the Melbourne Showgrounds but lost the race on protest to Robin Dundee. [...] An injury then prevented him from starting in the A G Hunter Cup. A trip to Perth for the Inter Dominion followed where he was second to Binshaw on the first two nights of the carnival, both times as favourite and both times from a 24 yard handicap. Halwes then suffered <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> in a hoof which prevented him from racing again in the series.|$|R
5000|$|White line {{disease is}} most often seen in moist, humid areas with large annual {{rainfall}} totals. The exact organism that causes white line disease is not known, but it {{is known to be}} caused by bacteria in the soil getting into a weakened spot in the hoof wall, such as a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack,</b> which then sets up a fungal infection that leads to the disease. [...] Hoof infections are often attributed to poor management, but with white line disease this is often not the case, as it is seen even in horses kept in very clean stables and facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Market Wise raced at {{age five}} in 1943. On {{the way to}} being voted American Co-Champion Older Male Horse, he won the Massachusetts Handicap and the Narragansett Special. In the Massachusetts Handicap in July, Market Wise carried top weight of 126 pounds and won with an [...] "amazing last-minute burst" [...] in a stakes record of 1:52.6 despite {{sustaining}} a [...] "spread foot". Two months later in the Narragansett Special, he produced a powerful late run to catch Air Master in the closing stages, with Thumbs Up third and Shut Out fourth. He returned to the winners' circle limping badly after sustaining a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On October 12, the Dancer faced a {{field of}} 14 rivals in the Coronation Futurity, the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by [...] lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on the Dancer, as Luro feared he could not {{maintain}} sufficient control of the headstrong colt. On November 7, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the 7 furlong Carleton Stakes at Greenwood on a muddy track, but {{came back to the}} barn bleeding from the beginning of a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack.</b> It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule - seven races in three months.|$|E
5000|$|After Ghostzapper's {{victory in}} the 2003 Vosburgh, he took time off to recover from <b>quarter</b> <b>cracks</b> and a bruised hoof. [...] His first 2004 start came on July 4 at Belmont Park in the Tom Fool Handicap. This time, he stayed close behind the early leaders and then moved to the lead on the far turn, drawing off to win by [...] lengths. He won the 7-furlong race in 1:20.42, just ths of a second off the track record. [...] "Bobby wanted {{to give him a}} rest and have him start fresh," [...] said regular jockey Javier Castellano. [...] "Bobby didn't want me to kill the horse after the layoff. I had to keep him with the pace, but not go too early and overuse him. He ran a big race today." [...] Ghostzapper earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 120.|$|R
60|$|The {{garrison}} of {{the bank}} saw many Europeans, hurrying, too late, to reach that shelter, murdered before their eyes. In the Levantine <b>quarter,</b> the <b>cracking</b> of pistols and the shouts of men showed {{that the work of}} massacre was proceeding there. Soon every door of the houses in the great square was forced in, and ere long great numbers of men, loaded with spoil of all kinds, staggered out.|$|R
50|$|This species {{displays}} diurnal, thermophilic activity. As {{with most}} Pentatomidae, it produces only one generation per year. It likes to overwinter on walls covered with ivy. In its search for suitable winter <b>quarters</b> (splits and <b>cracks)</b> it often unwittingly {{finds its way}} into houses.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, Gentry became trainer to John W. Galbreath's Darby Dan Farm. The move {{forced him}} to give up {{training}} a promising two-year-old named Kauai King {{who went on to}} win the following year's Derby. In 1966, Gentry trained Darby Dan Farm's Graustark, winner of the 1965 Arch Ward Memorial Stakes at Arlington Park and the 1966 Bahamas Stakes at Hialeah Park. After Buckpasser suffered a <b>quarter</b> <b>crack,</b> Graustark became widely favored to win the Kentucky Derby that year. Because Graustark had never raced over 7 furlongs, it was decided, in spite of a slightly infected left front hoof, to run him in the 9 furlong Blue Grass Stakes as a prep for the 1966 Kentucky Derby. Graustark was beaten by a nose by Abe's Hope after suffering a career-ending injury.|$|E
5000|$|For the Belmont Stakes, Big Brown wore {{a second}} set of {{stainless}} steel sutures on the inside of his hoof. Hoof specialist Ian McKinlay changed the sutures a week before the race and attached an acrylic and fiberglass adhesive patch to the hoof. Although Big Brown missed three days of training prior to the race, his gait and attitude seemed unaffected. After the crack was patched, Brown was exercised by rider Michelle Nevin. Ian McKinlay said, prior to the Belmont, that Big Brown [...] "does not need a patch on the <b>quarter</b> <b>crack</b> on his left front hoof until the morning of the Belmont Stakes. So Dutrow will give Big Brown his final hard workout Tuesday to breeze five furlongs without it and gallop him into the race confident the colt's tender hoof is healed." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the Remsen stakes, Luro gave Northern Dancer {{some time}} off to heal and had a {{vulcanized}} rubber patch applied to the <b>quarter</b> <b>crack.</b> Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January. His first race at three was in a six-furlong prep under a new jockey, Bobby Ussery, who was instructed {{to take it easy}} and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell {{to the back of the}} pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses and get bumped again, eventually finishing third. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider. [...] "I believe in being very patient with my horses," [...] said Luro. [...] "I don't want punishment—under no circumstances." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{multizone}} symmetric-Galerkin boundary element {{algorithm is}} applied to the analysis of fracture in a layered functionally graded material (FGM). The algorithm features automated crack growth based on the propagation theory of maximum circumferential stress, and a modified <b>quarter</b> point <b>crack</b> tip element. This element has been shown to greatly improve the accuracy of stress intensity factors, and excellent results are obtained using the simple crack opening displacement method. The fracture propagation in a three-point bending Ti/TiB specimen is modeled numerically and the results compared to experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{intensity}} factor equations are presented for an embedded elliptical crack, a semielliptical surface <b>crack,</b> a <b>quarter</b> elliptical corner <b>crack,</b> a semielliptical surface crack along the bore of a circular hole, and a <b>quarter</b> elliptical corner <b>crack</b> {{at the edge}} of a circular hole in finite plates. The plates were subjected to either remote tension or bending loads. The stress {{intensity factor}}s used to develop these equations were obtained from previous three dimensional finite element analyses of these crack configurations. The equations give stress intensity factors as a function of parametric angle, crack depth, crack length, plate thickness, and, where applicable, hole radius. The ratio of crack depth to plate thickness ranged from 0 to 1, the ratio of crack depth to crack length ranged from 0. 2 to 2, and the ratio of hole radius to plate thickness ranged from 0. 5 to 2. The effects of plate width on stress intensity variation along the crack front were also included...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of ageing structures has {{focused attention on}} the problem of multiple-site damage (MSD) and wide spread fatigue damage (WFD). In isolation each flaw or crack may be safe. However, the cumulative eect of multiple, interacting cracks may significantly degrade the damage tolerance of the structure. This paper presents an overview of a new finite element alternating technique algorithm suitable for calculating mode I stress-intensity factors for an arbitrary number of coplanar interacting three dimensional cracks. This new algorithm has been evaluated for a variety of crack aspect ratios and crack separation ratios for fully embedded elliptical cracks, semi-elliptical surface flaws and for <b>quarter</b> elliptical <b>cracks.</b> In each instance, test cases have been studied for both finite and infinite geometries. Results of three of these cases are presented in this paper. These results indicate a...|$|R
