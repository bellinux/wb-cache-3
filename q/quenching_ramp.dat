40|$|Closed quantum many-body systems out of {{equilibrium}} pose several long-standing {{problems in}} physics. Recent {{years have seen}} a tremendous progress in approaching these questions, not least due to experiments with cold atoms and trapped ions in instances of quantum simulations. This article provides an overview on the progress in understanding dynamical equilibration and thermalisation of closed quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium due to <b>quenches,</b> <b>ramps</b> and periodic driving. It also addresses topics such as the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localisation, universality near phase transitions, and prospects for quantum simulations.

40|$|How do closed quantum many-body systems {{driven out}} of {{equilibrium}} eventually achieve equilibration? And how do these systems thermalize, given that they comprise so many degrees of freedom? Progress in answering these—and related— questions has accelerated in recent years—a trend that can be partially attributed to success with experiments performing quantum simulations using ultracold atoms and trapped ions. Here we {{provide an overview of}} this progress, specifically in studies probing dynamical equilibration and thermalization of systems {{driven out of}} equilibrium by <b>quenches,</b> <b>ramps</b> and periodic driving. In doing so, we also address topics such as the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, typicality, transport, many-body localization and universality near phase transitions, as well as future prospects for quantum simulation.

40|$|Using a Luttinger liquid theory we {{investigate}} the time {{evolution of the}} particle density of a one-dimensional fermionic system with open boundaries and subject to a finite duration quench of the inter-particle interaction. We provide analytical and asymptotic solutions to the unitary time evolution of the system, showing that both switching on and switching off the <b>quench</b> <b>ramp</b> create light-cone perturbations in the density. The post-quench dynamics is strongly affected by the interference between these two perturbations. In particular, {{we find that the}} discrepancy between the time-dependent density and the one obtained by a generalized Gibbs ensemble picture vanishes with an oscillatory behavior {{as a function of the}} quench duration, with local minima corresponding to a perfect overlap of the two light-cone perturbations. For adiabatic quenches, we also obtain a similar behavior in the approach of the generalized Gibbs ensemble density towards the one associated with the ground state of the final Hamiltonian.

40|$|Using the {{time-dependent}} density matrix renormalization group {{method and}} exact diagonalization, we study the non-equilibrium {{dynamics of the}} one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model following a quantum <b>quench</b> or a <b>ramp</b> of the onsite interaction strength. For quenches from the non-interacting to the attractive regime, we investigate the dynamical emergence of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) correlations, which at finite spin polarizations are the dominant two-body correlations in the ground state, and their signatures in the pair quasi-momentum distribution function. We observe that the post-quench double occupancy exhibits a maximum as the interaction strength becomes {{of the order of}} the bandwidth. Finally, we study <b>quenches</b> and <b>ramps</b> from attractive to repulsive interactions, which imprint FFLO correlations onto repulsively bound pairs. We show that a quite short ramp time is sufficient to wipe out the characteristic FFLO features in the post-quench pair momentum distribution functions.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} a dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) that characterises dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) occurring in the subsequent temporal evolution of "two dimensional" closed quantum systems, following a <b>quench</b> (or <b>ramping)</b> of a parameter of the Hamiltonian, {which generalizes the notion of DTOP introduced in Budich and Heyl, Phys. Rev. B 93, 085416 (2016) for one-dimensional situations}. This DTOP is obtained from the "gauge-invariant" Pancharatnam phase extracted from the Loschmidt overlap, i. e., the modulus of the overlap between the initially prepared state and its time evolved counterpart reached following a temporal evolution generated by the time-independent final Hamiltonian. This generic proposal is illustrated considering DQPTs occurring in the subsequent temporal evolution following a sudden quench of the staggered mass of the topological Haldane model on a hexagonal lattice where it stays fixed to zero or unity and makes a discontinuous jump between these two values at critical times at which DQPTs occur.

In this paper we discuss recently implemented features that allow quench simulation of fast-ramping superconducting magnets. As the reliability of quench detection during the ramps depends on the signal to noise ratio, we simulate the influence of detection thresholds and the propagation of undetected <b>quenches</b> during the <b>ramps.</b> We also study the effect of an increased copper content and the feasibility of a self-protected magnet surviving a powering cycle with an undetected quench and without quench heater firing or energy-extraction system...|$|R
40|$|The {{real-time}} {{dynamics of}} the Fermi-Hubbard model, driven out of equilibrium by <b>quenching</b> or <b>ramping</b> the interaction parameter, is studied {{within the framework of}} the nonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. A dynamical impurity approximation with a single auxiliary bath site is considered as a reference system, and the time-dependent hybridization is optimized as prescribed by the variational principle. The dynamical two-site approximation turns out to be useful to study the real-time dynamics on short and intermediate time scales. Depending on the strength of the interaction in the final state, two qualitatively different response regimes are observed. For both weak and strong couplings, qualitative agreement with previous results of nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory is found. The two regimes are sharply separated by a critical point at which the low-energy bath degree of freedom decouples in the course of time. We trace the dependence of the critical interaction of the dynamical Mott transition on the duration of the interaction <b>ramp</b> from sudden <b>quenches</b> to adiabatic dynamics and therewith link the dynamical to the equilibrium Mott transition...|$|R

This paper shows how the index could vary when describing systems of topological nature out of equilibrium and identifies how the time scales of variation of the index {{are related to the}} energy injected in the system for quantum <b>quenches</b> and adiabatic <b>ramps.</b> The provided description of the index in and out of equilibrium is model independent...|$|R

40|$|Ramp rate {{sensitivity}} in superconducting dipole magnets {{has been}} shown to vary in an unpredictable fashion between magnets constructed using similar fabrication techniques. Test results from a series of model magnets are presented, one of which was constructed using ebanolcoated strands. The ramp rate sensitivity and ac loss observed is described. I. INTRODUCTION In order to determine the training, ramp rate and magnetic field performance of prototype dipoles intended for the SSC, a comprehensive program of cold magnet testing was performed at Fermi and Brookhaven National Laboratories [1]. The results showed two distinct families of quench current versus current ramp rate, as shown in figure 1. The first family (known as type "A") showed an initial nearly flat quench current up to about 20 A/s, then an almost linear decrease of <b>quench</b> current with <b>ramp</b> rate. The linear portion of the curve, however, varies significantly amongst members of this family. 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Small angle light {{scattering}} (SALS) and time resolved microscopy {{have been performed}} to study the phase separation kinetics in binary polymer mixtures (PEMS/PDMS) and phase separating reaction mixtures (epoxy/polysulfone) during continuous <b>quenches</b> (temperature <b>ramp)</b> and isothermal reaction. For a critical PEMS/PDMS mixture {{it was found that}} the time evolution of the {{light scattering}} curves (characteristic scattering vector: qm and maximum scattering intensity: Im) in a continuos quenching experiment can be scaled by the cooling rate. The similarity to the scaling behavior well known from isothermal demixing experiments after fast quenches and (scaling by the quench depth) is shown. For an off critical PEMS/PDMS mixture nucleation and growth was observed during continuous quenching and after fast quenches. The droplet growth during the continuous quenching could be described by the time dependent supersaturation. A secondary phase separation - well known for reaction-induced decomposition - was found also for continuos quenching and could be explained without the assumption of gelation or vitrification. The similarity between continuous quenching experiments of binary mixtures and the reaction-induced phase separation in reacting mixtures is discussed. In the latter systems the driving force for demixing is the continuous increase of the degree of polymerization N with reaction time instead of the interaction parameter x(T,p) in the case of polymer blends. In the SALS experiments this similarity is expressed in the similar time evolution of the structure factor for x and N induced decomposition. Due to the gelation and/or vitrification during polymerization or cross-linking the phase separation was found to be frustrated in different stages. The interplay of final morphology, phase separation kinetics, gelation and glass transition is discussed in a general xN versus composition diagram for both x and N (conversion) induced decomposition. Finally, very recent applications of small angle light scattering (SALS) for monitoring structural changes in polymer blends after pressure and temperature changes in the extrusion process (in-line experiments) will be shown. This results are described by the same concepts as discussed above. Available from: [URL] / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEDEGerman...|$|R
40|$|The nonequilibrium {{dynamics}} {{following a}} quench of strongly repulsive bosonic ensembles in one-dimensional finite lattices is investigated by employing interaction <b>quenches</b> and/or a <b>ramp</b> of the lattice potential. Both sudden and time-dependent quenches are analyzed in detail. For {{the case of}} interaction quenches we address {{the transition from the}} strong repulsive to the weakly-interacting regime, suppressing in this manner the heating of the system. The excitation modes such as the cradle process and the local breathing mode are examined via local density observables. In particular, the cradle mode is inherently related to the initial delocalization and, following a negative interaction quench, can be excited only for incommensurate setups with filling larger than unity. Alternatively, a negative quench of the lattice depth which favors the spatial delocalization is used to access the cradle mode for setups with filling smaller than unity. Our results shed light on possible schemes to control the cradle and the breathing modes. Finally, employing the notion of fidelity we study the dynamical response of the system after a diabatic or adiabatic parameter modulation for short and long evolution times. The evolution of the system is obtained numerically using the ab-initio multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method for bosons which permits to follow non-equilibrium dynamics including the corresponding investigation of higher-band effects.
