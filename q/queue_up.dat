5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
5|$|The two Ferrari {{cars and}} the Renault of Kubica became the first cars to <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> behind the safety car, {{while the rest of}} the field had enough notice to divert to the pitlane for their first stop. The {{significance}} of these events was that both Vettel and Hamilton were able to make their first stops before their advantage over the rest of the field was cancelled out by catching the safety car, while Alonso, Massa and Kubica fell down the order. Hamilton's stop was for a replacement front wing. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 14 and the cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel locked his tyres and ran deep driving into the final turn, and resisted Hamilton's attempt at overtaking him. Alonso immediately pushed hard and passed Hülkenberg for ninth place at turn 17 on the 15th lap. A line of cars formed behind Kobayashi while Vettel and Hamilton pulled away from the rest of the field, as the front two began trading the fastest lap time of the event. Button gained a large amount of top speed but remained behind both Sauber cars. Schumacher passed both Virgin cars to move into the 17th position by lap 17.|$|E

25|$|The unions say the {{striking}} workers account for some 30%–40% of dock employees serving Hutchison's terminals in the city. HIT said the strike is costing it HK$5 million (US$644,000) in daily losses. According {{to the chairman}} of Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics, vessels now need to <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> outside of Hong Kong port for two to four days before being able to berth; the wait was negligible just before the strike. The association estimated 120,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) have accumulated since the strike action began two weeks earlier.|$|E

On the [...] unconventional structure of the song, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman said that verses were [...] "very lengthy – Kanye appears within the first minute and then drops out for good – but the droning beat is so mesmerizing that it's barely even noticeable." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent explained the use of several guest appearances, writing [...] "Kanye has never been short on ambition or ego, so it's no surprise he should have his guests (including such hip-hop luminaries as Jay-Z, Swizz Beats and RZA) <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> on [...] "So Appalled" [...] to confirm in turn how 'this shit is fucking ridiculous'".|$|E
500|$|While {{acknowledging}} the privileged position whites had under Smith, several commentators have latterly agreed with his claims that many black Zimbabweans preferred him to Mugabe with hindsight. [...] "Smith's image improved inversely as Mugabe's plummeted," [...] Johnson wrote. [...] "When {{he walked the}} streets of Harare, Africans would almost <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> to grasp his hand and wish him well." [...] "If you were to go to Harare today [...] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader—Smith or Mugabe—the answer would be almost unanimous," [...] Boynton asserted; [...] "And {{it would not be}} Mugabe." [...] Smith's death prompted strongly condemnatory reports in Zimbabwe's state media. The Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga accused Smith of being a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands and asserted that he would [...] "not be mourned or missed here by any decent person". Reactions from Zimbabweans on the street were mixed, however; according to Western journalists, many expressed sadness.|$|E
500|$|Zeta-Jones {{participated in}} school stage shows {{from a young}} age and gained local media {{attention}} when her rendition of a Shirley Bassey song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a West End production of the musical Annie, and in her early teens, she became a national tap-dancing champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of Annie in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the Swansea Grand Theatre. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of Bugsy Malone. When she was 15, Zeta-Jones {{dropped out of school}} without obtaining O-levels and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of The Pajama Game. Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, [...] "I would <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent Arts Educational Schools in Chiswick, London, for a three-year course in musical theatre.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} production received mixed reviews. Coward later wrote, [...] "The critics described Private Lives variously as 'tenuous, thin, brittle, gossamer, iridescent, and delightfully daring'. All {{of which}} connoted {{in the public}} mind cocktails, repartee and irreverent allusions to copulation, thereby causing a gratifying number of respectable people to <b>queue</b> <b>up</b> at the box office." [...] The Times wrote, [...] "What an entertaining play it is!", but wondered if any other performers could bring it off. Allardyce Nicoll called it [...] "amusing, no doubt, yet hardly moving farther below the surface than a paper boat in a bathtub and, like the paper boat, ever in imminent danger of becoming a shapeless, sodden mass." [...] The Manchester Guardian commented, [...] "The audience evidently found it a good entertainment, but Mr. Coward [...] certainly had not flattered our intelligence. The play appears {{to be based on the}} theory that anything will do provided it be neatly done." [...] The Observer also thought that the play depended on brilliant acting and thought the characters unrealistic, though [...] "None the less, for a couple of hours they are delicious company when Mr. Coward is master of unceremonious ceremonies." [...] The New Statesman discerned a sad side to the play in its story of a couple who can live neither with nor without each other: [...] "It is not the least of Mr. Coward's achievements that he has ... disguised the grimness of his play and that his conception of love is really desolating." ...|$|E
