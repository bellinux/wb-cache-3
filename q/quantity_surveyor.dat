40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the nature and extent}} of value management (VM) practice by professional <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> in South Africa. The survey explores practitioners&# 039; awareness and understanding of VM and {{the nature and extent of}} the use of VM techniques within their organisations. Design/methodology/approach: A web-based, online questionnaire survey is employed to establish VM practice by South African registered <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> Descriptive statistics are used to analyse the survey response data. Findings: The results suggest that, while VM (and more particularly its value engineering antecedent) is generally known among <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> in South Africa, it is less widely practiced. VM is seen predominantly as a cost reduction tool. This misperception, and the lack of awareness of the potential benefits of VM, must be remedied if <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> in South Africa are to provide clients with services that meet world&# 039;s best practice standards. <b>Quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> also need to know what those standards are. Practical implications: Refresher courses in contemporary VM theory and practice are recommended, as well as exploration of the impacts on VM of other techniques such as risk, quality and environmental management.

40|$|AbstractQuantity {{surveying}} is {{global and}} provides services across various industries. <b>Quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> {{are involved in}} all phases of a facility's lifecycle such as feasibility, design, construction, extension, refurbishment, maintenance, and demolition. The competencies of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are aimed at producing constructions that meet the client's value system. Building engineering services are part of buildings, but quantity surveyors’ involvements in procurement are limited. Therefore, this study examines the kinds of services that <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> play in the procurement of building services. Primary data is collected through a survey questionnaire. The results of the findings led {{to the conclusion that}} <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> were actively involved in the procurement of building services. Cost advice during construction is the most offered service while advice on the impact of building engineering services on environment is seldom offered. However, most of the services are still at the downstream side in the supply chain. The analytical method and detailed costing techniques were predominantly applied for estimating building engineering services. We argue {{that there is a need}} for <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> to move to the upstream in the supply chain for competitiveness. The results of the study are useful to <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors,</b> service engineering consultants, academic institutions and other stakeholders in the construction industry...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the perception of propensity to trust and organizational commitment of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> and examine if propensity to trust among working partners enhances organizational commitment of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Organizational commitment and propensity to trust is linked through the framework of social exchange. Quantitative approach with questionnaire survey is employed to investigate whether propensity to trust would enhance organizational commitment. Questionnaires are sent to the <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> who are professional members of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors and are working in the Hong Kong construction industry. In total, 71 valid responses are obtained for data analysis. Findings – Contrary to prediction, propensity to trust does not show significant relationship with both affective and continuance commitment. The two propensity to trust scales show different results on the relationship with normative commitment (NC). When working relationship is taken into consideration, <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyor’s</b> propensity to trust the partner who has the worst working relationship has significant and positive impact on the surveyor’s NC level; whilst <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyor’s</b> propensity to trust the partner who has the best working relationship does not has significant positive impact on the surveyor’s NC level. Practical implications – To improve propensity to trust among <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors,</b> consultant companies should provide professional-related training programme to <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> as to explore their potential.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} {{investigates the}} role and perceptions of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> experienced with sustainable building projects {{and how they are}} able contribute as well as influence designs to address sustainability issues on projects. Design: To determine the considerations that affect quantity surveyors' perceptions towards sustainability in the construction industry, a literature review was carried out. This was followed by the development of an online survey formed of both structured and semi-structured questions that were issued out to South African <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> This study administers online surveys distributed online to <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> on the ASAQS and the Green Building Council database consisting of 1499 registered members and 59 members respectively. Furthermore, in depth interviews were carried out with four <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> who had experience with green building projects. Findings: South Africa is accustomed to traditional building methods and the adoption of and adaptation to alternative building techniques is challenging to implement in the industry. The main barriers to sustainable building designs were the perceived higher cost of the materials as well as the lack of training and knowledge consultants have on material choices. <b>Quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> nevertheless regarded the early design stages of a construction project as an ideal avenue for contribution towards sustainable building designs. Based on interviews conducted, professional <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> with experience on green building projects were more likely to contribute towards sustainable building specifications due to lessons learnt and knowledge from previous projects. However, <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> believed they generally have little influence towards green building specifications as the client and architect have the final say on what is incorporated into a building. Practical implications: The research study has provided a greater understanding of the role played by cost consultants on sustainability projects and how they can provide value to clients on such projects. Conclusions and Recommendations: The research concludes that <b>Quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are aware that they play a minor role player on project teams when it comes to providing alternative building specifications. It was acknowledged that <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> have limited experience on sustainable technologies and that further training and education in this regard is essential for them to add value to projects. It is recommended that further research be undertaken to obtain a larger sample size to get a clearer view of the perception of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> advising on building specifications to support sustainable building developments...|$|R
40|$|Purpose In South Africa 48 % of all <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are {{identified}} as generation Y, a generation born between 1981 – 2000. This {{highlights the importance of}} generation Y to the quantity surveying profession as they are the future upon which this profession will build. Employers in the quantity surveying industry need to know what makes the workplace attractive and satisfying for this generation in order to effectively recruit and retain the talent of generation Y. A literature review done on job satisfaction of <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> indicated that very little research has been conducted on the subject in general and no research was found specifically on job satisfaction of generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate if generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are experiencing job satisfaction. Methodology The research approach for this study consists of a comprehensive literature review and substantiated empirical research. Various sources of literature were reviewed including books, articles, reports and papers. The literature review examined information with regards to generational theory, the relation between motivation, job satisfaction and employee turnover and lastly aspects about the quantity surveying industry in South Africa. Empirical research was conducted making use of focus groups as qualitative research method. Research participants were generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> who were profiled according to gender, race and experience to ensure diversity within the focus groups. Findings It was found that the majority of generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are experiencing job satisfaction within their current working environment. This was only achieved once the correct “employee-employer fit” was found. It was also established that generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> are motivated by growth opportunities, rewards/bonuses, recognition, appreciation, support/help/mentorship and being part of the team/business. It was further found that these workplace factors also affect employee turnover among this generation. Research limitations The focus of this study was limited to the quantity surveying profession in South Africa with a specific focus on generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> Research informants were limited to generation Y <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors</b> born during 1980 – 1990 and included both candidate and professional <b>quantity</b> <b>surveyors.</b> What is original / value The findings of this paper will be of value to employers in the quantity surveying profession, as job satisfaction of generation Y employees has not previously been addressed. Adapting management strategies according to the findings may result in higher job satisfaction, lower employee turnover and increased profitability.
