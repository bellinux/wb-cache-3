While overthrowing the regimes in Egypt and Tunisia was a relatively <b>quick</b> <b>process,</b> Gaddafi's campaign posed significant stalls on the uprisings in Libya. The first announcement of a competing political authority appeared online and declared the Interim Transitional National Council as an alternative government. One of Gaddafi's senior advisors responded by posting a tweet, wherein he resigned, defected, and advised Gaddafi to flee. By 20 February, the unrest had spread to Tripoli. On 27 February 2011, the National Transitional Council was established to administer the areas of Libya under rebel control. On 10 March 2011, France became the first state to officially recognise the council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people.|$|E

500|$|Whitney {{was portrayed}} by Brook Kerr from the series' debut on July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007. In 2005, Sidne Siobhan Phillips portrayed the {{character}} in flashbacks. Passions casting director Jacklynn Briskey originally rejected 26-year-old Brook Kerr {{for the role}} of Whitney, believing she would look too mature to play a teenager. Despite this decision, Kerr's husband Christopher Warren submitted his wife's head shots to the network and she was hired to play the character. Kerr later described the week of auditioning and two screen tests to be formally cast in the role as an extremely <b>quick</b> <b>process.</b> While discussing her portrayal of the character, Kerr said, [...] "I was always the sensible one, the friend everyone could count on, always doing what I should."

Much of the damage is worse than initially thought, and the lift's 36-tonne haul rope will have to be replaced.

2500|$|The {{industrial}} production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the cold process, wherein the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled process, wherein the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and <b>quick</b> <b>process</b> is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E
