30|$|Next, {{we examine}} how {{estimation}} of the unbiased weighted standard deviation and skewness estimators varies {{as a function of}} the overlapping return period q, sample size n, and weighting scheme using the SPY dataset previously described. We consider overlapping return periods of 5, 21, and 63 sample points which correspond to weekly, monthly, and <b>quarterly</b> <b>aggregation</b> windows for our example daily return data. Next, we truncate the sample size to 256, 512, and 1024 data points which roughly correspond to 1, 2, and 5 -year time periods, using a trailing truncation window on the SPY returns.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} weekly, monthly and <b>quarterly</b> time <b>aggregation</b> on {{estimates}} of price change is examined for nineteen different supermarket item categories over a fifteen month period using scanner data. We find that time aggregation choices (the {{choice of a}} weekly, monthly or quarterly unit value concept for prices) have a considerable impact on estimates of price change. When chained indexes are used, the difference in price change estimates can be huge, ranging from 0. 28 % to 29. 73 % for a superlative (Fisher) index and an incredible 14. 88 % to 46, 463. 71 % for a non-superlative (Laspeyres) index. The results suggest that traditional index number theory breaks down when weekly data with severe price bouncing are used, even for superlative indexes. Monthly and (in some cases even) <b>quarterly</b> time <b>aggregation</b> {{were found to be}} insufficient to eliminate downward drift in superlative indexes. In order to eliminate chain drift, multilateral index number methods are adapted to provide drift free measures of price change.

40|$|We study {{aggregation}} - or sample frequencies - of {{time series}}, e. g. aggregation from weekly to monthly or <b>quarterly</b> time series. <b>Aggregation</b> usually gives shorter time series but spurious phenomena, in e. g. daily observations, can {{on the other}} hand be avoided. An important issue is the effect of aggregation on the adjustment coefficient in cointegrated systems. We study only first order vector autoregressive processes for n dimensional time series Xt, and we illustrate the theory by a two dimensional and a four dimensional model for prices of various grades of gasoline. na...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quarterly</b> {{earnings}} allow <b>aggregation</b> into {{annual earnings}} in four different ways. Fiscal year earnings is {{one measure of}} annual earnings, the others being earnings for annual periods ending at interim quarter-ends. We investigate earnings management in fiscal year earnings relative to these alternative measures of firms’ annual earnings. We confirm prior findings in Burgstahler and Dichev (1997. Earnings management to avoid earnings decreases and losses. Journal of Accounting and Economics 24, 99 – 126) of discontinuities around zero and prior year earnings in histograms of earnings. Subsequent research questions whether these discontinuities are evidence of earnings management. Using histograms of our alternative annual earnings measures, we offer evidence suggesting earnings management {{is responsible for the}} discontinuities...|$|R
