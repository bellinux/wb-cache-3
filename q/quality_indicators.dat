25|$|The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is the Federal {{authority}} for patient safety {{and quality of}} care {{and has been a}} leader in pediatric quality and safety. AHRQ has developed Pediatric <b>Quality</b> <b>Indicators</b> (PedQIs) with the goal to highlight areas of quality concern and to target areas for further analysis. Eighteen pediatric <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> are included in the AHRQ quality measure modules; based on expert input, risk adjustment, and other considerations. Thirteen inpatient indicators are recommended for use at the hospital level, and five are designated area indicators. Inpatient indicators are treatments or conditions with the greatest potential of an adverse event for hospitalized children.|$|E
25|$|Other {{key areas}} {{of work for}} the Commission include National Health Service accreditation, {{recognising}} and responding to clinical deterioration, patient centred care, safety and quality in mental health and primary care {{and the development of}} national safety and <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> as part of the information strategies activity.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service (NHS) {{began an}} ambitious pay for {{performance}} initiative in 2004, {{known as the}} Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). General practitioners agreed to increases in existing income according to performance with respect to 146 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> covering clinical care for 10 chronic diseases, organization of care, and patient experience. Unlike proposed quality incentive programs in the United States, funding for primary care was increased 20% over previous levels. This allowed practices to invest in extra staff and technology; 90% of general practitioners use the NHS Electronic Prescription Service, and up to 50% use electronic health records {{for the majority of}} clinical care. Early analysis showed that substantially increasing physicians' pay based on their success in meeting quality performance measures is successful. The 8,000 family practitioners included in the study earned an average of $40,000 more by collecting nearly 97% of the points available.|$|E
30|$|In this section, a {{graph-based}} {{representation of}} a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> is defined. It is called a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> graph. A <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> graph consists {{of one or two}} MSO-labeled object graphs and a quantifying concept.|$|R
30|$|The {{value that}} is {{obtained}} from a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> by using the calculating formula and data in a hospital (or hospitals) is called “the value of a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> (in a hospital (or hospitals))” or “the data of a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> (in a hospital (or hospitals))”.|$|R
30|$|Then, Q is ensured to be a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> graph. By using substitution, one {{can develop}} a {{complicated}} <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> graph such as G incrementally. Moreover, the example shows the graph-based representation can address the problem explained in Section 1. And it shows that QI-RS realizes a representation of a <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> that satisfies both of formality and understandability.|$|R
2500|$|Also, {{the first}} phase of the [...] was {{supported}} by a 27 million US dollars loan approved in June 2000. OSE was able to successfully implement and disseminate an in-house reference system that compares performance of the water utility in 21 cities, on the basis of eight service <b>quality</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, {{the first phase}} helped improve sewer coverage in another 12 cities of the interior by expanding—according to demand—the sewerage systems. Finally, three new sewage treatment plants were built in the cities of Minas, Treinta y Tres and Durazno, with a total capacity to serve 60,000 users.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{of managed}} care argue that [...] "for-profit" [...] managed care has been an {{unsuccessful}} health policy, as it has contributed to higher health care costs (25–33% higher overhead {{at some of the}} largest HMOs), increased the number of uninsured citizens, driven away health care providers, and applied downward pressure on quality (worse scores on 14 of 14 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> reported to the National Committee for Quality Assurance). Others argue that managed care puts the emphasis on financial implications instead of healthcare. In hospital meetings, {{it has been reported that}} senior staff feel [...] "the only people with real decisions to make are the insurers".|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{population}} health, life expectancy in 2006 {{was about two}} and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years. Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S. Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage. For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd. [...] The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on <b>Quality</b> <b>Indicators,</b> the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, childhood leukemia, and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles. [...] It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000. [...] The authors state that, [...] "It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list." ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{environmentally}} sensitive areas (ESAs) prone to desertification {{can lead to}} substantial gains in the efficiency of land use planning and partly avoid negative outcomes. The main objectives of this research were the monitoring and mapping of ESAs to desertification in the agro-ecosystem of the Khanmirza plain, Iran, during two time series (2000 and 2013). In the current study, an adjusted “Mediterranean desertification and land use (MEDALUS) ” approach was applied to identify the most ESAs to desertification {{in the study area}} and monitorchanges inthe environmental sensitivity area indicator (ESAI) between 2000 and 2013 over the studied area.

40|$|A new <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> for Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMV) s {{has been}} tested at the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies.

The EE promises higher skill than the <b>quality</b> <b>indicator</b> alone in predicting AMV error. Removing numerical weather prediction information from the regression still shows some skill, although it is less skillful than the full linear regression.
