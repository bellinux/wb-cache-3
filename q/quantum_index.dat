40|$|Quantum {{computers}} realize {{parallel computing}} and solve NP problems efficiently since {{the possibilities of}} all the candidates for the answer are simultaneously calculated by utilizing quantum-mechanical processes. NP problems such as factorization are problems {{for which it is}} difficult to find the answers but candidates found are easily verified. In order to realize a quantum computer for solving practical problems, development of software as well as hardware is necessary, although qubit expansion using physical quantum-mechanical processes has been a focus for research on quantum computing. Moreover, in order to develop software efficiently, a system which can emulate large-scale problems at high speed is required. In this paper, a quantum computing emulator, which executes 75 -qubit programs at high speed, is proposed for the development of practical quantum algorithms. Our emulator, named a <b>quantum</b> <b>index</b> processor, emulates the procedure of quantum computing at high speed by using the latest CMOS LSI.

40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the image quality and radiation exposure of pediatric protocols for cardiac CT angiography (CTA) in infants under one year of age. Methodology/Principal Findings: Cardiac CTA examinations were performed using an anthropomorphic phantom representing a 1 -year-old child scanned with non-electrocardiogram-gated (NG), retrospectively electrocardiogram-gated helical (RGH) and prospectively electrocardiogram-gated axial (PGA) techniques in 64 -slice and 256 -slice CT scanners. The thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) were used for direct organ dose measurement, while dose-length product and effective mAs were also used to estimate the patient dose. For image quality, noise and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) were assessed based on regions-of-interest drawn on the reconstructed CT images, and were compared with the proposed cardiac image <b>quantum</b> <b>index</b> (CIQI). Estimated dose results were in accordant to the measured doses. The NG scan showed the best image quality in terms of noise and SNR. The PGA scan had better image quality than the RGH scan with 83. 70 % dose reduction. Noise and SNR were also corresponded to the proposed CIQI. Conclusions/Significance: The PGA scan protocol was a good choice in balancing radiation exposure and image quality for infant cardiac CTA. We also suggested that the effective mAs and the CIQI were suitable in assessing the tradeoffs between radiation dose and image quality for cardiac CTA in infants.

40|$|We {{present an}} optical study of {{beryllium}} delta-doped GaAs/AlAs multiple quantum well (QW) structures designed for sensing terahertz (THz) radiation. Photoreflectance (PR), surface photovoltage (SPV), and wavelength-modulated differential surface photovoltage (DSPV) spectra were {{measured in the}} structures with QW widths ranging from 3 to 20 nm and doping densities from 2 × 10 (10) to 5 × 10 (12) cm(– 2) at room temperature. The PR spectra displayed Franz-Keldysh oscillations which enabled an estimation of the electric-field strength of 20 kV/cm at the sample surface. By analyzing the SPV spectra we have determined that a buried interface rather than the sample surface mainly governs the SPV effect. The DSPV spectra revealed sharp features associated with excitonic interband transitions which energies {{were found to be}} in a good agreement with those calculated including the nonparabolicity of the energy bands. The dependence of the exciton linewidth broadening on the well width and the <b>quantum</b> <b>index</b> has shown that an average half monolayer well width fluctuations is mostly predominant broadening mechanism for QWs thinner than 10 nm. The line broadening in lightly doped QWs, thicker than 10 nm, was found to arise from thermal broadening with the contribution from Stark broadening due to random electric fields of the ionized impurities in the structures. We finally consider the possible influence of strong internal electric fields, QW imperfections, and doping level on the operation of THz sensors fabricated using the studied structures. © 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new fermionic variational wavefunction, generalizing the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) wavefunction, which is suitable for interacting multi-species spinful systems and sustaining superfluidity. Applications range from quark matter to the high temperature superconductors. A wide class of Hamiltonians, comprising interactions and hybridization of arbitrary momentum dependence between different fermion species, can be treated in a comprehensive manner. This is the case, as both the intra-species and the inter-species interactions are treated on equally rigorous footing, which is accomplished via {{the introduction of a}} new <b>quantum</b> <b>index</b> attached to the fermions. The index is consistent with known fermionic physics, and allows for heretofore unaccounted for fermion-fermion correlations. We have derived the finite temperature version of the theory, thus obtaining the renormalized quasiparticle dispersion relations, and we discuss the appearance of charge and spin density wave order. We present numerical solutions for two electron species in 2 dimensions. Based on these solutions, we show that, for equivalent spin up and down fermions, the Fermi occupation factor (per spin) equals 1 / 2 deep in the Fermi sea. This constitutes a unique experimental prediction of the theory, both for the normal and superfluid states. Interestingly, this result, obtained in the thermodynamic limit, is consistent with Fermi occupation factor (in-) equalities for finite systems of electrons, derived (in a different context) by Borland and Dennis, J.

The paper finds that in 1990 s, the stock market at Karachi has become more volatile both on short-term (daily) and medium term (monthly) basis. Furthermore strong volatility inertia was present in stock price index, trading volume, wholesale price index, manufacturing output and money supply. The paper finds that there did not exist any systematic relation of stock price volatility with real or nominal macroeconomic volatility. Likewise, for the sample period, a volatile trading volume was neither due to a volatile stock price nor due to the fluctuations and shocks taking place in the economy. However, there was a negative long run relationship between stock price index and trading volume which suggests that the stock market has grown in size but its performance in terms of price has deteriorated. We also find that the level of real activity as indicated by manufacturing sector’s output responds positively to changes in stock price index. Therefore a poor performance of the stock market was likely to have had played at least some negative effects on the performance of manufacturing sector in the said period. ...|$|E

Some experimental results for these compounds were contrary to conventional wisdom, which holds that calculated atomic charges for the aromatic sites and 13 C-NMR and 19 F-NMR chemical shifts should allow prediction of the preferred sites for aromatic substitution. Density functional theory (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G*//RM 1) and semi-empirical (RM 1) quantum chemical calculations were employed to study the intermediates in the reaction pathways in order to identify the preferred paths for aromatic substitution.
