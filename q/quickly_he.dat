5|$|The 20-year-old {{king was}} inexperienced and {{considered}} ill-served amidst {{what has been}} called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in Scania to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in Scania were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded Scania, taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E
5|$|After {{four years}} of doing his {{residency}} in Singkawang, Borneo, Dr. Pardi (Adnan Kapau Gani) returns to Java to open a practice. Before then, he goes to Cigading to visit his family and give them souvenirs. Upon arrival he is stunned to find that his family's maid Tati (Djoewariah), who had been his childhood playmate, is now a grown and beautiful woman. He secretly begins to fawn over Tati, although he does not tell her the reason. When Pardi's mother tells him he should marry <b>quickly,</b> <b>he</b> refuses all of her suggested brides. He says only that he already has someone in mind, aware that his mother would never approve an inter-class marriage with the maid.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Rommel took {{command of}} the German Army Group B in {{occupied}} France. He also {{took control of the}} Atlantic Wall defenses on the French coasts facing the United Kingdom and during a tour of anti-invasion fortifications Rommel concluded that the defenses would have to be improved, and <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> ordered millions of wooden tree trunks and logs to be set against airborne forces. Barbed wire and tripwires were to be strung between the poles. On plans that Rommel sent to his subordinates, the complete system of wooden poles and interconnecting wires was called Luftlandehindernis.|$|E

5|$|In Nuenen, Van Gogh {{focused on}} {{painting}} and drawing. Working outside and very <b>quickly,</b> <b>he</b> completed sketches and paintings of weavers and their cottages. From August 1884, Margot Begemann, a neighbour's daughter ten years his senior, joined {{him on his}} forays; {{she fell in love}} and he reciprocated, though less enthusiastically. They wanted to marry, but neither side of their families were in favour. Margot was distraught and took an overdose of strychnine, but survived after Van Gogh rushed her to a nearby hospital. On 26 March 1885, his father died of a heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Saari {{initially}} {{opened fire}} {{on a group of}} students taking a business studies exam, and entered at least one other classroom. According to the three students who were able to escape from the exam room (there were roughly 20 students taking the exam), Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them. It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively. Saari encountered little resistance, and the massacre was concluded relatively <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid, believed to be petrol, and set the room alight.|$|E
5|$|When Nixon took office, about 300 American {{soldiers}} were dying each week in Vietnam, {{and the war}} was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and {{he was determined to}} end the war <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.|$|E

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E
5|$|At about eleven o'clock, Cox began urging Ashford to leave. When the two did leave, it {{was with}} Thornton, who {{accompanied}} Ashford closely, while Cox walked behind them. Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her working clothes in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her working clothes. Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to teach and delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E

5|$|Measuring , {{the first}} {{painting}} {{was completed in}} 1896, and presented to Patriarch Georgije later that year. Dissatisfied, the Patriarch asked Jovanović to adjust his work to conform with the Church's view of the migration. Though Jovanović made the changes relatively <b>quickly,</b> <b>he</b> could not render them {{in time for the}} painting to be displayed in Budapest, and it therefore had to be unveiled at the Archbishop's palace in Sremski Karlovci. Jovanović went on to complete a total of four versions of the painting, three of which survive. The first version is on display at the patriarchate building of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade, the second at the Pančevo Museum, and the fourth at Princess Ljubica's Residence, in Belgrade. Migration of the Serbs holds iconic status in Serbian popular culture, and several authors repute it to be one of Jovanović's finest achievements.|$|E
5|$|The silver medals {{from the}} 2007 Osaka World Championships boosted Bolt's desire to run, {{and he took}} a more serious, more mature stance towards his career. Bolt {{continued}} to develop in the 100 m, and he entered to run in the event at the Jamaica Invitational in Kingston. On 3 May 2008, Bolt ran a time of 9.76 s, with a 1.8 m/s tail wind, improving his personal best from 10.03 s. This was the second-fastest legal performance {{in the history of the}} event, second only to compatriot Asafa Powell's 9.74 s record set the previous year in Rieti, Italy. Rival Tyson Gay lauded the performance, praising Bolt's form and technique especially. Michael Johnson, who was observing the race, said that he was shocked at how <b>quickly</b> <b>he</b> had improved over the 100 m distance. The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

25|$|As a batsman, {{following}} a strong order, Robinson's normal brief was to score <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> lifted Claude Lewis, the Kent left-arm spinner and later county scorer, {{over the roof}} of the football stand at Headingley, put Dick Howorth of Worcestershire out of Park Avenue, Bradford and into Horton Park, and Johnnie Clay of Glamorgan out of the Arms Park in Cardiff.|$|E
25|$|With that, Noda {{was out of}} {{the picture}} as far as Formula One was concerned, so for 1996 he went across the Atlantic to try his luck in Indy Lights in America.

25|$|However, {{after his}} last birthday, Tanabe's health {{deteriorated}} <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> had mostly been bed-ridden since early May 2009 {{and could not}} eat, due to a chronic heart condition. On 19 June 2009, Tanabe died in his sleep of heart failure {{at his home in}} southern Japan. He was 113 years, 274 days old. Upon Tanabe's death, British World War I veteran Henry Allingham, age 113, became the world's oldest living man, but died a month later.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} plan of General Sir Harold Alexander, the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI)—as formulated by his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Sir John Harding—was to storm the Gothic Line in the centre, {{where most of}} his forces were already concentrated. It was the shortest route to his objective, the plains of Lombardy, and could be mounted <b>quickly.</b> <b>He</b> mounted a deception operation to convince the Germans that the main blow would come on the Adriatic front.|$|E
25|$|His artistic {{skills were}} {{improved}} {{by studying the}} monumental buildings {{in the city and}} his education at the hands of Bilinić's wife, who was a high-school teacher. Soon, they found a mine owner from Vienna who paid for Meštrović to move there and be admitted to the Academy of Fine Arts where he studied under Edmund von Hellmer and Otto Wagner. <b>Quickly</b> <b>he</b> had to learn German from scratch and adjust to the new environment, but he persevered and successfully finished his studies.|$|E
