5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> glovework. Despite this, {{he was at}} times {{considered to be a}} better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E
5|$|Square {{tried to}} {{integrate}} Radical Dreamers into the Japanese PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger as an Easter egg. Writer and director Masato Kato halted {{this and other}} releases, unhappy with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. Though the game was never officially released abroad, ROM hackers completed an English fan translation in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Thornton {{returned}} to the artillery in September 1942 as second-in-command of 4th Field Regiment, but the following month he was posted to {{the staff of the}} division. Here he {{came to the attention of}} its commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> operational work.In June 1943, Thornton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, was given command of 5th Field Regiment. By now, the conflict in North Africa was over with the surrender of the Afrika Korps, and the New Zealanders were transferred to Italy to participate in the campaign there.|$|E

5|$|Because of the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{maritime}} illustrations, Coggins {{was invited}} by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children's {{book about the}} U.S. Navy; the author being Fletcher Pratt, the well known military historian. Coggins was {{invited to participate in}} Pratt's Naval Game, based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships, built {{on a scale of one}} inch to fifty feet. These were spread over the floor of Pratt's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula. The result of Pratt and Coggins's first collaboration, published in 1941, was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy, a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of the Netherlands, one of van Meegeren’s agents sold the Vermeer forgery Christ with the Adulteress to Nazi banker and art dealer Alois Miedl in 1942. Experts could probably have identified it as a forgery; as van Meegeren's health declined, so did the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work. He chain-smoked, drank heavily, and became addicted to morphine-laced sleeping pills. Fortunately for van Meegeren, there were no genuine Vermeers available for comparison, since most museum collections were in protective storage as a prevention against war damage. Miedl then sold it to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring for 1.65million guilders ($625,000 or $7million today).|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{prolific}} and commercially successful {{throughout the}} 1840s, but the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In {{the immediate aftermath}} of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in Tate Britain's landmark Exposed: The Victorian Nude exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his The Sirens and Ulysses in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.|$|E

5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared {{from time to time in}} operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Henri-Georges Clouzot {{was born}} in Niort, France, to mother Suzanne Clouzot and father Georges Clouzout, a book store owner. He {{was the first of}} three {{children}} in a middle-class family. Clouzot showed talent by writing plays and playing piano recitals. In 1922, Clouzot's father's bookstore went bankrupt and his family moved to Brest, France, where his father became an auctioneer. In Brest, Henri-Georges Clouzot went to Naval School, but was unable to become a Naval Cadet due to his myopia. At the age of 18, Clouzot left for Paris to study political science. While living in Paris, he became friends with several magazine editors. His writing talents led him to theater and cinema as a playwright, lyricist and adaptor-screenwriter. The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work led producer Adolphe Osso to hire him and send him to Germany to work in Studio Babelsberg in Berlin, translating scripts for foreign language films shot there.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts about the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> troops, {{he had no choice}} but to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E
60|$|I {{was struck}} in this note with {{the mention of}} Lord Byron, and, the next time I saw her, alluded to it, and remarked upon the {{peculiar}} <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind as shown in some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> more serious conversations with Dr. Kennedy.|$|R

5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about the prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful {{in part due to}} British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|The first {{appearance}} {{of this species}} in the literature was in 1890, under the name Colus fusiformis, when Eduard Fischer wrote a description based on a painting he found in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In his 1944 monograph on the Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Herriot Cunningham considered this naming to be a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate description. However, it was valid under {{the rules of the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In 1899 Penzig described the species Colus javanicus based on a single specimen found on Java, and a year later Fischer amended the name of his original Colus fusiformis to Colus javanicus, as he was not satisfied with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> original description. Despite his doubts on the validity of his description, his original naming is both legitimate and has priority over C.javanicus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{earning a}} poor {{reputation}} for his conduct, Costa attracted interest from Salamanca, Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Málaga after his loan at Celta; García Pitarch ruled out any approach from the latter, fearing how Costa would behave on the Costa del Sol. After attending Atlético's pre-season tour of Mexico, he signed on loan for Albacete, also of Segunda División, on 22 August 2008, signing a contract {{which would have}} a lower fee depending on how many games he played. He initially threatened to terminate his deal with the Castile-La Mancha team, {{on account of the}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates and the city's lack of a beach. Nine days after signing, he scored a late winner in a 2–1 victory over Sevilla's reserves at the Estadio Carlos Belmonte. The Queso Mecánico suffered with financial problems during Costa's loan, with him threatening to strike unless their non-playing staff were paid in full. He was dropped to the bench by manager Juan Ignacio Martínez for the home game against Real Sociedad on 13 December as punishment for an argument with goalkeeper Jonathan, but came on as a substitute to score another late winner.|$|E

6000|$|Our hero, Harry Boyns, {{held the}} {{steering}} oar. He {{had been appointed}} by the parent Institution {{to the position of}} [...] "Local Secretary of the Covelly Lifeboat Branch," [...] and, of course, was anxious to know the <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vessel.|$|R
60|$|He came {{a little}} nearer. His hands rested upon her {{shoulders}} very lightly, yet they seemed like some enveloping chain. More {{than ever in}} those few moments she realised the spiritual <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. His eyes were aglow. His voice, a little broken with emotion, was wonderfully tender. He looked at her {{as though she were}} some precious and sacred thing.|$|R
5|$|Several {{areas of}} the city were {{developed}} in the Stuart period, and more building took place during Georgian times in response to the increasing number of visitors who required accommodation. Architects John Wood the Elder and his son laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone, a type of limestone used for construction in the city, was obtained from the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764). Allen, to advertise the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines. Allen was responsible for improving and expanding the postal service in western England, for which he held the contract for more than forty years. Although not fond of politics, Allen was a civic-minded man and a member of Bath Corporation for many years. He was elected mayor for a single term in 1742.|$|E

25|$|Chaloner was renowned in the coining {{community}} for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work and his prolific success. He purchased a large {{house in the}} semi-rural suburb of Knightsbridge, rode in a carriage, bought plate and dressed like a gentleman.|$|E
5000|$|De Staebler’s ceramic sculptures {{harness the}} {{inherent}} <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> clay, <b>his</b> primary medium during the earlier years <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career, to create raw, fragmented indexes of the body, {{the landscape and}} even the landscape as body. The equally organic and preternatural <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forms evoke the tenuous relationships between earthly monumentality and spiritual transcendence, fragmentation and wholeness, and fragility and strength. This tendency for slippage serves a productive purpose, allowing the works to inhabit the discursive space between more prescriptive categories. Seated Figure with Yellow Flame, {{in the collection of}} the Smithsonian American Art Museum is a typical example <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anthropomorphic works.|$|R
5000|$|John H. Wheeler {{wrote of}} Gilliam, [...] "As a statesman, {{he was a}} pure and patriotic; as a lawyer, he was learned and able, and his ability was only equalled by the kindly <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> heart. Such were the {{conspicuous}} traits <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character, which endeared him to all who knew him." ...|$|R
50|$|As a tango pianist, {{he played}} with several orchestras, {{including}} the orchestra of Juan d'Arienzo from 1935 to 1938, and is often partly credited {{with the development of}} d'Arienzo's rhythmic style. He later formed his own orchestra, and the special rhythmic <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music are easily recognisable.|$|R
25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Adam von Bartsch, {{although}} Andreae never designed woodcuts (as opposed to designing typefaces), the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work was such that he, along with Hans Lützelburger and Jost de Negker, should be considered an artist.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{with his}} 1979 album, Into the Music {{and the song}} [...] "And the Healing Has Begun", a {{frequent}} theme <b>of</b> <b>his</b> music and lyrics {{has been based on}} his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of mystic Christianity.
