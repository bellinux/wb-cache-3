Brechin scored twelve goals and conceded seven {{compared}} with <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South's ten goals scored and only three conceded. <b>Queen</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South kept a clean sheet {{in the first three}} rounds and were favourites to win the match being the higher ranked club as a competitor in the First Division, one tier above Brechin who were in the Second Division.
