40|$|Conditions {{have been}} {{established}} where the deactivation of the beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus PC 1 by the penicillin substrate, <b>quinacillin,</b> is close to complete but fully reversible. The temperature-dependence of the rate of re-activation indicated a half-life of about 170 min for the deactivated state at 0 degrees C. Measurement of the relative viscosity of mixtures of enzyme and <b>quinacillin</b> at 8. 4 degrees C ruled out any significant difference in shape or solvation between the deactivated and the normal enzyme. C. d. measurements of the deactivated protein, separated from excess <b>quinacillin,</b> showed that the <b>quinacillin</b> side-chain chromophore was bound in an asymmetric environment. The ellipticity associated with the bound <b>quinacillin</b> chromophore decreased with the same first-order rate constant as that for reappearance of enzyme activity. These findings support the accumulation of a deactivated state that contains bound <b>quinacillin</b> or a derivative. <b>Quinacillin</b> caused a 3 -fold increase {{in the rate of}} 3 H exchange-out (at a rate that was low compared with that for the substantially unfolded or expanded protein). However, there was rapid exchange-out of about 50 3 H atoms on addition of 1 M-urea to the deactivated enzyme, whereas the same concentration had no effect on the exchange-out of 3 H from native enzyme. The interpretation that <b>quinacillin</b> increases the susceptibility of the native state to unfolding in the presence of urea is supported by the demonstration that SO 4 (2) - ions decreased the rate and extent of deactivation but had no effect on the rate of re-activation, as predicted from the observation that SO 4 (2) - ions, in competition with urea, stabilize the native state relative to the partially unfolded state H [Mitchinson & Pain (1985) J. Mol. Biol. 184, 331 - 342]...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that when the Gram-positive {{micro-organisms}} Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were grown under conditions in which their cellular lipid was increased a corresponding increase in their resistance to the penicillins benzylpenicillin, cloxacillin, methicillin and <b>quinacillin</b> was produced. Likewise cell-wall lipid depletion caused a corresponding increase in sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|The Zn-contg. D-alanyl-D-alanine {{carboxypeptidase}} of Streptomyces albus G {{was slowly}} inactivated by 6 -aminopenicillanic acid (I), reversibly inhibited by 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid (II), and unaffected by mecillinam (III), cefoxitin (IV), <b>quinacillin,</b> <b>quinacillin</b> sulfone, clavulanic acid (V), and N-formimidoylthienamycin (VI). IV and VI, which are potent antibacterial agents, inactivated the serine D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase of Actinomadura R 39 (R 39 enzyme) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the corresponding serine enzyme of Streptomyces R 61 (R 61 enzyme). All of the other nonclassical Î²-lactams tested, including III, were slow inactivators of these serine enzymes. The intermediates formed between I and the R 61 and R 39 enzymes were long- and short-lived, resp., whereas those formed between II and the same R 61 and R 39 enzymes were short- and long-lived, resp. Breakdown of the short-lived intermediates thus obtained gave rise to several ninhydrin-pos. degrdn. products. The intermediates formed between V and the serine enzymes were long-lived. With the R 39 enzyme, the inactivated complex formed in a 1 st step underwent subsequent monomol. rearrangement to {{give rise to a}} 2 nd species exhibiting a high absorbance at 276 nm.

40|$|Streptomyces albus G secretes a Zn 2 +-containing D-alanyl-D-alanine peptidase. Streptomyces R 61 and Actinomadura R 39 secrete D-alanyl-D-alanine-cleaving serine peptidases. The {{effect of}} non-classical {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics on these three model enzymes has been studied. Mecillinam, cefoxitin, <b>quinacillin,</b> <b>quinacillin</b> sulphone, clavulanate and N-formimidoylthienamycin {{have no effect}} on the Zn 2 +-containing enzyme. 6 -Amino-penicillanic acid slowly inactivates this enzyme and 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid behaves as a reversible inhibitor. Cefoxitin and N-formimidoylthienamycin are potent anti-bacterial agents; they effectively inactivate the serine R 39 enzyme and, to a lesser extent, the serine R 61 enzyme. All the other beta-lactam compounds tested, including mecillinam, are slow inactivators of these serine enzymes. The intermediates formed between 6 -aminopenicillanic acid and the R 61 and R 39 enzymes are long- and short-lived respectively, whereas those formed between 7 -aminocephalosporanic acid and the same R 61 and R 39 enzymes are short- and long-lived respectively. Breakdown of the short-lived intermediates thus obtained gives rise to several ninhydrin-positive degradation products. The intermediates formed between clavulanate and the serine enzymes are long-lived. With the R 39 enzyme, the inactivated complex formed in a first step undergoes subsequent monomolecular rearrangement to give rise to a second species exhibiting a high absorbance at 273 nm.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of clavulanic acid, sulbactam, <b>quinacillin</b> sulfone, and the carbapenems MM 13902 and MM 4550 as inhibitors of TEM- 2 beta-lactamase in growing cultures of gram-negative bacteria has been studied. Each of these beta-lactams inhibited the enzyme in intact cells, {{and the nature}} of the inhibition correlated with studies on the purified enzyme. The potency of these compounds as inhibitors of the beta-lactamase in vivo can be correlated with the amounts hydrolyzed by the purified enzyme under saturating conditions during the inhibition of the enzyme in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity to {{ampicillin}} and cephalothin, {{the formation}} and induction of penicillinase and cephalosporinase, {{and the role of}} cephalosporinase in resistance to cephalothin were investigated in nine strains of Gram-negative bacteria. Naturally occurring strains resistant to cephalothin formed cephalosporinase, and ampicillin-resistant strains formed penicillin-ase. Cephalothin-resistant strains were all resistant to ampicillin, but the ampicillin-resistant strain of Proteus mirabiEis was sensitive to cephalothin and did not form cephalosporinase. Penicillinase and cephalosporinase activity were induced by benzylpenicillin in five strains of Gram-negative bacteria and cephalosporinase was also induced by cephalothin and 6 -amino-penicillanic acid in four of the inducible strains examined. Methicillin and <b>quinacillin</b> were variable in effect as inducers and cloxacillin partially inhibited cephalosporinase activity of two strains. Intrinsic resistance to cephalothin was high in four of five naturally occurring resistant strains...|$|E
