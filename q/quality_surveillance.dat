50|$|Despite {{its growing}} importance, {{the issue of}} water quality has long been nearly absent from water {{coverage}} assessments, since few countries could afford regular water <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Instead, {{it is assumed that}} certain types of water sources categorized as ‘improved’ are likely to deliver drinking water of adequate quality for basic health needs. This assumption appears over-optimistic, and improved technologies are shown not to be providing in all circumstances safe water. Similarly, health-related gains in water interventions are also dependent on service reliability; and it has been seen for example that annual health benefits attributed to the consumption of safe water are almost entirely lost if raw water is consumed over the course of few days. This draws attention to the issue of reliability and seasonality of drinking water sources.|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{networks}} can be {{used for}} event alarming applications. To date, in most of the proposed schemes, the raw or aggregated sensed data is periodically sent to a data consuming center. However, with this scheme, the occurrence of an emergency event such as a fire is hardly reported in a timely manner which is a strict requirement for event alarming applications. In sensor networks, it is also highly desired to conserve energy so that the network lifetime can be maximized. Furthermore, to ensure the <b>quality</b> of <b>surveillance,</b> some applications require that if an event occurs, it needs to be detected by at least k sensors where k is a user-defined parameter. In this work, we examine the Timely Energy-efficient k-Watching Event Detection problem (TEKWED). A topology-and-routing-supported algorithm is proposed which constructs a set of detection sets that satisfy the short notification time, energy conservation, and tunable <b>quality</b> of <b>surveillance</b> requirements for event alarming applications. Simulation results are shown to validate the proposed algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|Target {{tracking}} is {{an important}} application of wireless sensor networks. In this application, the sensor nodes collectively monitor and track the movement of an event or target object. The network operations have two states: the surveillance state during {{the absence of any}} event of interest, and the tracking state which is in response to any moving targets. Thus, the power saving operations, which is of critical importance for extending network lifetime, should be operative in two different modes as well. In this paper, we study the power saving operations in both states of network operations. During surveillance state, a set of novel metrics for <b>quality</b> of <b>surveillance</b> is proposed specifically for detecting moving objects. In the tracking state, we propose a collaborative messaging scheme that wakes up and shuts down the sensor nodes with spatial and temporal preciseness. This study, which is a combination of theoretical analysis and simulated evaluations, quantifies the trade-off between power conservation and <b>quality</b> of <b>surveillance</b> while presenting guidelines for efficient deployment of sensor nodes for target tracking application...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of {{brown coal briquette}} bundles in a completely automated production plant imposes strict quality requirements on the pressing of the briquettes. Thus the packaging of bundles which consist of several layers of briquettes requires that each layer has approximately the same length. As the pressing of briquettes with exactly predefined measurements can't be meastered technically, {{a part of the}} production must be picked out with a suitable <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance</b> procedure. The <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance</b> procedure that was used in production could mathematically be described exactly and was subject to an in depth analysis. It could be verified that besides the question for the optimal choice of single parameters, for that very special practical application it is essential that the performance of a <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance</b> procedure does not depend on the dynamic behaviour of the factors of production. The output of the factory could be increased considerably by eliminating these problems and optimizing the production plant. Besides the mathematical modeling this result was based on the optimization and simulation by a computer-based model. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we derive closed-form {{expressions}} {{to describe}} {{the relationship between the}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>quality</b> and system parameters under different real-time requirements and arbitrary sensing models, where the <b>surveillance</b> <b>quality</b> is represented by real-time intrusion detection probability and the system parameters are represented by duty cycle factors and node density. Various sensing models are adopted in the numerical simulations, including Boolean disk model, exponential model, power-law model, staircase model and anisotropic model, to validate the analytical closed-form results. It is shown that under all these sensing models adopted, the numerical results always closely matches the analytical ones, which soundly verifies the correctness of our derivation.

To this end, we define the <b>quality</b> of <b>surveillance</b> (QoSv) as the reciprocal value of the average detection time for vehicles.

40|$|This {{document}} represents Volume II of a 5 -volume {{quality assurance}} (QA) handbook series dedicated to air pollution measurement systems. Volume I provides general QA guidance that is {{pertinent to the}} remaining volumes. Volume II {{is dedicated to the}} Ambient Air <b>Quality</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Program and the data collection activities of that program. The intent of the document is twofold. The first is to provide additional information and guidance on the material covered in the Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Ambient Air <b>Quality</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Program. The second is to establish a set of consistent QA practices that will improve the quality of the nation's ambient air data and ensure data comparability among sites across the nation. Therefore, the document is written for technical personnel at State and local monitoring agencies and is intended to provide enough information to develop a quality system for ambient air quality monitoring. The information in this document was revised/developed by many of the organizations implementing the Ambient Air <b>Quality</b> <b>Surveillance</b> Program. Therefore, the guidance has been peer reviewed and accepted by these organizations and should serve to provide consistency among the organizations collecting and reporting ambient air data.

40|$|Digital {{spatial data}} {{are subject to}} {{temporal}} changes. The common approach to verify and update the data is to superimpose the data with up-to-date orthophotos and check the correctness interactively. This is a very time consuming and expensive process. We propose a method for the automatic <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance</b> of GIS data, in particular in respect to changes of settlement and industrial areas. These classes correspond to the classes defined for the German ATKIS R ○ geodata. In this paper the up-to-dateness of ATKIS is checked by use of a high resolution color aerial image of a scene near Hannover. The analysis uses the knowledge-based system GEOAIDA, which allows an intelligent, clearly structured, and flexible control of a scene interpretation by utilizing a semantic scene description. GEOAIDA is extended to use a state transition graph that models possible expected temporal transitions in the scene. The system produces a hierarchic, pictorial description of the results while the structural context of the identified objects including the associated attributes is preserved in a graph. The results of a <b>quality</b> <b>surveillance</b> procedure in the examined GIS data are illustrated. ...|$|E
